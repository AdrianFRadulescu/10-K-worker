ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
     U.S. Home Corporation ("U.S. Home" or the "Company"), organized in 1954 and
incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1959, is one of the largest
single-family home builders in the United States based on homes delivered. The
Company currently builds and sells homes in more than 190 new home communities
in 31 metropolitan areas in 12 states. Since its formation, the Company has
delivered more than 252,000 homes. The Company conducts substantially all of its
home building business through U.S. Home, the parent company.
 
     The Company offers a wide variety of moderately-priced homes that are
designed to appeal to the affordable, move-up and retirement and
active-adult/second home buyers. In each of its markets, the Company's primary
strategy is to build quality homes, utilizing its Zero Defect Program, which the
Company believes offers prospective home buyers a high level of new home value.
The Company believes that many home purchasers compare homes on the basis of
location, perceived quality and dollars of purchase price per square foot of
living area. As a result, the Company attempts to purchase land and lots in
popular growth corridors, maintain high quality standards and design homes to
maximize living space.
 
     In addition to building and selling single-family homes, the Company
provides mortgage banking services to its customers. The Company originates,
processes and sells mortgages to third-party investors. The Company does not
retain or service the mortgages that it originates but, rather, sells the
mortgages and related servicing rights to investors.
 
OPERATIONS
 
     The Company is engaged in two related industry segments: home building and
financial services. The revenues, operating profits or losses and identifiable
assets attributable to the Company's industry segments are separately disclosed
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
                            HOME BUILDING OPERATIONS
 
     The Company's primary industry segment is the on-site development of
single-family residential communities. Currently, the Company builds in 31
metropolitan areas in 12 states. During 1994, the Company's product mix
consisted of deliveries of approximately 34% affordable homes, 47% move-up homes
and 19% retirement and active-adult/second homes. U.S. Home continues to pay
increasing attention to the active adult who is in the market for a second home
or is nearing retirement. The Company has set a goal to increase its retirement
and active-adult/second home deliveries to approximately 30% of the Company's
volume. However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.
The Company presently has retirement and active-adult/second home communities in
Texas, Maryland, New Jersey, Nevada and Florida, with expansion plans for
California and Arizona where two retirement communities are expected to open in
the latter part of 1995.
 
     During 1994, the Company entered new markets in the Midwest by acquiring or
optioning property in Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio and Indianapolis, Indiana. By
the third quarter of 1995, the Company expects to open 10 new communities in
these Midwest markets.

(1) Homes under contract for sale but not delivered at end of year.
 
     The Company anticipates that substantially all of its backlog units, net of
cancellations, as of December 31, 1994 will be completed and delivered during
1995. While operations in certain market areas are affected by seasonal factors
which limit on-site building and sales activities, the Company's ability to
build and deliver its backlog is not considered to be seriously affected by such
factors.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
     The Company employs sales consultants for the sale of single-family homes,
although sales by independent real estate brokers are also encouraged. Specific
sales training programs are provided which inform sales consultants about sales
techniques and methods as well as information about their local market, realtors
and products. The sales programs focus on the Company's Zero Defect Program as a
marketing tool because the sales force is the first contact with the customer.
The Zero Defect Program is a quality assurance program with major emphasis on
construction (see Construction below).
 
     The Company advertises primarily in magazines and local newspapers.
Additionally, homes are marketed by means of model homes, pictorial brochures
and on-site displays. The Company's general marketing strategy seeks to generate
one-third of housing sales through advertisements, one-third through customer
referrals and one-third through realtor contacts.
 
     The Company markets homes in "model home parks" featuring one or more model
homes, attractively furnished and decorated and staffed by the Company's sales
consultants who provide information regarding floor plans, the various
elevations available, decorating options, as well as assisting with mortgage
financing information. The model may include a variety of options and upgrades
which the customer may request at an additional cost. Such upgrades may include
items such as pools, fireplaces and decks. The Company constantly studies both
aesthetic design and architectural trends, as well as quality construction and
engineering trends, in order to provide customers with high quality, design and
value. The Company has received numerous awards in various markets for
outstanding housing design.
 
     Selling prices are set in each area based on local market conditions and
competitive factors. The Company's gross margins vary from area to area based on
competitive factors in each market.

     The Company's product lines include both single-family detached and
attached homes. During 1994, 1993 and 1992, approximately 85% of the homes
delivered were single-family detached. The number of units and average sales
prices of single-family homes delivered in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were as follows:

     The increases in the average sales prices of single-family detached homes
in 1994 and 1993 were primarily due to price increases. The increase in the
average sales prices of single-family attached homes in 1994 was primarily due
to an increase in deliveries in higher priced markets while the decrease in the
average sales prices of single-family attached homes in 1993 was primarily due
to an increase in the deliveries in lower priced markets.
 
     In 1994, the national average sales prices of new single-family homes (both
detached and attached) as reported on a preliminary basis by the U.S. Census
Bureau was $154,100 compared with an average sales price of $151,000 for the
Company.
 
     Variations in the general product and customer mix may exist from year to
year based on shifts in local market demand or product availability. The table
below sets forth the mix of the Company's deliveries for the affordable, move-up
and retirement and active-adult/second home products during the last three
years:

     Many purchasers finance a large portion of the purchase price of a home
through conventional or government insured/guaranteed mortgages from lending
institutions. The Company generally assists purchasers in obtaining mortgages.
Approximately 85% of the homes delivered in 1994 and 86% delivered in 1993 and
in 1992, were purchased using mortgage financing.
 
     The Company takes steps to qualify certain of its homes under Veterans
Administration ("VA") and Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") mortgage
financing programs, which provide mortgage financing sources. During 1994, 1993
and 1992, approximately 19%, 25% and 25% of the Company's homes delivered were
financed under VA and FHA mortgage programs.
 
CONSTRUCTION
 
     The Company's investment in direct employee labor costs, equipment and
facilities is kept to a minimum because all construction of single-family homes
is performed by independent subcontractors. At all stages of construction,
however, on-site Company managers supervise and coordinate the activities of
these subcontractors and subject their work to quality and cost control
standards. The Company's Director of National Purchasing and Quality Control
provides centralized management of quality standards, both with respect to the
construction of homes and the purchase of certain major components used in the
construction of homes. Company employees are rated and compensation incentives
are affected by a measure of quality standards. The Company's commitment to
quality and its use in the Company's sales efforts are best illustrated by its
Zero Defect Program. Under the Zero Defect Program, the home buyer meets with
the construction supervisor prior to the commencement of, and during,
construction in order to ensure that the home buyer (i) is aware of all quality
features of the house, including those which are not readily apparent in the
finished house, (ii) agrees that the design features, including appliances,
match those ordered and (iii) is satisfied with the finished product. The
Company considers a completed house to have "zero defects" if, upon final
inspection by the home buyer, only a few minor cosmetic items remain to be
corrected.
 
                                        6
<PAGE>   7
 
     Construction subcontractors are selected on the basis of competitive bids
and written agreements govern their relationship with the Company. All bids are
based on detailed specifications and complete blueprints to ensure commitment to
the Company's expectation for high quality workmanship.
 
     The Company purchases the majority of its construction material on a
decentralized basis with a "just in time" delivery schedule to each individual
job site. Materials are regularly purchased on a competitive bid basis to ensure
both competitive pricing and high quality. In addition to local purchasing, the
Company has entered into a number of national purchasing agreements in order to
maximize purchasing power. Agreements with each vendor are negotiated on an
annual basis by the Company's Director of National Purchasing and Quality
Control.
 
     In order to minimize the risk associated with completed but unsold
inventory, the Company generally does not commence construction of a
single-family detached home prior to receipt of an executed purchase contract, a
deposit from the customer and preliminary mortgage approval based on the
purchaser's mortgage application. For single-family attached homes, construction
does not generally commence until 50% of the units in a building have been sold.
 
REGULATION
 
     The Company and its subcontractors must comply with various federal, state
and local zoning, building, pollution, environmental, advertising and consumer
credit statutes, rules and regulations, as well as other activities, including
regulations relating to specific building materials to be used, building design
and minimum elevations of properties. All of these regulations have increased
the time and cost required to market the Company's products by extending the
time between the initial acquisition of land and the commencement of
construction. The Company's operations, like those of other home builders, have
been periodically subject to moratoriums on development activities caused by
insufficient water, sewage and energy-related facilities. Moratoriums in local
areas have not had a material adverse effect on its overall activities because
of the geographic diversification of the Company's operations.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The single-family residential housing industry is highly competitive. U.S.
Home competes in each of its markets, with respect to the location, design and
price of its products, with numerous firms engaged in the on-site development of
single-family residential housing, ranging from regional and national firms to
small local companies. The Company is one of the largest on-site builders of
single-family homes in the United States, ranking among the ten largest
single-family on-site home builders in the United States for each of the last 20
years. However, because there are so many firms engaged in the single-family
home building industry, the Company accounts for less than 1% of all new on-site
single-family housing sales in the United States.
 
RAW MATERIALS AND SUBCONTRACTORS
 
     The Company uses numerous suppliers of raw materials and services in its
business and such materials and services have been and continue to be available.
Where appropriate, the Company has adopted national programs for products to
maximize price discounts through volume purchases. The Company also utilizes
numerous independent subcontractors representing all building trades in
connection with the construction of its homes.
 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
 
     A significant portion of the Company's land and lot needs are currently
satisfied through rolling lot options, which enable the Company to initially pay
a small fraction of total lot cost and then purchase the lots on a scheduled or
on an "as needed" basis. For example, during 1994, 56% of the Company's unit
deliveries were from lots owned by the Company and 44% were from lots acquired
by the exercise of rolling lot options.
 
     The Company's policy is that land cannot be purchased or sold without prior
approval of the Company's Asset Management Committee. Asset Management Committee
approval requires submission of data relating
 
                                        7
<PAGE>   8
 
to sales forecasts, a timing schedule (e.g., estimated dates on start of land
development, housing construction, model opening and sales) and a projection of
income and internal rate of return. All development expenditures are reviewed by
the respective President of Operations prior to the commencement of development.
In addition, the Company's amended and restated by-laws require approval by the
Company's Board of Directors of any acquisition of unimproved real property or
acreage by the Company in any single transaction or series of related
transactions involving an expenditure in excess of $5 million and any other
capital expenditures and other commitments by the Company in excess of $5
million per transaction (excluding transactions involving housing).
 
     The Presidents of Operations and the Division Presidents are responsible
for maintaining continuity of housing sales through awareness of trends in
housing demand in each market area. Feasibility studies and market research
studies are generally required before approval of the purchase of land. These
studies examine the demographics of an area including population trends, income
trends, employment trends, housing stock and housing demand. Products are
matched to customer profile, determined in part by the market studies and the
experience of the local manager in each market.
 
     Housing communities are generally built in or near major metropolitan areas
and are normally located in growing markets for such areas. At December 31,
1994, the Company's land and finished lot inventories totaled $304.0 million,
excluding option deposits. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Substantially all are zoned for their intended use and serviced by
utilities. As of December 31, 1994, the Company had deposits totaling $53.6
million for options to purchase undeveloped land and finished lots for home
building operations for a total purchase price on exercise of approximately
$327.7 million.
 
     The following table sets forth as of December 31, 1994, by market, the cost
of certain of the Company's land inventories and the estimated number of lots
controlled through direct ownership and under option which are being used or
that will be used in the Company's home building operations (dollars in
thousands):

(1) Based upon current management estimates, which are subject to change. This
    table does not include commercial property and other properties which the
    Company has no current plans to use, with an aggregate cost of $32.4 million
    (including $13.3 million relating to land under contract for sale and for
    exchange). In view of the various stages of development of the land owned by
    the Company as of December 31, 1994 (i.e., finished, under development and
    development not started), any per lot cost derived by dividing the book cost
    by the estimated number of units would not be meaningful.

     In 1994, revenues from the sale of developed and undeveloped land by the
Company amounted to $16.2 million, as compared to revenues of $8.5 million in
1993 and $6.6 million in 1992. In addition, the Company, in 1993 and 1992,
completed several exchanges of land assets with third parties in which the
Company received land suitable for development of single-family detached homes,
which could be more readily developed and sold, in return for land zoned
primarily for commercial use and single-family attached homes which the Company
had no near-term plans to utilize.
 
REORGANIZATION
 
     The Company and certain of its affiliates commenced proceedings (the
"Cases") under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code on April 15,
1991 (the "Filing Date"), in order to restructure their indebtedness and other
liabilities. On May 25, 1993, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court") entered an order
confirming the first amended consolidated plan of reorganization of the Company
and certain of its affiliates (as modified, the "Plan"). Such order became final
on June 5, 1993, and the Plan became effective on June 21, 1993 (the "Effective
Date"). On the Effective Date, the Company also completed a public offering of
$200 million principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2003, the net proceeds
from which were utilized to pay a portion of the claims of certain unsecured
creditors of the Company under the Plan and to repay outstanding amounts under
the Company's debtor-in-possession financing facility.
 
     The Plan effected a recapitalization of the Company and did not result in a
reduction in the scope or other major restructuring of the Company's operations.
During the pendency of the Cases, the Company continued its home building
operations in the ordinary course in its housing markets and improved its market
share in a majority of such markets. The Company was able to retain its senior
management and believes that it maintained customer, subcontractor and supplier
goodwill and the confidence of its employees.
 
     As part of the Plan, creditors received 4,873,650 shares of common stock,
$.01 par value per share, and 2,816,762 shares of convertible redeemable
preferred stock, $.10 par value per share, and the pre-Effective Date
stockholders received 3,510,818 shares of common stock and Class B warrants to
acquire common stock (exercisable at $20 per share), which, if fully exercised,
would result in an additional 1,904,757 shares of common stock (a total of
5,415,575 shares). As of December 31, 1994, 2,297,867 shares of convertible
redeemable preferred stock had been converted into an equal number of shares of
common stock and 3,321 Class B warrants had been exercised. See Notes 5 and 6 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
                         FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS
 
     The Company's second industry segment consists primarily of its mortgage
banking activities. U.S. Home Mortgage Corporation ("Mortgage"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, commenced operations in 1971 and serves an important
role in the Company's sale of its homes by arranging financing for customers.
 
     Mortgage is a Federal National Mortgage Association/Government National
Mortgage Association/ Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation approved
seller-servicer, headquartered in Clearwater, Florida with branch offices in the
metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Sacramento, California;
Denver, Colorado; Washington, D.C.; Clearwater, Fort Myers and Orlando, Florida;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Dallas, Texas. The Company offers
a wide variety of conventional, FHA and VA financing programs through Mortgage,
thereby providing prospective buyers the benefits of both conventional and
government assisted loan programs. As a mortgage banker, Mortgage originates and
funds mortgage loans and sells the loans and the related servicing rights
directly to investors. Loans and servicing rights are generally sold by Mortgage
and funded by the investors within 30 days after home delivery. To limit its
risk of interest rate fluctuations, Mortgage regularly enters into fixed price
mandatory forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities to
securities dealers or fixed price forward delivery commitments to sell specific
whole loans to investors on a mandatory or best efforts basis. Mortgage has a
secured revolving line of credit to fund the mortgage loans on an interim basis
until purchased by investors.

     While the Company continues to focus its attention primarily upon the
expansion of Mortgage's operations within the Company's own customer base,
Mortgage also offers its services to realtors, unaffiliated builders and
refinance customers.
 
     Among the factors affecting Mortgage's operations are general economic
conditions, federal, state and local regulatory constraints, consumer confidence
and interest rate volatility. These factors, together with the number of homes
delivered by the Company, affect the volume of loan originations which in turn
impact the resulting volume of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights
available for sale.
 
                             ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 
FINANCING OF HOUSING OPERATIONS
 
     The Company finances its housing operations through internally generated
funds, unsecured public debt and a $95 million secured working capital credit
facility and certain other secured acquisition and development financing
facilities. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
FINANCING OF FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS
 
     The Company finances its financial services operations primarily through
internally generated funds (i.e., origination and sale of residential mortgage
loans and related servicing rights) and short-term debt. The short-term debt
consists of a $25 million secured revolving line of credit. See Note 2 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. This debt is not guaranteed by the Company
nor does the Company have any obligation to provide funding to its financial
services operations.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     At December 31, 1994, the Company had 1,353 employees, of whom 1,220 were
employed in home building operations and 133 were employed in financial services
operations. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union. The
Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company's
single-family housing and community development operations are conducted
primarily through independent subcontractors, thereby limiting the number of
direct employees required.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
     The Company leases its executive offices, located at 1800 West Loop South,
Houston, Texas 77027, pursuant to a lease scheduled to expire on February 28,
1999. The Company does not believe that its executive
 
                                       10
<PAGE>   11
 
offices or its other facilities, consisting of sales and administrative offices
located in or near each of the Company's areas of operations and generally held
under leases with terms not exceeding five years, are material to its
operations.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of
business, none of which, in the opinion of the Company, will have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
     None.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
        MATTERS
 
     As of February 10, 1995, there were 7,115 holders of record of the
Company's common stock, $.01 par value per share. The principal market on which
the common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange.
 
     The following tables set forth the high and low sale prices of the
Company's common stock, $.10 par value per share, outstanding prior to the
effectiveness of the Plan and the common stock (issued pursuant to the Plan) for
the periods indicated as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape.
The Company believes that the stock price information through June 21, 1993 is
of limited use and relevance in the view of the significant changes in ownership
of the Company's capital stock and the Company's capital structure which
occurred under the Plan.

</TABLE>
 
     Immediately prior to the Effective Date, the Company had 45,312,526 shares
of common stock, $.10 par value per share, outstanding. Pursuant to the Plan,
all pre-Effective Date capital stock was canceled and common stock, $.01 par
value per share, and other securities were issued.
 
     No dividends were paid by the Company during 1994 or 1993. The Company's
working capital facility (the most restrictive of the Company's borrowing
agreements) prohibits the Company from paying dividends on its capital stock.
The senior note indenture and the Company's second restated certificate of
incorporation also contain restrictions on the payment of dividends.

(1) Income (loss) per common and common equivalent share has been computed using
    the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares
    outstanding, assuming the new capital structure had been effective as of the
    beginning of all periods presented. This differs from historical primary and
    fully diluted income (loss) per common and common equivalent share
    previously reported (based on the Company's former capital structure) for
    the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990 of $(.47), $(.20), and
    $(2.27), respectively. The Company believes that earnings per common share
    information for 1992, 1991, and 1990 is of limited use and relevance in view
    of the significant changes in ownership of the Company's capital stock and
    the Company's capital structure which occurred in 1993 under the Plan.

(2) Primary and fully diluted income per share in 1993 were $2.29 per share and
    $2.21 per share, respectively, excluding $3.87 primary income per share and
    $3.72 fully diluted income per share, respectively, due to the decrease in
    the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. See Note 4 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
(3) Includes unsecured debt of $266,635,000 at December 31, 1992 which was
    exchanged for a combination of cash and equity securities, and secured debt
    of $5,213,000 at December 31, 1992 which was either reinstated or the
    property securing the debt was deeded to the lenders in full satisfaction of
    the debt.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 1993

Plan and do not include certain interest charges on the Company's unsecured debt
which was stayed during the pendency of the Cases.

REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN
 
     Revenues from sales of single-family homes for 1994 increased 22% from
1993. The increase resulted from a 14% increase in the number of housing units
delivered and a 7% increase in the average sales price. Revenues from sales of
single-family homes for 1993 increased 18% from 1992, resulting primarily from a
13% increase in the number of housing units delivered and a 4% increase in the
average sales price.
 
     The increase in units delivered in 1994 was primarily attributable to an
improved backlog level at December 31, 1993 when compared to the backlog level
at December 31, 1992. The increase in units delivered in 1993 was primarily
attributed to a continuation of generally improved industry conditions, as well
as increases in the Company's market share in many of its housing markets. The
increases in the average sales prices in 1994 and 1993 were primarily due to
price increases.
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   15
 
     The gross margin percentage was essentially unchanged over the three year
period as the Company was able to increase sales prices in the three year period
to offset cost increases.
 
     New orders taken in 1994 decreased 3% from 1993. The decline in new orders
in 1994 occurred in the second half of the year and was attributable to the
increases in mortgage interest rates caused by Federal Reserve actions in the
last three quarters of 1994. New orders taken in 1993 increased 24% from 1992
attributable primarily to a continuation of generally improved industry
conditions.
 
     If mortgage interest rates in 1995 continue at the present level or
increase, new orders in 1995 from the Company's current communities may be less
than new orders in 1994.
 
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
 
     As a percentage of housing revenues, selling, general and administrative
expenses were 11% in both 1994 and 1993 as compared to 12% in 1992. Actual
selling, general and administrative expense for 1994 increased $19.5 million
compared to 1993. This increase was attributable to increases in volume-related
expenses ($6.5 million) resulting from the increase in deliveries in 1994 when
compared to 1993 and increases in other selling, general and administrative
expenses resulting from increased activities and earnings. Similarly, selling,
general and administrative expenses increased by $6.7 million in 1993 compared
to 1992, due to increases in volume-related expenses ($4.4 million) resulting
from increases in deliveries in 1993 when compared to 1992 and increases in
other selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from increased
activities and earnings.
 
INTEREST EXPENSE
 
     Interest paid and accrued for 1994 increased approximately 39% compared to
1993 and increased approximately 53% in 1993 compared to 1992. The increase in
1994 over 1993 was primarily due to interest on a majority of the Company's debt
in the first six months of 1993 being stayed during the pendency of the Cases,
while the increase in 1993 over 1992 was primarily due to the sale of the 9.75%
senior notes in June 1993 and the 4.875% convertible subordinated debentures in
November 1993. The increase in the percentage of interest capitalized for 1993
over 1992 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of assets qualifying
for interest capitalization.
 
REORGANIZATION ITEMS, NET
 
     Reorganization items in 1993 and 1992 represent expenses (primarily
professional and other fees) incurred by the Company resulting from the Cases
and are specific to the reorganization process. Pursuant to the Plan, the
Company issued 140,000 shares of common stock on June 21, 1993 to corporate
officers and certain other key employees for services rendered in connection
with the reorganization of the Company. The Company has reflected the issuance
as an increase in stockholders' equity and an offsetting charge to earnings of
$2.9 million based upon the market price of the common stock on June 21, 1993.
 
     In connection with implementing the Plan, the Company recorded a $42.4
million provision in the fourth quarter of 1992 to reflect the impact of the
Plan on land utilization and its estimated net realizable value which amount has
been included in "Reorganization Items" in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

     Mortgage provides financing primarily to purchasers of homes sold by the
Company's housing operations through origination of residential mortgage loans
and engages in the sale of such mortgages and related servicing rights to
unaffiliated investors. Mortgage's operations are affected, among other things,
by general economic conditions, consumer confidence and interest rate
volatility. These factors, together with the number of homes delivered by the
Company, affect the volume of loan originations which in turn impact the
resulting volume of mortgages and servicing rights for sale.
 
     The decrease in Mortgage's revenues for 1994 from 1993 was primarily due to
decreased marketing income as a result of increased pricing competition and
volatility in the secondary mortgage markets. The increase in Mortgage's
revenues for 1993 from 1992 was primarily due to an increase in the number of
residential mortgage loan originations. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in the number of Company homes deliveries financed by Mortgage.
 
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE
 
     General and administrative expenses in 1994 increased $1.9 million from
1993 which had increased $.5 million from 1992. The increase in 1994 was due in
part to nonrecurring transactions which reduced general and administrative
expenses in 1993 by approximately $1.0 million. The balance of the increase in
1994 was primarily due to Mortgage opening additional branch and satellite
offices in the last half of 1993 and early 1994. The increase in 1993, which was
offset in part by the nonrecurring transactions referred to above, was due to
the opening of additional Mortgage offices in the last half of 1993 and an
increase in Mortgage's staffing as a result of increased volume of activities.
 
INTEREST EXPENSE
 
     Interest expense in 1994 decreased approximately 58% from 1993 which was
approximately the same as 1992. The decrease in 1994 was due to a decrease in
the average short-term borrowings.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
 
                                    HOUSING
 
     The Company's most significant needs for capital resources are land and
finished lot purchases, land development and housing construction. The Company's
ability to generate cash adequate to meet these needs is principally achieved
from the sale of homes and the margins thereon, the utilization of Company-owned
lots and periodic borrowings under its financing facilities. The Company
expects, on a long-term basis, that operations will generate cash to meet
substantially all of its housing cash flow needs and that a financing facility,
such as the $95 million secured revolving working capital facility (the "Working
Capital Facility") with General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC"), would be
utilized to meet peak operating needs. The Company does not anticipate that the
borrowing base requirements of the Working Capital Facility will restrict the
Company's ability to borrow under such Facility. See Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company employs various operational
guidelines to reduce initial cash requirements with respect to investments in
land, thereby increasing its financial flexibility and reducing its risk by
limiting the amount invested in land owned directly by the Company. The Company
intends to continue, where possible,
 
                                       16
<PAGE>   17
 
to use Company-owned lots in inventory to generate additional cash flow and to
continue to emphasize land acquisitions using rolling lot options, which enable
the Company to initially pay a small fraction of total lot cost and then
purchase the lots for a fixed price on a scheduled or "as needed" basis. The
Company believes that these steps result in reduced carrying costs and limited
exposure to market changes and direct land investments. The increase in the land
inventories in 1994 from 1993 was primarily the result of increased activities,
including expansion of the retirement and active-adult/second home communities
which will continue into 1995.
 
     The net cash provided or used by the operating, investing and financing
activities of the housing operations for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
and 1992 is summarized below (dollars in thousands):

</TABLE>
 
     Housing operations are, at any time, affected by a number of factors,
including the number of housing units under construction and housing units
delivered. Housing operating activities used less cash in 1994 than in 1993
primarily due to an increase in the number of housing units delivered offset in
part by an increase in construction and land asset activities. Housing operating
activities used cash during 1993 compared to providing cash in 1992 primarily
due to an increase in the number of housing units under construction, land and
finished lot option deposit payments and reorganization expense payments, offset
in part by an increase in the number of housing units delivered.
 
     Cash flow from housing financing activities for 1994 was used for the
repayment of notes and mortgages payable, offset by net borrowings under the
Working Capital Facility. Cash flow from housing financing activities for 1993
was provided by the net proceeds from the sale of the Company's 9.75% senior
notes and 4.875% convertible subordinated debentures, offset by the payment of
reorganization debt and liabilities and the repayment of the postpetition credit
facility with GECC. Cash flow from housing financing activities for 1992 was
used for the repayment of reorganization secured debt and certain outstanding
amounts under the postpetition credit facility with GECC.
 
     The Company anticipates that cash flow from operations and amounts
available under the Working Capital Facility will be sufficient to meet its
working capital obligations.
 
                               FINANCIAL SERVICES
 
     Mortgage's activities represent a substantial portion of the financial
services segment's activities. As loan originations by Mortgage are primarily
from homes sold by the Company's home building operations, Mortgage's financial
condition and liquidity are to a significant extent dependent upon the financial
condition of the Company.
 
     The Company finances its financial services operations primarily from
internally generated funds, such as the origination and sale of residential
mortgage loans and related servicing rights, and short-term debt. As more fully
discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
short-term debt consists of a $25 million secured revolving line of credit
entered into by Mortgage in April 1992, as amended (the "Mortgage Credit
Facility"). At December 31, 1994, $10.0 million was outstanding under the
Mortgage Credit Facility. The Company has no obligation to provide funding to
its financial services operations, nor does it guarantee any of its financial
services subsidiaries' debt. The Company believes that internally generated
funds and the Mortgage Credit Facility will be sufficient to provide for
Mortgage's working capital needs.
 
                                       17
<PAGE>   18
 
     The Mortgage Credit Facility bears interest at the greater of a premium
over the London Interbank Offered Rate or a premium over a composite rate for
dealer-placed 30-day commercial paper and matures on August 31, 1995. Certain
residential mortgage loans have been pledged as collateral to secure Mortgage's
obligations under the Mortgage Credit Facility. While the Mortgage Credit
Facility contains numerous covenants, including a debt to tangible net worth
ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement, these covenants are not
anticipated to significantly limit Mortgage's operations.
 
OTHER
 
  Impact of Inflation
 
     Inflation not only affects interest rates on funds borrowed by the Company,
but also affects the affordability of permanent mortgage financing available to
prospective customers. Increased construction costs associated with rising
interest rates, as well as increased material costs, compress gross margins in
the short-term, but may be recovered in the long-term through increases in sales
prices, although such increases may reduce sales volume. In recent years,
inflation has not had a significant adverse effect on the Company.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors of U.S. Home Corporation:
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Home
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994
and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of U.S. Home
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results
of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
GENERAL
 
  Nature of Operations
 
     The Company is one of the largest single-family home builders in the United
States based on homes delivered. The Company currently builds and sells homes in
more than 190 new home communities in 31 metropolitan areas in 12 states. The
Company offers a wide variety of moderately-priced homes that are designed to
appeal to the affordable, move-up and retirement and active-adult/second home
buyers. In addition to building and selling single-family homes, the Company
provides mortgage banking services to its customers. The Company originates,
processes and sells mortgages to third-party investors. The Company does not
retain or service the mortgages that it originates but, rather, sells the
mortgages and related servicing rights to investors.
 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all
significant intercompany balances and transactions. The financial statements for
1993 and 1992 have been conformed to the format used in 1994.
 
     The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
     The Company is engaged in two related industry segments, the on-site
development of single-family residential communities and financial services.
Identifiable assets and the results of operations of the Company's segments are
reported in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
operations. Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expense for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were insignificant.
 
  Income (Loss) Per Share
 
     Primary income (loss) per common and common equivalent share has been
computed using the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding, assuming the new capital structure (see Note 6) had been
effective as of the beginning of all periods presented. This differs from
historical loss per common and common equivalent share for 1992 of $.47,
previously reported (based on the Company's former capital structure and
45,312,508 shares of common stock, $.10 par value per share, outstanding at
December 31, 1992). In management's opinion, per share information prior to the
Company's emergence from Chapter 11 is of limited use or relevance given the
significant changes in ownership and the Company's capital structure which
occurred as a result of the Company's reorganization pursuant to the Plan (see
Note 5).
 
     The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares
outstanding for primary income per share include the dilutive effect of the
convertible redeemable preferred stock and Class B warrants and the assumed
exercise of stock options for periods subsequent to June 21, 1993 (based on the
average stock price for the periods). No effect was given to the shares that
would be issuable on exercise of the warrants and stock options in 1994, since
they would be antidilutive or immaterial. Fully diluted income per share
includes the assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures in
1994 and 1993 and the dilutive effect of the Class B warrants and stock options
(based on the higher year-end stock price) in 1993.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
The following weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares
were used to compute income (loss) per share:

</TABLE>
 
  Cash Equivalents
 
     The Company considers all short-term investments with an initial maturity
of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents.
 
  Financial Instruments
 
     The Company believes that fair value approximates recorded values for such
financial instruments as cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and
payables, short-term debt and option deposits because of the typically liquid,
short-term nature, market rate terms and lack of specific concentration of these
instruments.
 
     The Company's senior notes and convertible subordinated debentures are
fixed rate instruments with yields which are currently below the prevailing
rates. These instruments trade at a discount; however, the actual amount of the
discount or the fair value of the instruments can not be determined as neither
of these instruments are actively traded on the open market. The Company does
not presently intend to repurchase any of these instruments prior to maturity.
In addition, the Working Capital Facility (see Note 2) prohibits the Company
from repurchasing any of these instruments.
 
     The fair value of the Company's residential mortgage loans approximate
their carrying value as such loans are packaged and sold to investors generally
within 30 days after home delivery. Additionally, a significant portion of the
Company's interest rate risk associated with and generated by these loans is
mitigated by the use of forward delivery contracts and commitments. See Hedging
Contracts below.
 
HOUSING
 
  Sales and Profit Recognition
 
     Profit is recognized from the sale of real estate at time of closing, i.e.,
when sufficient down payment has been made; any financing has been arranged;
title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the
buyer; and the Company is not obligated to perform additional significant
activities after the sale.
 
  Inventories and Valuation
 
     The components of single-family housing inventories are as follows (dollars
in thousands):

net realizable value. Net realizable value differs from market value in that,
among other things, market value assumes a cash sale under current market
conditions, considers a potential purchaser's requirement for future profit and
discounts the timing of estimated future cash receipts, whereas net realizable
value is the price obtainable in the future based on the current intended use of
the land, net of disposal and holding costs, without provision for future
profits or discounting future cash flow to present value. Housing inventories
are recorded using the specific identification method at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Excluding the $42,368,000 provision recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1992 (see Note 5), provisions to reduce land and housing inventories
to the lower of cost or net realizable value for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were not
significant. Total land and housing reserves were $35,417,000, $48,362,000 and
$59,777,000 at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
     During 1993 and 1992, the Company completed several exchanges of land
assets with third parties totaling approximately $5,697,000 and $22,300,000,
respectively, in which the Company received land suitable for single-family
detached homes, which can be more readily developed and sold, in return for land
zoned primarily for commercial use and single-family attached homes for which
the Company had no near-term plans to utilize. The exchanges are treated as
non-cash transactions for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flow.
 
  Capitalization Period
 
     Interest is capitalized on land, finished building lots and single-family
residential housing construction costs during the development and construction
period. Interest is capitalized to eligible assets using an allocation method
based on the Company's actual interest costs. A summary of interest for 1994,
1993 and 1992 follows:

     Under Chapter 11 ("Chapter 11") of title 11 of the United States Code,
interest on the Company's unsecured debt was stayed, while the Company was in
reorganization (April 1991 to June 1993). Had the accrual of interest not been
stayed, paid and accrued interest for 1993 and 1992 would have been increased by
approximately $12,000,000 and $26,400,000, respectively, and interest expense
for 1993 and 1992 would have been increased by approximately $1,300,000 and

  Revenue Recognition
 
     The sale of loans and loan servicing rights is recognized when the closed
loans are sold and delivered to an investor. During the years ended December 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992, revenues included net gains (losses) from the sale of loans
of $(831,000), $(262,000) and $(655,000), respectively, and net gains from the
sale of servicing of $4,212,000, $3,829,000 and $3,189,000 respectively.
 
  Residential Mortgage Loans
 
     Residential mortgage loans held for sale ($16,235,000 at December 31, 1994)
are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the lower of
cost or market on an aggregate basis. The Company estimates the fair value of
residential mortgage loans held at December 31, 1994 approximated recorded value
based on quoted market prices (at December 31, 1994) for similar loans sold
either on a whole loan basis or pooled and sold as collateral for
mortgage-backed securities.
 
  Hedging Contracts
 
     The Company manages its interest rate market risk on the inventory loans
held for sale and its estimated future commitments to originate and close
mortgage loans at fixed prices ("Loan Quotes") through hedging techniques by
regularly entering into either fixed price mandatory forward delivery contracts
("Forward Contracts") to sell mortgage-backed securities to security dealers or
fixed price forward delivery commitments ("Forward Commitments") to sell
specific whole loans to investors on a mandatory or best efforts basis ("Forward
Contracts" and "Forward Commitments" collectively "Hedging Contracts"). The
Company records the inventory of residential mortgage loans at the lower of cost
or market on an aggregate basis after considering any market value changes in
the inventory loans, Loan Quotes and Hedging Contracts. See Note 9.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Housing notes and mortgage notes payable are primarily for the acquisition
and development of land, with interest rates ranging from 6.0% to 10.25%. Assets
pledged as collateral under these agreements totaled approximately $71,000,000
at December 31, 1994.
 
     In June 1993, the Company completed the sale of its 9.75% senior notes due
June 15, 2003. Interest is payable semi-annually. On or after June 15, 1998, the
senior notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part,
at prices ranging from 103.656% (during the 12 month period ending June 14,
1999) to 100% (on and after June 15, 2001) of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture relating to the senior
notes contains numerous covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth
requirement and a limitation on the incurring of additional debt.
 
     In November 1993, the Company completed the sale of its 4.875% convertible
subordinated debentures due November 1, 2005. Interest is payable semi-annually.
The debentures are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into
common stock at a conversion price of $35.50 per share, subject to adjustment
under certain conditions. On or after November 1, 1996, the debentures may be
redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at prices ranging
from 103.25% (during the 12 month period ending October 31, 1997) to 100% (on or
after November 1, 2004) of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest.
 
     Upon a change of control of the Company, holders of the senior notes and
the debentures will have the right to require the Company to redeem the senior
notes and debentures at a price of 101% of the principal amount of the senior
notes and 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, together with accrued
and unpaid interest. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available to make the required repurchases if a change of control occurs. In
addition, the Working Capital Facility prohibits the Company from repurchasing
the senior notes and debentures prior to the termination of the Working Capital
Facility.
 
     At December 31, 1994, housing long-term debt matures as follows:
$10,572,000 in 1995, $7,262,000 in 1996, $4,379,000 in 1997, $36,000 in 1998,

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Deferred income taxes are determined based upon the difference between the
financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and available
net operating loss carryforward ("NOL").
 
     When the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," in 1992, a valuation allowance was provided
for the total amount of deferred tax assets attributable to the NOL because the
Company was precluded from recognizing the tax benefit of the NOL during the
pendency of the Cases. Subsequent to emerging from Chapter 11, the Company
concluded that it would, based on the Company's historical and current pretax
earnings (adjusted for reorganization items) and business plans, more likely
than not be able to realize substantially all of the benefit associated with
deferred tax assets. Accordingly, during the six months ended December 31, 1993,
the Company reduced its valuation allowance by $45,000,000 (based on 39.0%
effective tax rate), resulting in a reduction of the Company's provision for
income taxes and recognition of a deferred tax asset in the same amount, which
amount has been reduced to approximately $13,700,000 at December 31, 1994 as a
result of pretax income generated during 1994 and the last six months of 1993.
The decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased primary and
fully diluted income per share in 1993 by $3.87 per share and $3.72 per share,
respectively.
 
     At December 31, 1994, the Company has a net deferred tax asset of
$38,400,000, which is comprised of deferred tax assets of $54,800,000 (including
$16,300,000 relating to land and housing reserves which were expensed for
financial reporting purposes but deferred for federal income tax reporting
purposes and $24,200,000 relating to the Company's NOL) and deferred tax
liabilities of $16,400,000 (including $13,100,000 relating to interest expense
capitalized for financial reporting purposes but expensed for federal income tax
reporting purposes). At December 31, 1993, deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities were $54,800,000 and $15,700,000, respectively, and were primarily
attributable to the same items as noted above. At December 31, 1994 and 1993,
valuation allowances totaling $22,200,000 and $4,400,000, respectively, had been
provided against the existing net deferred tax asset. The increase in the
valuation allowance in 1994 relates to the increase in the NOL resulting from
deductions taken in the 1993 tax returns. The NOL will reduce taxable income
when it is realized unless the valuation allowance is reduced at an earlier date
due to a change in circumstances.
 
     At December 31, 1994, the Company has available an NOL of approximately
$98,400,000 which expires in the years 2000 through 2008. In addition, the
Company has a credit for alternative minimum tax ("AMT") paid ($2,000,000 at
December 31, 1994) which can be carried forward and be used to reduce regular
taxes payable in excess of AMT in future years.
 
     Pretax income of approximately $35,200,000 will have to be generated during
the NOL carryforward period for the Company to fully utilize the remaining
deferred tax asset at December 31, 1994.
 
     As a result of the Company's recognition of the deferred tax asset
attributable to its NOL, effective July 1, 1993 (and for all future periods),
the Company began providing income taxes based on its effective tax rate.
Excluding the decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 1993, the
following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the
effective income tax rate for:

(5) REORGANIZATION AND EMERGENCE FROM CHAPTER 11
 
     On June 21, 1993 (the "Effective Date"), the Company and 46 of its
affiliates emerged from Chapter 11 pursuant to their First Amended Consolidated
Plan of Reorganization (as modified, the "Plan"). Seven other affiliates
(consisting of the Company's discontinued manufactured housing and building
supply operations, the "Liquidating Debtors") commenced liquidation pursuant to
their First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Liquidating Plan").
 
     None of the financial services subsidiaries were a party to the Company's
reorganization.
 
     Under the Plan, creditors received 4,873,650 shares of common stock and
2,816,762 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock and pre-Effective
Date stockholders received 3,510,818 shares of common stock and warrants
(exercisable at $20 per share), which, if fully exercised, would result in the
issuance of an additional 1,904,757 shares of the Company's common stock.
 
     In connection with the Plan, the Company issued 140,000 shares of common
stock to corporate officers and certain other key employees for services
rendered in connection with the reorganization of the Company. The Company has
reflected the issuance as an increase in stockholders' equity and an offsetting
charge to earnings (which charge has been included in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for 1993 as "reorganization items, net") of
$2,940,000 based upon the prevailing market price of the Company's common stock
at the Effective Date.
 
     In connection with preparing to implement the Plan, the Company recorded
provisions totaling $69,668,000 in 1992 to reflect the impact of the Plan on
land utilization ($42,368,000) and certain nonrecourse debt restructuring
($27,300,000) and recorded a gain from nonrecourse debt forgiven in connection
with the Plan ($27,300,000). The resulting net amount ($42,368,000) was included
in "reorganization items, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations for 1992. The primary component of the charge was a change in the
intended use and reduced holding period for certain land assets necessitated by
increased debt amortization and service requirements of certain indebtedness
originally planned to be issued under the Plan.
 
     The Liquidating Plan provided, among other things, that the proceeds from
the liquidation of the assets of each Liquidating Debtor, if any, after payment
of that Liquidating Debtor's administrative and priority claims, would be
distributed to that Liquidating Debtor's secured and unsecured creditors.

    unpaid dividends. Each share of convertible redeemable preferred stock is
    convertible, subject to adjustments, into one share of common stock at the
    option of the holder and at any time prior to its redemption by the Company.
    During 1994 and 1993, 1,435,835 shares and 862,032 shares, respectively, of
    convertible redeemable preferred stock were converted into an equal number
    of shares of common stock. If the closing price of the common stock is equal
    to or greater than $30 per share for 20 consecutive trading days, the
    convertible redeemable preferred stock will automatically convert into
    common stock. Any shares converted are restored to the status of authorized
    and unissued preferred stock without designation as to series. The holders
    of the convertible redeemable preferred stock are entitled to one vote for
    each share of convertible redeemable preferred stock held by them.
 
    The holders of the convertible redeemable preferred stock vote together as a
    single class with the holders of the common stock on all matters requiring
    stockholder action.
 
(b) Undesignated as to series -- None outstanding. Shares may be issued in one
    or more classes or series with preference, limitations and relative rights
    as determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance. Any shares
    issued will rank, as to dividends and liquidation preference, junior to the
    convertible redeemable preferred stock.
 
     Class B Warrants -- In connection with the Plan, pre-Effective Date
stockholders received Class B warrants to acquire an aggregate of 1,904,757
shares of common stock for $20 per share, of which 3,321 warrants had been
exercised at December 31, 1994. The warrants expire in June 1998.
 
     The Working Capital Facility, the senior note indenture and the Company's
second restated certificate of incorporation contain restrictions on the (i)
payment of dividends on the Company's common and convertible redeemable
preferred stock and (ii) purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition
of the Company's common and preferred stock, other than upon conversion of the
convertible redeemable preferred stock into common stock and upon exercise into
the Company's common stock of Class B warrants and options to acquire common
stock issued pursuant to stock options and stock payment plans.
 
(7) STOCK PLANS
 
  Stock Option Plans --
 
     In June 1993, the Company adopted a qualified and non-qualified stock
option plan for key employees (the "Employee Plan") to purchase a maximum of
500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. In August 1993, the Company
adopted an additional stock option plan whereby options may be granted to non-
employee directors (the "Director Plan") to purchase a maximum of 100,000 shares
of the Company's common stock. Options under the Director Plan are granted
annually in a fixed amount.
 
     Options granted under the Employee Plan will be granted at not less than
the closing price of the common stock on date of grant. Options granted under
the Director Plan will be granted at not less than the average closing price of
the common stock for the ten consecutive trading days prior to the date of
grant; provided that the grant price will not be less than 95% of the average
closing price of the common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days prior to
the date of grant. The options are exercisable as specified in the stock option
agreements relating to the options and may not be exercised later than ten years
from the date of grant.
 
     In 1994, options for 104,000 shares were granted at exercise prices ranging
from $15.13 to $22.71 per share to certain key employees and non-employee
directors, options for an aggregate of 9,000 shares were cancelled and no
options were exercised.
 
     In 1993, options for 318,500 shares were granted at exercise prices ranging
from $23.29 to $26.50 per share to certain key employees and non-employee
directors, options for an aggregate of 10,000 shares were cancelled and no
options were exercised.

                     U.S. HOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     At December 31, 1994, options for 403,500 shares were outstanding at
exercise prices ranging from $15.13 to $26.50 per share of which options for
143,834 shares were exercisable. As of December 31, 1994, 195,500 shares were
available for granting of options, including 38,500 shares to non-employee
directors.
 
  Stock Payment Plan --
 
     In December 1993, the Company adopted an employee stock payment plan (the
"Payment Plan") for key employees whereby up to 25% of an employee's annual
incentive pay (compensation other than base salary) may be payable in shares of
the Company's common stock as determined by the Company's Board of Directors, of
which up to 50% of the shares payable will vest to the employee not later than
two years after the end of the incentive compensation year and will expire in
the event the employee is not employed by the Company on the vesting date. The
Payment Plan has a five-year term and commences on January 1, 1994. As of
December 31, 1994, 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock were reserved
for issuance under the Payment Plan.
 
     Shares to be issued under the Payment Plan will be valued at the average
closing price of the common stock for a ten consecutive trading day period as
defined in the plan.
 
  Restricted Stock Plan --
 
     In October 1994, the Company adopted, subject to stockholder approval, a
restricted stock plan (the "Restricted Plan") for officers and other key
employees. Under the Restricted Plan, which will be effective upon stockholder
approval, a maximum of 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be
granted as restricted stock. Participants in the Restricted Plan may not dispose
of any of the stock granted for five years from date of grant. Restrictions
lapse at the rate of 20% of the stock per year, commencing with the end of the
fifth year. The lapsing of the restrictions between the end of the fifth year
and the ninth year may be accelerated based upon improvements in the Company's
return on assets (as defined in the Restricted Plan) over the base year.
 
     Upon issuance of the restricted stock, unearned compensation equivalent to
the average closing price of the common stock for a ten consecutive trading day
period as defined in the Restricted Plan will be charged to stockholders' equity
and subsequently amortized to expense over a nine year period.
 
(8) PROFIT SHARING
 
     The Company has a qualified profit sharing plan for the benefit of its
employees which may be terminated at any time at the option of the Company. The
annual contributions may be made in such amount as the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, limited to 15% of the total compensation (as defined) of all
participating employees. The aggregate amounts accrued for contribution to the
profit sharing plan for distribution to employees were $891,000 in 1994,
$546,000 in 1993 and $493,000 in 1992.
 
(9) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
     As of December 31, 1994, the Company had refundable and non-refundable
deposits outstanding totaling $53,621,000 for options and contracts to purchase
undeveloped land and finished lots having a total purchase price of
approximately $327,699,000. These options expire at various dates through 2001.
 
     The Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of
business, none of which, in the opinion of the Company, will have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.
 
     At December 31, 1994, Mortgage in connection with managing the interest
rate market risk on its inventory loans held for sale of $16,235,000 and Loan
Quotes of $22,816,000, had outstanding $15,338,000

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
(face amount of $15,500,000 and estimated fair value of $15,373,000) of Forward
Contracts and $23,310,000 of Forward Commitments which expire over the next four
months when the inventory loans are expected to be sold and Loan Quotes are
expected to close. At December 31, 1994, the estimated fair value of the
inventory loans and Loan Quotes hedged by Forward Contracts and not covered by
the Forward Commitments was $15,832,000.
 
     Mortgage reduces its risk of nonperformance under the Hedging Contracts by
entering into those contracts with reputable security dealers and investors and
evaluating their financial condition. However, there is a risk if certain of the
Loan Quotes do not close or are renegotiated in a declining interest rate market
and close at lower prices. Mortgage reduces this risk by collecting commitment
fees on certain of the Loan Quotes along with entering into Forward Commitments
to deliver loans to investors on a best efforts basis and adjusting, from time
to time, the estimate of loan closings covered by Forward Contracts.

GENEL COMPANY, INC.'S ARIZONA MORTGAGE BANKER'S NUMBER IS BK 8284
<PAGE>   2
         C. GENEL Company, Inc., an Oregon corporation, which is licensed as a
mortgage banker in Arizona (Arizona Mortgage Banker Number BK 8284), has been
engaged by Lender to, and did negotiate the terms of this Sixth Amendment as
such terms relate to Arizona matters.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants hereinafter contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. DEFINITIONS

         In addition to the terms defined herein, capitalized terms used in
this Sixth Amendment shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the
Loan Agreement.

         2. SIXTH AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT

         The Loan Agreement is, effective as of the date hereof, amended as
follows:

         2.1 Section 1 of the Loan Agreement is amended by adding or amending
and restating, as the case may be, the definitions set forth below:

                 "'Land Account to Net Worth Ratio' shall mean, as at the date
         of determination thereof, the ratio of (i) the Land Account Balance
         (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) as of such date to (ii) Adjusted
         Consolidated Tangible Net Worth as of such date.

                 "'Sixth Amendment' shall mean that certain Sixth Amendment to
         Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated effective as of September
         16, 1994, between Borrower and Lender."

                 "'Total Land Account Balance' shall mean, on any date, the net
         aggregate sum of book cost (net of reserves)





                                       2
<PAGE>   3
         of (i) Land Held for Investment or in the Process of Development owned
         by Borrower or Guarantors on such date; (ii) Development Costs
         incurred by Borrower or Guarantors on such date; (iii) the USH Book
         Cost of all Finished Building Lots owned by Borrower or any Guarantor
         on such date; (iv) Option Deposits made by Borrower or Guarantors
         (including refundable Option Deposits) on such date; and (v) Advance
         Costs incurred by Borrower or Guarantors on such date."

                 2.2 Section 2.9(a) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:

                 "(a) Borrower shall pay interest to Lender monthly in arrears,
         on the first day of each month (each, an 'Interest Payment Date'), in
         an amount equal to the quotient of (i) an amount equal to (A) the sum
         of the daily unpaid principal amounts of the Loan outstanding on each
         day during the previous month multiplied by (B) a rate equal to the
         GECC Composite Commercial Paper Rate for the previous month plus 4.0%
         (the 'Stated Rate'), divided by (ii) 360."

                 2.3 Section 2.10(a) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended
and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

                 "(a) Upon the effectiveness of the Sixth Amendment, Borrower
         is obligated to pay Lender a fee (the "Availability Fee") of $475,000
         per annum, with such per annum amount to be pro rated for any partial
         year during which this Agreement is in effect. Upon the occurrence and
         during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Availability Fee
         will increase to $950,000 per annum and, if such Event of Default is
         cured by Borrower, the Availability Fee shall revert to the rate of
         $475,000 per annum. Upon the effectiveness of the Sixth Amendment, the
         entire amount of the Availability Fee for the remaining term of this
         Agreement (which, for purposes of this sentence, shall be calculated
         at the rate of $475,000 per annum notwithstanding the existence of an
         Event of Default on the date this Agreement is terminated) shall be
         deemed to be fully earned by Lender and the termination of this
         Agreement for any reason prior to June 21, 1997, shall not terminate
         the obligation of Borrower to pay the entire remaining amount of the
         Availability Fee for the anticipated term of this Agreement which,
         upon termination of this Agreement for any reason prior to June 21,
         1997, shall become immediately due and payable in full. Borrower shall
         pay the Availability Fee to Lender in quarterly installments on the
         first

         Business Day of each calendar quarter in immediately available funds;
         provided that to the extent the conditions of Section 2.2 hereof are
         met, the Availability Fee shall, at the option of Borrower, constitute
         a Revolving Credit Advance."

                 2.4 Subsection (c) of Section 7.10 of the Loan Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

                 "(c) Maximum Land Account Balance. Borrower shall not, at any
         time, permit (i) its Land Account to Net Worth Ratio to be greater
         than 1.15 to 1.0 or (ii) its Total Land Account Balance to exceed
         $425,000,000."

                 2.5 Section 10.2 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety as follows:

                 "10.2 Fees and Expenses. (a) Borrower shall, upon execution of
         this Agreement, and thereafter pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
         expenses of Lender in connection with the preparation and, subject to
         subsection (b)(i) below, administration of the Loan Documents
         (including the reasonable fees and expenses of all of its counsel and
         advisors retained in connection with the Loan Documents and the
         transactions contemplated thereby and advice in connection therewith).
         If, at any time or times, regardless of the existence of an Event of
         Default (except with respect to paragraphs (iv) and (v), which shall
         be subject to an Event of Default having occurred and be continuing),
         Lender (or in the case of paragraphs (iv) and (v) below, any Assignee
         Lender) shall employ counsel or other advisors for advice or other
         representation or shall incur reasonable legal or other costs and
         expenses in connection with:

                          (i) subject to the terms of subsection (b)(ii)
                 below, any sale of participations, assignment, transfer  or
                 other disposition of Lender's interest in the Loan  or any of
                 the Loan Documents or any portion thereof;

                          (ii) any amendment, interpretation of,  modification
                 or waiver, or consent with respect to, any of the Loan
                 Documents or, subject to the terms of  subsection (b)(i) and
                 (iii) below, advice in connection  with the administration of
                 the Loans made pursuant  hereto or its rights hereunder or
                 thereunder;

                          (iii) any litigation, contest, dispute, suit,
                 proceeding or action (whether instituted by Lender or  any
                 Assignee Lender, Borrower, any Subsidiary of  Borrower or any
                 other Person) in any way relating to  the Collateral, any of
                 the Loan Documents or any other  agreements to be executed or
                 delivered in connection  herewith;

                          (iv) any attempt to enforce any rights of Lender  or
                 any Assignee Lender against Borrower, any Subsidiary  of
                 Borrower or any other Person, that may be obligated  to Lender
                 by virtue of any of the Loan Documents;

                          (v) any attempt to verify, protect, value,  collect,
                 sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of the  Collateral;

         then, and in any such event, the attorneys' and other parties' fees
         arising from such services, including those of any appellate
         proceedings, and all expenses, costs, charges and other fees incurred
         by such counsel and others in any way or respect arising in connection
         with or relating to any of the events or actions described in this
         Section shall be payable, on demand, by Borrower to Lender (or as
         provided above to an Assignee Lender) and shall be additional
         Obligations secured under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such reasonable
         expenses, costs, charges and fees may include: appraisers,
         liquidators, review of applicable Court filings, paralegal fees, costs
         and expenses; accountants' and investment bankers' fees, costs and
         expenses; court costs and expenses; photocopying and duplicating
         expenses; court reporter fees, costs and expenses; long distance
         telephone charges; air express charges; telegram charges; secretarial
         overtime charges; and expenses for travel, lodging and food paid or
         incurred in connection with the performance of such legal services.

                 (b) Notwithstanding the terms of subsection (a) hereof, (i)
         Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any of the expenses incurred by
         Lender (including the fees and expenses of its counsel and advisors)
         in connection with the qualification of properties as Eligible
         Collateral, for admittance of Eligible Collateral to the Borrowing
         Base or determinations or calculations of Borrowing Base Availability,
         (ii) Borrower shall only be obligated to pay 50% of the attorneys' and
         other parties' fees arising from the activities described in
         10.2(a)(i) hereof and (iii) Lender shall be obligated for any expenses
         incurred by it in





                                       5

         connection with the issuance of mortgagee title policies or
         commitments issued in its favor (together with any related title
         company charges) and any fees of local real estate counsel incurred in
         connection therewith; provided, however, that Borrower shall remain
         obligated to pay all usual and customary fees and premiums for the
         issuance of owner's title policies (together with any related title
         company charges), all recording fees and all fees, costs and expenses
         for environmental matters, including environmental peer reports."

                 2.6 Schedule 1.1 to the Loan Agreement is hereby replaced in
its entirety by the revised Schedule 1.1 attached to this Sixth Amendment as
Exhibit A.

                 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                 The Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Lender that:

                          (a) All the representations and warranties of the
         Loan Parties contained in the Loan Agreement or in any of the Loan
         Documents are true and correct on, and as if made on, the date of this
         Sixth Amendment, except to the extent that any such representation or
         warranty expressly relates to an earlier date and for changes therein

         this Sixth Amendment does not contravene, violate or conflict with any

                                  SCHEDULE 1.1


                 "Borrowing Base" shall mean all Eligible Collateral that
Lender has not rejected in its sole discretion as constituting a portion of the
Borrowing Base and with respect to which (a) Lender has a first priority Lien
perfected as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, subject only to
Ordinary Course Liens; (b) Lender has received a binding mortgagee's policy of
title insurance on ALTA Form B (1970 and 1984) or the appropriate
state-specific form requested by Lender and otherwise in form and content
satisfactory to Lender, to be obtained at Lender's expense, insuring that the
Lien of the Collateral Documents constitutes a valid Lien encumbering the Real
Estate, free and clear of all defects and encumbrances except for Ordinary
Course Liens and such other Liens as Lender shall approve and naming Lender as
insured, issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company acceptable
to Lender, with no exceptions or exclusions other than as may be approved by
Lender (together with legible copies of all permitted title exceptions), and in
an amount not less than the value attributed to such Eligible Collateral by
Lender, with the total amount of the title policies to be issued in Lender's
favor to be (i) with respect to parcels of Real Estate located in the states of
Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey and
Virginia, in a maximum aggregate amount equal to the maximum principal amount
of $95,000,000; and (ii) with respect to parcels of Real Estate located in the
states of Texas, Florida or any other states not named in section (i) of this
definition, in an amount equal to the "book value" attributed to each parcel by
Lender. Notwithstanding the provisions of parenthetical (ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, with respect to parcels of Real Estate located in the state
of Texas only, Lender hereby agrees that it will accept an interim construction
binder of title insurance in lieu of the above described mortgagee's title
insurance policy (but which otherwise meet all of the requirements of the
preceding sentence), provided that (x) an Event of Default has not occurred;
and (y) immediately upon Lender's request (whether or not an Event of Default
has occurred), Borrower shall obtain, at Lender's expense, mortgagee's policies
of title insurance on all parcels of Real Estate located in the state of Texas,
which policies shall meet all of the requirements of the preceding sentence.
Each title policy shall include such affirmative insurance as Lender may
require and shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender's legal
counsel. The title insurance policy shall be reinsured with such title
companies, in such





<PAGE>   11
amounts and in such manner and form as shall be acceptable to Lender. In the
event that a Lien (other than an Ordinary Course Lien) is filed against any
Eligible Collateral subsequent to its admission to the Borrowing Base (whether
or not such Lien is subordinate to the Lien perfected by Lender as contemplated
by this Agreement), in addition to all other rights and remedies that Lender
may have under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender shall be
entitled, in its sole discretion, to remove the Eligible Collateral affected by
such Lien from the Borrowing Base, effective immediately.

                             U.S. HOME CORPORATION
                CORPORATE OFFICERS AND PRESIDENTS OF OPERATIONS
                             RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN



                 1.       PURPOSE.

                 The purpose of the U.S. Home Corporation Corporate Officers
and Presidents of Operations Restricted Stock Plan (the "Plan") is to create
incentives for the corporate officers and presidents of operations of U.S. Home
Corporation (the "Company") to provide services to the Company over a long
period of time and to enhance the level of performance of the Company by
awarding such employees shares of Stock (as defined herein) subject to certain
vesting requirements.

                 2.       ADMINISTRATION.

                 (a)      A committee (the "Committee"), which shall initially
be the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the board of directors of the
Company (the "Board"), and which will be comprised of at least three members of
the Board, all of whom are "disinterested persons" (as defined below), will (i)
administer the Plan, (ii) establish, subject to the provisions of the Plan,
such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate for the proper
administration of the Plan and (iii) make such determinations under, and such
interpretations of, and take such steps in connection with, the Plan or the
Stock issued thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable.  The members of
the Committee may be appointed from time to time by the Board and serve at the
pleasure of the Board.  The Committee will hereinafter be referred to as the
"Administrator."

                 (b)      For the purposes of this Section 2, a "disinterested
person" is a person who, on a given date, is disinterested within the meaning
of Rule 6b-13 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act").

                 3.       STOCK.

                 The stock which is the subject of the Plan will be the shares
of common stock of the Company, $.01 par value per share (the "Stock"), whether
authorized and unissued or treasury stock.  The total number of shares of Stock
which may be issued under the Plan will not exceed, in the aggregate, 250,000.

                 4.       AWARD OF STOCK.

                 (a)      All of the corporate officers and presidents of
operations of the Company listed on Schedule A attached hereto (each an
"Employee" and collectively, "Employees"), shall be eligible to receive Stock
in accordance with the terms hereof.

                 (b)      In consideration of future services to be provided by
each Employee to the Company, each Employee shall be awarded, on a one-time
basis, the number of shares of Stock, subject to the restrictions contained
herein, determined by dividing $200,000 by the average closing price of the
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") for the 10 consecutive trading
days immediately following the date on which the Company releases its financial
results for the fiscal year ending December 3, 1994; provided that no fractional
shares of Stock shall be issued under the Plan.

                 (c)      The closing price of the Stock, as of any particular
day, will be as reported in The Wall Street Journal; provided, however, that if
the Stock is not listed on the NYSE on any applicable day, the closing price
for such day will be not less than the fair market value of the Stock on such
day, as determined by the Administrator based on such empirical evidence as it
deems to be appropriate under the circumstances.





                                     A-1
<PAGE>   2
                 (d)  The Administrator shall have the right pursuant to the
terms hereof to award Stock to any individual who becomes a corporate officer
or president of operations of the Company after the effective date of the Plan
and prior to the initial Vesting Date (as defined herein).  The Administrator
shall make such award substantially in accordance with the terms of the Plan,
including the vesting requirements contained in Section 5 hereof, but shall be
permitted to award a smaller number of shares of Stock based on the date on
which the individual commences employment as a corporate officer or president
of operations of the Company.

                 5.       VESTING.

                 (a)  On each Vesting Date, unless all shares of Stock awarded
to each Employee shall have previously vested with each Employee and subject to
the forfeiture provisions contained herein, a percentage of the shares of Stock
awarded hereunder to each Employee shall vest with each Employee such that the
cumulative percentage of total shares of Stock vested with each Employee shall
be the greater of the applicable percentages set forth below:

                (i)       (A)       20% as of the Vesting Date in the year 2000;
                          (B)       40% as of the Vesting Date in the year 2001;
                          (C)       60% as of the Vesting Date in the year 2002;
                          (D)       80% as of the Vesting Date in the year 2003;
                          (E)       100% as of the Vesting Date in the year 
                                    2004;

                (ii)      If, on a Vesting Date, the Return on Assets
Improvement (as defined herein) is:

                          (A)       greater than 1.05 and less than or equal to 
                                    1.10, then 40%;
                          (B)       greater than 1.10 and less than or equal to
                                    1.15, then 60%;
                          (C)       greater than 1.15 and less than or equal to
                                    1.20, then 80%; 
                          (D)       greater than 1.20, then 100%;

provided, however, that no Employee shall be required to forfeit any shares of
Stock previously vested hereunder.

For the purposes hereof:

                          "Return on Assets Improvement" means (x) the sum of
the Return on Assets for the two fiscal years of the Company immediately prior
to the applicable Vesting Date divided by two, and the result divided by (y)
the Return on Assets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994, rounded to the
nearest hundredth.

                          "Return on Assets" means (x) the amount contained in
the Company's "income (loss) before income tax" line-item for the applicable
fiscal year of the Company as reported in the consolidated statements of
operations set forth in the audited financial statements for the Company for
such fiscal year, divided by (y) the Average Total Assets for such year.

                          "Average Total Assets" means an amount equal to (x)
(1) total housing assets at the beginning of the applicable fiscal year of the
Company (as reported in the consolidated balance sheet set forth in the audited
financial statements for the Company for the prior fiscal year), plus (2) total
housing assets at the end of such fiscal year (as reported in the consolidated
balance sheet set forth in the audited financial statements for the Company for
such fiscal year), divided by (y) two.

                 (b)      In the event an Employee is not employed by the
Company on or prior to December 31 of any year which is immediately prior to any
Vesting Date, due to voluntary termination of employment by the Employee or
termination for Cause (as defined herein), all of the shares of Stock remaining
to be vested with such Employee hereunder and all rights arising from such
shares of Stock shall be forfeited by such Employee and returned to the
Company.





                                      A-2
<PAGE>   3
                 (c)      For purposes of the Plan, a voluntary termination by
an Employee will not be deemed to occur in the event such Employee is
Constructively Terminated (as defined herein).

                 (d)      In the event an Employee is terminated without Cause
prior to January 1, 2000, 20% of the shares of Stock awarded hereunder shall
immediately vest with such Employee and the remaining shares of Stock to be
vested hereunder and all rights arising from such shares of Stock shall be
forfeited by such Employee and returned to the Company.

                 (e)      In the event there is a Change of Control (as defined
herein) and within 24 months thereof an Employee is terminated without Cause or
Constructively Terminated, all shares of Stock remaining to be vested with such
Employee hereunder shall immediately vest with such Employee and the Company
shall immediately cause the issuance to such Employee of appropriate stock
certificates representing such shares of Stock in such Employee's name in
accordance with Section 6 hereof.

                 (f)      In the event an Employee dies, is Permanently
Disabled (as defined herein), or retires (after not less than 20 years of
employment by the Company), the Administrator shall have the authority, in its
sole discretion, to vest such Employee (or such Employee's estate, if
applicable) in as many shares of Stock as the Administrator shall deem
appropriate, based upon such Employee's prior job performance.

                 (g)      For purposes of the Plan:

                          (i)      "Base Salary" shall mean an amount equal to
                          an Employee's maximum annual base salary in effect at
                          any time after the effective date of the Plan,
                          excluding any incentive compensation or bonus payable
                          or paid to an Employee.

                          willful failure to perform his duties with respect to

                          partial incapacity due to physical or mental
                          illness), (2) gross negligence or malfeasance by an
                          Employee in the performance of his duties with
                          respect to the Company, (3) an act or acts on an
                          Employee's part constituting a felony under the laws

                          results or was intended to result directly or
                          indirectly in gain or personal enrichment by such
                          Employee at the expense of the Company or (4) any
                          other circumstances set forth in an employment
                          agreement between the Company and such Employee which
                          would constitute grounds for the Company to terminate
                          the employment of such Employee for cause (as defined
                          in the applicable employment agreement).

                          (iii)    "Change of Control" means any of the
                          following:  (i) the sale, lease, conveyance or other
                          disposition of all or substantially all of the

                          subsidiaries of a President of Operations will not be
                          deemed to be Constructively Terminated in the event
                          he or she is required to be a Division Chairman or

                          further, that the employment of an Employee will not
                          be deemed Constructively Terminated unless such
                          Employee actually terminates his or her employment
                          with the Company within 60 days after the occurrence
                          of an event specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above.

                          to the date and extent of disability of any Employee
                          shall be made by the Administrator upon the basis of

                 6.       STOCK CERTIFICATES.

                 (a)      Each Employee shall receive a stock certificate
reflecting the number of shares of Stock awarded hereunder.  Such  certificate
shall be registered in the name of such Employee and shall bear the following
legend:

                 "The securities (the "Shares") represented by this stock
                 certificate are restricted by the terms of the U.S. Home
                 Corporation Corporate Officers and Presidents of Operations
                 Restricted Stock Plan ("Restricted Stock Plan"), effective as
                 of January 1, 1995, which contains provisions affecting the
                 rights and obligations of the holder of the Shares and
                 restrictions on the transfer of the Shares.  Any transfer of
                 the Shares represented by this stock certificate in violation
                 of the Restricted Stock Plan is null and void."

                 (b)      The Administrator may, in its sole discretion,
require that the stock certificates evidencing the shares of Stock be held in
custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed, and
that, as a condition of receiving the shares of Stock, the Employee shall have
delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the shares of Stock.
If and to the extent any shares of Stock vest with an Employee in accordance
with terms hereof, stock certificates for the appropriate number of
unrestricted shares of Stock shall be delivered promptly to the Employee.
Shares of Common Stock will not be released to an Employee unless and until the
amount of federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld has been paid
or satisfied.  Tax withholding liabilities may be satisfied by the Employee
relinquishing shares of Common Stock vested pursuant to the Plan, valued at the
market price of the Common Stock on the date such shares of Common Stock are
released to the Employee.

                 7.       TERM AND EFFECTIVE DATE.

                 The Plan will become effective upon (i) approval by the Board
and (ii) approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting
capital stock of the Company present or represented and entitled to vote at the
1995 annual meeting of the Company's stockholders.  Subject to Section 15 
hereof, the Plan shall terminate upon issuance and vesting of the Stock issuable
pursuant to the Plan.

                 8.       TRANSFERABILITY.

                 Employees shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge,
assign or otherwise encumber shares of Stock awarded hereunder prior to the
vesting of such shares of Stock.  Upon vesting of such shares of Stock, an
Employee will only transfer such shares of Stock in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities laws.  Employees who are affiliates of the Company
may generally dispose of their shares in accordance with Rule 44 promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

                 9.       RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER.

                 Except as provided in Section 8 hereof or this Section 9,
Employees shall have, with respect to any shares of Stock remaining to be
vested hereunder, all of the rights of stockholders of the Company, including
the right to vote such shares of Stock and to receive any cash dividends.
Stock dividends, if any, issued with respect to such shares of Stock shall be
subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions hereunder that
apply to such shares of Stock.

                 10.      INVESTMENT PURPOSE.

                 At the time of issuance of any shares of Stock, the
Administrator may, if it will deem it necessary or desirable for any reason,
require an Employee to represent in writing to the Company that (a) it is such
Employee's then intention to acquire the Stock for investment purposes and not
with a view to the distribution thereof and/or (b) upon acquisition of the
Stock, the Employee will not beneficially own in excess of 4.9 percent of the
value of the equity securities (as defined in Rule 3a-11-1 under the Exchange 
Act) of the Company; provided that for purposes of this Section 10(b),
all outstanding options and convertible securities to acquire Stock shall be
deemed to be exercised or converted; provided, further, that this Section 10(b)
shall be inoperative after June 21, 1995.

                 11.      RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT.

                 Nothing contained herein will restrict the right of the
Company to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time.

                 12.      FINALITY OF DETERMINATIONS.

                 Each determination, interpretation, or other action made or
taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan by the Administrator will be final
and be binding and conclusive for all purposes.

                 13.      SUBSIDIARY AND PARENT CORPORATIONS.

                 Unless the context requires otherwise, references under the
Plan to the Company will be deemed to include any subsidiary corporations and
parent corporations of the Company, as those terms are defined in Section 424
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                 14.      GOVERNING LAW.

                 The Plan will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

                 15.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

                 The Administrator may at any time terminate, amend or modify
the Plan in any respect it deems suitable; provided, however, that, solely with
respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, no such action of
the Administrator, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, may
(I) materially increase the benefits accruing to employees eligible to receive
Stock under the Plan, (ii) materially increase the total amount of Stock which
may be awarded under the Plan or (iii) materially modify the requirements for
participation in the Plan; provided, further, that no amendment, modification
or termination of the Plan may in any manner affect any Stock (whether vested
or not) theretofore awarded under the Plan without the consent of the Employee
to whom Stock has been awarded.

                 16.  OVERRIDE.

                 (a)      With respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act, transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all
applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act.
To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by the Administrator fails to
so comply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and
deemed advisable by the Administrator.

                 (b)      All transactions pursuant to terms of the Plan,
including, without limitation, awards and vesting of Stock, shall only be
effective at such time as counsel to the Company shall have determined that
such transaction will not violate federal or state securities or other laws.
The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, defer the effectiveness of such
transaction to pursue whatever actions may be required to ensure compliance
with such federal or state securities or other laws.

                            U.S.  HOME  CORPORATION

                            CORPORATE  OFFICERS'(1)
                        INCENTIVE  COMPENSATION  PROGRAM

                            For the Incentive Period
                      January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994

         Set forth below is an outline of the Corporate Officers' Incentive
Compensation Program for the incentive period January 1, 1994 to December 31,
1994 ("Incentive 1994").

         Corporate Officers who are employed by the Corporation as of January
1, 1994 will be eligible to participate in the Corporate Officers' Incentive
Compensation Program for the period commencing January 1, 1994 and ending
December 31, 1994.  Effective January 1, 1994, base salaries are established as
set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

         Under this Program, an incentive compensation pool equal to the lessor
of $600,000 or 2% of the pre-tax profits of the Corporation earned in fiscal
1994, shall be established to be distributed to the Corporate Officers at the
sole discretion and upon approval of a majority of the non-management members
of the Compensation Committee and of the Board of Directors of the Corporation
based on its evaluation of the following factors:

         1.      The Board of Directors shall review the profit and loss of the
                 Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994 as
                 compared to the projected profit and loss for the period
                 January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 as set forth in the
                 1994 Business Plan as presented to the Board of Directors.

         2.      The Board of Directors shall review the cash flow of the
                 Company as compared to the projected cash flow for the period
                 January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 as set forth in the
                 1994 Business Plan as presented to the Board of Directors.

         3.      The Board of Directors shall review the overall performance of
                 the Company in comparison to competitive industry performance
                 taking into consideration, an analysis of rates of growth,
                 return on equity and return on sales.

         4.      The Board of Directors shall review incentive bonus payments
                 by competitors in relation to proposed payments to said
                 officers to insure that they are designed to retain and
                 motivate executives.

         5.      All other actions by said Officers to maximize the value of
                 shareholders' equity.

         Upon the recommendation of the Chairman and President of the Company,
the Board of Directors shall determine, in its sole discretion, the amount each
respective Officer shall receive from the said incentive compensation pool,
provided that the maximum incentive compensation payable to any Officer shall
not exceed 75% of the base compensation of such Officer.

____________

(1)  Excludes Chairman and President who are subject to Employment and
     Consulting Agreements which govern payment of bonus (see Exhibit A).

Coporate Officers' Incentive Program                                      Page 2

         To be entitled to receive a bonus, a Corporate Officer must remain in
the employ of the Company for the entire fiscal year.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall have the right to
terminate employment of any Corporate Officer covered under this Program at
will, without notice, and without cause, at any time.

         The total bonus earned pursuant to the incentive program set forth
herein shall be paid upon approval of the Board of Directors of the Company as
follows:

         A.      75% of the aggregate incentive bonus earned by the Corporate
                 Officer shall be paid in cash within 30 days following receipt
                 of 1994 audited financial statements.

         B.      25% of the aggregate incentive bonus earned by the Corporate
                 Officer shall be paid in shares of U.S.  Home Corporation's
                 common stock, with each share valued at the average market
                 price of said shares on the New York Stock Exchange, as of the
                 close of trading for the ten (10) trading days commencing the
                 day following release by the Company of its results for the
                 fiscal year ended December 31, 1994.  Said shares shall be
                 held in escrow by the Company to be delivered to the
                 respective Corporate Officers as follows:

                 1.       1/2 of such shares shall be delivered to the
                          Corporate Officer within thirty (30) days of the
                          determination of the respective stock price.

                 2.       1/2 of such shares shall be delivered to the
                          Corporate Officer on or prior to January 31, 1997.
                          However, in order to receive such shares, the
                          Corporate Officer must remain in the employ of the
                          Corporation as of December 31, 1996.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that said Corporate
Officer's employment with the Corporation is terminated by the Corporation
other than for "Cause", all remaining shares not previously delivered to the
Corporate Officer shall be delivered to said Corporate Officer within thirty
(30) days following termination.  For purposes of this Program, the term
"Cause" shall mean (i) the Officer's continuing, willful failure to perform his
duties required of his position (other than as a result of total or partial
incapacity due to physical or mental illness), (ii) gross negligence or
malfeasance by the Officer in the performance of his duties hereunder, (iii) an
act or acts on the Officer's part constituting a felony under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof which results or was intended to result
directly or indirectly in gain or personal enrichment by the Officer at the
expense of the Company, or (iv) breach of the provisions of Exhibit B hereto
pertaining to confidentiality and competitive activities, but shall not mean
(A)  the refusal to relocate to another city more than 50 miles from the
Officer's present place of business, nor (B)  a refusal to perform the duties
required of his position as a result of either a material change in the scope
of his job responsibilities or a reduction in base compensation.

         The transfer of said shares by such Corporate Officer shall be
required to conform to all applicable laws and regulations pertaining thereto.

                                   EXHIBIT B

A.       Confidentiality.  The Officer acknowledges that he has acquired and
         will acquire confidential information respecting the business of the
         Company.  Accordingly, the Officer agrees that, without the written
         consent of the Company as authorized by its Board of Directors, he
         will not, at any time, willfully disclose any such confidential
         information to any unauthorized third party with an intent that such
         disclosure will result in financial benefit to the Officer or to any
         person other than the Company.  For this purpose, information shall be
         considered confidential only if such information is uniquely
         proprietary to the Company and has not been made publicly available
         prior to its disclosure by the Officer.

B.       Competitive Activity.  Until the end of his employment, the Officer
         shall devote full business time to business of the Corporation and
         shall not, without the consent of the Board of Directors of the
         Company, directly or indirectly, knowingly engage or be interested in
         (as owner, partner, shareholder, employee, director, officer, agent,
         consultant or otherwise), with or without compensation, any business
         which is in competition with any line of business being actively
         conducted by the Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries
         during his employment period.  Nothing herein, however, shall prohibit
         the Officer from acquiring or holding not more than one percent of any
         class of publicly traded securities of any such business.

between U.S. HOME MORTGAGE CORPORATION, a Florida corporation (the "Company")
and RESIDENTIAL FUNDING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Lender").

         WHEREAS, the Company and the Lender have entered into a single family
revolving warehouse facility with a present commitment amount of Forty Million
Dollars ($40,000,000) (the "Commitment"), to finance the origination and
acquisition of Mortgage Loans as evidenced by a Fourth Amended and Restated
Promissory Note in the principal sum of Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000),
dated as of June 15, 1993 (the "Note"), and by a Warehousing Credit and
Security Agreement dated as of April 15, 1992, as the same may have been
amended or supplemented (the "Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, the Company has requested the Lender to reduce the Commitment
amount, to provide for tiered pricing on the Commitment, and to amend certain
other terms of the Agreement, and the Lender has agreed to such reduction and
amendment subject to the terms and conditions of this Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing and of the
mutual covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter set forth and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

         1.      All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have their respective meanings set forth in the Agreement.

         2.      Section 1.1 of the Agreement shall be amended by adding the
following definition:

                 "C.P. Rate" means, as of any date of determination, the rate
         of interest per annum which is equal to the composite rate for
         dealer-placed thirty-day commercial paper published by Knight-Ridder,
         Inc. on its MoneyCenter system at 10 a.m. on the first Business Day of
         such week. The CP Rate shall be rounded, if necessary, to the next
         highest one eighth of one percent. If such composite commercial paper
         rate is not so published for any period, then during such period the
         CP Rate shall mean the rate for thirty-day commercial paper sold
         through dealers published for the first Business Day of such week in
         The Wall Street Journal in its regular column entitled "Money Rates."

         3.      From the date hereof until December 31, 1994, Section 1.1 of
the Agreement shall be amended to delete the definition of "Floating Rate" in
its entirety, replacing it with the following definition:

                 "Floating Rate" means the Tier 1 Floating Rate or the Tier 2
         Floating Rate, as applicable.

         4.      Effective as of November 1, 1994, Section 2.1(a) of the

         Agreement and provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
         is continuing, the Lender  agrees, from time to time during the period
         from November 1, 1994, to and including August 31, 1995 (unless such
         period is earlier terminated pursuant hereto) to make Advances to the
         Company, provided the total aggregate  principal amount outstanding at
         any one time of all such Advances shall not exceed Twenty-Five Million
         Dollars  ($25,000,000). The obligation of the Lender to make Advances
         hereunder up to such limit, is hereinafter  referred to as the
         "Commitment." Within the Commitment, the Company may borrow, repay and
         reborrow. All Advances under this Agreement shall constitute a single
         indebtedness, and all of the Collateral shall be security for the Note
         and for the performance of all the Obligations.

                          (B)     On the outstanding principal amount of
                 Ordinary Warehousing Advances to the extent such outstanding
                 principal amount exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the
                 Commitment, a floating rate of interest which is equal to
                 LIBOR plus one and one- half percent (1.50%) per annum (the

         conclusive and binding, absent  manifest error.

         7.      Effective as of November 1, 1994, the words "Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000)" in Sections 2.9(a) and 2.9(b) of the Agreement shall be
