                                  PART I

Item 1.  Business.

     General Development of Business.   Trinity Industries, Inc. (the
"Registrant") was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas
in 1933. On March 27, 1987, Trinity became a Delaware corporation by merger
into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the same name.

     Narrative Description of Business and Financial Information About
Industry Segments.  The Registrant is engaged in the manufacture, marketing,
and leasing of a variety of metal products consisting principally of (1)
"Railcars" (i.e. railroad freight cars), principally tank cars, hopper cars,
gondola cars, intermodal cars and miscellaneous other freight cars; (2)
"Marine Products" such as boats, barges and various offshore service vessels
for ocean and inland waterway service and military vessels for the United
States Government and, to a limited extent, various size vessels for
international ocean transportation companies; (3) "Construction Products" such
as highway guardrail and highway and railway bridges, power plants, mills,
etc, highway safety products, passenger loading bridges and conveyor systems
for airports and other people and baggage conveyance requirements, ready-mix
concrete production and aggregates including distribution, and providing raw
material to owners, contractors and sub-contractors for use in the building
and foundation industry; (4) "Containers" such as (a) extremely large, heavy
pressure vessels and other heavy welded products including industrial
silencers, desalinators, evaporators, and gas processing systems, (b) pressure
and non-pressure containers for the storage and transportation of liquefied
gases, brewery products and other liquid and dry products, and (c) heat
transfer equipment for the chemical, petroleum and petrochemical industries;
(5) "Metal Components" such as weld fittings (tees, elbows, reducers, caps,
flanges, etc.) used in pressure piping systems and container heads (the ends
of pressure and non-pressure containers) for use internally and by other
manufacturers of containers; and (6) "Leasing" of Registrant manufactured
railcars and barges to various industries.

     Various financial information concerning the Registrant's industry
segments for each of the last three fiscal years is included in the
Registrant's 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders on page 22 under the heading
"Segment Information", and such section is incorporated herein by reference.

     Railcars.  The Registrant manufactures railroad freight cars, principally
pressure and non- pressure tank cars, hopper cars, intermodal cars and gondola
cars used for transporting a wide variety of liquids, gases and dry cargo.
Tank cars transport products such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquid
fertilizer, sulfur, sulfuric acids and corn syrup.  Covered hopper cars carry
cargo such as grain, dry fertilizer, plastic pellets and cement.  Open-top
hoppers haul coal, and top-loading gondola cars transport a variety of heavy
bulk commodities such as scrap metals, finished flat steel products, machinery
and lumber.  Intermodal cars transport various products which have been loaded
in containers to minimize shipping costs.

     Marine Products.  The Registrant manufactures a variety of marine
products pursuant to customer orders.  It produces various types of vessels
for offshore service including supply, crew, fishing and other types of
boats.  The Registrant is currently constructing various military vessels for
both the United States Army and Navy. The Registrant produces river hopper
barges which are used to carry coal, grain and miscellaneous commodities.  The
purchasers of the Registrant's marine products include inland waterway marine
operators, offshore oil and gas drillers and operators, international ocean
transportation companies, barge transport companies and domestic and foreign
governmental authorities.




     Construction Products.  The construction products manufactured by the
Registrant include beams, girders, columns, highway guard rail and highway
safety devices and related barrier products, ready-mix concrete and
aggregates, passenger loading bridges, and baggage handling systems.  These
products are used in the bridge, highway construction and building industries
and airports.  Some of the sales of beams, girders and columns are to general
contractors and subcontractors on highway construction projects.  Generally,
customers for highway guardrail and highway safety devices are highway
departments or subcontractors on highway projects.  Passenger loading bridges
and conveyor systems are generally sold to contractors, airports, or airlines
as part of airport terminal equipment. Ready-mix concrete and aggregates are
used in the building and foundation industry and customers include primarily
owners, contractors and sub-contractors.

     Containers.  The Registrant is engaged in manufacturing metal containers
consisting of extremely large, heavy pressure vessels and other heavy welded
products, including industrial silencers, desalinators, evaporators, and gas
processing systems for the storage and transportation of liquefied petroleum
("LP") gas and anhydrous ammonia fertilizer.  Pressure LP gas containers are
utilized at industrial plants, utilities, small businesses and in suburban and
rural areas for residential heating and cooking needs.  Fertilizer containers
are manufactured for highway and rail transport, bulk storage, farm storage
and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia.  The Registrant
also makes heat transfer equipment for the chemical, petroleum and
petrochemical industries and a complete line of custom vessels, standard steam
jacketed kettles, mix cookers, and custom-fabricated cooking vessels for the
food, meat, dairy, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and chemical industries.

     Metal Components.  The metal components manufactured by the Registrant
are made from ferrous and non-ferrous metals and their alloys and consist
principally of butt weld type fittings, flanges and pressure and non-pressure
container heads.  The weld fittings include caps, elbows, return bends,
concentric and eccentric reducers, full and reducing outlet tees, and a full
line of pipe flanges, all of which are pressure rated.  The Registrant
manufactures and stocks, in standard, extra-heavy and double-extra-heavy
weights and in various diameters, weld caps, tees, reducers, elbows, return
bends, flanges and also manufactures to customer specifications.  The basic
raw materials for weld fittings and flanges are carbon steel, stainless steel,
aluminum, chrome-moly and other metal tubing or seamless pipe and forgings.
The Registrant sells its weld fittings and flanges to distributors and to
other manufacturers of weld fittings.

     Container heads manufactured by the Registrant are pressed metal
components used in the further manufacture of a finished product.  Since the
manufacture of container heads requires a substantial investment in heavy
equipment and dies, many other manufacturers order container heads from the
Registrant.  Container heads are manufactured in various shapes and may be
pressure rated or non-pressure, depending on the intended use in further
manufacture.  Other pressed shapes are also hot- or cold-formed to customer
requirements.

     Leasing.  The Company has one wholly-owned leasing subsidiary, Trinity
Industries Leasing Company ("TILC"), which was incorporated in 1979.  TILC is
engaged in leasing specialized types of railcars, consisting of both tank cars
and hopper cars, to industrial companies in the petroleum, chemical, grain,
food processing, fertilizer and other industries which supply cars to the
railroads.  At March 31, 1995, TILC had under lease 9,066 railcars.  During
fiscal year 1995, TILC divested its inventory of river hopper barges
previously held for lease.  The barges were operated under an agreement which
provided for management of the barges.  The barges were generally used for
movement of commodities on the inland waterway system, primarily the
Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.

     Substantially all equipment leased by TILC was purchased from the
Registrant at prices comparable to the prices for equipment sold by the
Registrant to third parties.  As of March 31, 1995, TILC had equipment on
lease or available for lease purchased from the Registrant at a cost of $431.0
million.  Generally, TILC purchases the equipment to be leased only after a
lessee has committed to lease such equipment.

     The volume of equipment purchased and leased by TILC depends upon a
number of factors, including the demand for equipment manufactured by the
Registrant, the cost and availability of funds to finance the purchase of
equipment, the Registrant's decision to solicit orders for the purchase or
lease of equipment and factors which may affect the decision of the
Registrant's customers as to whether to purchase or lease equipment.

     Although the Registrant is not contractually obligated to offer to TILC
equipment proposed to be leased by the Registrant's customers, it is the
Registrant's intention to effect all such leasing transactions through TILC.
Similarly, while TILC is not contractually obligated to purchase from the
Registrant any equipment proposed to be leased, TILC intends to purchase and
lease all equipment which the Registrant's customers desire to lease when the
lease rentals and other terms of the proposed lease are satisfactory to TILC,
subject to the availability and cost of funds to finance the acquisition of
the equipment.

     Marketing, Raw Materials, Employees and Competition.  As of March 31,
1995, the Registrant operated only in the continental United States.  On May
5, 1995, the Registrant acquired one hundred percent of the capital stock of
the holding company which owns Grupo TATSA S.A. de C.V.  Grupo TATSA is
headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico.  The Registrant sells substantially all
of its products through its own salesmen operating from offices in Montgomery,
Alabama; Elizabethtown and Paducah, Kentucky; Shreveport, Louisiana; Flint,
Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; Gulfport, Mississippi; Asheville, North
Carolina; Cincinnati and Girard, Ohio; Beaumont, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston and
Navasota, Texas; and Centerville, Utah.  Independent sales representatives are
also used to a limited extent.  The Registrant markets railcars, containers
and metal components throughout the United States.  Except in the case of weld
fittings, guardrail, and standard size LP gas containers, the Registrant's
products are ordinarily fabricated to the customer's specifications pursuant
to a purchase order.

     The principal materials used by the Registrant are steel plate,
structural steel shapes and steel forgings.  There are numerous domestic and
foreign sources of such steel and most other materials used by the Registrant.

     The Registrant currently has approximately 16,500 employees, of which
approximately 15,100 are production employees and 1,400 are administrative,
sales, supervisory and office employees.

     There are numerous companies located throughout the United States that
are engaged in the business of manufacturing various railcars and containers
of the types manufactured by the Registrant, and these industries are highly
competitive.  Companies manufacturing products which compete with the
Registrant's construction products consist of numerous other structural
fabricators and ready-mix concrete producers, most of which are smaller than
the Registrant.  Small shipyards located on inland waterways and medium to
large size shipyards located on or near ports on navigable waterways produce
marine products which compete with those manufactured by the Registrant.  Both
domestic and foreign manufacturers of metal components, some of which are
larger than the Registrant, compete with the Registrant.  A number of
well-established companies actively compete with TILC in the business of
owning and leasing railcars, as well as banks, investment partnerships and
other financial and commercial institutions.

     Recent Developments.  Information concerning the Registrant's business
acquisitions are included in the Registrant's 1995 Annual Report to
Stockholders under the heading "Business Acquisitions," (pages 23 through 24)
and such section is incorporated herein by reference.

     Other Matters.  The Registrant is not materially affected by federal,
state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment.  To date, the Registrant has not suffered any
material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to
operate its various plant facilities or its transportation vehicles.  Future
limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products
(particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles)
could have an adverse effect upon the Registrant's ability to conduct its
business.  The likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration, and its
ultimate effect on the Registrant's operations, cannot be reasonably predicted
at this time.

Item 2. Properties.

     The Registrant's principal executive offices are located in a ten story
office building containing approximately 107,000 sq. ft. and a connected
adjacent building containing approximately 66,000 sq. ft., each owned by the
Registrant, in Dallas, Texas.  The following table sets forth certain salient
facts with respect to each of the operating plant properties owned and/or
leased by the Registrant at March 31, 1995:

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS

It is with pleasure and pride that I report on the status of our Company.
It has been a good year for Trinity.  It was a year of record revenues and
net income, of record production and orders on hand, of growth and
expansion, and of acquisitions and new technology.  It has been a year of
healthy challenges - those caused by growth and competition.  The Annual
Report to Stockholders speaks for itself.  Our employees have met
challenges, and Trinity is prospering.

In the twelve month period ended March 31, 1995, revenues were $2.3
billion, and the Company recorded net income of $89.1, or $2.20 per share.
For the twelve months of the prior fiscal year, income before cumulative
effect of change in accounting for income taxes of $68.3 million, or $1.69
per share, was recorded on revenues of $1.8 billion.  Net income was $76.2
million, or $1.89 per share.  In the three months ended March 31, 1995,
revenues totalled $638.2 million.  Net income of $25.7 million, or $0.63
per share, was recorded.  In the prior year's comparable quarter, net
income of $15.2 million, or $0.38 per share, was recorded on revenues of
$452.7 million.

Trinity is becoming increasingly global in many aspects of its business.
With increased production, Trinity must now look internationally for many
of the materials and component parts needed for manufacture and
maintenance.  As free trade laws like NAFTA are passed, it is both an
encouragement and a necessity to keep a watchful eye on international
competition.  Many challenges and opportunities originate from these
rapidly changing political and economic phenomenon.

Subsequent to the close of fiscal 1995, one such opportunity for
international expansion occurred.  Trinity seized this opportunity and
increased its presence in Mexico.  On May 5, 1995, Trinity acquired the
holding company for Grupo Tatsa, headquartered in Mexico City.  Grupo Tatsa
manufactures and distributes a wide variety of fabricated steel products,
including products for the storage and transportation of liquefied
petroleum products marketed in Mexico and other Latin American countries.
The acquisition of Grupo Tatsa should add to Trinity's flexibility and cost
efficiency as these operations are integrated into the company's
operations.

Increased opportunities are coupled with increased competition and this,
generally, means greater demand for the materials, components and supplies
needed to build the Company's products.  Frequently, seeking materials,
component parts, and supplies intenationally may drive up costs and extend
delivery times.  These business conditions call for attentive effort,
creativity and salesmanship on the part of our employees.  We have been
successful in meeting these challenges and are proud of our employees
abilities.

We continually evaluate our facilities and our products to determine their
cost-effectiveness and relevance to future business operations.  During the
past year, we have disposed of some facilities and acquired others in this
continuing effort to maximize and efficiently utilize our resources.  We
continue our philosophy of expansion through a balance of internal growth
and strategic acquisitions.  Internal review and evaluation is a normal
part of the acquisition and expansion process.  During the last quarter of
the fiscal year, a review and evaluation was concluded of certain assets
used by the Company in its business operations.  Certain real property was
determined to be in excess of that required for future business operations.
While the ultimate values for these assets on sale will not be known until
the actual sale, management determined that a valuation provision was
appropriate.  A valuation reserve was established for approximately eight
million dollars.

Our emphasis on quality and safety is keeping pace with our growth.  We
have developed a bilingual, computer-assisted training program for workers,
designed to teach and upgrade skills and provide safety training on an
ongoing basis.  This advanced program is being tested in our Railcars
segment and will soon be employed throughout the company.

We continue to seek and acquire new technology that provides more
consistent quality and efficiency in our operations.  We are using robotics
more frequently in areas where consistency and safety are critical.

Over the past year, Trinity has been recognized with a number of awards
from major companies, reconfirming our efforts to provide quality products
and outstanding service at competitive prices.  We strive to serve our
customers, we also strive to be responsible corporate citizens, remaining
ever mindful of our environment and the well-being of the world around us.

It appears that both the railcar and marine replacement cycles are becoming
more orderly.  We have experienced increased demand in both our Railcars
and Marine Products segments and are realizing benefits of Trinity's
readiness to replace aging fleets.  The Railcars segment finished fiscal
1995 with record orders on hand and increased its unit production rate in
the fourth quarter by more than twenty percent compared to the previous
quarter.

In addition to replacement demand, large U.S. grain crops and demand for
grain by developing countries are improving the outlook for barges in the
Marine Products segment. While barges are important marine products,
specialty boats like those used for resort recreation, oceanographic
vessels, and high speed patrol boats and off-shore work boats add to the
diversity of our Marine Products segment.  From all indications, we are on
the verge of a favorable across-the-board shipbuilding cycle.

Our Construction Products segment has expanded over the past year.  There
appear to be more signs of vitality in construction work than we have seen
in almost a decade.  We have expanded our highway guardrail and road
barrier products and substantially increased our concrete and aggregate
business.  Trinity recently purchased certain Texas ready-mix concrete
equipment, facilities and aggregate mining assets from LaFarge Corporation.
This purchase moves the Transit Mix business into geographical areas in
Texas and Louisiana not served by previous operations.  We are anticipating
additional growth in these markets.

Looking forward, it is anticipated that the Company will continue its
expansion and upward trend.  We appreciate your continued support, the
dedication of our loyal employees, and the support of our customers and
suppliers.

Railcars

          Trinity's Railcars segment manufactures a broad line of freight and
tank railcars and related railcar parts and components.  Railcars are used to
transport various bulk products and commodities including coal, grain,
cement, plastic raw materials, petroleum products, chemicals, intermodal
containers (products bundled in shipping containers designed to fit on
railcars and other modes of transportation to minimize shipping costs),
lumber and similar products.

          Trinity markets railcars principally to customers in North America
including railroads, private shippers (major corporations and associations
who chose to own their own equipment for movement of their commodities and
products), and leasing companies.  The Company's leadership role in the
railcar industry is also creating opportunities internationally.

          After more than a decade of consolidation of railcar types, railcar
quantities, railroad companies and railroad operating systems, it appears
that the replacement cycle for many types of railcars is fully in progress.
The Company is enjoying record levels of railcar orders for a wide variety of
types and models.  These orders are an expression of customer confidence in
Trinity's products and services.

          Trinity is mindful of its leadership in the railcar industry and has
instituted and developed many internal and external customer satisfaction and
quality assurance programs.  Trinity's goal of providing exceptional value to
customers in its products and services is the heart of the Railcars segment
business philosophy. Focus on the customer's requirements and how to serve
those needs is the principal business strategy.

          The Railcars segment reported an increase in operating profit of 66.4%
on a 58.4% increase in revenues for fiscal 1995.  Revenues were $1.16 billion
and operating profit was $88.5 million for the year ended March 31, 1995.  In
the prior fiscal year, revenues of $730.6 million and operating profit of
$53.2 million were reported.

Marine Products

          Trinity's Marine Products segment is a leading producer of small-to-
medium sized vessels for commercial and military customers in domestic and
international markets and of inland waterway and ocean-going barges. Examples
of some of the vessels built by the Company are crew boats (generally, to
transport operational personnel to marine work locations), tug boats, supply
boats, ferries, inland water hopper and tank barges, ocean- going
"double-skin" tanker barges, tow boats, push boats, fishing boats, excursion
boats, riverboat casinos, fire and rescue boats and luxury yachts. Examples of
military and government owned vessels include oceanographic research ships,
ocean surveillance ships, hydrographic vessels, and the United States Special
Operations Command next generation Mark V Pegasus high speed craft for
insertion and extraction of special operations forces.

          In the Company's continuing effort to expand both the product and
customer base, the Company entered into agreements with the United States
Maritime Administration (commonly referred to as MARAD) for development of
several new products including a new high speed, low wake catamaran passenger
ferry, a large passenger / vehicle ferry, a container / bulk carrier and a
multi-purpose cargo ship.  As international economic conditions improve, these
types of projects may develop new markets.  The Company has focused its
resources on expansion and upgrading ship repair, conversion, cleaning and gas
freeing (cleaning of vessels and barges) capabilities, as well as improvements
to barge construction and repair facility.

          The Marine Products segment revenues were $369.7 million and
operating profit was $30.3 million for the year ended March 31, 1995.  In the
prior fiscal year, revenues of $360.7 million and operating profit of $28.9
million were reported.

Construction Products

          Trinity's Construction Products segment fabricates a broad line of
products for supply to governmental, commercial, industrial and utility
customers.  Major product lines include highway guardrail, with a full line of
special highway safety products, structural components for highway and
railroad bridges, heavy weldments and truck bodies for mining and construction
equipment, custom roll-formed shapes for railcalrs, trailers, and other uses,
passenger loading bridges and conveyor systems for airports and ready-mix
concrete and aggregates. Primary markets are federal and state governments as
well as Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other countries. During the fiscal
year, Trinity expanded further in the ready-mix concrete and aggregates
product line through acquisitions of additional facilities in Texas and
Louisiana (see Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).  Demand remains high for these products.

          Trinity's Construction Products segment is in a favorable position as
attention is focused on the repair and upgrading of the nations bridges and
highways.  Trinity is prepared to meet the demand expected for the products
offered by the Construction Products segment.

          The Construction Products segment revenues were $355.5 million and
operating profit was $35.6 million for the year ended March 31, 1995.  In the
prior fiscal year, revenues of $333.1 million and operating profit of $35.6
million were reported.


Containers


          Trinity's Containers segment manufactures a variety of vessels. The
Company fabricates containers ranging in size from as small as 50 gallons to
as large as 500,000 gallons; extremely large, heavy pressure vessels and
other heavy welded products; and heat transfer equipment.

          Pressure and nonpressure containers built to Department of
Transportation and American Society of Mechanical Engineers' standards are
used for the transportation and storage of liquefied petroleum gases, food
and beverage products, and other liquid and dry products.  Products range
from domestic and storage tanks to truck tank and transport barrels.  Vessels
are generally constructed of carbon steel but may be constructed of other
materials such as  alloy, stainless steel, and aluminum.  Products include
pressure vessels, refinery and chemical reactors, industrial silencers, heat
recovery systems, desalinators, and  evaporators.  Heat transfer equipment is
built to an exact set of design standards and configurations provided by the
customer.  Customers include residential, governmental, commercial and an
array of industrial users, specifically, petrochemical, food processing and
utility industries.

          The Containers segment's revenues were $169.7 million and operating
profit was $9.7 million for the year ended March 31, 1995.  In the prior
fiscal year, revenues of $155.6 million and operating profit of $9.8 million
were reported.

Metal Components

          Trinity's Metal Components segment manufactures and markets Hackney
and Flo-Bend brands of fittings and flanges and container heads.  Weld fittings
include full and reducing outlet tees, elbows, return bends, concentric and
eccentric reducers, caps, and forged flanges of all types. Flanges and
fittings are manufactured from carbon steel, stainless steel, chrome-moly and
many other kinds of steel.

          Container heads are the rounded ends on containers.  Many container
heads manufactured by Trinity are large pressed metal components used in the
further manufacture of finished custom containers used by the chemical and
petroleum industries.  The manufacture of container heads requires a
substantial investment in machinery and equipment.  Trinity supplies
fabricators with container heads which they are unable to manufacture
themselves.  Container heads are manufactured in various shapes and may be
pressure or nonpressure rated depending on the specifications of the
customer.

          The metal components segment is comprised of seven manufacturing
locations, and Trinity has expanded this business segment through strategic
acquisition of certain assets of Flo-Bend, Inc. (see Business Acquisitions in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

          The Metal Components segment revenues were $105.5 million and
operating profit was $14.9 million for the year ended March 31, 1995.  In the
prior fiscal year, revenues of $99.7 million and operating profit of $11.7
million were reported.

Leasing

          With Trinity's wholly-owned leasing subsidiary, Trinity Industries
Leasing Company, the Company can offer customers an alternative to purchasing
railcars, thereby reaching a broader base of customers.  The options provided
by leasing allows customers to retain working capital and reduce
administrative expenses.  Leasing customers also receive the benefit of
Trinity's exceptional maintenance, testing and repair facilities.

          Leasing provides Trinity with a steady flow of income, tax deferrals,
and equity in long-life assets.

          The Leasing segment revenues were $156.9 million and operating profit
was $23.6 million for the year ended March 31, 1995.  In the prior fiscal
year revenues of $104.6 million and operating profit of $15.3 million were
reported.  Because of the consolidation of Trinity Industries Leasing Company
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 94 (See Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies and Leasing notes in Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements), intercompany interest income aggregating $8.1 million
is eliminated from Trinity's consolidated financial statements.

Mexico Expansion

          On May 5, 1995, Trinity acquired one hundred percent of the capital
stock of the holding company which owns Grupo TATSA S. A. de C. V. in
exchange for shares of Trinity common stock.

          Grupo TATSA, headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico, manufactures and
distributes a wide variety of fabricated steel products including containers
(primarily for the storage or transportation of liquefied petroleum
products), rail tankcar barrels, and heads which are used within Grupo TATSA
as well as sold to other manufacturers from its manufacturing facilities in
Mexico City, Monclova, and Huehuetoca, Mexico.  Grupo TATSA serves the
Mexican market and other Latin American countries as well as exporting to the
United States.

          Grupo TATSA has a long standing reputation for quality and service in
residential and industrial products.  Grupo TATSA was established during the
1950's.  The acquisition of Grupo TATSA should add to Trinity's flexibility
and cost efficiency as these operations are integrated into the Company's
operations.

Management Discussion of Operations and Financial Condition

Operations


Record revenues of $2.3 billion were recorded for the fiscal year ended March
31, 1995, an increase of $530.0 million compared to fiscal 1994.   The Company
experienced increases in demand in all six major business segments, with the
Railcars segment contributing the most significant increase.  Railcars, the
Company's largest segment, enjoyed the benefit of a better market for its
railcars and railcar related products.

The Construction Products segment's revenues continue to be favorably affected
by additional business acquisitions of certain concrete operations. (See
Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  The
Marine Products, Containers and Metal Components segments experienced
expanding markets. Total operating profit increased from $116.6 million in
fiscal 1994 to $157.5 million in fiscal 1995 due primarily to higher operating
operating profit recorded in the Railcars, Marine Products, Metal Components
and Leasing segments, partially offset by slightly lower operating profit
recorded in the Containers segment. A valuation reserve was established for
approximately $8.0 million for certain real property which was determined to
be in excess of that required for future business operations.

Expanding on a trend which began in fiscal 1993, production and deliveries in
the Railcars segment again increased in fiscal 1995. Operating profit as a
percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 1995 compared to the previous
fiscal year as greater efficiencies were achieved as a result of ongoing
participation in quality assurance programs established in previous years.
Trinity continues to be active in the railcar market with a variety of car
types including coal, grain, plastic pellet, cement, intermodal and a variety
of tank railcars.  Increased revenues and operating profit in fiscal 1995 are
primarily the result of replacement demand and fundamental economic expansion
of railroad traffic.   This demand is expected to continue as railcars on
order at the end of the fiscal year exceeded those of the prior fiscal year.
The Company anticipates higher levels of production for the coming fiscal year.

In the Marine Products segment, demand for the segment's products, marine
vessels and barges, continues to increase. The inland river hopper barge
product line is generally benefitted by large grain crops.  Orders on hand for
this segment are increasing as the replacement market grows. The Marine
Products segment is further positioning itself for future growth and
contribution to operating profit through strategic business acquisitions. (See
Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The Construction Products segment has expanded its highway guardrail and road
barrier products and expanded the concrete and aggregate business.
Acquisitions completed in fiscal 1995 were made at various times during the
year.  The inclusion of a full year of these acquisitions in future years is
expected to show favorable results in year to year comparisons.

Continuing  improvement in the chemical and petroleum industries related to
the Clean Air Act and new housing starts is leading to improvement in the
Containers segment, particularly the market for LPG tanks.  Competitive
markets for the Company's large pressure vessels are partially offsetting
segment operating profit.  Industry demand for products in the Metal
Components segment has risen in the current fiscal year. General improvement
in the economy has generated some expansion in the industries served by this
segment. Leasing segment's operating profit was higher in fiscal 1995 due
primarily to additions of new freight and tank railcars to the fleet, and the
sale of selected car types coupled with the divestiture of
its inventory of river hopper barges previously held for lease.

Record revenues of $1.78 billion were recorded by the Company for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1994, an increase of $244.9 million compared to fiscal
1993.   Significant increases in demand in the Railcars, Construction
Products, Containers, and Leasing segments lead to the record year.  Revenues
recorded by the Metal Components segment remained comparable to the previous
fiscal year.  Revenues recorded declined when compared to Marine Products
previous fiscal year's record revenues.  Demand for railcars has increased
causing upward adjustments to production rates to accommodate increases in
business.  The Construction Products segment's revenues were favorably
affected by additional business acquisitions of certain concrete operations.
(See Business Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).  The Containers and Metal Components segments experienced
expanding markets.  Total operating profit increased from $74.6 million in
fiscal 1993 to $116.6 million in fiscal 1994 due primarily to higher operating
profit recorded in the Railcars, Construction Products, and Leasing segments,
partially offset by slightly lower operating profit recorded in the Marine
Products, Containers and Metal Components segments.

Continuing a trend which accelerated in fiscal 1993, production and deliveries
in the Railcars segment  increased in fiscal 1994. Operating profit as a
percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 1994 compared to the previous
fiscal year as greater efficiencies were achieved as a result of ongoing
participation in quality assurance programs established in previous years.
Increased revenues and operating profit in fiscal 1994 were primarily the
result of expanded demand attributed to a continuing railcar replacement
cycle, demand for new types of railcars as the transporting of certain
commodities across the country shifted from over-the-road trucking to rail, a
net increase in the amount of goods and products that are shipped by rail, and
the general improvement in the economy.  In the Marine Products segment,
demand for the segment's products, marine vessels and barges, continued to be
strong and broad based.   The decline in fiscal year 1994 results compared to
results from the previous fiscal year was due primarily to the record revenues
and operating profit recorded in the previous fiscal year from the completion
of a multi-vessel, quick production contract.  The replacement market for
vessels and barges lead to expanded production. The Marine Products segment
further positioned itself for future growth and contribution to operating
profit through strategic business acquisitions. (See Business Acquisitions in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Construction Products segment's revenues and operating profit increased in
fiscal 1994 compared to the previous fiscal year.  These results signify the
effect of the decision to emphasize infrastructure products, including highway
guardrail and safety barriers, and construction materials and aggregates.
Continued expansion of the ready mix concrete markets helped to boost the
segment's revenues and operating profit.  General improvement in the chemical
and petroleum industries and new housing starts lead to improvement in the
Containers segment, particularly the market for LPG tanks.  Competitive
markets for the Company's large pressure vessels  partially offset segment
operating profit.  Industry demand for products in the Metal Components
segment rose in fiscal year 1994.  General improvement in the economy
generated some expansion in the industries served by this segment.  Leasing
segment's operating profit was higher in fiscal 1994 due primarily to
additions of new freight and tank railcars to the fleet, sales of selected car
types previously for lease, and a slight reduction in overall repair and
maintenance expenses in the current fiscal year.

Selling, engineering and administrative expenses increased to $104.5 million
in fiscal 1995 from $94.2 million in fiscal 1994 due principally  to
additional personnel expenses from fiscal 1995 business acquisitions and
increased Railcars segment business.   Selling, engineering and administrative
expenses were up slightly in fiscal 1994 compared to fiscal 1993. Increases
were due to additional personnel from fiscal 1994 business acquisitions and
increased Railcars segment business, offset somewhat by the absence of
expenses present in the prior fiscal year related to the business acquisition
of Syro.

Interest expense of the Leasing Subsidiary decreased by $2.6
million in fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994 due primarily to the reduction
of the equipment trust series long-term debt through scheduled debt payments
and disposition of certain assets. Interest expense of Leasing subsidiary
decreased by $4.4 million in fiscal 1994 compared to fiscal 1993 due primarily
to the conversion of Leasing Subsidiary debt to common stock of the Company in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 (see Long-term Debt in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Retirement plans expense increased to $12.1 million in fiscal 1995 from $9.2
million in fiscal 1994.  The increase is due primarily to increases in
personnel in fiscal 1995 business acquisitions.  Retirement plans expense
decreased to $9.2 million in fiscal 1994 from $10.2 million in fiscal 1993.
The decrease is due primarily to the reduction of the actuarial accrual
related to a certain supplemental retirement benefit agreement, offset by
increases in personnel due to fiscal 1994 business acquisitions.

Net interest expense of $11.4 million in fiscal 1995 increased as compared to
$4.0 million in fiscal 1994 primarily due to the increase in the usage of
short-term debt for capital expenditures and to finance business
acquisitions.  Net interest expense of $4.0 million in fiscal 1994 increased
compared to $3.3 million in fiscal 1993 primarily due to the increase in the
use of short-term debt to finance business acquisitions, offset by a decline
in long- term debt from regularly scheduled principal payments.

The provision for income taxes in fiscal 1995 expressed as a percent of income
before income taxes is a 39.6 percent rate as compared to a 40.2 percent rate
in fiscal 1994 and a 37.6 percent rate in fiscal 1993.  The increase between
fiscal 1994 and 1993 is due principally to the increase in the statutory
federal income tax rate and the increase in the provision for state income
taxes.

In February, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The Company was required to adopt SFAS
No. 109 in fiscal 1994 and change from the deferred to the liability method of
computing income tax.  The Company recognized the cumulative effect of the
change in method as of April 1, 1993 resulting in an increase to net income of
$7.9 million. (See Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements).


Liquidity and Financial Resources

During fiscal 1995, internally generated funds and short-term borrowing were
used to support capital expenditures and payments for business acquisitions.
Capital expenditures, excluding Leasing Subsidiary, for fiscal 1995 were $64.7
million.  Capital expenditures projected for fiscal 1996 are approximately
$51.4 million.  Payments for acquisitions in fiscal 1995, net of cash
acquired, totalled $63.7 million.  Future operating requirements are expected
to be financed principally with net cash flows from operations.  Internally
generated funds, short-term and long-term debt will continue to be used to
finance business acquisitions.  Additions to TILC's railcar fleet are
anticipated to be financed through internally generated funds, the issuance of
equipment trust certificates, or similar debt instruments.

The percentages of long-term debt and stockholders' equity to total
capital (long-term debt and stockholders' equity) of $884.1 million (of which
Leasing Subsidiary's long-term debt is $205.2 million) were 27.5 percent (of
which Leasing Subsidiary's long-term debt is 23.2 percent of total capital)
and 72.5 percent, respectively.


Inflation

Changes in price levels did not significantly affect the Company's operations
in fiscal 1995, 1994 or 1993.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  The financial statements of Trinity Industries, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries ("Trinity" or the "Company") include the accounts of all
significant majority-owned subsidiaries.   All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company accounts for its wholly-owned Leasing Subsidiary in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94,  "Consolidation of
All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,"  which  requires the consolidation of all
majority-owned subsidiaries, unless control is temporary or does not reside
with the majority owner.  The Company's financial statements include the
consolidation of the accounts of Trinity Industries Leasing Company
("TILC"). TILC is sometimes referred to as the "Leasing Company" or
"Leasing Subsidiary".

For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Financial instruments which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are
primarily cash investments and receivables.  The Company places its cash
investments in investment grade, short-term debt instruments and limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer.  Concentrations of
credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number
of customers in the Company's customer base, and their dispersion across
different industries and geographic areas.  The Company maintains an
allowance for losses based upon the expected collectibility of all
receivables.

For financial accounting, profits on long-term contracts are recorded on
the percentage-of-completion method.  Allocation of profits to various
periods is based on costs incurred, units delivered, or other appropriate
measures.  Provision is made for losses when they become known.

TILC enters into lease contracts with third parties with terms generally
ranging between one and fifteen years, wherein certain equipment
manufactured by Trinity is leased for a specified type of service over the
term of the contract.  TILC accounts for leases principally by the
operating method.

Inventories and investments are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Inventory cost is determined principally on the specific identification
method.  Market is replacement cost or net realizable value.

Depreciation and amortization are generally computed by the straight-line
method on the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The costs of ordinary
maintenance and repair are charged to expense, while renewals and major
replacements are capitalized.



Net income per common and common equivalent share are based on the weighted
average shares outstanding plus the assumed exercise of dilutive stock
options (less the number of treasury shares assumed to be purchased from
the proceeds using the average market price of Trinity's common stock).
For the years ended March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, there was no convertible
debt outstanding that would require the calculation of fully diluted
earnings per share.  In fiscal 1993, the convertible debt in the form of 8
percent convertible subordinated debentures and 6.75 percent convertible
debentures were converted.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to
conform to the current year presentation.

Segment Information

The Company manufactures and sells or leases a variety of metal products
consisting principally of (1) freight railcars, principally tank cars and
hopper cars ("Railcars"); (2) boats and barges for ocean and inland waterway
service ("Marine Products"); (3) construction products such as highway guard-
rail, beams, girders, and columns used in construction of highway and railway
bridges, power plants, mills, etc., passenger loading bridges and conveyor
systems, and ready mix concrete and aggregates ("Construction Products");
(4) pressure and non-pressure containers for the storage and transportation
of liquefied gases, other liquid, and dry products ("Containers"); (5) weld
fittings (tees, elbows, reducers, caps, flanges, etc.) used in pressure piping
systems and container heads (the ends of pressure and non-pressure containers)
for use internally and by other manufacturers of containers ("Metal

("Leasing").


Financial information for these segments is summarized in the following table.
The Company operates principally in the continental United States.  Interseg-
mental sales are shown at market prices.

notes receivable, land held for investment, and certain property, plant and
equipment.

Business Acquisitions

The Company made certain business acquisitions during fiscal 1995, 1994 and
1993.  All but one have been accounted for by the purchase method.  The
acquisition of Syro Steel Company ("Syro") in fiscal 1993 has been
accounted for by the pooling of interests method.  Except for Syro, the
operations of these companies have been included in the consolidated
financial statements from the effective dates of the acquisitions.

Stock Options

The Company has a Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Plan") which
provides that incentive or non-qualified stock options for a maximum of
1,500,000 shares of common stock may be granted to directors, officers and
key employees.  Incentive options may be granted over a period not to
exceed ten years at a price not less than fair market value on the date of
grant.  The Plan provides that, to the extent options granted under this
Plan or any prior stock option plan are forfeited, expire or cancelled,
they may again be granted pursuant to the provisions of this Plan.  The
Plan provides that if shares already owned by the optionee are surrendered
as full or partial payment of the exercise price of an option, a new option
(the "Reload Option") may be granted equal to the number of shares
surrendered.  The exercise price of Reload Options shall be the fair market
value on the effective date of the grant.

Stockholder's Rights Plan

The Company has adopted a Stockholder's Rights Plan.  Effective April 27,
1989, the Company paid a dividend distribution of one purchase right for each
outstanding share of the Company's $1.00 par value common stock.  Each right
entitles the stockholder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
one hundred and seventy-five dollars.  The rights are not exercisable or
detachable from the common stock until ten business days after a person
acquires beneficial ownership of twenty percent or more of the Company's
common stock or if a person or group commences a tender or exchange offer upon
consummation of which that person or group would beneficially own twenty
percent or more of the common stock.

If any person becomes a beneficial owner of twenty percent or more of the
Company's common stock other than pursuant to an offer, as defined, for all
shares determined by certain directors to be fair to the stockholders and
otherwise in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders
(other than by reason of share purchases by the Company), each right not owned
by that person or related parties enables its holder to purchase, at the
right's then current exercise price, shares of the Company's common stock
having a calculated value of twice the right's exercise price.

The rights, which are subject to adjustment, may be redeemed by the Company at
a price of one cent per right at any time prior to their expiration on April
27, 1999 or the point at which they become exercisable.

Long-term debt excluding the Leasing Subsidiary:

          The Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios, as
defined.   Principal payments due during the next five years are: 1996 - $7.1;
1997 - $0.8; 1998 - $0.2; 1999 - $0.1; and 2000 - $0.3.

Long-term debt of Leasing Subsidiary:

          The trustees of the equipment trusts have been assigned title to
railcars with a cost of $382.4 at March 31, 1995 for the   life of the
respective equipment trusts.  Leases relating to such railcars financed by
equipment trust certificates have been   assigned as collateral.  Trinity is
required to pay fees to TILC to maintain net earnings, as defined, at 150
percent of fixed   charges, as defined.  Pursuant to this agreement,  $0, $0,
and $1.4 have been paid by Trinity to TILC in fiscal 1995, 1994,   and 1993,
respectively.  Trinity is also required to pay to TILC the current tax benefit
which results from the inclusion of   TILC in Trinity's federal income tax
return.  These amounts are eliminated for consolidated financial presentation
of Trinity.

  TILC is required to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined.

  Principal payments due during the next five years are: 1996 - $29.5; 1997 -
$30.4; 1998 - $26.3; 1999 - $26.1; and 2000 -   $23.9.

The fair value of non-traded, fixed rate outstanding debt, estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis, approximates its carrying value.

In fiscal 1993, 8 percent convertible subordinated debentures and 6.75 percent
convertible debentures were converted.  Assuming this convertible debt had
converted as of April 1, 1992, supplementary earnings per share for fiscal
1993 would have been $1.24.

Income Taxes
(in millions except per share data)

Effective April 1, 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This Statement requires a
change from the deferred to the liability method of computing income taxes.
As permitted by Statement No. 109, the Company has elected not to restate the
financial statements of any prior period.  The cumulative effect of applying
the change in accounting method is a decrease in the Company's deferred tax
liability and a nonrecurring credit of $7.9 or $0.20 per share.

The provision for federal income taxes is determined on a consolidated return
basis.  The Company and the Leasing Subsidiary file a consolidated federal
income tax return.  The significant components of the provision (benefit) for
income taxes follow to the right:

Deferred income tax was provided in the financial statements for timing
differences between financial and taxable income. Components of the deferred
provision (benefit) for income taxes computed at the statutory rate for fiscal
1993 follow:

                                                 Year Ended

The provision for income taxes in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 results in
effective tax rates different than the statutory rates.  The
reconciliation between the effective and statutory rates follows:

                                          Year Ended March 31
                                 1995          1994          1993

Statutory rate..............     35.0%         35.0%         34.0%
State taxes.................      4.0           2.7           2.0

Effective tax rate..........     39.6%         40.2%         37.6%

In fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 income taxes of $55.9, $44.7 and $22.8,
respectively, were paid.



Employee Benefit Plans
(in millions)

Pension plans are in effect which provide income and death benefits for
eligible employees.  The Company's policy is to fund retirement costs accrued
to the extent such amounts are deductible for income tax purposes.  Plan
assets include cash, short-term debt securities, and other investments.
Benefits are based on years of credited service and compensation.

Net periodic pension expense for fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993 included the
following components:

The Company has a contributory profit sharing plan for employees of the
Company and certain affiliates. Under the plan, eligible employees are allowed
to make voluntary pre-tax contributions.  The Company's contribution to this
plan, as defined, is based on consolidated earnings and dividends.

Contingencies

In May, 1994, a jury sitting in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York returned a verdict against the company in an 
action brought against Mosher by Morse-Diesel, Inc. for damages allegedly 
caused in the construction of the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square, New 
York City, New York. Judgement against Trinity was entered in February, 1995 
in the amount of approximately sixty million dollars including interest
accrued to that date.  Appeal of the jury verdict is pending before the 
Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Trinity has been advised by legal counsel 
that it has substantial defenses and remedies available, and it is pursuing 
all available avenues in the post-trial and appellate review process.

Trinity has not been involved in the fabrication of structural steel for
multi-story buildings since 1989.

While the ultimate liability in this matter is difficult to assess, it is
management's belief that the final outcome is not reasonably likely to have a
material adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

The Company is involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to its
business.  In the opinion of management, these claims and suits in the
aggregate will not have a material adverse affect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Trinity Industries, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Trinity Industries, Inc. as of March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period
ended March 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Trinity Industries, Inc. at March 31, 1995
and 1994, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March
31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                      Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
Trinity Industries, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statements of financial
condition of the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of Trinity
Industries, Inc. and Certain Affiliates (the "Plan") as of March
31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of income and
changes in plan equity for each of the three years in the period
ended March 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition
of the Plan at March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the income and
changes in plan equity for each of the three years in the period
ended March 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The accompanying
supplemental schedules of assets held for investment and
reportable transactions are presented for purposes of complying
with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for
Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, and are not a required part of the basic
financial statements.  The Fund Information in the statements of
financial condition and the statements of income and changes in
plan equity is presented for purposes of additional analysis
rather than to present the financial condition and income and
changes in plan equity of each fund.  The supplemental schedules
and Fund Information have been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in our audits of the financial statements and,
in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

                     Profit Sharing Plan for Employees
             of Trinity Industries, Inc. and Certain Affiliates
                       Notes to Financial Statements 
                               March 31, 1995



1.  Description of the Plan  

    General - The Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of Trinity
Industries, Inc. and Certain Affiliates (the "Plan") was adopted by
the Board of Directors of Trinity Industries, Inc. (the "Board") on
December 11, 1986 and became effective January 1, 1987, for
eligible employees of Trinity Industries, Inc. and Certain
Affiliates (the "Employer").  The Plan was amended and restated
effective April 1, 1994.  The Plan is a defined contribution plan
designed to comply with the provisions of Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  The following is
a brief description of the Plan.  Participants should refer to the
Plan document for complete information regarding the Plan.  The
Plan's fiscal year end is March 31.

    Participation - Each employee is eligible to contribute to the
Plan on the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of
service with the Company and must meet the following requirements:

                 Must be classified as a full-time, part-time, or temporary
                 employee of Trinity Industries, Inc.; and

                 Must be in a unit of employees who are designated as     
                      eligible to participate in the Plan; and

                 Must not be included in a unit of employees covered by a   
            collective bargaining agreement unless benefits under this
                 Plan were included in an agreement as a result of good   
                      faith bargaining.

            Eligible employees automatically become participants and must
indicate on the form or forms provided by the Committee whether or
not they want to make contributions to the plan.  If they elect to
contribute, they will authorize the Employer to make payroll
deductions for contributions to the Plan.

    Contributions - Each Plan participant agrees to contribute not
less than two percent nor more than ten percent of their
compensation in one percent increments as designated by the
participant.  A participant's salary reduction may not exceed
$9,240 per calendar year ended 1995 and 1994.  A salary reduction
and contribution agreement must be entered into by each employee as
the employee begins participation in the Plan and may be amended by
such employee each quarter.


    Employer matching contribution shall be made if Company
earnings are at least $0.33 per share of common stock and
sufficient to pay dividends to stockholders ($0.68, $0.64 and $0.53 
per share for the years ended March 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively).  Dividends per share have been adjusted for the
three-for-two stock split distributed on August 31, 1993.  If the
Employer matching contribution is made, then each participant with
at least five years of service, shall receive an amount equal to 50
percent of that portion of such participant's employee contribution
which does not exceed six percent of such participant's total
compensation for the year.  If the Employer matching contribution
is made, then each participant with less than five years of service
shall receive an amount equal to 25 percent of that portion of such
participant's employee contribution which does not exceed six
percent of such participant's total compensation for the year.  

    Employer contributions are net of forfeitures, as defined.
Employer contributions for a given plan year shall be deposited in
the Profit Sharing Trust for Employees of Trinity Industries, Inc.
and Certain Affiliates (the "Trust Fund") as defined below, no
later than the date on which the Employer files its Federal income
tax return for such year. 

    The Employer and Texas Commerce Bank - Dallas  (the "Trustee"),
have entered into a Trust Agreement under which the latter acts as
Trustee under the Plan.  Texas Commerce Bank - Dallas is the
successsor Trustee to First City Bank of Dallas, N.A. pursuant to
the acquisition by Texas Commerce Bank - Dallas of the assets and
certain liabilities of the former First City Bank of Dallas, N.A.  

    In its capacity as Trustee, Texas Commerce Bank - Dallas
invests the employee contributions and Employer contributions in
the following investment options (hereafter collectively referred
to as the "Trust Fund"): 


              (a) Trinity Stock Investment Account ("Stock Account") holds
              shares of Employer common stock purchased on behalf of the
              participants.  Idle cash is invested in interest-bearing
              accounts until such time as it can be utilized to purchase
              Employer common stock. 

              (b) Guaranteed Investment Contract Investment Account (the
              "Guaranteed Investment Account") invests in guaranteed
              investment contracts issued by an insurance company selected
              annually by the Committee.  At March 31, 1995, the guaranteed
              investment contracts had guaranteed annual rates of return of
              8.80% (GAC 4854), 9.06% (GAC 5027), 6.24% (GAC 627-05387),
              8.31% (GAC 7614) and 5.15% (GAC 7219).



              (c) Putnam Mutual Funds Investment Accounts (the "Putnam
              Mutual Funds") invests in three mutual funds selected by the
              Committee.   At March 31, 1995, the funds are U.S. Government
              Income Trust, Growth and Income, and Voyager.

    Participants may elect the extent to which assets are invested
in the options described above in increments of 10 percent or 25
percent.  At March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the majority of
participants had elected to participate in the guaranteed
investment contracts.

    Benefits - Distribution of a participant's account balance is
payable upon retirement at or after age 65, total disability,
death, or termination of employment.  Distribution is equal to the
salary reduction contribution and related earnings plus the vested
portion of the Employer contribution and related earnings.

    Withdrawal of up to 100 percent of the employee contribution
can be made only to meet "immediate and heavy financial needs"
(medical care, college tuition, the purchase of a principal
residence, or to prevent the foreclosure on a principal residence)
as long as the funds are not available for such needs from other
sources.  No withdrawal can be made against the earnings on the
employee contributions or against the Employer contribution and
related earnings. These restrictions no longer apply when the
participant reaches age 59 1/2.

     Loans for "immediate and heavy financial needs" may be made
for a minimum of $1,000 up to a maximum of $50,000, not to exceed
50 percent of the Employee contribution and related earnings and
not to exceed 50 percent of the vested portion of the Employer
contribution and related earnings.  Loans are subject to rules and
regulations established by the Plan Administrator, as defined in
the Plan.

    Vesting - The Employer contribution and related earnings
(losses) vest to participants, depending upon the number of years
of vesting service, as defined, completed by such participant as
follows:
                Years of Service          Percentage Vested
           Less than 1                        0
           1 but less than 2                 20
           2 but less than 3                 40
           3 but less than 4                 60
           4 but less than 5                 80
           5 or more                        100

    Participants are 100 percent vested in their Employer
contribution and allocated portion of related earnings (losses)
upon their attainment of age 65 and are always 100 percent vested
in their employee contribution and related earnings (losses) on
such contribution. 

    Administration of the Plan - The Plan is administered by a
Profit Sharing Committee (the "Committee") consisting of at least
three persons who are appointed by the Board.  The members of the
Committee serve at the pleasure of the Board, and any committee
member who is an employee of the Employer shall not receive
compensation for his services. 

    A separate account is maintained for each participant.  The
Plan provides that account balances for participants are adjusted
periodically as follows: 

              (a) Employee contributions are generally allocated on a
              quarterly basis; 

     
              (b) Participant's share of the Employer contribution shall be
              allocated to the participant's account as of a date no later
              than the last day of the Plan year; 


              (c) Earnings and appreciation or depreciation of investment
              assets of the Trust Fund for each calendar quarter shall be
              allocated to the accounts of participants, former
              participants and beneficiaries who had unpaid balances in
              their accounts on the last day of such calendar quarter in
              proportion to the balances in such accounts at the beginning
              of the calendar quarter. 

    Upon request, distributions shall be made no earlier than the
later of the last day of the calendar quarter in which entitlement
occurs or the date on which the Committee determines the final
balances. Distributions from the Stock Account shall be made in
cash unless otherwise designated by the participant. 


    Income tax status - The Plan has received a determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service dated November 4, 1994
stating that the Plan is a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") and that the Trust
is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. 
The Committee is not aware of any course of action or series of
events that have occurred that might adversely affect the plan's
qualified status.

    Employee contributions and Employer contributions are not
included in the participant's federal taxable income in the year
such contributions are made.  A participant shall not be subject to
federal income taxes with respect to participation in the Plan
until the amounts are withdrawn or distributed. 




    Amendment or termination of the Plan -   The Employer may amend
the Plan at any time.  However, no amendment, unless made to secure
approval of the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental
agency, may operate retroactively to reduce or divest the then
vested interest in the Plan of any participant, former participant
or beneficiary, or to reduce or divest any benefit payable under
the Plan unless all participants, former participants and
beneficiaries then having vested interests or benefit payments
affected thereby consent to such amendment.

    The Employer may terminate the Plan at any time.  Upon complete
or partial termination, the accounts of all participants affected
thereby shall become 100 percent vested, and the Committee shall
direct the Trustee to distribute the assets in the Trust Fund,
after receipt of any required approval by the Internal Revenue
Service and payment of any expenses properly chargeable thereto, to
participants, former participants, and beneficiaries in proportion
to their respective account balances. 


2.  Significant Accounting Policies  


    Investments and investment income - Investments in the common
stock of the Employer and the Putnam Mutual Funds are valued at the
last reported sales price on the last business day of the Plan year
as reported on a national securities exchange.  The investments in
guaranteed investment contracts are valued at cost which
approximates market value. 

   Security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. The
statement of income and changes in Plan equity include net
unrealized appreciation or depreciation in market value on
investments.  The Plan's financial statements are prepared on an
accrual basis.
  
       Realized gains and losses - Realized gains and losses have been      
    calculated using historical cost (first in, first out). 
 
       Prior year financial statements have been restated in order to       
    comply with the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position 92-6      
    "Accounting and Reporting by Health and Welfare Benefit Plans."         
    Amounts previously reported as benefits payable have been included in   
    Plan equity and the distributed amounts have been adjusted accordingly.
