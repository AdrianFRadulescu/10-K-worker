ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

GENERAL

          Triton Energy Corporation is an international oil and gas
exploration  company  primarily  engaged in exploration and production through
subsidiaries and affiliates. The Company's principal properties and operations
are  located  in  Colombia and Malaysia-Thailand. The Company also has oil and
gas  interests  in other Latin American and Asian countries, Europe, Australia
and North America.

          Triton was incorporated in Texas in 1962 and reincorporated in
Delaware  in  1995.   The Company's principal executive offices are located at
6688 North Central Expressway, Suite 1400, Dallas, Texas 75206, and its
telephone  number is 214/691-5200.  The terms "Company" and "Triton" when used
herein mean Triton Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries and other
affiliates through which Triton conducts its business, unless the context
otherwise implies.

            The Company has called a special meeting of its stockholders to be
held  on  March  25,  1996 at which the stockholders will vote on the proposed
reorganization of the Company (the "Reorganization").  Pursuant to the
Reorganization, Triton Energy Limited ("Triton Cayman"), a newly formed Cayman
Islands company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, would become the
parent holding company of Triton through the merger of a wholly owned
subsidiary  of Triton Cayman with and into the Company.  If the Reorganization
is  consummated,  the  Company  will become a subsidiary of Triton Cayman, and
Triton  Cayman  will  continue to conduct the businesses (through subsidiaries
and  affiliates)  in which the Company is now engaged.  The Company and Triton
Cayman have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Proxy
Statement/Joint Prospectus dated as of February 23, 1996 relating to the
special meeting and the securities to be issued if the Reorganization is
consummated.  Subsequent to the Reorganization, the Company intends to
transfer  substantially  all of its businesses or subsidiaries located outside
the United States, other than the Company's interests in the Cusiana and
Cupiagua fields, and interests in Argentina, to Triton Cayman.  See note 22 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Malaysia-Thailand, where activities are, or have been, conducted by the
Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, Triton Oil Company of Thailand and Triton
Oil  Company  of  Thailand  (JDA), Ltd. (collectively, "Triton Thailand"), and
Triton  Thailand's  50%  owned  affiliate, Carigali - Triton Operating Company
SDN.  BHD.  ("CTOC"); in Europe, where activities are, or have been, conducted
by  the Company's wholly owned (but until March 1994, 59.5% owned) subsidiary,

or have been, conducted by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Triton

("New  Zealand Petroleum"); in the United States by the Company's wholly owned
subsidiary,  Triton  Oil  &  Gas Corp. ("Triton Oil"), and the Company's 49.9%

Zealand  by  New  Zealand Petroleum and Crusader; in Canada by Crusader, until
June  1995, and by Triton Canada Resources Ltd. ("Triton Canada") until August

          A significant portion of Triton's reserves is held through the

     Competition

            The Company encounters strong competition from major oil companies
(including government-owned companies), independent operators and other
companies  for favorable oil and gas concessions, licenses, production sharing
contracts and leases, drilling rights and markets.  Additionally, the
governments  of  certain countries in which the Company operates may from time
to time give preferential treatment to their nationals.  The oil and gas
industry as a whole also competes with other industries in supplying the
energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual
consumers.   The principal means of competition in the sale of oil and gas are
product  availability,  price  and  quality.  While it is not possible for the
Company to state precisely its position in the oil and gas industry, the
Company believes that it represents a minor competitive factor.

     Markets

             Crude oil, natural gas, condensate and other oil and gas products
generally  are  sold  to  other oil and gas companies, government agencies and
other  industries.  The  Company  does not believe that the loss of any single
customer or contract pursuant to which oil and gas is sold would have a
long-term  material  adverse effect on the revenues from the Company's oil and
gas operations.





        In Colombia, crude oil is exported through the Caribbean port of
Covenas where it is sold at prices based on United States prices, adjusted for
quality and transportation.  The oil produced from the Cusiana Field is
transported to the export terminal through pipelines owned by the Colombian
national oil company or joint stock companies partially owned by the Company.
This pipeline system is in the process of being upgraded to accommodate
additional production from the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields.  See Item 2,
"Properties -  Oil and Gas - Colombia" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

           Pertamina, the Indonesian national oil company, purchases crude oil
under a contract from the Triton-operated Enim concession in Indonesia, which
expires in October 1996, using a formula based on the average market price of
five different crude oils.

           In the United States, the Company receives royalties on oil and gas
sold by others.

            In Australia, natural gas is sold to the South Australian and New
South Wales markets primarily through the Pipelines Authority of South
Australia and the Australian Gas Light Company, respectively.  Gas is supplied
to both of these markets under long-term contracts.  Small volumes may be sold
outside these contracts on a "spot" basis when market demands allow.  Crude
oil, condensate, natural gasolines and liquefied petroleum gases are freely
traded in both the domestic and export markets.

           For a discussion of certain factors regarding the Company's markets
and potential markets that could affect future operations, see note 18 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Employees

            At March 1, 1996, the Company employed approximately 245 full-time
employees  in its oil and gas exploration and production operations, excluding
employees of Crusader and its subsidiaries.

OTHER OPERATIONS

          In Australia, coal mining activities are conducted through
Crusader's 58.3%-owned subsidiary, Allied Queensland Coalfields Limited
("AQC"),  the  shares  of which are publicly traded in Australia.  AQC and its
subsidiaries have interests under exploration permits and mining leases
primarily  in  Australia.    In November 1995, Crusader contributed all of its
interest  in  Koala Smokeless Fuels Limited, an operator of a coal briquetting
factory in Ireland, to a joint venture in exchange for preferred stock and 49%
of the common shares of the joint venture.

          Crusader sold in March 1995 its gold business previously held by its
wholly owned subsidiary, Saracen Minerals Limited, for proceeds of $14.3
million.

DISCONTINUED AVIATION OPERATIONS

          During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company sold its
aviation  services businesses and, therefore, has reflected the aviation sales
and services segment as discontinued operations.

OIL AND GAS

     Colombia

          Through Triton Colombia, the Company has varying participation
interests in nine licenses in Colombia.

Cusiana and Cupiagua Fields

          Contract Terms.  In the foothills of the Llanos Basin area in
eastern  Colombia, Triton Colombia holds a 12% interest in the SDLA, Tauramena
and  Rio  Chitamena  contract areas, covering approximately 66,000, 41,400 and
11,600  acres, respectively, where an active appraisal and development program
is being carried out in the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields.  Triton's partners in
these  areas  are Empresa Colombiana De Petroleos ("Ecopetrol"), the Colombian
national  oil  company, with a 50% interest, BP Exploration Company (Colombia)
Limited  ("BP"),  the  operator,  with a 19% interest, and TOTAL Exploratie en
Produktie  Maatschippij  B.V.  ("TOTAL"),  also with a 19% interest.  In 1993,
Ecopetrol declared the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields to be commercial and
exercised  its right to acquire a 50% interest.  Triton's net revenue interest
is  approximately  9.6% after governmental royalties.  Triton's net revenue is
reduced  by up to 0.36% pursuant to an agreement with an original co-investor,
subject  to  Triton being reimbursed for a proportionate share of expenditures
relating thereto.

          The Company and its private partners have secured the right to
produce  oil  and  gas  from the SDLA and Tauramena contract areas through the
years  2010  and  2016, respectively, and from the Rio Chitamena contract area
through 2015 or 2019, depending on contract interpretation. In July 1994,
Triton Colombia, BP, TOTAL and Ecopetrol entered into an Integral Plan for the
Unified  Exploitation  of the Cusiana Oil Structure in the SDLA, Tauramena and
Rio  Chitamena  Association  Contract Areas.  Under the plan, the parties have
agreed  to  develop  the  Cusiana oil structure in a technically efficient and
cooperative manner during three consecutive periods of time.  During the
initial  period, petroleum produced from the unified area will be owned by the
parties  according  to  their  respective undivided interests in each contract
area.

             Within the first quarter of 2005, an independent determination of
the original barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE") of petroleum in place under the
unified  area and under each association contract will be made, as a result of
which a "tract factor" will be calculated for each association contract.  Each
tract  factor  will be the amount of original BOEs of petroleum in place under
the particular association contract as a percentage of the total original BOEs
under  the unified area.  Each party's unified area interest during the second
period  (commencing  from  the  expiration of the SDLA association contract in
2010) and during the final period (commencing from the termination of the
second association contract to termination) will be the aggregate of that
party's interest in each remaining association contract multiplied by the
tract factor for each such contract.

       Recent Drilling Results.  In the Cusiana Field, Triton Colombia and its
working interest partners have completed and have in service 16 producing
wells  and  five gas injection wells.  The injection wells will recycle to the
reservoir most of the gas that is associated with the oil production to
increase  the oil recoverable over the life of the field.  There are currently
six wells being drilled as part of 1996 activity.  The plan for the year
includes  the  drilling  and completion of 16 oil production and gas injection
wells, which would bring the year end total to 37 production and gas injection
wells.    Full field development drilling is proceeding on a schedule which is
intended to have sufficient well capacity at all times to meet production
capacities of field facilities and export pipelines from the area.

          In the Cupiagua Field, Triton Colombia and its working interest
partners  completed  the  Cupiagua-4  well in the Barco Formation and the well
awaits connection to a pipeline system for early field production beginning in
1996.    Tests  of the well yielded 11,500 barrels of oil and 43 million cubic
feet  of  gas  per  day and confirmed the presence of oil and gas in the lower
inverted Mirador and Barco formations.  The well extended the total oil column
in  the  field  to  3,671 feet and no water contact was found.  The Cupiagua-5
well,  spudded  in April, has  penetrated the Mirador and Barco reservoirs and
the  Cupiagua-6  well,  spudded  in May, has penetrated the Mirador, Barco and
Guadalupe  reservoirs.    The  Cupiagua-5 well was the deepest well to date in
either  the Cusiana Field or the Cupiagua Field.  The well has reached a total
depth of approximately 18,000 feet and is currently being flow tested.
Appraisal  and  development  drilling is proceeding with a  three-rig drilling
program,  which is expected to increase to four rigs by mid-year, and which is
expected  to  result  in  the completion of at least seven additional wells in
1996.

          The Company believes considerable progress has been achieved in
reducing the time and expenditures required to drill and complete wells in the
Cusiana  and Cupiagua fields.  Although there can be no assurance, the Company
believes  that  further improvements can be achieved with experience gained in
the  area.    The  Company expects that an additional rig will be mobilized as
needed in both fields to efficiently develop the oil and gas reserves.

      Production Facilities and Pipelines.  The four early production units of
the  Cusiana Field central processing facility have been placed in service and
are designed to handle approximately 180,000 barrels of daily production
throughput from the Cusiana Field.  Construction is under way to increase
production  from  the  Cusiana and Cupiagua fields to at least 500,000 barrels
per  day by the end of 1997.  Additional pipeline capacity is required to meet
the transportation needs associated with full field development of these
fields.   To that end, in April 1995, Triton Pipeline Colombia, Inc., a wholly
owned  subsidiary  of the Company, along with Ecopetrol, BP Colombia Pipelines
Ltd.,  Total Pipeline Colombie, S.A., IPL Enterprises (Colombia) Inc. and TCPL
International Investments Inc., completed the formation of a company,
Oleoducto Central S.A. ("OCENSA"), to own and finance pipeline and port
facilities  to be constructed and operated for the transport of crude oil from
the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields to the port of Covenas.  Triton's equity
participation  in  OCENSA  is  9.6%.  See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funding
Alternatives."

          This pipeline project consists of a 793-kilometer (495-mile)
pipeline  system from the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields to the Caribbean port of
Covenas.  It loops and generally follows the route of the two existing
pipelines:  the  Central  Llanos pipeline from El Porvenir to Vasconia and the
Oleoducto  de Colombia ("ODC") pipeline from Vasconia to Covenas.  A portion of
the Central Llanos loop already completed and pump station upgrades at El
Porvenir  and Miraflores were acquired by OCENSA during 1995.  Construction of
the remainder of the system is currently under way and scheduled to be
completed in 1997.  Production from the Fields in 1995 was 5.1 million barrels
of  oil,  including Ecopetrol reimbursements.  The current plan is to increase
production  capacity  to at least 500,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of
1997.

     Other Colombia Areas

            Triton owns the rights to six additional licenses in Colombia.  In
the  Middle  Magdalena Valley basin and adjacent foothills, Triton owns a 100%
interest  (before  certain  royalties  and government participation) in the El
Pinal contract area, which covers approximately 142,250 acres approximately 330
kilometers (205 miles) north of Bogota.  In the southern part of El Pinal,
Triton  discovered  and  confirmed  the La Liebre Field with two wells (the La
Liebre-1  and  -2),  which  were tested at an aggregate of approximately 1,800
barrels  of  oil per day.  In 1995, Ecopetrol approved Triton's application to
declare  the La Liebre Field commercial, and initial production from the field
is expected to begin in 1996.

             The Yumeca-1 exploratory well, located in the northern part of El
Pial,  was  drilled  and tested in 1995.  It was intended that the well test a
new  play  concept  in the foothills of the Middle Magdalena Valley.  The well
encountered hydrocarbon shows at various intervals but was plugged and
abandoned after four zones were tested.  The well was drilled to a total depth
of 13,675 feet and failed to produce on test.  Triton intends to drill an
additional exploratory well on the Yumeca trend in 1996.

             In June 1995, the Company was awarded the Guayabo A and B and Las
Amelias  Association Contracts covering a contiguous area of approximately 1.8
million  acres  in Colombia.  The area is located approximately 150 kilometers
(93 miles) north of Bogota and 140 kilometers (87 miles) northwest of the
Cusiana  and Cupiagua fields, and is contiguous with the El Pinal contract area
to  the  north.    The terms of these association contracts are less favorable
than  the  terms  of the Cusiana and Cupiagua association contracts. Triton is
conducting  environmental  studies  over the blocks and intends to acquire 175
kilometers (110 miles) of seismic over the Las Amelias block and 100
kilometers (62 miles) of seismic over the Guayabo A block.

          In March 1996, the Company executed an agreement with Deminex
Colombia  Petroleum GmbH ("Deminex") providing Deminex the right to earn a 50%
interest  in the El Pinal, Guayabo A and B and Las Amelias contract areas.  The
effectiveness  of the agreement is conditioned on the approval by December 31,
1996 of Ecopetrol and the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia.  The
agreement  provides  for  an initial payment by Deminex of approximately $13.4
million.  In addition to costs associated with its 50% interest in the
contract areas, Deminex would pay certain direct exploratory costs of the
Company up to a maximum of approximately $16.8 million.  All payments due
prior to the receipt of the requisite approvals will be held in escrow.

            In the Upper Magdalena Valley basin, Triton Colombia has 22.5% and
20%  interests  (before  certain  royalties), respectively, in the 32,834-acre
Tolima-B  and  32,240-acre  San Luis contract areas, approximately 180 and 130
kilometers  (110  and 80 miles), respectively, southwest of Bogota.  HOCOL S.A.
is  operator  in both areas.  Ecopetrol has granted commerciality of one field
in each of the two areas.

     Malaysia-Thailand

          In April 1994, Triton Thailand became a party to a production
sharing  contract  covering an area located offshore, designated as Block A-18
of  the  Malaysia-Thailand  Joint  Development Area.  The contract area, which
encompasses  approximately  731,000 acres, had been the subject of overlapping
claims between Malaysia and Thailand. The other parties to the production
sharing  contract  are  the  Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority, which has been
established by treaty to administer the Joint Development Area, and the
Malaysian  national oil company.  The treaty provides for the development of a
Joint  Development  Area that includes Block A-18.  Triton Thailand previously
held  a  concession  from  Thailand that covered part of the Joint Development
Area.

          Simultaneously with the execution of the production sharing
contract,  the  parties  executed  a joint operating agreement governing Block
A-18 operations.  The operating agreement designated as operator, CTOC, a
company owned equally by Triton Thailand and the Malaysian national oil
company.

          The first phase of Block A-18 operations included a 2D seismic
survey  covering  approximately  5,700  kilometers (3,542 miles), a 3D seismic
survey conducted in 1995 and covering approximately 620 square kilometers (239
square  miles)  over  the  Cakerawala field, data analysis and the drilling of
three exploratory wells.

          In August 1995, the first of the three wells, the Cakerawala-1A, was
tested at a combined flow rate of 58 MMcf of gas and 945 barrels of condensate
and oil per day.  The well was drilled in approximately 200 feet of water to a
total  depth of 7,878 feet.  A second well, Suriya-1, was tested at 58 MMcf of
gas  and  351 barrels of condensate per day.  The Suriya-1 well was drilled in
approximately  180 feet of water to a total depth of 7,273 feet and is located
on a separate structure.  The Suriya-1 well is located approximately 11
kilometers (7 miles) east-southeast of the Cakerawala-1A well.

             A third well, Cakerawala East-1, was drilled in approximately 180
feet  of  water to a total depth of 11,808 feet.   Cakerawala East-1 tested at
approximately  22  MMcf  of gas and 138 barrels of condensate per day from the
two  shallow sequences that constitute the principal producing zones for phase
one  field development.  The well confirmed anticipated fault separations from
the structure on which the Cakerawala-1A and Pilong wells (drilled by Exxon in
1979)  were drilled, and experienced comparable sand thickness, flow rates and
gas-water  contact,  and  lesser  CO2  content, than the same sequences in the
Cakerawala-1A  and Pilong wells.  Intermediate sequences were wet and were not
tested.  The well also confirmed the presence of deeper, overpressure
sandstone  sequences, but the deeper zones tested wet or inconclusively due to
mechanical  difficulties.  The deeper zones remain an exploratory prospect for
future drilling.

          CTOC's highest priority in 1996 is expected to be the further
delineation  and  development  of the main Cakerawala field in anticipation of
negotiation  of  an  initial gas sales contract.  The Company believes that it
will  be  necessary  to convince a buyer of the field's capacity to produce at
least 300 MMcf per day for at least 6,000 days in order to negotiate any
acceptable  contract.  To that end, CTOC expects to drill up to four appraisal
wells  to  delineate the Cakerawala Field in 1996.  In addition, CTOC plans to
drill  the  last two wells of the initial five-well exploration program on two
structures adjacent to the gas-field discoveries.

          The nature and extent of the second phase of development and
appraisal of the area will depend on the parties' assessment of the results of
phase-one activities.

     Argentina

          Through the Company's subsidiaries, Triton Argentina, Inc. and
Triton Resources Argentina, Inc. (collectively, "Triton Argentina"), the
Company  holds a 100% working interest in the approximately 50,000 acre-Sierra
Azul Sur concession in the oil and gas producing Neuquen Basin in western
Argentina.

            Triton Argentina also holds working interests in the Malargue Sur,
Cerro  Doa  Juana  and Loma Cortaderal concessions in Argentina.  In 1995, the
Company  drilled two exploratory wells in the Malarge Sur Block, the El Fortin
X-1  and  the  Cerro Negro X-1.  The El Fortin X-1 well was drilled to a total
depth  of 7,485 feet and, although the well exhibited oil and gas shows, three
tests failed to produce oil to surface and the well was plugged and abandoned.
 The Cerro Negro X-1 well was drilled to 12,153 feet and plugged and abandoned
after  five tests failed to produce economic quantities of oil.  A third well,
Cerro Chimango X-1, was drilled to a total depth of 6,067 feet and plugged and
abandoned  in January 1996.   Triton expects to relinquish its interest in the
Malarge Sur concession in March 1996.

     Guatemala

              Through the Company's subsidiary, Triton Guatemala S.A. ("Triton
Guatemala"),  the Company has acquired an interest in two contiguous blocks in
Guatemala.   During 1995, Triton Guatemala acquired 270 kilometers (169 miles)
of  seismic data.  The blocks lie on the border with Mexico in an extension of
the  Chiapas  fold belt province.  Triton expects to test the extension of the
Chiapas fold belt trend into Guatemala.

     Ecuador

           Through the Company's subsidiary, Triton Ecuador, Inc. LLC ("Triton
Ecuador"), the Company holds an interest in Block 19 located in the Ecuadorian
foothills in the Oriente Basin.  During 1995, Triton farmed out a 30% interest
in  the  area  to Vintage Petroleum Ecuador, Inc. and a 15% interest to Ranger
Oil  Limited, in each case subject to government approval.  The partners' work
program  commitments for Block 19 consist of the acquisition of 400 kilometers
of new seismic data and the drilling of two exploratory wells during a
four-year  exploration period.  An environmental impact study was completed in
1995 and a 420 kilometer (263 mile)-seismic acquisition program is expected to
be completed in 1996.  Exploratory drilling is planned to begin in 1997.

     China

            The Company's subsidiary, Triton China, Inc. LLC ("Triton China"),
signed a production sharing contract with the China National Offshore Oil
Company  in  February 1995 giving the Company the right to explore and develop
Contract  Area 16/22 located approximately 175 kilometers (110 miles) offshore
from Hong Kong in water depths ranging from 300 to 650 feet.  The 791,000-acre
block  is  in the Huizhou Sub-basin of the Pearl River Mouth Basin.  The block
has  a  primary  three year exploration term with a commitment of reprocessing
500 kilometers (310 miles) of existing seismic and the drilling of an
exploratory  well  for  a total expenditure of not less than $7.5 million.  In
April 1995, the Company was awarded the adjacent 1.9 million acre block,
Contract Area 16/01, as a Joint Study Area.  Seismic reprocessing on both
blocks,  of  an aggregate of approximately 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), was
completed  in 1995 and the Company expects to drill its first exploratory well
in Contract Area 16/22 in 1996.

     Italy

          The Company's subsidiary, Triton Mediterranean Oil & Gas N.V.
("Triton  Mediterranean"),  has  a 40% interest  in the DR71 and DR72 licenses
operated by Enterprise Oil, plc, in the Adriatic Sea offshore Italy.  One
exploratory well is planned for 1996.  Triton has applied for four new
licenses onshore in the southern Apennine Mountains and one new license
offshore.    In  1995, the Monte Caruso license, in which Triton Mediterranean
held a 10.91% interest, was relinquished.


     France

          In August 1995, the Company sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Triton
France, to Coparex International, a French oil and gas company.  The Company's
assets  in France primarily consisted of the Villeperdue field in which Triton
France had a 50% interest.

     Crusader

          Oil and gas activities in Australia are conducted through the
Company's 49.9% owned affiliate, Crusader, whose shares are publicly traded in
Australia.   Crusader has an interest in the Cooper Basin Gas and Liquids Unit
of South Australia.  Within the Gippsland and Otway Basins of Victoria,
Crusader  has  interests in two offshore and one onshore exploration licenses,
respectively.  Crusader has an approximate 48.9% equity interest in Australian
Hydrocarbons Limited ("AHY"), a publicly traded Australian company.  Two
Crusader directors and one alternate Crusader director are members of the
three-member AHY Board of Directors and Crusader consolidates AHY in its
financial  and reserve disclosures.  AHY owns various interests in oil and gas
exploration projects in Australia including the South West Queensland Gas
Unit.

          In 1995, Crusader sold substantially all of its interests in oil and
gas exploration, production and processing in Canada and Argentina.

     Indonesia

          Triton Indonesia is the operator of a secondary
recovery/rehabilitation  project  on the southeastern portion of the island of
Sumatra  pursuant to a contract that expires in October 1996.  In 1995, Triton
Indonesia acquired the 6% interest in this project owned by New Zealand
Petroleum,  through its wholly owned subsidiary Triton Oil (N.Z.) Limited, and
entered into a definitive agreement to sell its entire interest in this
project, the consummation of which is subject to certain conditions.

     United States

          During the fiscal year ended May 31, 1994, the Company sold
substantially all of its working interests in oil and gas reserves in the
United  States,  retaining  primarily royalty and mineral interests.  In March
1996, the Company entered into an agreement providing for the sale of
substantially  all  of  its royalty and mineral interests, the consummation of
which  is  subject  to  customary conditions.  The net proceeds from the sale,
which will be made effective as of January 1, 1996, are expected to be
approximately $23.8 million and are expected to result in a gain of
approximately $4 million.

RESERVES

          The following tables set forth the estimated oil and gas reserves of
the  Company  and the estimated discounted future net cash flows before income
taxes  at December 31, 1995.  The first table is a summary of separate reports
of estimates of the Company's net proved reserves, estimated by the
independent petroleum engineers, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, with respect to all
proved  reserves  in  the  Cusiana and Cupiagua fields in Colombia, and by the
Company's  own  petroleum  engineers with respect to all other reserves.  This
table sets forth the estimated net quantities of proved developed and
undeveloped  oil  and gas reserves and total proved oil and gas reserves owned
by  the  Company  and its consolidated subsidiaries in Colombia, Indonesia and
the United States and its proportionate interest in reserves owned in
Australia by Crusader.  The second table sets forth, for the net quantities so
reported, the future net cash flows (by reserve categories and country of
location) discounted to present value at an annual rate of 10%. The discounted
future  net  cash  flows were calculated in accordance with current Securities
and Exchange Commission ("Commission") guidelines concerning the use of
constant oil and gas prices and operating costs in reserve evaluations.
Future  income tax expenses have not been taken into account in estimating the
future net cash flows.  At December 31, 1995, the Company had no proved
developed or proved undeveloped reserves in Malaysia-Thailand, Argentina,
Guatemala,  Ecuador,  Italy  or  China.  See note 25 of  Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

             The estimated reserves and future net cash flows set forth in the
tables below include information attributable to the Company's 49.9% ownership
interest in Crusader (which includes the minority interests in Crusader's
consolidated subsidiaries).  Oil reserves data include natural gas liquids and
condensate.

</TABLE>

          Revenue and costs associated with the Australian reserves are
reported  in US dollar equivalents based on an exchange value of Australian $1
equivalent  to US$0.7428.  The Colombian and Indonesian reserves are evaluated
in United States dollars.

          The foregoing estimated pretax discounted future net cash flow
figures relate only to the reserves tabulated above.  The estimates were
prepared without consideration of income taxes and indirect costs such as
interest and administrative expenses (except administrative expenses billed by
the operator), and are not to be construed as representative of the fair
market values of the properties to which they relate.

            Reserve estimates are approximate and may be expected to change as
additional  information  becomes  available. Furthermore, estimates of oil and
gas  reserves,  of  necessity,  are projections based on engineering data, and
there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as
the  projection  of  future  rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures.    Reservoir  engineering  is a subjective process of estimating
underground  accumulations  of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact
way,  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of
available  data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the reserves set forth herein will
ultimately  be produced nor can there be assurance that the proved undeveloped
reserves will be developed within the periods anticipated.  The Company
emphasizes  with  respect  to  the estimates prepared by independent petroleum
engineers,  as  well  as  those estimates prepared by the Company's engineers,
that the discounted future net cash flows should not be construed as
representative  of  the fair market value of the proved oil and gas properties
belonging  to  the  Company,  since discounted future net cash flows are based
upon projected cash flows that provide for neither changes in oil and gas
prices  nor  for escalation of expenses and capital costs.  The meaningfulness
of  such  estimates  is  highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions
upon  which  they  were based.  See note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

          No estimates of total proved net oil or gas reserves have been filed
by the Company with, or included in any report to, any United States authority
or  agency pertaining to the Company's individual reserves since the beginning
of the Company's last fiscal year.

ACREAGE

          The following table shows the total gross and net developed and
undeveloped  oil  and  gas acreage (including acreage attributable to mineral,
royalty and overriding royalty interests) held by Triton at December 31, 1995,
including  acreage  attributable  to the Company's 49.9% ownership interest in
Crusader  (which  includes  the  minority interests in Crusader's consolidated
subsidiaries).  "Gross" refers to the total number of acres in an area in
which  the Company holds any interest without adjustment to reflect the actual
percentage  interest  held  therein by the Company.  "Net" refers to the gross
acreage as adjusted for working interests owned by parties other than the
Company.


             "Developed" acreage is acreage spaced or assignable to productive
wells.   "Undeveloped" acreage is acreage on which wells have not been drilled
or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial
quantities  of  oil and gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved
reserves.

OTHER

          The Company owns or has interests in oil and gas production
facilities  relating  to  its oil and gas production operations throughout the
world.  In addition, the Company leases or owns office space and other
properties for its various operations in various parts of the world.

             For additional information on the Company's leases, including its
office leases, see note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

LITIGATION

           The Company's domestic oil and gas subsidiary, Triton Oil, is among
several  defendants  in  two related lawsuits brought in the Superior Court of
the State of California, County of Los Angeles, by National Union Fire
Insurance  Company  ("National  Union"),  The Restaurant Enterprises Group and
Travelers  Indemnity  Company ("Travelers").  The lawsuits allege, among other
things, that the defendants' negligence contributed to the collapse of a hotel
and the flooding of a restaurant in a 1988 tidal wave at King Harbor in
Redondo  Beach,  California, which allegedly caused $22 million in damages and
related  attorneys'  fees.   In the case of Triton Oil, the alleged negligence
was  Triton  Oil's  drilling  of nearby oil wells and alleged resulting ground
subsidence which purportedly lowered the height of the King Harbor breakwater.
 The City of Redondo Beach has also filed a suit in the Superior Court against
the  Company  and Triton Oil seeking indemnity for certain amounts paid by the
City to settle the foregoing lawsuits and other claims arising out of the
flooding.  The Company believes that it and Triton Oil have meritorious
defenses and intends to defend the suits vigorously.

          During the quarter ending September 30, 1995, the United States
Environmental  Protection  Agency  and  Justice Department advised the Company
that one of its domestic oil and gas subsidiaries, as a potentially
responsible  party for the clean-up of the Monterey Park, California Superfund
site operated by Operating Industries, Inc., could agree to contribute
approximately $2.8 million to settle its alleged liability for certain
remedial  tasks at the site.  The offer did not address responsibility for any
groundwater remediation.  The subsidiary was advised that if it did not accept
the settlement offer, it, together with other potentially responsible parties,
may be ordered to perform or pay for various remedial tasks.  After
considering  the  cost of possible remedial tasks, its legal position relative
to  potentially  responsible parties and insurers, possible legal defenses and
other factors, the subsidiary declined to accept the offer.

           In June 1994, the Company and numerous other defendants were served
by the State of Nevada, Division of Environmental Protection (the "NDEP") in a
state  court proceeding in Clark County, Nevada.  The action seeks to hold the
defendants responsible for remediation of certain underground water
contamination  at the McCarran International Airport and seeks civil penalties
of  up  to $25,000 per day.  The Company has been advised by the NDEP that the
action  was filed to toll the running of the statute of limitations on certain
potential causes of action.  The Company denies responsibility for the
contamination at issue and does not believe that the action will have a
material adverse affect on its consolidated financial position.

          The Company is also subject to ordinary litigation that is
incidental to its business.

REGULATORY MATTER

           The Company continues to cooperate with inquiries by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice regarding possible
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the
Company's  operations  in  Indonesia.  Based upon the information available to
the  Company to date, the Company believes that it will be able to resolve any
issues that either agency ultimately might raise concerning these matters in a
manner that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position.
CERTAIN FACTORS

          None of the legal matters described above is expected to have a
material  adverse  effect  on  the Company's consolidated financial position.
However, this statement of the Company's expectation is a forward-looking
statement  that  is  dependent on certain events and uncertainties that may be
outside of the Company's control.  Actual results and developments could
differ  materially  from  the  Company's expectation, for example, due to such
uncertainties  as  jury  verdicts,  the application of laws to various factual
situations,  the actions that may or may not be taken by other parties and the
availability of insurance.  In addition, in certain situations, such as
environmental  claims, one defendant may be responsible for the liabilities of
other  parties.    Moreover, circumstances could arise under which the Company
may elect to settle claims at amounts that exceed the Company's expected
liability for such claims in an attempt to avoid costly litigation.  Judgments
or settlements could, therefore, exceed any reserves.


ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

           No matter was submitted by the Company during the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year covered by this report to security holders, through the
solicitation  of proxies or otherwise.  In November 1995, the Company obtained
the  consent of the holders of its publicly traded notes to certain amendments
to  the  indentures  under  which they were issued.  See Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The
Company  has  called a special meeting of its stockholders to be held on March
25, 1996 at which the stockholders will vote on the Reorganization.  The
Company and Triton Cayman have filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  a  Proxy  Statement/Joint Prospectus dated as of February 23, 1996
relating to the special meeting and the securities to be issued if the
Reorganization is consummated.

_______________________

*Through March 7, 1996.

            Triton has not declared any cash dividends on its shares of common
stock  since  fiscal 1990.  The Company's current intent is to retain earnings
for use in the Company's business and the financing of its capital
requirements.  The payment of any future cash dividends is necessarily
dependent  upon  the  earnings  and financial needs of the Company, along with
applicable legal and contractual restrictions.

          The payment of dividends on the Company's capital stock is
restricted  pursuant  to  the indentures under which its publicly traded notes
were issued.

              Under applicable corporate law, the Company may pay dividends or
make  other distributions to its shareholders, out of surplus and, if there is
no surplus, out of net profits for the current year and/or the preceding year,
unless the net assets of the corporation are less than the capital represented
by  issued  and outstanding stock having a preference on asset distributions.
"Surplus"  is  defined as the excess of the net assets of the Company over its
stated capital (stated capital being the total par value of the Company's
outstanding capital stock plus all amounts transferred to stated capital,
minus legal reductions from such sum).

          In connection with the acquisition in March 1994 of the common
shares of Triton Europe not owned by Triton, the Company issued 522,460 shares
of  its  5%  Convertible  Preferred Stock ("5% preferred stock") to the former
holders  of the Triton Europe ordinary shares.  Each share of the 5% preferred
stock may be converted into one share of Triton common stock at any time on or
after October 1, 1994.  Each share of 5% preferred stock bears a cash
dividend, which has priority over dividends on Triton's common stock, equal to
5% per annum on the redemption price of $34.41 per share, payable
semi-annually on March 30 and September 30, commencing on September 30, 1994.
The 5% preferred stock has priority over Triton common stock upon liquidation,
and  may be redeemed at Triton's option at any time on or after March 30, 1998
(or  such  earlier  date  as at least 75% of the shares originally issued have
been converted into common stock) for cash equal to the redemption price.  Any
shares of 5% preferred stock that remain outstanding on March 30, 2004 must be
redeemed  at the redemption price either for cash or, at the Company's option,
for shares of Triton common stock.   See notes 4 and 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

              In May 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a new
Shareholder Rights Plan under which preferred stock rights were issued to
holders  of its common stock at the rate of one right for each share of common
stock held as of the close of business on June 2, 1995.  The rights were
issued in place of the Company's previous preferred share purchase rights
issued in 1990, which were redeemed.

            Generally, the rights become exercisable only if a person acquires
beneficial  ownership  of  15% or more of Triton's Common Stock or announces a
tender offer for 15% or more of the common stock.  If, among other events, any
person  becomes  the beneficial owner of 15% or more of Triton's common stock,
each  right  not  owned by such person generally becomes the right to purchase
such  number  of  shares of common stock of the Company, which is equal to the
amount obtained by dividing the right's exercise price (currently $120) by 50%
of  the market price of the common stock on the date of the first occurrence.
In addition, if the Company is subsequently merged or certain other
extraordinary business transactions are consummated, each right generally
becomes a right to purchase such number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person which is equal to the amount obtained by dividing the right's
exercise  price  by 50% of the market price of the common stock on the date of
the  first  occurrence.    The rights will expire on May 22, 2005, unless such
expiration date is extended or unless the rights are earlier redeemed or
exchanged  by the Company.  At any time prior to a person acquiring beneficial
ownership  of 15% or more of Triton's Common Stock, the Company may redeem the
rights  in  whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right.  For so long
as the rights are redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the
redemption price, amend the rights in any manner.

            At March 7, 1996, there were 6,236 record holders of the Company's
common stock.

THE REORGANIZATION

          If the Reorganization is consummated, each outstanding share of
common  stock  of the Company at the effective time of the Reorganization (the
"Effective  Time")  (other than shares held in treasury and shares as to which
an  election  to receive Equity Units (as defined below) has been made and not
withdrawn,  subject  to  certain  limitations) will be automatically converted
into one Class A Ordinary Share of Triton Cayman. Holders of not less than 15%
but not more than 25% of the outstanding shares of  Common stock at the
Effective Time, in the aggregate, may make an unconditional election to
receive an equity unit ("Equity Unit") consisting of one Class B Ordinary
Share  of  Triton Cayman and one-tenth of one share of participating preferred
stock of the Company for each share of   Common  Stock of the  Company
owned  in  lieu  of  such shares being converted into Class A Ordinary Shares.
Each  such  Class  B  Ordinary Share and one-tenth of a share of participating
preferred  stock  would  be paired and after such pairing could only be traded
together  as  a unit. If holders of less than 15% of the outstanding shares of
the  Company's  common stock, in the aggregate, elect to receive Equity Units,
no Equity Units will be issued and all such shares would be automatically
converted  into Class A Ordinary Shares of Triton Cayman. The Class A Ordinary
Shares have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol "OIL," the same symbol under which the Company's common stock is
currently  listed,  and the Equity Units have been approved for listing on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "OIL.B".

ITEM  7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

           Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Funding Alternatives

          Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $95.5
million and $72.3 million at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994,
respectively.  Working capital was $85.6 million at December 31, 1995, an
increase of $55.9 million from December 31, 1994.

              The Company's capital expenditures and other capital investments
were  $178.2  million,  $89.9 million, $86.8 million and $124.9 million during
the year ended December 31, 1995, the seven months ended December 31, 1994 and
the years ended May 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, primarily for exploration
and development of the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields (the "Fields") in Colombia.
  The  1995 capital spending program was funded with cash flow from operations
(including  a  forward sale of Cusiana crude oil), cash on hand, proceeds from
marketable securities, sale of assets ($20.9 million) and net borrowings
($36.3 million).

          In May 1995, the Company sold 10.4 million barrels of oil in a
forward oil sale.  Under the terms of the sale, the Company received
approximately  $87 million of the approximately $124 million net proceeds, and
is  entitled  to receive substantially all of the remaining proceeds (now held
in  various  interest-bearing reserve accounts) when the Company's Cusiana and
Cupiagua  fields project in Colombia becomes self-financing, which is expected
in  1997, and when certain other conditions are met.  The delivery requirement
represents  approximately 15% of the Company's currently projected Cusiana and
Cupiagua production over the five-year delivery period that began in June
1995.

           During 1995, the Company repaid $25 million of short-term debt, and
borrowed  $48.6  million,  net  under a $65 million long-term revolving credit
facility.  The facility matures in October 1997 and is secured by the
Company's marketable securities portfolio and Crusader common stock.

          Capital expenditures incurred during the seven months ended December
31,  1994 were funded by cash on hand, net proceeds from marketable securities
($30.8  million)  and  borrowings  ($17.2 million).  The principal sources for
funds for the year ended May 31, 1994 used to support operations, capital
expenditures and debt repayment were $100 million in proceeds from the sale of
assets and approximately $124 million from the issuance of $170 million
principal amount of 9 3/4% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes ("9 3/4% Notes")
due  December  2000.  Proceeds of approximately $126 million from the issuance
of $240 million principal amount of 12 1/2% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes
("1997 Notes") due November 1997 and asset sales ($29.4 million) were the
primary sources of funds during fiscal 1993.

          Continued development of the Fields, including drilling and
construction  of  additional  production  facilities, will require significant
capital.    In 1995 and early 1996, Carigali-Triton Operating Company ("CTOC")
discovered gas on its first three wells on Block A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand
Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand.  Further exploration and
development activities on Block A-18, as well as exploratory drilling in other
countries, will also require substantial capital.  The Company's capital
budget  for  the  year ending December 31, 1996 is approximately $260 million,
excluding capitalized interest, of which approximately $157 million relates to
the Fields, $34 million relates to Block A-18, $40 million relates to the
Company's exploration and drilling program in other parts of the world and $29
million relates to capital contributions to Oleoducto Central S.A. ("OCENSA").
 Capital requirements for full field development of the Fields are expected to
continue at substantial levels into 1997 and capital requirements for
exploration  and  development  relating to Block A-18 are expected to increase
significantly into 1998.

           In December 1994, the Company, along with other investors formed an
independent  company,   OCENSA, to own, expand, finance and operate a pipeline
system from the Fields to the Caribbean port of Covenas.  The Company's
ownership  percentage  is  9.6%.  OCENSA's capitalization plan contemplates an
ultimate  capital  structure  of approximately 30% equity from the Company and
other  investors  and 70% debt.  OCENSA has raised significant amounts of debt
in  separate  tranches supported by various agreements with the Company or its
partners as the case may be (relating, in particular, to tariffs on each
partner's throughput).  The Company assisted OCENSA in securing one such
tranche  for  $60  million in 1995, which is supported by the Company's tariff
commitments for its share of production from the Fields.  The Company has
agreed  to assist OCENSA in raising an additional $60 million in 1996.  In the
event  such  amount  cannot be raised, OCENSA may call for an advance from the
Company.

             In November 1995, the Company signed a $45 million loan agreement
supported by a guarantee issued by the Export-Import Bank of the United
States.    The loan finances expenditures for exported U.S. goods and services
for phase one development of the Cusiana Field in Colombia.  The Company
borrowed approximately $43 million against this facility in early 1996.

            As part of the forward oil sale transaction, Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York agreed to purchase up to $40 million of additional
production  on a forward sale basis in the event that the Company is otherwise
unable to meet its cash call obligations in respect of the Cusiana and
Cupiagua fields project.  The number of barrels would be determined based on a
formula intended to reflect their fair market value. The Company does not
expect, however, to sell any production under this agreement.

          The Company expects to meet capital needs in the future with a
combination  of  some  or all of the following: the long-term revolving credit
facility  described  above,  cash  flow from its Colombian operations, cash on
hand  and  marketable  securities,   asset sales, and the issuance of debt and
equity securities.  As a result of certain modifications to the indenture
relating to the 1997 Notes effected in November 1995, the Company's
indebtedness  limitation  was  increased  to permit the Company to incur total
indebtedness  (excluding  certain  permitted indebtedness) of up to 25% of the
sum  of  its  indebtedness and market capitalization of its capital stock.  In
addition,  the  indenture relating to the 1997 Notes was modified to eliminate
the  Company's repurchase obligation in the event the Company's net worth were
to fall below a certain level.

                            Results of Operations

            The Company changed its fiscal year end from May 31 to December 31
beginning in 1995.  The Consolidated Statements of Operations report the
Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1995, the
seven months ended December 31, 1994 and the years ended May 31, 1994 and
1993; however, Management's Discussion and Analysis compares the calendar
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the fiscal years ended May 31, 1994
and 1993.  The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1994 have
not been audited.

Years Ended December 31, 1995 and 1994

     Revenues

          Sales and other operating revenues were $107.5 million and $33
million  in  1995  and 1994, respectively.  Revenues  in Colombia increased by
$81.6  million  in  1995 primarily due to greater production capacity from the
recent installation of four production units in the Cusiana central processing
facility and higher oil prices in Colombia ($16.29 per barrel in 1995,
compared  with $13.16 per barrel in 1994) resulting from more favorable market
conditions  and  batching  of  Cusiana crude beginning in mid-1995.   The 1995
results  also included revenues of $14.5 million relating to the reimbursement
of  pre-commerciality  costs for the Cusiana Field.  Ecopetrol is obligated to
reimburse the Company for an additional $7 million of Cusiana
pre-commerciality costs, most of which will be recorded as revenue.  The
reimbursements  depend  on  the  timing and amount of Cusiana production.  Oil
sales in France were $5.8 million higher in 1994 than in 1995, primarily
because of  the sale of Triton France in August 1995.

     Costs and Expenses

          Operating expenses increased $14.1 million to $35.3 million in 1995,
while depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $9.5 million to $23.2
million  in  1995.  Higher production in Colombia increased operating expenses
by $19.1 million and depreciation, depletion and amortization by $13.4
million.    The Company's operating costs per equivalent barrel were $6.28 and
$10.75 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The sale of Triton France reduced
operating  expenses  and  depletion  in 1995 by $3.6 million and $3.7 million,
respectively.   The 1994 results included an accrual of $1.1 million for
environmental clean-up costs in the United States.

           General and administrative expenses decreased from $29.1 million in
1994  to  $25.7  million in 1995, primarily due to increased capitalization of
general and administrative expenses from $14.9 million in 1994 to $21.1
million in 1995 resulting from increased exploration and development
activities.

          Writedown of assets in 1994 was related to oil properties in France,
Indonesia and the United States under application of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission")  full cost ceiling limitation.

     Other Income and Expenses

             Interest income was $8 million and $8.1 million in 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Interest expense increased by $12 million in 1995 due to higher
debt outstanding and lower capitalized interest, primarily as a result of
commercial level production beginning in Colombia during late 1994.
Capitalized  interest  was  $16.2  million and $20.6 million in 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

          Equity in loss of affiliates, net was $2.2 million in 1995, compared
with $2.9 million in 1994.  Equity in loss of Crusader for 1995 included a net
gain of $3.8 million on the sale of Saracen Minerals, a $2.7 million loss
related to the early redemption of Crusader's Convertible Notes and writedowns
of $2.9 million on unproved oil and gas properties and a coal mining property.


          Other income, net was $11.6 million in 1995, compared with $2.8
million in 1994.  Other income during 1995 included $7.2 million received from
legal  settlements,  a $3.5 million gain on the sale of Triton France and $2.9
million  received  from the early redemption of Crusader's Convertible Notes.
These  increases were offset by a $4.2 million noncash charge representing the
change  in fair market value of call options purchased in conjunction with the
Colombian forward oil sale.

     Income Taxes

             Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),
"Accounting for Income Taxes", requires that the Company make projections
about the timing and scope of certain future business transactions in order to
estimate  realizability  of  deferred  tax assets primarily resulting from the
expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs").  Changes in
the timing or nature of  actual or anticipated business transactions,
projections  and  income  tax laws can give rise to significant adjustments to
the  Company's  deferred tax expense or benefit that may be reported from time
to  time.  For these and other reasons, compliance with SFAS 109 may result in
significant  differences between tax expense for income statement purposes and
taxes actually paid.

             The income tax provision for the 1995 period represented deferred
taxes in Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and China, and a deferred tax
benefit in the United States related to anticipated future utilization of
NOLs.    Subject to the factors described above, the Company currently expects
that  its foreign deferred tax provision will substantially exceed its current
tax  provision  (i.e.,  actual taxes paid), resulting in an effective tax rate
for  income  statement purposes that will exceed statutory tax rates, at least
until  the  Cusiana  and Cupiagua fields project reaches peak production.  The
primary reason for the expected difference is the nondeductibility for
Colombian  tax  purposes  of certain capitalized expenses and the treatment of
reimbursements for pre-commerciality costs as return of capital under
Colombian tax laws.

              At December 31, 1995, the Company had NOLs of approximately $200
million and certain subsidiaries had separate return limitation years ("SRLY")
operating  loss  carryforwards  of approximately $52 million.  The NOLs expire
from  2001  through 2010 and the SRLY operating loss carryforwards expire from
1997 through 2002.  See note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

             The Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $47.3 million at
December 31, 1995, net of a valuation allowance of $54 million, an increase of
$12.8  million  from  December 31, 1994.  The minimum amount of future taxable
income necessary to realize the deferred tax asset is approximately $135
million.    Although  there  can be no assurance the Company will achieve such
levels  of income, management believes the deferred tax asset will be realized
through  increasing  income  from  its operations in Colombia and tax planning
strategies involving the Company's corporate structure.

     Minority Interest in Losses of Subsidiaries

              The Company ceased to record minority interest related to Triton
Europe  following  the purchase of shares held by the minority interest owners
on March 31, 1994.

 Years Ended May 31, 1994 and 1993

     Revenues

            Oil and gas sales decreased by $36.4 million in 1994 compared with
1993  primarily  due  to the sale of the Company's investment in Triton Canada
($13.5  million),  sale  of  working interests properties in the United States
($8.6 million) and lower revenues in France resulting from a drop in
production.    Average oil prices per barrel dropped by $3.88 between 1993 and
1994, resulting in an $8.1 million decrease in revenues during 1994,
principally from price decreases in France ($4.46 per barrel or a $4.7 million
effect).    Price decreases in Indonesia, the United States and Colombia had a
lesser  impact,  representing in the aggregate a $3.3 million effect in 1994.
Colombian production increased to 467,000 barrels in 1994 from 219,000 barrels
in 1993.

     Costs and Expenses

          In 1994, operating expenses of $27.9 million decreased $12.4 million
from  the previous year primarily due to oil and gas operations ($8.3 million)
and  gas gathering and pipeline operations ($3.8 million) that were sold.  Oil
and  gas  production costs (operating expenses) were $26.6 million in 1994 and
$34.9 million in 1993. The decrease in 1994 was principally due to the sale of
Triton Canada and United States properties ($9 million effect) and lower
production in France ($3.1 million effect), partially offset by increased
production  in Colombia ($1.8 million effect) and an accrual for environmental
clean-up  costs in the United States ($1.5 million).  Average production costs
per  equivalent  barrel of oil and gas production were $8.83 in 1994 and $5.95
in  1993.  The increase per barrel in 1994 was primarily due to an accrual for
environmental clean-up costs in the United States and lower United States
production from the sale of working interest properties.

          General and administrative expenses decreased $4.2 million from 1993
to  1994  as  lower costs from oil and gas operations were partially offset by
increases  in  personnel at the corporate office.  Lower expenses in 1994 were
primarily  due  to the restructuring in Europe ($4.6 million effect), the sale
of  Triton Canada ($1.4 million effect), and higher capitalization ($2 million
effect) reflecting increased activity in Malaysia-Thailand.

             Depreciation, depletion and amortization of $19.8 million in 1994
decreased  $25.2  million  from 1993 due to lower depletion related to oil and
gas operations.

            Writedowns of oil and gas properties totaled $44.4 million in 1994
and  $91.2  million in 1993.  During 1994, the writedowns primarily related to
the  Commission's  ceiling limitation requirements for the Company's cost pool
in France.  The 1993 writedowns reflected a decision to eliminate certain
future  development activities in the Villeperdue Field, for which the Company
recorded a significant decrease in its proved undeveloped reserves. A
resulting drop in the Commission's ceiling limitation for these properties led
to a $55.7 million writedown of costs associated with the Company's proved oil
properties.  Additionally, in connection with Triton Europe's decision to
eliminate certain exploration activities in both France and the United
Kingdom, approximately $19.2 million of unevaluated properties were considered
to  be  impaired.  These costs were associated with various license areas that
were relinquished or allowed to expire.

     Other Income and Expenses

          The increase in interest expense from 1993 to 1994 was due to higher
outstanding  debt  resulting  from  the issuance of the 1997 Notes in November
1992 and the 9 3/4% Notes in December 1993, offset by capitalized interest.

          Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates was comprised of the
following (in thousands):

<TABLE>

                          YEAR ENDED MAY 31,

</TABLE>

              Crusader's 1994 earnings improvement resulted from a decrease in
losses  from the smokeless fuel operation in Ireland of $3.4 million and lower
writedowns  of $4.4 million.  The 1993 Crusader loss was primarily a result of
pre-operating  costs  associated  with the smokeless fuel operation in Ireland
($8.4 million) and writedowns of its United States oil and gas properties
($5.3  million).  For the year ended May 31, 1993, the Company's equity in the
losses of Aero Services International, Inc. ("Aero") reflected a loss
provision  of  $7.3  million,  which reduced the carrying amounts of preferred
stock, common stock, outstanding loans from the Company and receivables.

           Other income, net in 1994 included a $7 million gain on the sale of
United States oil and gas properties and a $1.5 million gain on the sale of an
interest in Aero.  In 1993, the Company settled or reached agreement to settle
a number of lawsuits for which a loss provision of $5.5 million was recorded.

     Income Taxes

              The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes",
effective June 1, 1992.  The cumulative benefit of the change to the liability
based method under SFAS No. 109 in 1993 was $4 million, or $.12 per share.


           The income tax benefit of $6.5 million in 1994 was due to a foreign
tax  benefit of $10.7 million resulting from the ceiling test writedown of oil
and gas properties in France, a gain of $1 million relating to a refund
collected  for  taxes  paid  in connection with the 1991 sale of the North Sea
properties and a $2 million refund due in France for the use of  net operating
losses.  These benefits were partially offset by $6.7 million of Canadian
taxes  due  following  the sale of the Company's investment in Triton Canada.
Also included in the 1994 tax provision is deferred tax expense of $10 million
related  to  Colombia and Argentina and a deferred tax benefit of $9.4 million
related to the United States.

          The income tax benefit for fiscal 1993 was $43.9 million,
principally  due  to a foreign tax benefit resulting from the writedown of oil
properties  in  France and recognition of a $25 million net deferred tax asset
in the United States.

     Minority Interest in  Loss of  Subsidiaries

          The changes in minority interest corresponded with movements in
operating losses realized by Triton Europe in 1993 and up until March 31,
1994,  the  date on which the Company acquired the minority interest shares in
Triton Europe.

Discontinued Operations

          The results of operations for the aviation sales and services
segment and wholesale fuel products segment have been reported as discontinued
operations.   In June 1995, the Company sold the assets of its subsidiary, Jet
East,  Inc.,  for $2.9 million in cash and a note, and realized a loss of $1.4
million  on  the  sale.   The Company accrued $.6 million for costs associated
with  final  disposal of the segment, which occurred in August 1995.  The 1994
losses of the wholesale fuel products segment were offset against a loss
provision of $16.1 million, net of tax,  at May 31, 1993.  An additional
accrual of $.7 million, net of tax, was recorded at May 31, 1994 for estimated
operating  losses  associated with the final disposition of this segment.  The
Company  realized a net gain of $13.8 million during its first quarter of 1993
from  the  sale of the Company's seismic equipment sales and services segment,
which was discontinued in fiscal 1992.

International Operations

            The Company derives substantially all of its consolidated revenues
from international operations.  A risk inherent in international operations is
the possibility of realizing economic currency exchange losses when
transactions  are  completed  in currencies other than United States dollars.
The  Company's risk of realizing currency exchange losses currently is largely
mitigated  because the Company receives United States dollars for sales of its
petroleum products in Colombia and Indonesia.

          The Company's 49.9%-owned affiliate, Crusader Limited, operates
primarily in Australia.  In April 1994, Crusader issued $41 million of
exchangeable notes, which are denominated in United States dollars.  The notes
are  exchangeable  into 1,114,000 shares of Triton common stock held in escrow
by  Crusader.    Although the notes are exposed to movements in exchange rates
for  financial reporting purposes, the exchange feature to Triton common stock
acts  as  an  economic  hedge to Crusader.  During the year ended December 31,
1995 and seven months ended December 31, 1994, the Company's share of
Crusader's  unrealized gains (losses), associated with the exchangeable notes,
was approximately ($.9 million) and $1 million, respectively.

Petroleum Price Risk Management

          Oil and natural gas sold by the Company is normally priced with
reference  to a defined benchmark, such as light sweet crude oil traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange (West Texas Intermediate or "WTI").  Actual
prices received vary from the benchmark depending on quality and location
differentials.  It is the Company's policy to use financial market
transactions  with credit-worthy counterparties from time to time primarily to
reduce  risk  associated  with the pricing of a portion of the oil and natural
gas which it sells.  The policy is structured to underpin the Company's
budgeted  revenues and results of operations.  The Company may also enter into
financial  market  transactions  to  benefit from its assessment of the future
prices  of its production relative to other benchmark prices.  There can be no
assurance  that  the  use  of financial market transactions will not result in
losses.

           In the normal course of business, the Company enters into financial
and  commodity  market  transactions for purposes other than trading to manage
its  exposure  to  commodity  price risk.  As a result of such transactions to
date, the Company has set the price benchmark on approximately 44% of its
projected  1996  Colombian  oil production at a weighted average WTI benchmark
price  of  $17.99 per barrel.  In addition, in order to retain the opportunity
to  participate in higher prices, the Company has purchased WTI benchmark call
options  on  a  total of 500,000 barrels for various delivery dates during the
first half of 1996 at strike prices between $19.68 and $20.28.

              In anticipation of entering into a forward oil sale, the Company
entered  into  five-year  commodity  price agreements in April and May 1995 to
hedge  price risk associated with  the portion of the Company's oil production
in Colombia expected to be sold in the forward oil sale.  Sales of the
Company's Colombian production are priced with reference to WTI.  The
agreements,  which  were  entered into with a counterparty with a "AAA" credit
rating, fixed a WTI price benchmark of $18.42 per barrel on approximately 10.4
million  barrels.   Simultaneously, the Company purchased from a credit-worthy
counterparty  call  options  to  retain the ability to benefit from future WTI
price  increases above $20.42 per barrel.  The volumes and expiration dates on
the call options coincided with the volumes and delivery dates under the
commodity  price agreements.  Prior to completion of the forward oil sale, the
commodity price and call agreements had been accounted for as hedging
transactions.    Upon  completion of the forward oil sale, the commodity price
agreements were superseded and the call options, which no longer qualified for
hedge  accounting,  were  recorded as a separate investment at their then fair
market value of $9.3 million.  As a result of this accounting treatment,
fluctuations  in the value of the call options affect other income, positively
or negatively, as noncash adjustments.

Exploration Operations

              Costs related to acquisition, holding and initial exploration of
concessions  in  countries  with no proved reserves are initially capitalized,
including internal costs directly identified with acquisition, exploration and
development activities.  The Company's exploration concessions are
periodically  assessed  for  impairment on a country by country basis.  If the
Company's investment in exploration concessions within a country where no
proved  reserves  are  assigned  is deemed to be impaired, the concessions are
written down to estimated recoverable value.  If the Company abandons all
exploration  efforts  in  a country where no proved reserves are assigned, all
exploration costs associated with the country are expensed.  Due to the
unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities, the amount and timing
of impairment expense are difficult to predict with any certainty.

Environmental Matters

          The Company is subject to extensive environmental laws and
regulations.  These laws regulate the discharge of materials into the
environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the
environmental  effects  of  the disposal or release of petroleum substances at
various  sites.    Also,  the Company remains liable for certain environmental
matters  that may arise from formerly owned fuel businesses that were involved
in the storage, handling and sale of hazardous materials, including fuel
storage  in  underground tanks.  The Company believes that the level of future
expenditures  for  environmental  matters,  including clean-up obligations, is
impractical  to  determine  with  any reliable degree of accuracy.  Management
believes  that  such  costs, when finally determined, will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's operations or consolidated financial
condition.

Certain Factors That Could Affect Future Operations

      Certain statements in this report, including statements of the Company's
and management's expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs, are
forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 21D of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934,  that are dependent on certain events, risks and
uncertainties that may be outside of the Company's control.  These
forward-looking statements include statements of management's plans and
objectives for the Company's future operations and statements of future
economic  performance;  information  regarding drilling schedules, expected or
planned production or transportation capacity, the future construction or
upgrades  of pipelines (including costs), when the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields
might  become  self-financing,  future  production of the Cusiana and Cupiagua
fields,  the  negotiation  of a gas contract and commencement of production in
Malaysia-Thailand, the Company's capital budget and future capital
requirements,  the  Company's  meeting its future capital needs, the Company's
realization  of  its  deferred tax asset, the level of future expenditures for
environmental  costs and the outcome of regulatory and litigation matters; and
the assumptions described in this report underlying such forward-looking
statements.  Actual results and developments could differ materially from
those  expressed  in or implied by such statements due to a number of factors,
including  those  described  in the context of such forward-looking statements
and in notes 18 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

            In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived  Assets  to  be Disposed Of" and Statement No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation."  Both Statements must be adopted in 1996.

            Statement No. 121 will require the review of long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying  amount  of  an asset may not be recoverable.  The impact of adopting
this standard will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
operations or consolidated financial condition.  Statement No. 123 will
require companies to record or disclose the fair value of stock-based
compensation to employees.  The Company currently intends to disclose the fair
value of stock-based compensation to employees.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
 Triton Energy Corporation

In  our  opinion, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended  December  31,  1995,  as of and for the seven months ended December 31,
1994, as of and for the year ended May 31, 1994 and for the year ended May 31,
1993 listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Triton Energy Corporation and its
subsidiaries  at  December 31, 1995 and 1994 and May 31, 1994, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1995,
the  seven months ended December 31, 1994 and the years ended May 31, 1994 and
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial  statements  are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our  audits.    We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally  accepted  auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.    We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.


As  discussed in notes 1 and 11, respectively, the Company changed its methods
of  accounting  for  investments  in marketable securities at May 31, 1994 and
income taxes in 1993.

                  TRITON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     (AMOUNTS IN TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR SHARE AND PER BARREL DATA)


 1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Triton  Energy Corporation is an international oil and gas exploration company
primarily engaged in exploration and production through subsidiaries and
affiliates.   The term "Company" means collectively, Triton Energy Corporation
and  its  subsidiaries and its affiliates through which it conducts business.
The  Company's principal properties and operations are located in Colombia and
Malaysia-Thailand  with the majority of its proved reserves and oil production
located in Colombia.  The Company also has oil and gas interests in other
Latin American and Asian countries, Europe, Australia and North America.

CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR END

Effective January 1, 1995, the Company changed its fiscal year end from May 31
to  December  31.  These financial statements include the Company's transition
period for the seven months ended December 31, 1994.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The  consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of Triton Energy
Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany
balances  and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments
in 20% to 50% owned affiliates in which the Company exercises significant
influence  over  operating  and financial policies are accounted for using the
equity  method.    Investments in less than 20% owned affiliates are accounted
for using the cost method.

 CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

  Cash  equivalents  are  highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less.

Investments  in  marketable  debt securities are reported at fair value except
for  those investments that management has the positive intent and the ability
to  hold  to maturity.  Investments available-for-sale are classified based on
the  stated  maturity of the securities and changes in fair value are reported
as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Trading investments are
classified as current regardless of the stated maturity of the underlying
securities  and  changes in fair value are reported in other income (expense),
net.    Investments  that will be held-to-maturity are classified based on the
stated maturity of the securities.  Prior to May 31, 1994, the Company
accounted for its investments in debt securities at amortized cost and
classified such investments according to the stated maturity of the underlying
securities.   The cumulative effect of changing accounting policy of $1
million  was  recorded as a valuation reserve at May 31, 1994 in stockholders'
equity.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

The  Company  follows  the  full cost method of accounting for exploration and
development  of oil and gas reserves, whereby all productive and nonproductive
costs  are  capitalized.  Individual countries are designated as separate cost
centers.  All capitalized costs plus the undiscounted future development costs
of  proved  reserves are depleted using the unit of production method based on
total proved reserves applicable to each country.  A gain or loss is
recognized on sales of oil and gas properties only when the sale involves
significant reserves.

Costs  related  to acquisition, holding and initial exploration of concessions
in countries with no proved reserves are initially capitalized, including
internal costs directly identified with acquisition, exploration and
development activities.  Costs related to production, general overhead or
similar  activities  are  expensed.  The Company's exploration concessions are
periodically  assessed  for  impairment on a country by country basis.  If the
Company's investment in exploration concessions within a country where no
proved  reserves  are  assigned  is deemed to be impaired, the concessions are
written down to estimated recoverable value.  If the Company abandons all
exploration  efforts  in  a country where no proved reserves are assigned, all
exploration costs associated with the country are expensed.  Due to the
unpredictable  nature  of  exploration drilling activities, the amount and
timing of impairment expense are difficult to predict with any certainty.

  The  net  capitalized  costs of oil and gas properties for each cost center,
less related deferred income taxes, cannot exceed the sum of (i) the estimated
future  net  revenues from the properties, discounted at 10%; (ii) unevaluated
costs not being amortized; and (iii) the lower of cost or estimated fair value
of  unproved  properties being amortized; less (iv) income tax effects related
to  differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of oil and
gas properties.

The estimated costs, net of salvage value, of dismantling facilities or
projects  with  limited lives or facilities that are required to be dismantled
by  contract,  regulation  or  law, and the estimated costs of restoration and
reclamation associated with oil and gas operations, are accrued during
production and classified as a long-term liability.

 Support equipment and facilities are depreciated using the unit of production
method  based  on total reserves of the field related to the support equipment
and  facilities.    Other property and equipment, which includes furniture and
fixtures, vehicles, aircraft and leasehold improvements, are depreciated
principally  on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from
3 to 30 years.

Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and renewals and improvements
are capitalized.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Environmental costs are expensed or capitalized depending on their future
economic  benefit.   Costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations  and have no future economic benefit are expensed.  Liabilities for
future expenditures of a noncapital nature are recorded when future
environmental expenditures and/or remediation is deemed probable, and the
costs can be reasonably estimated.

INCOME TAXES

Deferred  tax  liabilities or assets are recognized for the anticipated future
tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and
the  tax  basis  of the Company's assets and liabilities using the enacted tax
rates in effect at year end.  A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is
recorded  when  it  is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred
tax asset will not be realized.

 REVENUE RECOGNITION

Oil  and  gas  revenues are recognized at the point of first measurement after
production which is generally upon delivery into field storage tank/processing
facilities  or  pipelines.  Cost reimbursements arising from carried interests
granted by the Company are revenues to the extent the reimbursements are
contingent  upon  and  derived  from production.  Obligations arising from net
profits interest conveyances are recorded as operating expenses when the
obligation is incurred.

 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

 The United States dollar is the designated functional currency for all of the
Company's foreign operations, except for foreign operations of certain
affiliates  where  the  local currencies are used as the functional currency.
The  cumulative  translation  effects  from translating balance sheet accounts
from  the  functional  currency into United States dollars at current exchange
rates are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Oil  and natural gas sold by the Company are normally priced with reference to
a defined benchmark, such as light sweet crude oil traded on the New York
Merchantile Exchange (West Texas Intermediate or "WTI").  Actual prices
received vary from the benchmark depending on quality and location
differentials. It is the Company's policy to use financial market transactions
with  credit-worthy  counterparties from time to time primarily to reduce risk
associated  with  the pricing of a portion of the oil and natural gas which it
sells.  The Company may also enter into financial market transactions to
benefit from its assessment of the future prices of its production relative to
other benchmark prices.

Gains or losses on financial market transactions that qualify for hedge
accounting  are  recognized in income as offsets to gains and losses resulting
from  the  underlying hedged transactions.  Premiums paid for financial market
contracts  are capitalized and amortized over the contract period.  Changes in
the fair market value of financial market transactions that do not qualify for
hedge accounting are reflected as noncash adjustments to other income
(expense), net in the period the change occurs.

The Company occasionally enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce risk
of unfavorable exchange rate movements.  The gains or losses arising from
currency  exchange  contracts  offset  foreign exchange gains or losses on the
underlying assets or liabilities or are deferred and offset against the
carrying value of the firm commitment.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

 The Company discontinued its aviation sales and services segment in June
1995.    The  Consolidated Statements of Operations for the seven months ended
December 31, 1994 and the years ended May 31, 1994 and 1993 have been restated
to reflect the aviation sales and services segment as discontinued operations.


Certain  other previously reported financial information has been reclassified
to conform to the current period's presentation.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE

  Earnings  (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of
shares  of common stock outstanding.  The Company's proportionate shares owned
by  Crusader  Limited ("Crusader") are not considered outstanding for purposes
of  determining  weighted  average number of shares outstanding.  Common stock
equivalents were not material or were antidilutive for purposes of the primary
earnings per share calculation.  Fully diluted earnings (loss) per common
share is not presented due to the antidilutive effect of including all
potentially dilutive securities.

THE USE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The  preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In  1995,  the  Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 121,
"Accounting  for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of" and Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."  Both Statements must be adopted in 1996.

Statement  No. 121 will require the review of long-lived assets for impairment
whenever  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable.  The impact of adopting this standard will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or consolidated
financial  condition.    Statement No. 123 will require companies to record or
disclose the fair value of stock-based compensation to employees.  The Company
currently  intends  to  disclose the fair value of stock-based compensation to
employees.

2.     FORWARD SALE OF COLOMBIAN OIL PRODUCTION

In  May  1995,  the  Company sold 10.4 million barrels of oil in a forward oil
sale.    Under  the  terms of the sale, the Company received approximately $87
million  of  the  approximately  $124 million net proceeds, and is entitled to
receive substantially all of the remaining proceeds (now held in various
interest-bearing  reserve  accounts)  when  the Company's Cusiana and Cupiagua
fields  project in Colombia becomes self-financing, which is expected in 1997,
and when certain other conditions are met. The proceeds held in
interest-bearing reserve accounts have been recorded as long-term receivables.
The Company has recorded the net proceeds as deferred income and will
recognize such revenue when the barrels are delivered during a five-year
period  that began in June 1995.  The Company will deliver to the buyer 58,425
barrels  per month through March 1997 and 254,136 barrels per month from April
1997 to March 2000, which represents approximately 15% of the Company's
currently projected Cusiana and Cupiagua production during the five-year
period.

The oil was sold to an unrelated entity.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New
York ("Morgan Guaranty") has agreed to purchase the oil delivered by the
Company to the unrelated entity at a fixed price.

The purchase prices and other terms of the transaction were determined by
arm's-length negotiations among the Company, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Morgan  Guaranty and the unrelated entity.   The prices reflected  the various
parties'  mutual  agreement  as to present fair market value of the barrels of
oil  to  be delivered, taking into account such factors as quality relative to
WTI, transportation costs and timing of deliveries.

3.     DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In August 1995, the Company sold Triton France S. A. through which it held its
interest in the Villeperdue Field to the operator of the field, Coparex
International.  The Company received net proceeds, including repayment of
intercompany  debt,  of  approximately  $16 million and recorded a net gain of
$3.5  million  and a reduction in equity of approximately $3.3 million for the
foreign currency translation adjustment.

In  June  1995, the Company sold the assets of its subsidiary, Jet East, Inc.,
for $2.9 million in cash and a note and realized a loss of $1.4 million on the
sale.  The Company accrued $.6 million for costs associated with final
disposal of the segment, which occurred in August 1995.

  In  the  first quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company completed the sale of its
76% interest in the common stock of Triton Canada Resources Ltd. ("Triton
Canada").    The  Company  received net proceeds of $59 million and recorded a
gain of $47.9 million.

In August and October 1993, the Company sold its United States working
interest  properties for net proceeds of $19.5 million, resulting in a gain of
$7  million.   The properties that were sold accounted for approximately 55.7%
of discounted future net revenues associated with United States proved
properties at May 31, 1993.

  In  fiscal  1993,  the Company initiated a plan to discontinue its remaining
operations in the wholesale fuel products segment.  An accrual of $16.1
million was recorded at May 31, 1993 as an estimate of the results of
operations  for discontinued operations during fiscal 1994 and the anticipated
loss  on  disposal  of  the segment.  An additional accrual of $.7 million was
recorded  at May 31, 1994 for estimated operating losses caused by closing the
sale  of  several  operating divisions later than originally anticipated.  All
operations have been sold.

 On August 12, 1992, the Company sold its remaining 26.9% interest in
Input/Output, Inc. through a secondary public offering.  The net proceeds from
the offering were $24.1 million, which resulted in a net gain of $13.8
million.

4.     PURCHASE OF THE TRITON EUROPE MINORITY INTEREST

  On  March  31,  1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares not
owned  by  the Company, representing the minority shareholders' 40.5% interest
in  Triton Europe plc ("Triton Europe"), in exchange for 522,460 shares of the
Company's  5% Convertible Preferred Stock ("5% preferred stock"), with a value
of  $18  million,  and $2.6 million in cash, including transaction costs.  The
transaction was recorded as a purchase, and accordingly, 100% of Triton
Europe's operating results have been included in the Company's results of
operations  since  March  31, 1994.  The excess of the purchase price over the
carrying  value  of the minority interest in Triton Europe of $3.5 million was
allocated to the full cost pools within Triton Europe.

</TABLE>


At December 31, 1995, the maturites of investments in corporate and other
marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale were less than two
years  with  the exception of one floating rate investment totaling $2 million
which had a stated maturity in excess of ten years.  Proceeds from the sale of
available-for-sale securities were $7.7 million in the year ended December 31,
1995.    Gross unrealized holding losses at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and May
31, 1994 were $.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

6.     INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES


CRUSADER

Crusader,  a 49.9% owned affiliate, is an Australian public company engaged in
oil and gas exploration and production and coal mining in Australia.  The
Company's equity investment in Crusader's common stock was $31.5 million,
$26.2 million and $29.3 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and May 31,
1994, respectively.  At December 31, 1994 and May 31, 1994, the Company's
investment in Crusader also included $8 million and $7.5 million,
respectively,  of  convertible  subordinated  debentures issued by Crusader in
1989.  The quoted market value of the Company's investment in Crusader's
common stock at December 31, 1995 was approximately $56.2 million.

In March 1995, Crusader completed the sale of Saracen Minerals for proceeds of
$14.3 million.  This sale resulted in a net gain to the Company of
approximately  $3.8  million.   In June 1995, Crusader recorded a $5.3 million
loss (the Company's share - $2.7 million) due to a payment to holders of their
12%  Convertible  Subordinated  Unsecured  Notes to effect early redemption of
these Notes to shares of Crusader common stock.  The Company received
approximately  $2.9  million  from its exchange of such notes and recorded the
proceeds  as  other income.  Also in 1995, Crusader contributed its Irish coal
briquetting  operations to Phoenix Coal Limited ("Phoenix"), a corporate joint
venture,  in  exchange  for preference shares and 49% of Phoenix' common
shares outstanding.  Crusader recorded its investment in Phoenix at historical
book value.

On April 28, 1994, Crusader issued $40.9 million aggregate principal amount of
6%  Exchangeable  Senior Notes due February 14, 2004 (the "6% Notes").  The 6%
Notes  are  exchangeable  at the option of the holder after July 27, 1994 into
the shares of the Company's common stock held by Crusader at a price of $36.75
per share upon certain terms.

At  December  31, 1995 and 1994 and May 31, 1994, Crusader owned approximately
3% of the Company's common stock.  Crusader's investment in the Company, using
the cost method of accounting, was $12.2 million, $12.2 million and $11.6
million  at  December  31,  1995 and 1994 and May 31, 1994, respectively.  The
Company's investment in Crusader and additional paid-in capital have each been
reduced  to  eliminate  the  Company's proportionate share of its common stock
owned by Crusader.  During 1993, Crusader recognized a gain of $4.6 million on
the sale of 245,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  The Company's share
of the sale proceeds has been credited to additional paid-in capital.

</TABLE>

 The Company's wholly owned subsidiary Triton Pipeline Colombia, Inc. ("Triton
Pipeline") owns the Company's 9.6% interest in Oleoducto Central S.A.
("OCENSA"). Triton Colombia, Inc. ("Triton Colombia"), a wholly owned
subsidiary  of  the  Company, owns approximately 6.6% in Oleoducto de Colombia
S.A.  ("ODC").    The  investments by Triton Pipeline and Triton Colombia will
enable  the  Company  to  transport its full share of Cusiana and Cupiagua oil
production to the Caribbean port of Covenas.

As part of the purchase of ODC, the Company agreed to assume by counter
guarantee,  directly and proportionally to part of the interest purchased, the
guarantees  granted  to  bank creditors of ODC through Shell Petroleum Company
Ltd. and Shell Overseas Trading Limited. Securities pledged to secure the
guarantees as of May 31, 1994 have been replaced with letters of credit.

Triton Colombia, along with its joint venture partners in the Company's
Cusiana  and  Cupiagua fields in Colombia, advanced 50% of the cost to upgrade
the capacity of the Central Llanos pipeline that was formerly owned by Empresa
Colombiana  de Petroleos ("Ecopetrol").  In November 1995, OCENSA acquired the
Central Llanos pipeline from Ecopetrol.  The Company will recover the
remaining  outstanding receivable based on the production from the Cusiana and
Cupiagua  fields transported through the pipeline.  The outstanding balance of
the  receivable  bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")
plus 1%.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, advances of $8 million and $7
million, respectively, were also recorded in other receivables.  Full
repayment is expected in 1997.

The  Company  amortizes  debt issue costs over the life of the borrowing using
the  interest  method.  Amortization related to the Company's debt issue costs
was $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 1995, $1.3 million in the
seven  months  ended December 31, 1994 and $1.5 million and $.5 million in the
years ended May 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

</TABLE>


 On December 15, 1993, the Company completed the sale of $170 million in
principal amount of 9 3/4% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes ("9 3/4% Notes")
due  December 15, 2000, providing net proceeds to the Company of approximately
$124 million.  The original issue price was 75.1% of par, representing a yield
to  maturity of 9 3/4%.  No interest is payable on the 9 3/4% Notes during the
first  three  years of issue.  Commencing December 15, 1996, interest on the 9
3/4%  Notes  will  accrue  at the rate of 9 3/4% per annum and will be payable
semi-annually  on  June  15  and December 15, beginning on June 15, 1997.  The
Indenture,  as amended, for the 9 3/4% Notes contains financial covenants that
include  certain  limitations on indebtedness, dividends, certain investments,
transactions  with  affiliates,  and  engaging in mergers and consolidations.
Additional provisions include optional and mandatory redemptions, and
requirements associated with changes in control.

On November 13, 1992, the Company completed the sale of $240 million in
principal amount of Senior Subordinated Discount Notes ("1997 Notes") due
November  1, 1997, providing net proceeds to the Company of approximately $126
million.   The original issue price was 54.76% of par, representing a yield to
maturity of 12 1/2% per annum compounded on a semi-annual basis without
periodic  payments of interest.  The Indenture, as amended, for the 1997 Notes
contains  financial  covenants  including certain limitations on indebtedness,
dividends, certain investments, transactions with affiliates, mergers and
consolidations.  Additional provisions include optional and mandatory
redemptions, and requirements associated with changes in control.  As a result
of  certain modifications to the indenture relating to the 1997 Notes effected
in November 1995, the Company's indebtedness limitation was increased to
permit  the  Company  to incur total indebtedness (excluding certain permitted
indebtedness) of up to 25% of the sum of its indebtedness and market
capitalization  of  its capital stock.  In addition, the indenture relating to
the  1997  Notes was modified to eliminate the Company's repurchase obligation
in the event the Company's net worth were to fall below a certain level.

In March 1995, the Company signed a $65 million revolving credit facility with
a bank.  Borrowings bear interest at various rates either based on prime (8.5%
at  December  31,  1995) or LIBOR and mature in October 1997.  The facility is
secured  by  the  Company's  marketable securities portfolio and the Company's
ownership  in Crusader common stock.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company had
borrowed  $48.6  million  and issued a letter of credit for $2.8 million under
the facility.

In  November 1995, the Company signed an unsecured credit facility with a bank
supported by a guarantee issued by the Export-Import Bank of the United States
("EXIM") for $45 million, which matures in January 2001.  Principal and
interest payments are due semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 beginning on
July  15,  1996  and  borrowings bear interest at LIBOR (5.5%  at December 31,
1995)  plus .25%, adjusted on a semi-annual basis. There were no borrowings at
December 31, 1995.

The  aggregate  maturities  of long-term debt for the five years in the period
ending  December  31, 2000 are as follows:  1996 - $1.3 million; 1997 - $241.5
million;  1998  -  $.7 million; 1999 - $.7 million and 2000 - $155.9 million.
The 1997 and 2000 amounts exclude future accretion of interest on the 1997 and
the 9 3/4% Notes.

 11.     INCOME TAXES

  Effective  June  1,  1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for

At December  31,  1995,  the Company had net operating loss ("NOL") and
depletion carryforwards for United States tax purposes of $200.5 million
and $6.8 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 1995,
certain subsidiaries had separate return limitation year ("SRLY")
operating loss and depletion carryforwards of $52.1 million and $13.5
million, respectively, which are available to offset only the future
taxable income of those subsidiaries.  The depletion carryforwards are
available indefinitely. The NOL and SRLY operating loss carryforwards
expire from 1997 through 2010 as follows:

</TABLE>

The  deferred  tax  valuation allowances were reduced by $33.5 million in 1995
due  to  changes  in expectations of future U.S. taxable income resulting from
corporate restructuring during 1995, including redomiciliation of certain
domestic subsidiaries into controlled foreign corporations.  Such
redomiciliation resulted in recognition of current taxable income and a
corresponding decrease in NOLs through recapture of previously recognized
losses.  Furthermore, changes in the timing or nature of actual or anticipated
business transactions, projections and income tax laws can give rise to
significant  adjustments to the Company's deferred tax expense or benefit that
may be reported in the future.

If  certain changes in the Company's ownership should occur, there would be an
annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized.  To
the extent a change in ownership does occur, the limitation is not expected to
materially impact the utilization of such carryforwards.

During the year ended May 31, 1993, the Company added $3.9 million to
additional  paid-in capital for United States tax benefits attributable to the
utilization  of net operating loss carryforwards.  These carryforwards related
to periods prior to the Company's corporate readjustments.

12.     EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

 PENSION PLANS

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
employees  in  the  United States.  The benefits are based on years of service
and the employee's final average monthly compensation.  Contributions are
intended  to provide for benefits attributed to past and future services.  The
Company  also  has the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") that is
unfunded and provides supplemental pension benefits to a select group of
management and key employees.

  The  projected benefit obligations at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and May 31,
1994 assume a discount rate of 8%, 8% and 7%, respectively, and a rate of
increase in compensation expense of 5%.  The impact of the change in the
discount rate from 7% to 8% reduced the projected benefit obligation at
December  31, 1994 for both the defined benefit plan and SERP by $.5 million.
The  expected long-term rate of return on assets is 9% for the defined benefit
plan.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

 Effective January 1, 1994, the Company amended and restated the employee
stock ownership plan to form a 401(k) plan ("the plan").  The Company
recognizes  expense  relating  to the plan based on actual amounts contributed
since  inception  of  the  plan.  The Company used the shares allocated method
prior to the January 1, 1994 amendment.




13.     STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

 PREFERRED STOCK

In  connection with the acquisition of the minority interest in Triton Europe,
the  Company  designated  a series of 550,000 preferred shares (522,460 shares
issued) as 5% preferred stock, no par value, with a stated value of $34.41 per
share.  Each share of the Company's 5% preferred stock is convertible into one
common share, subject to adjustment in certain events.  The 5% preferred stock
is convertible anytime on or after October 1, 1994, and bears a fixed
cumulative cash dividend of 5% per annum payable semi-annually on March 30 and
September  30,  commencing September 30, 1994.  If not converted earlier, each
5%  preferred share will be redeemed on March 30, 2004, either for cash, or at
the  option  of  the Company, for the Company's common stock.  At December 31,
1995, 410,017 preferred shares were outstanding.

CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE PLAN

 The Company has a convertible debenture plan under which key management
personnel and others  may purchase debentures that are convertible into shares
of the Company's common stock.  The aggregate number of common shares issuable
upon  conversion  of the debentures cannot exceed 1,000,000 shares, subject to
adjustment in certain events.  Each debenture represents an unsecured,
subordinated  obligation  due  in seven to ten years and may be redeemed after
three years at a redemption price of 120% of the principal amounts.  The
debentures  outstanding  at December 31, 1995 bear interest at the prime rate,
have  a  conversion date of one year following the date of issuance and may be
converted into the Company's common stock at a price of $42.75 per share
(debentures  covering  250,000 shares issued in May 1995) and $25.13 per share
(debentures covering 250,000 shares issued in April 1994), subject to
adjustment in certain events.  At December 31, 1995, approximately 4,000
shares  were available for issuance upon conversion of debentures eligible for
sale under the plan.

The  participants  in  the plan purchased debentures by delivery of promissory
notes to the Company.  The promissory notes are secured by the debentures that
are  held as security by the Company, are due on the earlier of ten years from
the  date  of  issue  or termination of employment and require annual interest
payments equal to prime plus 1/8%. The debentures are reflected as a
noncurrent liability, net of the related promissory notes, in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as follows:

 SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

  In May 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a new Shareholder
Rights  Plan  under which preferred stock rights were issued to holders of its
common  stock  at the rate of one right for each share of common stock held as
of  the close of business on June 2, 1995.  The rights were issued in place of
the  Company's  previous preferred share purchase rights issued in 1990, which
have been redeemed.

Generally,  the rights become exercisable only if a person acquires beneficial
ownership  of  15% or more of the Company's common stock or announces a tender
offer for 15% or more of the common stock.  If, among other events, any person
becomes  the  beneficial  owner of 15%  or more of the Company's common stock,
each  right  not  owned by such person generally becomes the right to purchase
such  number  of  shares of common stock of the Company, which is equal to the
amount obtained by dividing the right's exercise price (currently $120) by 50%
of  the market price of the common stock on the date of the first occurrence.
In addition, if the Company is subsequently merged or certain other
extraordinary business transactions are consummated, each right generally
becomes a right to purchase such number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person which is equal to the amount obtained by dividing the right's
exercise  price  by 50% of the market price of the common stock on the date of
the  first  occurrence.    The rights will expire on May 22, 2005, unless such
expiration date is extended or unless the rights are earlier redeemed or
exchanged  by the Company.  At any time prior to a person acquiring beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, the Company may redeem
the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN

The Company has a stock appreciation rights ("SARs") plan which authorizes the
granting  of  SARs  to non-employee directors of the Company.   Upon exercise,
SARs  allow  the  holder  to receive the difference between the SARs' exercise
price  and  the  fair market value of the common shares covered by SARs on the
exercise  date  and expire at the earlier of ten years or a date based on the
termination of the holder's membership on the board of directors.  At December
31,  1995,  SARs  covering 25,000 common shares, with an exercise price of $8
per share, were outstanding.

RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN

  The Company has a restricted stock plan that provides for the award of up to
50,000  common shares to eligible key officers and employees.  At the November
11,  1993  annual  meeting, this plan was amended to also serve as an employee
stock  purchase  plan.  At December 31, 1995, 20,124 shares were available for
issuance under the plan.

CORPORATE READJUSTMENTS

  To  permit  payments  of common stock dividends from future earnings without
being penalized by an accumulated deficit, Article 4.13B of the Texas Business
Corporation  Act formerly provided that a company may, subject to its board of
directors'  approval, eliminate that deficit through application of additional
paid-in  capital.    Pursuant  to board of directors' approvals on January 12,
1987  and  August 6, 1986, the Company eliminated accumulated deficits of $5.3
million at November 30, 1986 and $28.7 million at May 31, 1986.

14. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT  AND
    CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

At December 31, 1995 and 1994 and May 31, 1994, the Company's financial
instruments included cash, cash equivalents, short-term receivables,
marketable  securities,  long-term  receivables, short-term and long-term debt
and  financial market transactions.  The fair value of cash, cash equivalents,
short-term receivables and short-term debt approximated carrying values
because  of the short maturities of these instruments.  The fair values of the
Company's  marketable  securities,  long-term receivables and financial market
transactions, based on broker quotes, quoted market prices and discounted cash
flows approximated the carrying values.  The estimated fair value of long-term
debt,  based  on quoted market prices and market data for similar instruments,
was  $396 million, $300 million and $299 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994
and May 31, 1994, respectively.

RISK MANAGEMENT

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into financial and
commodity  market  transactions  for purposes other than trading to manage its
exposure  to  commodity price risk.  As a result of such transactions to date,
the  Company has set the price benchmark on approximately 44% of its projected
1996  Colombian  oil  production  at a weighted average WTI benchmark price of
$17.99 per barrel.  In addition, in order to retain the opportunity to
participate  in  higher  prices,  the Company has purchased WTI benchmark call
options  on  a  total of 500,000 barrels for various delivery dates during the
first half of 1996 at strike prices between $19.68 and $20.28.

In  anticipation  of  entering  into the forward oil sale, the Company entered
into five-year commodity price agreements in April and May 1995 to hedge price
risk  associated  with the portion of the Company's oil production in Colombia
expected to be sold in the forward oil sale.  Sales of the Company's Colombian
production are priced with reference to WTI.  The agreements, which were
entered into with a counterparty with a "AAA" credit rating, fixed a WTI price
benchmark of $18.42 per barrel on approximately 10.4 million barrels.

Simultaneously,  the  Company purchased from a credit-worthy counterparty call
options to retain the ability to benefit from future WTI price increases above
$20.42 per barrel.  The volumes and expiration dates on the call options
coincided with the volumes and delivery dates under the commodity price
agreements.   Prior to completion of the forward oil sale, the commodity price
and call agreements had been accounted for as hedging transactions.  Upon
completion of the forward oil sale, the commodity price agreements were
superseded and the call options, which no longer qualified for hedge
accounting,  were  recorded as a separate investment at their then fair market
value  of $9.3 million.  Noncash charges of $4.2 million were recorded for the
year ended December 31, 1995.

 The Company entered into a foreign exchange contract in fiscal 1994 to
purchase C$8.6 million to hedge exposure to a Canadian tax liability resulting
from  the sale of Triton Canada common stock.  At May 31, 1994, the fair value
of  the  foreign  exchange  contract, which matured in July 1994, was based on
quoted  rates  for  contracts  with similar terms and maturity dates; however,
such fair value was offset by gains on the tax liability hedged by the
contract,  so  there  was no significant difference between the recorded value
and the fair value of the Company's net foreign exchange position.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit
risk consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables and
financial market transactions.  The Company places its cash equivalents,
marketable securities and financial market transactions with high credit
quality  financial  institutions.   The Company believes the risk of incurring
losses related to credit risk is remote.

Triton  Colombia sells its crude oil production from the Cusiana Field through
an  agreement  with  the operator of the field to approximately ten to fifteen
refineries located primarily in the United States.  The Company does not
believe that the loss of any single customer or a termination of the agreement
with the operator would have a long-term material adverse effect on its
operations.

</TABLE>
 During fiscal 1994, the carrying amounts of the Company's evaluated oil
properties in France were written down by $43.2 million through application of
the  ceiling  limitation  prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  "Commission")  principally as a result of a temporary drop in oil prices
and a downward revision in estimated reserves.

Included in the writedowns of evaluated and unevaluated properties during
fiscal 1993 were $55.7 million and $11 million, respectively, of costs
associated with operations in France and an $8.2 million writedown of
unevaluated  costs  associated with onshore properties in the United Kingdom.
These  writedowns  resulted  from  Triton Europe's decision to curtail certain
exploration  and development activities in Europe. As such, proved undeveloped
reserves  in  Europe  were reduced, thereby requiring a writedown of evaluated
costs as a result of the Commission's ceiling limitation for these properties.
  The  writedowns  of  unevaluated costs in both France and the United Kingdom
were  associated  with various license areas that were relinquished or allowed
to expire.  Similar cutbacks in Indonesia resulted in writedowns of costs
associated with evaluated properties of $8.7 million in fiscal 1993.

18.     CERTAIN FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE OPERATIONS

Certain statements in this report, including statements of the Company's and
management's expectations,  intentions,  plans  and beliefs, including those
contained in or implied by "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, are forward-looking statements, as
defined in Section 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that are
dependent on certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of
the Company's control.  These forward-looking statements include statements
of management's plans and objectives for the Company's future operations and
statements of future economic performance; information regarding drilling
schedules, expected or planned production or transportation capacity, the
future construction or upgrades  of pipelines (including costs), when the
Cusiana and Cupiagua fields might  become  self-financing, future  production
of the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields,  the  negotiation  of a gas contract and
commencement of production in Malaysia-Thailand, the Company's capital budget
and future capital requirements, the  Company's  meeting its future capital
needs, the Company's realization  of  its  deferred tax asset, the level
of future expenditures for environmental costs and the outcome of regulatory
and litigation matters; and the assumptions described in this report
underlying such forward-looking statements.  Actual results and
developments could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by
such statements due to a number of factors, including those described in
the context of such forward-looking statements, as well as those presented
below and in note 19.


     CERTAIN FACTORS RELATING TO THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY

The Company's strategy is to focus its exploration activities on what the
Company believes are relatively high potential prospects.  No assurance can be
given that the Company will be successful in its exploration activities.

Oil prices have been subject to significant fluctuations over the past several
decades.  The Company expects that levels of production maintained by the
Organization  of  Petroleum Exporting Countries member nations and other major
oil  producing  countries, and the actions of oil traders, will continue to be
major determinants of crude oil price movements in the near term.  It is
impossible to predict future oil price movements with any certainty.

The  Company's  oil  and gas business is subject to all of the operating risks
normally  associated  with  the exploration for and production of oil and gas,
including  blowouts,  cratering, pollution, earthquakes, labor disruptions and
fires,  each  of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas
wells, formations, production facilities or properties, or in personal injury.
 In accordance with customary industry practices, the Company maintains
insurance  coverage  limiting  financial  loss resulting from certain of these
operating hazards.  Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or
underinsured events would reduce revenues and increase costs to the Company.

The Company's oil and gas business is also subject to laws, rules and
regulations  in the countries in which it operates, which generally pertain to
production  control,  taxation,  environmental  and pricing concerns and other
matters relating to the petroleum industry.

The Company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.  These
laws regulate the discharge of oil, gas or other materials into the
environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the
environmental  effects of the disposal or release of such materials at various
sites.  The Company does not believe that its environmental risks are
materially  different  from  those  of comparable companies in the oil and gas
industry.  Nevertheless, no assurance can be given that environmental laws and
regulations will not, in the future, adversely affect the Company's results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.  Pollution and similar
environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.



<PAGE>
CERTAIN FACTORS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

The Company derives substantially all of its consolidated revenues from
international  operations.  Risks inherent in international operations include
loss  of  revenue,  property and equipment from such hazards as expropriation,
nationalization, war, insurrection and other political risks; trade protection
measures; risks of increases in taxes and governmental royalties; and
renegotiation  of  contracts with governmental entities; as well as changes in
laws and policies governing operations of other companies.  Other risks
inherent in international operations are the possibility of realizing economic
currency  exchange  losses when transactions are completed in currencies other
than  United States dollars and the Company's ability to freely repatriate its
earnings under existing exchange control laws.  To date, the Company's
international operations have not been materially affected by these risks.

      COMPETITION

The  Company encounters strong competition from major oil companies (including
government-owned  companies),  independent  operators  and other companies for
favorable  oil and gas concessions, licenses, production sharing contracts and
leases, drilling rights and markets.  Additionally, the governments of certain
countries in which the Company operates may from time to time give
preferential treatment to their nationals.  The oil and gas industry as a
whole  also  competes  with  other industries in supplying the energy and fuel
requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.

      MARKETS

Crude  oil,  natural  gas, condensate and other oil and gas products generally
are sold to other oil and gas companies, government agencies and other
industries.  The  availability  of ready markets for oil and gas that might be
discovered  by the Company and the prices obtained for such oil and gas depend
on  many  factors  beyond the Company's control, including the extent of local
production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity and capacity of pipelines
and  other transportation facilities, fluctuating demands for oil and gas, the
marketing  of competitive fuels, and the effects of governmental regulation of
oil and gas production and sales.  Pipeline facilities do not exist in certain
areas of exploration and, therefore, any actual sales of discovered oil or gas
might be delayed for extended periods until such facilities are constructed.

      CERTAIN FACTORS RELATING TO COLOMBIA

The Company is a participant in significant oil and gas discoveries located in
the  Llanos  Basin  in the foothills of the Andes Mountains, approximately 160
kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Bogota, Colombia.  The Company owns
interests in three contiguous areas known as the Santiago de las Atalayas
("SDLA"),  Tauramena  and  Rio Chitamena contract areas.  Well results to date
indicate that significant oil and gas deposits lie across the Cusiana and
Cupiagua fields.

Largely  due to complex geology, drilling of wells in the Cusiana and Cupiagua
fields  has  been comparatively difficult, lengthy in duration and expensive.
The  Company believes that considerable progress has been achieved in reducing
the  time and expenditures required to drill and complete wells in the Cusiana
and  Cupiagua  fields  based on experience gained from initial wells drilled.
Although  there  can be no assurance, the Company believes that the experience
gained  in  the area to date will allow the operator to continue to reduce the
time and expenditures required to drill and complete wells in the area.
However,  because the Company is not the operator of these contract areas, the
Company does not control the timing or manner of these operations.

Full development of reserves in the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields will take
several years and require additional drilling and extensive production
facilities, which in turn will require significant additional capital
expenditures,  the  ultimate  amount  of which cannot be predicted.  Pipelines
connect  the  major  producing  fields in Colombia to export facilities and to
refineries.  These pipelines are in the process of being upgraded and expanded
to accommodate production from the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields.

Guerrilla  activity  in Colombia has from time to time disrupted the operation
of oil and gas projects and increased costs.  Although the Colombian
government,  the Company and its partners have taken steps to improve security
and  improve  relations  with  the local population, there can be no assurance
that  attempts  to  reduce or prevent guerrilla activity will be successful or
that such activity will not disrupt operations in the future.

Numerous Colombian government officials, including the President, are the
subjects  of  investigations  and  allegations that they have accepted illegal
campaign  contributions.    These  circumstances have led to speculation as to
whether  these officials will remain in office.  The President has stated that
any  such  illicit contributions were made without his knowledge.  In response
to the allegations, the leadership of the opposition Conservative Party
withdrew its support of the Government and certain cabinet ministers and
ambassadors  and a high ranking military officer resigned.  Any changes in the
holders  of  significant government offices could have adverse consequences in
the  Company's  relationship  with  the Colombian national oil company and the
Colombian government's ability to control guerrilla activities, and could
exacerbate the factors relating to foreign operations discussed above.  At the
same time, Colombia is among 31 nations whose progress in stemming the
production  and transit of illegal drugs is subject to annual certification by
the President of the United States.  In March 1996, the President of the
United States announced that Colombia would neither be certified nor granted a
national  interest  waiver  and  the United States Congress is not expected to
oppose  the  President's  action.   The consequences of the failure to receive
certification generally include the following:  all bilateral aid, except
anti-narcotics  and humanitarian aid, will be suspended; EXIM and the Overseas
Private  Investment Corporation will not approve financing for new projects in
Colombia,  although  currently approved EXIM financings are not expected to be
affected;  U.S.  representatives  at multilateral lending institutions will be
required  to vote against all loan requests from Colombia, although such votes
will not constitute vetoes; and the President and Congress retain the right to
apply future trade sanctions.

      CERTAIN FACTORS RELATING TO MALAYSIA-THAILAND

The  Company  is a partner in a significant gas exploration project located in
the  upper  Malay  Basin  in the Gulf of Thailand approximately 450 kilometers
northeast of Kuala Lumpur and 750 kilometers south of Bangkok.  The Company is
a  contractor  under  a Production Sharing Contract covering Block A-18 of the
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area.  Test results for the initial
exploratory wells indicate that significant gas deposits lie under the Block.

Development  of gas production is in the early planning stages but is expected
to  take  several  years  and require the drilling of additional wells and the
installation of production facilities, which will require significant
additional capital expenditures, the ultimate amount of which cannot be
predicted.  Pipelines will also be required to be connected between Block A-18
and ultimate markets.   The terms on which any gas produced from the Company's
contract  area  in  Malaysia-Thailand may be sold may be adversely affected by
the present monopoly gas purchase and transportation conditions in both
Thailand  and  Malaysia, including the Thai national oil company's monopoly in
transportation within Thailand and its territorial waters.

     LITIGATION

The outcome of litigation and its impact on the Company are difficult to
predict  due  to many uncertainties, such as jury verdicts, the application of
laws  to  various factual situations, the actions that may or may not be taken
by  other  parties and the availability of insurance.  In addition, in certain
situations, such as environmental claims, one defendant may be responsible, or
potentially responsible, for the liabilities of other parties. Moreover,
circumstances  could  arise under which the Company may elect to settle claims
at amounts that exceed the Company's expected liability for such claims in
order to avoid costly litigation.  Judgments or settlements could, therefore,
exceed any reserves.

19.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Continued development of the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields ("the Fields"),
including  drilling and construction of additional production facilities, will
require significant capital.  In 1995 and early 1996, Carigali-Triton
Operating  Company  ("CTOC")  discovered gas on its first three wells on Block
A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand.
Further exploration and development activities on Block A-18, as well as
exploratory drilling in other countries, will also require substantial
capital.    The Company's capital budget for the year ending December 31, 1996
is approximately $260 million, excluding capitalized interest, of which
approximately $157 million relates to the Fields, $34 million relates to Block
A-18, $40 million relates to the Company's exploration and drilling program in
other  parts of the world, and $29 million relates to capital contributions to
OCENSA.    Capital  requirements  for full field development of the Fields are
expected to continue at substantial levels into 1997, and capital requirements
for exploration and development relating to Block A-18 are expected to
increase significantly into 1998.

In December 1994, the Company, along with other investors, formed an
independent  company,   OCENSA, to own, expand, finance and operate a pipeline
system from the Fields to the port of Covenas.  The Company's ownership
percentage  is  9.6%.    OCENSA's capitalization plan contemplates an ultimate
capital structure of approximately 30% equity from the Company and other
investors  and  70% debt.  As part of the formation of OCENSA, Triton Colombia
entered  into  a transportation agreement with OCENSA in which Triton Colombia
commits to transport all crude from the Fields through OCENSA's pipeline
system.

OCENSA  has  raised significant amounts of debt in separate tranches supported
by various agreements with the Company or its partners as the case may be
(relating, in particular, to tariffs on each partner's throughput).  The
Company  assisted OCENSA in securing one such tranche for $60 million in 1995,
which is supported by the Company's tariff commitments for its share of
production from the Fields.  The Company has agreed to assist OCENSA in
raising an additional $60 million in 1996.  In the event such amount cannot be
raised, OCENSA may call for an advance from the Company.

In November 1995, the Company signed a $45 million loan agreement supported by
a  guarantee issued by EXIM.  The loan finances expenditures for exported U.S.
goods and services for phase one development of the Cusiana Field in Colombia.
 The Company borrowed approximately $43 million against this facility in early
1996.

As part of the forward oil sale transaction, Morgan Guaranty agreed to
purchase up to $40 million of additional production on a forward sale basis in
the event that the Company is otherwise unable to meet its cash call
obligations in respect of the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields project.  The number
of  barrels  would  be determined based on a formula intended to reflect their
fair market value. The Company does not expect, however, to sell any
production under this agreement.

The  Company expects to meet capital needs in the future with a combination of
some  or  all  of the following: its long-term revolving credit facility, cash
flow  from  its Colombian operations, cash on hand and marketable securities,
asset  sales,  and the issuance of debt and equity securities.  As a result of
certain  modifications to the indenture relating to the 1997 Notes effected in
November  1995,  the Company's indebtedness limitation was increased to permit
the Company to incur total indebtedness (excluding certain permitted
indebtedness) of up to 25% of the sum of its indebtedness and market
capitalization  of  its capital stock.  In addition, the indenture relating to
the  1997  Notes was modified to eliminate the Company's repurchase obligation
in the event the Company's net worth were to fall below a certain level.

During  the  normal course of business, the Company is subject to the terms of
various operating agreements and capital commitments associated with the
exploration and development of its oil and gas properties.  It is management's
belief  that  such commitments, including the capital requirements in Colombia
and Malaysia-Thailand discussed above, will be met without any material
adverse effect on the Company's operations or consolidated financial
condition.

The  Company leases office space, other facilities and equipment under various
operating leases expiring through 2001.  Total rental expense was $1.9 million
for  the year ended December 31, 1995, $1.3 million for the seven months ended
December 31, 1994 and  $2.6 million and $4 million for the years ended May 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  At December 31, 1995, the minimum payments
required  over the next five years are as follow:  1996 - $2.3 million; 1997 -
$2.2 million; 1998 - $1.8 million; 1999 - $1.4 million; and 2000 - $.7
million.

 GUARANTEES

  At December 31, 1995, the Company had guaranteed loans of approximately $6.1
million  of a Colombian pipeline company in which the Company has an ownership
interest and guaranteed performance of $11 million in future exploration
expenditures  in various countries.  These commitments are backed primarily by
unsecured letters of credit and bank guarantees.

REGULATORY MATTERS

  The  Company continues to cooperate with inquiries by the Commission and the
Department  of Justice (the "Department") regarding possible violations of the
Foreign  Corrupt  Practices Act in connection with the Company's operations in
Indonesia.    Based upon the information available to the Company to date, the
Company  believes  that  it will be able to resolve any issues that either the
Commission  or  the Department ultimately might raise concerning these matters
in  a  manner  that  would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
operations or consolidated financial condition.

<PAGE>
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.  These
laws regulate the discharge of oil, gas or other materials into the
environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the
environmental  effects of the disposal or release of such materials at various
sites.    Also,  the  Company remains liable for certain environmental matters
that  may  arise from formerly owned fuel businesses that were involved in the
storage,  handling  and sale of hazardous materials, including fuel storage in
underground tanks.  The Company believes that the level of future expenditures
for environmental matters, including clean-up obligations, is impracticable to
determine with a precise and reliable degree of accuracy.  Management believes
that  such  costs,  when  finally determined, will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's operations or consolidated financial condition.
During the year ended May 31, 1994, the Company accrued $4.4 million for
environmental costs.

LITIGATION

  The Company is also subject to various litigation matters, none  of which is
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or
consolidated financial condition.

20.     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 The Company charged Crusader $.6 million for the year ended December 31,
1995, $.3 million for the seven months ended December 31, 1994 and $.6 million
for  the  years ended May 31, 1994 and 1993 for administrative services.  Also
during  fiscal  1994, the Company was paid $1.2 million by Crusader for acting
as agent in issuing its 6% Notes and recorded $.6 million as other income.

</TABLE>

Corporate assets were principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, the United States deferred tax asset and investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates.    Other identifiable assets primarily represented
capitalized  costs  related  to  the Company's exploration activities in other
areas of the world, no one country of which is material except Argentina
($36.3 million at December 31, 1995).

22.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

During January and February 1996, the Company borrowed approximately $43
million against its credit line supported by the EXIM guarantee.  The proceeds
from  the  borrowing were used primarily to pay down outstanding bank lines of
credit.


The Company has called a special meeting of its stockholders to be held on
March 25, 1996 at which the stockholders will vote on the proposed
reorganization of the Company (the "Reorganization").  Pursuant to the
Reorganization, Triton Energy Limited, a newly formed Cayman Islands company
and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Triton Cayman"), will become
the parent holding company of the Company through the merger of a wholly owned
subsidiary of Triton Cayman with and into the Company.  If the Reorganization
is consummated, the Company will become a subsidiary of Triton Cayman and
Triton Cayman will continue to conduct the businesses (through subsidiaries
and affiliates) in which the Company is now engaged.  The Company and Triton
Cayman have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Proxy
Statement/Joint Prospectus dated as of February 23, 1996 relating to the
special meeting and the securities to be issued if the Reorganization is
consummated.

Upon consummation of the Reorganization, each outstanding share of common
stock of Triton Energy Corporation at the effective time of the Reorganization
(the "Effective Time") (other than shares held in treasury and shares as to
which an election to receive Equity Units (as defined below) has been made and
not withdrawn, subject to certain limitations) will be automatically converted
into one Class A Ordinary Share of Triton Cayman.  Holders of not less than
15% but not more than 25% of the outstanding shares of common stock at the
Effective Time, in the aggregate, may make an unconditional election to
receive an equity unit ("Equity Unit") consisting of one Class B Ordinary
Share of Triton Cayman and one-tenth of one share of participating preferred
stock of Triton Energy Corporation for each share of common stock of Triton
Energy Corporation owned in lieu of such shares being converted into Class A
Ordinary Shares.  Each such Class B Ordinary Share and one-tenth of a share of
participating preferred stock would be paired and after such pairing could
only be traded together as a unit.  If holders of less than 15% of the
outstanding shares of common stock, in the aggregate, elect to receive Equity
Units, no Equity Units will be issued and all such shares would be
automatically converted into Class A Ordinary Shares of Triton Cayman.

Subsequent to the Reorganization, the Company intends to transfer
substantially all of its businesses or subsidiaries located outside the United
States, other than the Company's interests in the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields
in Colombia, and interests in Argentina, to Triton Cayman. The value of the
assets to be transferred will be determined by the Company based on
independent third party appraisals as of the dates of the transfers.

Colombia is among 31 nations whose progress in stemming the production and
transit of illegal drugs is subject to annual certification by the President
of the United States.  In March 1996, the President of the United States
announced that Colombia would neither be certified nor granted a national
interest waiver and the United States Congress is not expected to oppose the
President's action.  See "Certain Factors Relating to Colombia" in note 18 for
further discussion of the implications of this announcement.

In March 1996, the Company entered into an agreement providing for the sale of
substantially all of its royalty and mineral interests in the United States,
the consummation of which is subject to customary conditions.  The net
proceeds from the sale, which will be made effective January 1, 1996, are
expected to be approximately $23.8 million and will result in a gain of
approximately $4 million.

In March 1996, the Company executed an agreement with Deminex Colombia
Petroleum GmbH ("Deminex") providing Deminex the right to earn a 50% interest
in the El Pinal, Guayabo A and B and Las Amelias contract areas.  The
effectiveness of the agreement is conditioned on the approval by December 31,
1996 of Ecopetrol and the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia.  The
agreement provides for an initial payment by Deminex of approximately $13.4
million.  In addition to costs associated with its 50% interest in the
contract areas, Deminex shall pay certain direct exploratory costs of the
Company up to a maximum of approximately $16.8 million.  All payments due
prior to the receipt of the requisite approvals will be held in escrow.

</TABLE>

Gross profit (loss) consists of sales and other operating revenues less
operating  expenses,  depreciation,  depletion and amortization and writedowns
pertaining to operating assets.

In  the  fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a loss provision of $1.1
million related to property available for sale, and Crusader recorded a
writedown of $3 million (the Company's share - $1.5 million) related to a coal
property of its majority-owned affiliate.  Also, the Company recorded a charge
to deferred tax expense of $2.8 million due to a change in income tax rates in
Colombia  and  a benefit of $8.5 million based on a reduction in the valuation
allowance on its deferred United States tax asset.

In  December  1994,  the Company recorded equity in losses of Crusader of $4.2
million  due  principally  to  adjustments to deferred taxes and writedowns of
unproved oil and gas properties in the Philippines and Argentina.

In  the  fourth  quarter  of the year ended May 31, 1994, the Company recorded
writedowns of $6.8 million, primarily resulting from application of the
Commission's ceiling limitation caused by a downward revision in the estimated
reserves  for  France.   The Company also recognized a gain of $1.5 million on
the sale of its investment in Aero.

31  effective January 1, 1995.  These financial statements cover the Company's

The  Company has significant property acquisition and exploration costs that
have  not  been evaluated and are not currently subject to depletion.  At this
time  the  Company  is unable to predict either the timing of the inclusion of
those  costs and the related oil and gas reserves in its depletion computation
or their potential future impact on depletion rates.  Drilling or other
exploration activities are being conducted in each of these cost centers.

 OIL AND GAS RESERVE DATA (UNAUDITED)

The  following  tables present the Company's estimates of its proved oil and
gas  reserves.  These estimates were prepared by the Company's independent and
internal  petroleum  reservoir engineers.  The Company emphasizes that reserve
estimates are approximates and are expected to change as additional
information  becomes available.  Reservoir engineering is a subjective process
of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
in an exact way, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the
quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and
judgment.   Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the reserves set forth
herein  will ultimately be produced nor can there be assurance that the proved
undeveloped  reserves  will  be developed within the periods anticipated.  Oil
reserves  are  stated  in  thousands of barrels and gas reserves are stated in
millions  of cubic feet.  The largest portion of the Company's reserves relate
to the SDLA, Tauramena and Rio Chitamena Association Contract Areas in
Colombia.  The Company had a 20% interest in the reserves of SDLA and
Tauramena for 1992.  The reserves for 1995, 1994 and 1993 reflect the
equalization  of  these  interests to 24% and Ecopetrol's decision to exercise
its contractual right to acquire 50% of the working interest through the
declaration  of  commerciality.    The Company consequently has a 9.6% working
interest in these areas after 20% governmental royalties.

 STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH INFLOWS AND CHANGES
THEREIN (UNAUDITED)

  The following table presents a standardized measure of discounted future net
cash  inflows  relating  to  proved oil and gas reserves.  Future cash inflows
were computed by applying year end prices of oil and gas relating to the
Company's proved reserves to the estimated year end quantities of those
reserves.  Future price changes were considered only to the extent provided by
contractual agreements in existence at year end.  Future production and
development  costs  were computed by estimating those expenditures expected to
occur  in  developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end
of  the  year,  based  on year end costs.  Actual future cash inflows may vary
considerably  and  the standardized measure does not necessarily represent the
fair value of the Company's oil and gas reserves.

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a
resolution authorizing the Company to enter into this Supplemental Indenture;
and

          WHEREAS, the Company has requested the Trustee and the Trustee has
agreed to join in the execution of this Supplemental Indenture in accordance
with the terms of Section 9.02 of the Indenture and subject to the conditions
set forth herein;

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual
agreements herein contained, the Company and the Trustee mutually covenant and
agree for the equal and proportionate benefit of the Holders from time to time
of the Securities as follows:

          SECTION 1.  Amendments

     (a)  Amendment to the Indenture to allow Holding Company.

     Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.02 of the Indenture to
the contrary, if, at any time during the term of the Indenture, the Company
effects a transaction pursuant to which it becomes a Subsidiary of a holding
company (the "Parent") organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands for the
purpose of becoming the parent holding company of the Company, the Company may
deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as
required by Sections 1.04 and 9.03 of the Indenture and upon delivery of such
Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, the Company, the Parent and the
Trustee shall enter into an amended and restated indenture substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Amended and Restated Indenture")
(which Amended and Restated Indenture provides for the guarantee of the
payment of the Securities by the Parent) without the consent of the Holders of
the Securities and without any other action on the part of such Holders and
upon the execution thereof, the Amended and Restated Indenture shall be
binding upon the Company, the Parent, the Trustee and all Holders of the
Securities.

     In the event that the creation of the holding company is effected through
the merger (the "Merger") of a person that is a Subsidiary of the Parent with
and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"), the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
satisfy the condition contained in Section 8.01(4) of the Indenture and the
Holders hereby waive any such requirement in connection with the Merger;
provided that such waiver does not constitute a waiver of any other rights of
the Holders under the Indenture.

     (b)  Section 1.01 shall be amended by deleting the definitions of
"Columbian Assets" and "Permitted Indebtedness" and substituting therefor, in
their respective proper alphabetical orders, the following definitions:

  "'Colombian Assets' means (i) the Capital Stock of Triton Colombia, (ii) the
Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of Triton Colombia, (iii) the shares,
interests, participations, rights or other equivalent means of ownership owned
by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company in any Joint Venture, provided
such Joint Venture owns, directly or indirectly, oil and gas properties or
other property interests or rights to oil and gas production in the Santiago
de las Atalayas and the Tauramena contract areas in Colombia, (iv) the Capital
Stock of any Subsidiary of the Company (other than Triton Colombia and its
Subsidiaries) that owns, directly or indirectly, oil and gas properties or
other property interests or rights to oil and gas properties in the Santiago
de las Atalayas and the Tauramena contract areas in Colombia and (v) assets,
tangible and intangible, of the Company or any Subsidiary or Joint Venture
referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of this definition that are located in
or pertain directly to the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Santiago de las Atalayas and the Tauramena contract areas
in Colombia."

     "'Permitted Indebtedness' means (i) the Securities; (ii) Indebtedness of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Special Subsidiaries outstanding on
December 16, 1993; (iii) obligations pursuant to Interest Rate Agreements or
Currency Agreements; (iv) with respect to any assets acquired or constructed
after the date hereof (including unimproved real property acquired prior to
the date hereof), Indebtedness under Capitalized Lease Obligations and
purchase money mortgages; (v) Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary in
respect of trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit incurred in
the ordinary course of business in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$25,000,000 at any time outstanding; (vi) loans or advances from a Subsidiary
to the Company or another Subsidiary, provided that the obligation of the
obligor of such Indebtedness is subject to an Intercompany Agreement; (vii)
indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary consisting of (A) guaranties,
indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in
connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets and (B) guaranties of
the Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary, provided, however, that (I) to
the extent such transaction involves an Affiliate, the obligation of the
guarantor of such guarantee is subject to an Intercompany Agreement, (II) such
guarantee is subordinated to the Securities, and the agreement governing the
guarantee includes subordination provisions substantially similar to those set
forth in Article XI to the same extent as if the Securities were Senior
Indebtedness and (III) such incurrence of the guarantee is otherwise permitted
under Section 10.08; (viii) any obligation or liability of the Company or any
Subsidiary in respect of leasehold interests assigned by the Company or such
Subsidiary to any other person; (ix) Indebtedness of the Company to any
Restricted Subsidiary,  provided, however, that (I) the obligation of the
obligor of such Indebtedness is subject to an Intercompany Agreement, (II)
such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Securities, and the agreement
governing such Indebtedness includes subordination provisions substantially
similar to those set forth in Article XI to the same extent as if the
Securities were Senior Indebtedness and (III) such incurrence of Indebtedness
is otherwise permitted under Section 10.08; and (x) any renewals, extensions,
substitutions, refinancings or replacements of any Indebtedness, including any
successive extensions, renewals, substitutions, refinancings or replacements
so long as the aggregate amount of Indebtedness represented thereby is not
increased by such renewal, extension, substitution, refinancing or replacement
unless otherwise permitted herein, such renewal, extension, substitution,
refinancing or replacement does not reduce the average life to stated maturity
or the stated maturity of such Indebtedness and, if the Indebtedness being
renewed, extended, substituted, refinanced or replaced is Indebtedness of the
Company, such renewal, extension, substitution, refinancing or replacement
shall be Indebtedness of the Company; and (xi) additional Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) having a principal amount outstanding at
issuance or at the date of assumption not to exceed $100,000,000, at any time
outstanding.

     (c)  The following defined terms shall be deleted in their entirety from
Section 1.02 of the Indenture and each other place where they appear in the
Indenture:  "Consolidated Net Worth Purchase Price", "Offer", "Purchase Date"
and "Offer Amount".

     (e)  Section 10.07 shall be deleted in its entirety and the following new
Section 10.07 shall be substituted therefor:

     "SECTION 10.07.  Limitation on Indebtedness.  The Company will not, and
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, incur,
create, assume, guarantee or in any other manner become directly or indirectly
liable or responsible for the payment of, any Indebtedness (including any
Acquired Indebtedness), other than Permitted Indebtedness, unless at the time
  of such event (a) (i) any such Indebtedness or Acquired Indebtedness (other
than Senior Indebtedness) has no sinking fund or amortization payment date or
final maturity date prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities and (ii) in
the case of Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Securities,
the instrument evidencing such Indebtedness shall include subordination
provisions substantially similar to those set forth in Article XI as if the
Securities were Senior Indebtedness with respect to such Indebtedness and (b)
after giving effect thereto and to any acquisition being financed through the
incurrence of such Indebtedness and to any Acquired Indebtedness incurred or
assumed therewith on a pro forma basis, either (i) the ratio expressed as a
percentage of (A) the Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to (B) the sum of (1) the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate with
respect to the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries plus (2) the value of
the Company's direct or indirect percentage ownership in publicly-held
Subsidiaries (other than its Restricted Subsidiaries) engaged in oil and gas
exploration, development, production or transportation and, without
duplication, the Special Subsidiaries, in each case based upon the Average
Quoted Price of the common stock of such Subsidiaries or Special Subsidiaries,
shall not be greater than 40% or (ii) the ratio expressed as a percentage of
(A) the Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to (B) the
sum of (1) the Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
plus (2) the product of the number of outstanding shares of the Company's
common stock as of the date of determination multiplied by the Average Quoted
Price of such Capital Stock, plus (3) the product of the number of outstanding
shares of the Company's Capital Stock (other than shares held by the Company,
or any Subsidiary) as of the date of determination multiplied by the Average
Quoted Price of such Capital Stock, shall not be greater than 25%.  For
purposes of this calculation, (i) a Subsidiary shall be considered
publicly-held if there is a Quoted Price available for its Capital Stock and
(ii) the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate shall include, in connection with an
acquisition, on a pro forma basis the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate, if any, of
any acquired person

<PAGE>
and shall be determined as of the end of the fiscal year of the Company and,
if applicable, the acquired person, most recently concluded if then available,
but if not then available, the end of the previous fiscal year of the Company
and, if applicable, the acquired person; provided, however, that the Company
may, at its option, make such calculation utilizing a more recent Oil and Gas
Reserve Estimate in lieu of the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate referred to in
the preceding clause if (a) such estimate is prepared, to the extent of at
least 85% of the quantities of proven oil and gas reserves set forth in such
estimate (which shall be determined on the basis that six thousand cubic feet
of gas equal one barrel of oil), by a nationally recognized independent
petroleum engineer, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, (b) such Oil and
Gas Reserve Estimate is determined on a basis consistent with the estimate
prepared at fiscal year end, except that the oil and gas prices and currency
prices utilized therein shall be as of the date of such more recent estimate
and (c) an officer authorized by the Company delivers to the Trustee a
certificate to the effect that such estimate has been prepared in accordance
with the
requirements of this Indenture."

     (f)  Section 10.14 shall be deleted in its entirety and the following
shall be substituted therefor:

     "SECTION 10.14.  Intentionally omitted."

          SECTION 2.  MISCELLANEOUS.

          2.1  Definitions.  Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings given such terms in the Indenture.

          2.2  The Trustee.  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as
the statements of the Company and the Trustee shall not assume responsibility
for, or be liable in respect of, the correctness thereof.  The Trustee makes

validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture.

BE A CONTRACT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND FOR ALL PURPOSES
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE,
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

Indenture to be duly executed, all as of the date first above written.

                 SECTION 1.03.  Incorporation by Reference of Trust Indenture
Act.  Whenever this Indenture refers to a provision of the TIA, the provision
is incorporated by reference in and made a part of this Indenture.  The
following TIA terms used in this Indenture have the following meanings:


<PAGE>

                 "Commission" means the SEC;

                 "indenture securities" means the Securities;

                 "indenture security holder" means a Holder or a

                 "indenture to be qualified" means this Indenture;

Trustee; and

                 "obligor" on the indenture securities means the Company or
any other obligor on the Securities.

                 All other TIA terms used in this Indenture that are defined
by the TIA, defined by TIA reference to another statute or defined by SEC rule
and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them therein.

                 SECTION 1.04.  Compliance Certificates and Opinions.  Upon
any application or request by the Company or the Guarantor to the Trustee to
take any action under any provision of this Indenture, the Company or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Trustee such certificates
and opinions as may be required under the Trust Indenture Act and an Officers'
Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in
this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an
Opinion of Counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such
conditions precedent, if any, have been complied with, except that in the case
of any such application or request as to which the furnishing of such
documents or any of them is specifically required by any provision of this
Indenture relating to such particular application or request, no additional
certificate or opinion need be furnished.

                 SECTION 1.05.  Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.  In
any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by
an opinion of, any specified person, it is not necessary that all such matters
be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such person, or that
they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such person may
certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other
such persons as to other matters, and any such person may certify or give an
opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

                 Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company or
the Guarantor may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a
certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer
knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate
or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his
certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.  Any such certificate or
Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters,
upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or
officers of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, stating that the
information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the
Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such counsel knows, or in
the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion
or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

                 Where any person is required to make, give or execute two or
more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or
other instruments under this Indenture or any Security, they may, but need
not, be consolidated and form one instrument.

                 SECTION 1.06.  Acts of Holders.

                 (a)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided by or pursuant to this Indenture to
be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or
by an agent duly appointed in writing.  Except as herein otherwise expressly
provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby
expressly required, to the Company or the Guarantor.  Such instrument or
instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein
sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or
instruments or so voting at any such meeting.  Proof of execution of any such
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any
person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture
and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act) conclusive in favor of
the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, if made in the manner provided in
this Section.

                 (b)  The fact and date of the execution by any person of any
such instrument or writing may be proved in any reasonable manner which
the Trustee deems sufficient and in accordance with such reasonable rules as
the Trustee may determine; and the Trustee may in any instance require further
proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.

                 (c)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Security shall bind every
future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued
upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
thereof in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any
Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, the Company or the Guarantor in reliance
thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

                 (d)  The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the
Security Register.

                 SECTION 1.07.  Notices, etc. to Trustee, Company and
Guarantor.  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

                 (1)  the Trustee by any Holder, the Company or the Guarantor
shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or
filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office,
Attention: Corporate Trustee Administration Department, or

                 (2)  the Company by the Trustee or any Holder shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the
Company, addressed to the attention of its Treasurer, which address is 6688 N.
Central Expressway, Suite 1400, Dallas, Texas 75206-9926, or at any other
address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company, or

                 (3)  the Guarantor by the Trustee or any Holder shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the
Guarantor, addressed to the attention of its Treasurer, which address is
________, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the
Trustee by the Guarantor.

                 SECTION 1.08.  Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, where
this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, such
notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Securities if in writing and
mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Security affected by
such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later
than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for
the giving of such notice.

                 In any case where notice to Holders of Securities is given by
mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so
mailed, to any particular Holder of a Security shall affect the sufficiency of
such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities given as provided
herein.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given or provided.  In the case by
reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other
cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such
notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall
constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

                 Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such
notice may be waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such  waiver shall be the equivalent of
such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with
the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the
validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

                 SECTION 1.09.  Language of Notices.  Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, election or waiver required or
permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that,
if the Company so elects, any published notice may be in an official language
of the country of publication.

                 SECTION 1.10.  Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.  If any
provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with any duties under any
required provision of the Trust Indenture Act imposed hereon by Section 318(c)
thereof, such required provision shall control.

                 SECTION 1.11.  Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.  The
Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

                 SECTION 1.12.  Successors and Assigns.  All covenants and
agreements in this Indenture by the Company or the Guarantor shall bind the
successors and assigns of the Company or the Guarantor, respectively, whether
so expressed or not.

                 SECTION 1.13.  Separability Clause.  In case any provision in
this Indenture or any Security shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                 SECTION 1.14.  Benefits of Indenture.  Nothing in this
Indenture or any Security express or implied, shall give to any person, other
than the parties hereto, any Registrar, any Paying Agent and their successors
hereunder and the Holders of Securities, any benefit or any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

                 SECTION 1.15.  Governing Law.  This Indenture and the
Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York as applied to agreements made or instruments entered
into and, in each case, performed in said state, without regard to principles
of conflicts of laws.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 1.16.  Submission to Jurisdiction.  The Guarantor
hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
New York and of the courts of the United States of America having jurisdiction
in the State of New York for the purpose of any legal action or proceeding in
any such court with respect to, or arising out of, this Indenture, the
Securities or the Guarantees.  The Guarantor designates and appoints Triton
Energy Corporation, 6688 North Central Expressway, Suite 1400, Dallas, Texas
75206-9926, Attention:  Robert B. Holland, III and its successors as the
Guarantor's lawful agent in the United States of America upon which may be
served, and which may accept and acknowledge, for and on behalf of the
Guarantor all process in any action, suit or proceedings that may be brought
against the Guarantor in any of the courts referred to in this Section, and
agrees that such service of process, or the acceptance or acknowledgement
thereof by said agent, shall be valid, effective and binding in every respect;
provided, however, that if said agency shall cease for any reason whatsoever,
the Guarantor hereby designates and appoints, without power of revocation, the
Secretary of State of the State of New York to serve as its agent for service
of process.  Nothing contained in this Section 1.16 shall limit the right of
the Holders of the Securities or any of them to take proceedings against the
Guarantor in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor, by virtue of
anything contained herein, shall the taking of proceedings in one or more
jurisdictions preclude the taking or proceedings in any other jurisdiction
whether concurrently or not.

                 SECTION 1.17.  Legal Holidays.  In any case where any
Redemption Date, Change in Control Purchase Date, Asset Sale Purchase Date,
date for payment of interest on overdue amounts or Stated Maturity shall be a
Legal Holiday at any place of payment, then (notwithstanding any other
provision of this Indenture, any Security other than a provision in any
Security that specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of
this Section) payment need not be made at such place of payment on such date,
but may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day at such
place of payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Redemption
Date, Change in Control Purchase Date, Asset Sale Purchase Date, date for
payment of interest on overdue amounts or Stated Maturity, and such time for
the period from and after such Redemption Date, Change in Control Purchase
Date, Asset Sale Purchase Date, date for payment of interest on overdue
amounts or Stated Maturity.

B, shall constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture.
To the extent applicable, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, by their
execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby.

                 The definitive Securities and Guarantees shall be printed,
lithographed or engraved or produced by any combination of these methods or
may be produced in any other manner permitted by the rules of any securities
exchange on which the Securities may be listed, all as determined by the
officers executing such Securities and Guarantees, as evidenced by their
execution of such Securities and Guarantees.

                 SECTION 2.02.  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and
Dating. Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman
of the Board, one of its Vice Chairmen, its President, its Treasurer or one of

be executed on behalf of the Guarantor by its Chairman of the Board, one of
its Vice Chairmen, its President, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents
under its corporate seal reproduced thereon and attested by its Secretary or
one of its Assistant Secretaries.  The signature of any of these officers on
the Securities or the Guarantees, as applicable, may be manual or facsimile.


<PAGE>

                 Securities or Guarantees bearing the manual or facsimile
signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the
Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall bind the Company or the
Guarantor, as applicable, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them
have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of
such Securities having endorsed thereon Guarantees or did not hold such
offices at the date of such Securities or Guarantees.

                 At any time and from time to time after the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities executed by the
Company having endorsed thereon Guarantees executed by the Guarantor to the
Trustee for authentication and, provided that a resolution from the Board of
Directors of the Company, a resolution from the Board of Directors of the
Guarantor, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture or indentures with
respect to such Securities and Guarantees and a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of such Securities and Guarantees endorsed thereon
has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee in accordance with the Company
Order and subject to the provisions hereof and of such Securities and
Guarantees shall authenticate and deliver such Securities.

                 Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security or Guarantee endorsed thereon shall be entitled to any benefit
under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there
appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the
form provided in the form of Security attached hereto as Exhibit A executed by
or on behalf of the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized
officers.  All Securities outstanding as of _______, 199__ shall be deemed to
have endorsed thereon a Guarantee in the form of the Guarantee attached hereto
as Exhibit B.  Such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive
evidence,and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated
and delivered hereunder.

                 In case the Company or the Guarantor, pursuant to Article
VIII, shall be consolidated or merged with or into any other person or shall
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person and the successor person resulting
from such consolidation, or surviving such merger, or into which the Company
or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall have been merged, or the successor
person which shall have received a conveyance, transfer, lease or other
disposition as aforesaid, shall have executed an indenture supplemental hereto
with the Trustee pursuant to Article VIII, any of the Securities authenticated
or delivered prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, lease
or other disposition may, from time to time, at the request of the successor
person, be exchanged for other securities executed in the name of the
successor person with such changes in phraseology and form as may be
appropriate, but otherwise in substance of like tenor as the Securities
surrendered for such exchange and of like Principal Amount; and the Trustee,
upon Company Order of the successor person, shall authenticate and deliver
Securities as specified in such request for the purpose of such exchange.  If
Securities shall at any time be authenticated and delivered in any new name of
a successor person pursuant to this Section in exchange or substitution for or
upon registration of transfer of any Securities, such successor person, at the
option of any Holder but without expense to such Holder, shall provide for the
exchange of all Securities at the time outstanding held by such Holder for
Securities authenticated and delivered in such new name.

                 SECTION 2.03.  Temporary Securities.  Pending the preparation
of definitive Securities, the Company may execute and deliver to the Trustee
and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
manner provided in Section 2.02, temporary Securities in lieu thereof which
are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in
any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive
Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form, having
endorsed thereon Guarantees duly executed by the Guarantor, substantially in
the form of the definitive Guarantees, and with such appropriate insertions,
omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers of the Company
executing such Securities and the officers of the Guarantor executing such
Guarantees may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such
Securities and Guarantees, respectively.

                 If temporary Securities are issued, the Company shall cause
definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay.  After the
preparation of definitive Securities containing terms and provisions that are
identical to those of any temporary Securities, such temporary Securities
shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities upon surrender of such
temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated
pursuant to Section 10.02 without charge to any Holder thereof.  Upon
surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
exchange therefor, a like Principal Amount of definitive Securities of
authorized denominations containing identical terms and provisions, having
endorsed thereon Guarantees executed by the Guarantor.  Unless otherwise
provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, until so exchanged the temporary
Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as definitive Securities.

                 SECTION 2.04.  Registration, Transfer and Exchange.  With
respect to the Securities, the Company shall cause to be kept a register (the
"Security Register") at the Corporate Trust Office which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe, the Company shall provide
for the registration of the Securities and of transfers of the Securities.
The Trustee is hereby initially appointed Registrar for the purpose of
registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided, subject
to Section 10.02.  In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Registrar
with respect to the Securities, it shall have the right to examine the
Security Register at all reasonable times.

                 Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security
at any office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 10.02,
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in
the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new
Securities denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, of a
like aggregate Principal Amount, having endorsed thereon a Guarantee executed
by the Guarantor bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and
containing identical terms and provisions.

                 At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for
other Securities containing identical terms and provisions, in any authorized
denominations, and of a like aggregate Principal Amount, each such Security
having endorsed thereon a Guarantee executed by the Guarantor, upon surrender
of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency.  Whenever any
Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making
the exchange is entitled to receive, each Security having endorsed thereon a
Guarantee executed by the Guarantor.

                 All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company
evidencing the same debt and entitling the Holders thereof to the same
benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such
registration of transfer or exchange.

                 Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or
the Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed,
by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

                 No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange, or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.02, 2.03, this 2.04, or
9.06 not involving any transfer.

                 Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this
Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the
transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before the day of the selection for redemption of
Securities under Section 3.03 and ending at the close of business on the day
of such selection, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any
Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except in the case of
any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed,
or (iii) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which, in
accordance with its terms, has been surrendered for repayment at the option of
the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.

                 SECTION 2.05.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen
Securities.  If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, subject
to the provisions of this Section 2.05, the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security
containing identical terms and of like Principal Amount, having endorsed
thereon a Guarantee executed by the Guarantor and bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding.

                 If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Security, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to
save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the
absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and, upon the
Company's request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for
or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new
Security containing identical terms and of like principal amount, having
endorsed thereon a Guarantee executed by the Guarantor and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding.

                 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.05, in case any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or
is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead
of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

                 Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

                 Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of
any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute a separate obligation
of the Company and of the Guarantor with respect to the Guarantee endorsed
thereon, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any
time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this
Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly
issued hereunder.


<PAGE>

                 The provisions of this Section, as amended or supplemented
pursuant to this Indenture, with respect to the Securities shall be exclusive
and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with
respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Securities.

                 SECTION 2.06.  Persons Deemed Owners.  Prior to due
presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the
Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the
Trustee may treat the person in whose name such Security is registered in the
Security Register as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving
payment of the Principal Amount, premium (if any), any Issue Price, accrued
Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price,
Asset Sale Offer Price, interest (if any) and any other required payment
hereunder with respect to such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not any payment with respect to such Security shall be overdue, and
neither the Company, nor the Guarantor, or the Trustee or any agent of the
Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

                 SECTION 2.07.  Cancellation.  All Securities surrendered for
payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if
surrendered to any person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee,
and any such Securities, as well as Securities surrendered directly to the
Trustee for any such purpose, shall be canceled promptly by the Trustee.  The
Company or the Guarantor may at any time deliver to the Trustee for
cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder
which the Company or the Guarantor may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and all Securities so delivered shall be canceled promptly by the Trustee.  No
Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities
canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by or
pursuant to this Indenture.  All canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall
be disposed of as directed by a Company Order or, in the absence of such
Company Order, in accordance with the Trustee's standard procedures.

                 SECTION 2.08.  Computation of Original Issue Discount.
Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, Original Issue
Discount on the Securities shall accrue at 12.50% per annum, on a semi-annual
bond equivalent basis using a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months,
commencing on the date of this Indenture.

                 SECTION 3.01.  Right of Redemption.  The Securities may be

case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the aggregate
Principal Amount thereof to be redeemed.

                 For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context
otherwise requires, all provisions relating to redemption of Securities shall
relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part,
to the portion of the aggregate Principal Amount of such Security which has
been or is to be redeemed.

                 SECTION 3.05.  Notice of Redemption.  Notice of redemption

                 Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the

the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.

                 SECTION 3.06.  Deposit of Redemption Price.  On or prior to

Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate
and hold in trust) an amount of money in same day funds (or New York Clearing
House funds if such deposit is made prior to the applicable Redemption Date)
sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Securities or portions
thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.

                 SECTION 3.07.  Securities Payable on Redemption Date.  Notice
of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed
shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price
therein specified and from and after such date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Securities shall cease to
accrue Original Issue Discount.  Upon surrender of any such Security for
redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the
Company at the Redemption Price.

                 If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid
upon surrender thereof for redemption, the Issue Price thereof and premium (if

endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company, the Registrar or the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such
Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities, of any
authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate Principal

Amount of the Security so surrendered.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                           Satisfaction and Discharge

pay at Stated Maturity the Principal Amount of all outstanding Securities
(other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.05), and if in either
case the Company or the Guarantor pays all other sums payable hereunder by the
Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Sections 4.02 and 6.05, cease
to be of further effect.  The Trustee shall, at the cost and expense of the
Company, join in the execution of a document prepared by the Company
acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the

by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that
remains unclaimed for two years; provided, however, that the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such return, may at the
expense of the Company cause to be published once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City of New York or mail to each such Holder notice that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which
shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing,
any unclaimed money then remaining will be returned to the Company.  After
return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the
Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned
property law designates another person.

                 Each of the Company and the Guarantor shall deliver to the
Trustee, immediately after it becomes aware of the occurrence thereof, written
notice of (i) any Event of Default under this Section 5.01, or (ii) any event
which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both would become an
Event of Default under clause (b) or clause (c), its status and what action
the Company or the Guarantor is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 5.02.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission.  If an
Event of Default with respect to the Securities (other than an Event of
Default specified in Section 5.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee or the Holders of at least a 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the
Securities then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the
Guarantor (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by Holders), may, and
the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the Issue Price and
accrued Original Issue Discount, and premium (if any), to be immediately due
and payable, as specified below.  Upon a declaration of acceleration, such
amount shall be due and payable immediately after receipt by the Company and
the Guarantor of such written notice given hereunder.  If an Event of Default
specified in Section 5.01(e) or 5.01(f) occurs and is continuing, then the
Issue Price and accrued Original Issue Discount on all of the Securities then
outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.  At any
time after such declaration of acceleration has been made and before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in
aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities outstanding, by written notice to
the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences if:

                 (a)  the Company or the Guarantor has paid or deposited with
the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

                    (i)   all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under
Section 6.05 and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and

                    (ii)  the Issue Price, premium (if any), and accrued
Original Issue Discount on any Securities which have become due otherwise than
by such declaration of acceleration and overdue interest thereon (to the
extent of such overdue interest at the rate borne by the Securities); and

                 (b)  the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
and if all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the Issue
Price and accrued Original Issue Discount which have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.

                 No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or
impair any right consequent thereon provided in Section 5.13.

                 SECTION 5.03.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for
Enforcement by Trustee.  The Company covenants that if an Event of Default
described in Section 5.01(a) occurs and is continuing, the Company will, upon
demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such
Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities, with
interest upon the overdue amounts and, to the extent that payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue interest, at the rate
borne by the Securities; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as
shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel.

                 If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such
demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may
institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and
unpaid and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce the same against the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon
the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the
manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, the Guarantor or
any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.

                 If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and
enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of
any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or the Securities or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein or therein, or to enforce any other
proper remedy.

                 SECTION 5.04.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon
the Securities or the property of the Company, the Guarantor or such other
obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the Principal
Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount,
Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price,
interest (if any), or any other payment required to be made under this
Indenture in connection with the Securities shall then be due and payable as
therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether
the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company or the Guarantor for the
payment of any such amount) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention
in such proceeding or otherwise,

                 (a)  to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or  such
lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities, of the Principal
Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount,
Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, interest (if any), or any
other payment required under this Indenture and to file such other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents or counsel) and of the
Holders of Securities allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

                 (b)  to collect and receive any monies or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Holder of Securities to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the
event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly
to the Holders of Securities, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 6.05.

                 Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder
of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or
to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a
Security in any such proceeding.

                 SECTION 5.05.  Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession
of Securities.  All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of
the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any
recovery or judgment,after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, shall be for the ratable benefit of each and every Holder of a
Security in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

                 SECTION 5.06.  Application of Money Collected.  Any money
collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the
following order, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon
of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully
paid:

                 FIRST:  To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under
Section 6.05;


<PAGE>

                 SECOND:  To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid
upon the Securities for the Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price,
accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase
Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, interest (if any), or any other payment
required under this Indenture, as the case may be, ratably, without preference
or priority of any kind, according to the aggregate amounts due and payable on
such Securities;

                 THIRD:  The balance, if any, to the Company.

                 SECTION 5.07.  Limitations on Suits.  No Holder of any
Securities shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless

                 (a)  such Holder has previously given written notice to the
         Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

                 (b)  the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Principal
Amount at the time outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee
to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default;

                 (c)  such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee
reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred in compliance with such request;

                 (d)  the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such
notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
proceeding; and

                 (e)  no direction inconsistent with such written request has
been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a
majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall
have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any
provision of this Indenture or any Security to affect, disturb or prejudice
the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to
obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right
under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal
and ratable benefit of all such Holders.

                 SECTION 5.08.  Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive
Payment.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to
receive payment of the Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original
Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer
Price, interest (if any), or any other required payment under this Indenture
with respect to such Security, on the respective due dates therefor specified
in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or, in
the case of repayment at the option of such Holder as provided in or pursuant
to this Indenture, on the date such repayment is due) and to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired
or affected without the consent of such Holder.

                 SECTION 5.09.  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.  If the
Trustee or any Holder of a Security has instituted any proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the
Guarantor, the Trustee and each such Holder shall, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to
their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of
the Trustee and each such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding
had been instituted.

                 SECTION 5.10.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.  Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.05, no right or remedy herein conferred upon
or reserved to the Trustee or to each and every Holder of a Security is
intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy to the extent permitted by law, shall be cumulative and in addition to
every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

                 SECTION 5.11.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.  No delay or
omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to exercise any right
or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or
remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein.  Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the
Trustee or to any Holder of a Security may be exercised from time to time, and
as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by such Holder, as the
case may be.

                 SECTION 5.12.  Control by Holders of Securities.  The Holders
of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee, provided that

<PAGE>

                 (a)  such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
law or with this Indenture or with the Securities, and

                 (b)  the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by
the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

                 SECTION 5.13.  Waiver of Past Defaults.  The Holders of not
less than a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the outstanding
Securities, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Holder)
on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities may waive any past Default
hereunder with respect to such Securities and its consequences, except
                 (a)  an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(a), or

                 (b)  a Default in respect of a covenant or provision that
under Section 9.02 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holder of each outstanding Security affected.

                 Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for
every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

                 SECTION 5.14.  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.  The Company
and the Guarantor each covenants that (to the extent that it may lawfully do
so) it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company and the Guarantor each
expressly waives (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) all benefit or
advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had
been enacted.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                     Trustee

                 SECTION 6.01.  Rights of Trustee.  Subject to TIA Section
315(a) through (d):

                 (a)  The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person.  The
Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.


<PAGE>

                 (b)  Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may
require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel.  The Trustee shall
not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in
reliance on such certificate or opinion.

                 (c)  The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and
shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent
appointed with due care.

                 (d)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes
or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within
its rights or powers, provided that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute
negligence or bad faith.

                 (e)  The Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of
such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

                 (f)  The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or
direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to this Indenture, unless
such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred
by it in compliance with such request or direction.

                 (g)  The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation
into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may
make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it
may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry
or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and
premises of the Company or the Guarantor, personally or by agent or attorney.

                 (h)  The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any
Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities unless either (1) a
responsible officer of the Trustee assigned to the Corporate Trust Department
of the Trustee (or any successor division or department of the Trustee) shall
have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or (2) written
notice of such Default or Event of Default shall have been given to the
Trustee by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or by any Holder
of the Securities.


<PAGE>

                 (i)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be  authorized
or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this
Indenture.

                 SECTION 6.02.  Individual Rights of Trustee.  The Trustee in
its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of
Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Guarantor or their
respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not the
Trustee.  Any Agent may do the same with like rights.  However, the Trustee is
subject to TIA Sections 310(b) and 311.

                 SECTION 6.03.  Trustee's Disclaimer.  The Trustee makes no
representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture, the
Securities or the Guarantees endorsed thereon.  It shall not be accountable
for the Company's or the Guarantor's use of the proceeds from the Securities
and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities or the
Guarantees endorsed thereon other than its certificate of authentication.

                 SECTION 6.04.  Notice of Default.  If a Default or an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Securities and if it
is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of Securities
notice of the Default or Event of Default within 30 days after it occurs,
unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured.

                 SECTION 6.05.  Compensation and Indemnity.  The Company and
the Guarantor shall pay to the Trustee such compensation as shall be agreed
upon in writing for its services.  The Company and the Guarantor shall
reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
and advances incurred or made by it.  Such expenses shall include the
reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.

                 The Company and the Guarantor shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify the Trustee for, and hold it harmless against, any loss or liability
or expense incurred by it without negligence or bad faith on its part, in
connection with the administration of this Indenture and its duties hereunder,
including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
liability and of complying with any process served upon it or any of its
officers in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers
or duties hereunder.  The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Guarantor
promptly of any claim asserted against the Trustee for which it may seek
indemnity.  The Company and the Guarantor shall defend the claim and the
Trustee shall cooperate in the defense.  The Trustee may have separate counsel
and the Company or the Guarantor shall pay reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel.  Neither the Company nor the Guarantor need pay for any
settlements made without its consent.  Neither the Company nor the Guarantor
need reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred
by the Trustee through negligence or bad faith.

                 To secure the Company's and the Guarantor's payment
obligations in this Section 6.05, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the
Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, in its
capacity as Trustee, except money or property held in trust to pay the
Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue
Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer
Price, interest (if any), and any other payment required to be made hereunder,
as the case may be, on particular Securities.

                 If the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the
occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(e) or (f), the
expenses and the compensation for the services will be intended to constitute
expenses of administration under any applicable Federal Bankruptcy Law.

                 The provisions of this Section 6.05 shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Trustee and the termination of this Indenture.

                 SECTION 6.06.  Replacement of Trustee.  A resignation or
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become
effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as
provided in this Section 6.06.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate
Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may remove the
Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee.  The
Company shall remove the Trustee if:

                 (1)  the Trustee fails to comply with Section 6.08;

                 (2)  the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent;

                 (3)  a receiver or public officer takes charge of the Trustee
or its property; or

                 (4)  the Trustee otherwise becomes legally incapable of
acting.

                 If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists
in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint,
by resolution of its Board of Directors, a successor Trustee.

                 A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee to the Company and the Guarantor.
Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and


<PAGE>

duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.  The successor Trustee shall mail
a notice of its succession to Securityholders.  The retiring Trustee shall
promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee,
subject to the lien provided for in Section 6.05.

                 If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days
after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the
Company, the Guarantor or the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal
Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                 If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 6.08, any
Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                 SECTION 6.07.  Successor Trustee by Merger, Etc.  If the
Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation or
national banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee
corporation or national banking association without any further act shall be
the successor Trustee.

                 SECTION 6.08.  Eligibility; Disqualification.  This Indenture
shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Section
310(a)(1).  The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least
$25,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of
condition.  The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b) regarding
disqualification of a trustee upon acquiring a conflicting interest.

                 SECTION 6.09.  Money Held in Trust.  The Trustee shall not be
liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may
agree in writing with the Company or the Guarantor.  Money held in trust by
the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent
required by law.

                 SECTION 6.10.  Preferential Collection of Claims Against
Company.  The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any
creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b).

                 A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject
to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

                 SECTION 9.02.  Supplemental Indentures with Consent of
Holders. With the consent of Holders of a majority of the aggregate Principal
Amount of the outstanding Securities, the Company, the Guarantor (when

Directors, a certified copy of which has been delivered to the Trustee) and
the Trustee may enter into an Indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for
the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or
eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any
manner the rights of the Holders of Securities under this Indenture; provided,
however, that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the
Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby, shall

                 (1)  make any change to the Principal Amount of Securities
whose Holders must consent to an amendment, or

                 (2)  reduce the Principal Amount, or change the Stated

                 (6)  modify any of the provisions of this Section, or Section
5.08 or Section 5.13, or to provide that certain other provisions of this
Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of
each outstanding Security affected thereby, except with respect to this
Section to increase any such percentage, or

                 (7)  make any change that adversely affects the right to
require the Company to redeem or purchase the Securities in accordance with
the terms thereof and this Indenture or the Guarantor to guarantee the payment
of the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Guarantees and this
Indenture.

                 It shall not be necessary for any act of Holders of
Securities under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed
supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such act shall approve
the substance thereof.

                 SECTION 9.03.  Execution of Supplemental Indentures.  As a
condition to executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any
supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby

receive, and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the
execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this
Indenture.  The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any
such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

                 SECTION 9.04.  Effect of Supplemental Indentures.  Upon the
execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture
shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture

Indentures.  Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any
supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by

shall so determine, new Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion
of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, to any such supplemental
indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company, having Guarantees
endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor and authenticated and delivered by

                                    ARTICLE X

                                    Covenants

                 SECTION 10.01.  Payment of Securities.  The Company shall
duly and punctually pay the Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price,
accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase
Price, Asset Sale Offer Price and interest (if any), in accordance with the
terms of the Securities and this Indenture.

                 The Company shall pay interest on overdue amounts at the rate
set forth in paragraph 1 of the Securities as set forth in the form of
Security attached hereto as Exhibit A, and it shall pay interest on overdue
interest at the same rate compounded semiannually (to the extent that the
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which interest on
overdue interest shall accrue from the date such amounts became overdue.

                 SECTION 10.02.  Maintenance of Office or Agency.  The Company
and the Guarantor will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New
York an office or agency where Securities may be surrendered for registration
of transfer or exchange or for presentation for payment and where notices and
demands to or upon the Company or the Guarantor in respect of such Securities,
the Guarantees and this Indenture may be served.  The Company and the
Guarantor will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and
any change in the location, of such office or agency.  If at any time the
Company or the Guarantor shall fail to maintain any such required office or
agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and each of the Company and the
Guarantor hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such
presentations, surrenders, notices
and demands.


<PAGE>

                 The Company and the Guarantor may also from time to time
designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to
time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or
rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company or the Guarantor of their
respective obligations to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York for such purposes.  The Company and the
Guarantor will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such
designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other
office or agency.

                 The Company and the Guarantor hereby initially designate the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, located in the Borough of Manhattan,
New York, New York as such office of the Company and the Guarantor.

                 SECTION 10.03.  Money for Security Payments to Be Held in
Trust.  If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent, the
Company will, on or before each due date of payments in respect of any
Security, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay such payment when so becoming due until such
sum shall be paid to such persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided,
and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

                 If the Company is acting as Paying Agent, the Company will on
or before the due date of payment in respect of any Security deposit with a
Paying Agent a sum in same day funds (or New York Clearing House funds if such
deposit is made prior to the date on which such deposit is required to be
made) sufficient to make such payment when so becoming due, such sum to be
held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such payment and
(unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the
Trustee of such action or any failure so to act.

                 If the Company is not acting as Paying Agent, the Company
will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to
the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the
Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent
will:

                 (a)  hold all sums held by it for the payment in respect of
any such Security in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto
until such sums shall be paid to such persons or otherwise disposed of as
herein provided;

                 (b)  give the Trustee notice of any Default by the Company
(or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the payment in respect of any
such Security;


<PAGE>

                 (c)  at any time during the continuance of any such Default,
upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums
so held in trust by such Paying Agent; and

                 (d)  acknowledge, accept and agree to comply in all respects
with the provisions of this Indenture relating to the duties, rights and
obligations of such Paying Agent.

                 The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held
in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the
Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the
Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to
the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability
with respect to such money.

                 SECTION 10.04.  Corporate Existence.  Subject to Article VIII
and Section 10.13, each of the Guarantor and the Company will do or cause to
be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its
corporate existence and that of each Material Subsidiary that is or would be a
Subsidiary without regard to the exclusion of Special Subsidiaries from the
definition of Subsidiary set forth in the last proviso therein, in each case
in accordance with the organizational documents of the Guarantor, the Company
and each such Material Subsidiary, as the case may be, and the rights (charter
and statutory), licenses and franchises of the Guarantor, the Company and each
such Material Subsidiary, as the case may be; provided, however, that neither
the Guarantor nor the Company shall be required to preserve any such right,
license, franchise or corporate existence of a Material Subsidiary if the
preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of
the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and the loss thereof is
not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of Securities.

                 SECTION 10.05.  Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.  The
Guarantor will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged before the
same shall become delinquent, (i) all material taxes, assessments and
governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of
the Guarantor or upon the income, profits or property of the Guarantor or any
of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) all material lawful claims for labor, materials
and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon the property of
the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the
Guarantor shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claims the amount,
applicability or validity of which is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate provision has been made.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 10.06.  Maintenance of Properties and Insurance.  The
Guarantor will cause all material properties owned by or leased to it or any
Material Subsidiary of the Guarantor and used or useful in the conduct of its
business or the business of such Material Subsidiary that is or would be a
Subsidiary without regard to the exclusion of Special Subsidiaries from the
definition of Subsidiary set forth in the last proviso therein to be
maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied
with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs,
renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the
judgment of the Guarantor may be necessary, so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all
times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10.06 shall prevent the
Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary of the Guarantor from discontinuing the
use, operation ormaintenance of any of such properties or disposing of any of
them, if such discontinuance or disposal is, in the judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Guarantor or of the board of directors of the Material
Subsidiary concerned, or of an officer (or other agent employed by the
Guarantor or any of its Material Subsidiaries) of the Guarantor or such
Material Subsidiary having managerial responsibility for any such property,
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Guarantor or any Material
Subsidiary of the Guarantor, and if such discontinuance or disposal is not
adverse in any material respect to the Holders of Securities.

                 The Guarantor will provide or cause to be provided for itself
and each of its Material Subsidiaries that is or would be a Subsidiary without
regard to the exclusion of Special Subsidiaries from the definitions of
Subsidiary set forth in the last proviso therein, insurance (including
appropriate self-insurance) against loss or damage of the kinds customarily
insured against by corporations similarly situated and owning like properties,
including, but not limited to, products liability insurance and public
liability insurance with reputable insurers or with the government of the
United States of America or an agency or instrumentality thereof, in such
amounts with such deductibles and by such methods as shall be customary for
corporations similarly situated in the industry.

                 SECTION 10.07.  Limitation on Indebtedness.  The Guarantor
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, incur, create, assume, guarantee or in any other manner become
directly or indirectly liable or responsible for the payment of, any
Indebtedness (including any Acquired Indebtedness), other than Permitted
Indebtedness, unless at the time of such event (a) (i) any such Indebtedness
or Acquired Indebtedness (other than Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor and
Senior Indebtedness of the Company) has no sinking fund or amortization
payment date or final maturity date prior to the Stated Maturity of the
Securities and (ii) in the case of Indebtedness subordinated in right of
payment to the Securities and the Guarantees thereof, the instrument
evidencing such Indebtedness shall include subordination provisions
substantially similar to those set forth in Articles XI and XIII as if the
Securities were Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantees were
Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor with respect to such Indebtedness and (b)
after giving effect thereto and to any
acquisition being financed through the incurrence of such Indebtedness and to
any Acquired Indebtedness incurred or assumed therewith on a pro forma basis,
either (i) the ratio expressed as a percentage of (A) the Indebtedness of the
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries to (B) the sum of (1) the Oil and
Gas Reserve Estimate with respect to the Guarantor and the Restricted
Subsidiaries plus (2) the value of the Guarantor's direct or indirect
percentage ownership in publicly-held Subsidiaries (other than its Restricted
Subsidiaries) engaged in oil and gas exploration, development, production or
transportation and, without duplication, the Special Subsidiaries, in each
case based upon the Average Quoted Price of the common stock of such
Subsidiaries or Special Subsidiaries, shall not be greater than 40% or (ii)
the ratio expressed as a percentage of (A) the Indebtedness of the Guarantor
and its Restricted Subsidiaries to (B) the sum of (1) the Indebtedness of the
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries plus (2) the product of the number
of outstanding shares of the Guarantor's Capital Stock as of the date of
determination multiplied by the Average Quoted Price of such Capital Stock,
plus (3) the product of the number of outstanding shares of the Company's
Capital Stock (other than any shares held by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary)
as of the date of determination multiplied by the Average Quoted Price of such
Capital Stock, shall not be greater than 25%.  For purposes of this
calculation, (i) a Subsidiary shall be considered publicly-held if there is a
Quoted Price available for its Capital Stock and (ii) the Oil and Gas Reserve
Estimate shall include, in connection with an acquisition, on a pro forma
basis the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate, if any, of any acquired person and
shall be determined as of the end of the fiscal year of the Guarantor and, if
applicable, the acquired person, most recently concluded if then available,
but if not then available, the end of the previous fiscal year of the
Guarantor and, if applicable, the acquired person; provided, however, that the
Guarantor may, at its option, make such calculation utilizing a more recent
Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate in lieu of the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate
referred to in the preceding clause if (a)
such estimate is prepared, to the extent of at least 85% of the quantities of
proven oil and gas reserves set forth in such estimate (which shall be
determined on the basis that six thousand cubic feet of gas equal one barrel
of oil), by a nationally recognized independent petroleum engineer, reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, (b) such Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate is
determined on a basis consistent with the estimate prepared at fiscal year
end, except that the oil and gas prices and currency prices utilized therein
shall be as of the date of such more recent estimate and (c) an officer
authorized by the Guarantor delivers to the Trustee a certificate to the
effect that such estimate has been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of this Indenture.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 10.08.  Limitation on Restricted Payments.  The
Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly
or indirectly:

                    (i)   declare or pay any dividend on, or make any
distribution to holders of, any shares of the Guarantor's Capital Stock (other
than (A) the payment of a dividend within 60 days after the date of
declaration thereof, (B) dividends or distributions payable in shares of its
Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital
Stock and (C) dividends on Preferred Stock, which Preferred Stock by its terms
is not mandatorily redeemable or redeemable at the option of the holder
thereof prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities, provided that the
dividend rate on such Preferred Stock on the date of its issuance shall not
exceed the yield to maturity on the Securities calculated on the basis of the
average Quoted Prices of the Securities for the 20 consecutive trading days
ending 5 days prior to the issuance of such Preferred Stock, but excluding
dividends or distributions payable in Redeemable Stock or in options, warrants
or other rights to purchase Redeemable Stock except for dividends on such
Redeemable Stock payable in shares of Redeemable Stock),

                    (ii)  purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for
value any Capital Stock of the Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock (other than
(A) redemption of Preferred Stock that is convertible into common stock,
provided that the Average Quoted Price of such common stock for the 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last full trading day prior to the date
of the notice of such redemption equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion
price of such Preferred Stock, (B) with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary,
purchases or redemptions pursuant to the Guarantor's Shareholders' Rights Plan
or purchases or redemptions in the ordinary course of business not to exceed
$10,000 a year, (C) in connection with a transaction whereby a Subsidiary or a
Special Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or a Subsidiary or a
Special Subsidiary is being merged with or into the Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture), and (D) through
the issuance of Capital Stock of the Guarantor (other than Redeemable Stock),

                   (iii)  make any principal payment on, or redeem,
repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to any
scheduled principal payment, maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled
sinking fund payment, any Indebtedness which is pari passu with, or is
subordinated in right of payment to, the prior payment of the Securities or to
the Guarantees, provided, however, that such Indebtedness may be refinanced so
long as such refinancing is pari passu with, or is subordinated in right of
payment to, the Indebtedness being refinanced and has an average life equal to
or greater than the Indebtedness being refinanced,

                    (iv)  declare or pay any dividend or distribution on any
Capital Stock of any Subsidiary to any person (other than the Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary) or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, any Capital Stock of any Subsidiary (other than with shares of Capital
Stock of the Guarantor (except Redeemable Stock)) held by any person (other
than the Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),

                    (v)   incur, create or assume any guarantee of
Indebtedness of any Affiliate (other than guarantees of Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary by the Guarantor or guarantees of Indebtedness of the
Guarantor by any Subsidiary or guarantees of Indebtedness of any Subsidiary or
Special Subsidiary of the Guarantor by the Guarantor pursuant to a transaction
whereby any Subsidiary or Special Subsidiary would become a Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Indenture, including (a) the execution by the obligor of such obligation of an
Intercompany Agreement and (b) the inclusion of provisions in the guarantee
substantially similar to those set forth in Articles XI and XIII which
subordinate the guarantee to the Securities and the Guarantees to the same
extent as if the Securities were Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the
Guarantees were Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor), or

                    (vi)  make any Investment (other than as permitted in the
preceding clauses (ii) and (v) or a Permitted Investment) in any person, other
than an Investment in a Restricted Subsidiary or any Special Subsidiary which
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Investment, provided
that to the extent applicable (a) the obligation of the obligor in any such
Investment is subject to an Intercompany Agreement and (b) the inclusion of
provisions in the agreement governing the Investment substantially similar to
those set forth in Articles XI and XIII which subordinate the Investment to
the Securities and the Guarantees to the same extent as if the Securities were
Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantees were Senior Indebtedness
of the Guarantor

(such payments or other actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(vi) are collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments") unless at the time
of and after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment (the amount of
any such Restricted Payment, if other than cash, being determined by the Board
of Directors, whose determination shall be evidenced by a resolution of the
Board of Directors) (I) no Default or Event of Default exists or occurs as a
result of such Restricted Payment, (II) the Guarantor could incur at least
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness in accordance with the provisions set forth
in Section 10.07 (including, in the case of Restricted Payments permitted in
the preceding clauses (ii), (v) and (vi), Permitted Indebtedness), and (III)
the aggregate amount expended for all Restricted Payments (excluding any
amount repaid, returned or discharged in respect of any Restricted Payment)
shall not exceed the sum of

                 (A)  50% of the aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income
of the Guarantor or its predecessor (calculated to exclude net income of
Subsidiaries that are not Restricted Subsidiaries and to exclude the after-tax
effect of the net income of any Subsidiary to the extent that such Subsidiary
is restricted or prohibited from declaring dividends) on a cumulative basis
during the period beginning on the first day following the last fiscal quarter
that ended prior to the date of this Indenture and ending on the last day of
the Guarantor's last fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such proposed
Restricted Payment (or, if such aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income
shall be a loss, minus 100% of such loss) and 50% of the aggregate cumulative
dividends received by the Guarantor from any Subsidiary or Special Subsidiary
(other than a Restricted Subsidiary) during the same period plus

                 (B) the aggregate net proceeds received (including without
limitation, Indebtedness or redemption or repurchase obligations discharged,
repaid or otherwise satisfied upon any conversion of convertible Indebtedness
or Redeemable Stock into Capital Stock of the Guarantor or its predecessor)
after the date of this Indenture as capital contributions from the issuance of
Capital Stock other than Redeemable Stock;

provided, however, the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses
II or III above shall not prevent the Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary
from (y) making Restricted Payments not to exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate
(excluding any amount repaid, returned or discharged in respect of any
Restricted Payment) which amount shall not reduce the amount of Restricted
Payments in clause III above or (z) making Restricted Payments necessary for
and directly related (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
and evidenced in a board resolution) to the development, transportation or
marketing of the oil and gas reserves of the Guarantor and its Restricted
Subsidiaries located in the Republic of Colombia which amount shall not reduce
the amount of Restricted Payments in clause III above, and that in each case
are not otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Indenture, provided,
further, however, no such Restricted Payments under clause (y) or (z) shall be
permitted if the condition set forth in clause (I) above is not satisfied.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 10.09.  Limitation Upon Other Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness.  Neither the Guarantor nor the Company will incur, create,
assume, guarantee or in any other manner become directly or indirectly liable
with respect to or be responsible for, or permit to remain outstanding, any
Indebtedness (other than the Securities or the Guarantees) that is subordinate
or junior in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or
Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, unless such Indebtedness is also pari
passu with, or subordinate in right of payment to, the Securities and the
Guarantees pursuant to subordination provisions substantially similar to those
set forth in Articles XI and XIII.

                 SECTION 10.10.  Limitation on Liens.  The Guarantor will not,
and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien of any kind upon any of their respective assets or
properties now owned or acquired after the date of this Indenture, or any
income or profits therefrom, securing any Indebtedness of the Guarantor that
is expressly by its terms subordinate or junior in right of payment to any
other Indebtedness of the Guarantor, unless the Guarantees are equally and
ratably secured, provided, however, that if such Lien securing such junior or
subordinated Indebtedness ceases to exist, such equal and ratable Lien for the
benefit of the Holders of the Guarantees shall cease to exist; provided,
further, that  the Lien securing such subordinated or junior Indebtedness
shall be subordinated and junior to the Lien securing the Guarantees with the
same relative priority as such subordinated or junior Indebtedness shall have
with respect to the Guarantees.

                 For purposes of this Indenture, the Guarantees will be
considered equally and ratably secured with any other Lien if the Lien
securing the Guarantees is of at least equal priority and covers the same
property or assets as that Lien.

                 SECTION 10.11.  Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.
The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, enter into any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or
lease of assets, property or services) with any Affiliate (other than a
wholly-owned Subsidiary) of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary in an aggregate
amount greater than $1,000,000 unless (i) such transaction or series of
related transactions is on terms that are no less favorable to the Guarantor
or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that would have been
available in a comparable transaction in an arm's-length transaction with an
unaffiliated third party and (ii) (A) with respect to any transaction or
series of related transactions involving aggregate payments in excess of
$1,000,000, but less than $10,000,000, the Guarantor delivers an Officer's
Certificate to the Trustee generally describing such transaction and
certifying that such transaction or transactions complies with clause (i)
above and (B) with respect to a transaction or series of transactions
involving aggregate payments equal to or greater than $10,000,000, such
transaction or transactions shall have received the approval of a majority of
the disinterested directors of the Board of Directors (as evidenced by a board
resolution by such disinterested directors, a certified copy of which has been
delivered to the Trustee).

                 SECTION 10.12.  Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries.  The Guarantor will not, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any
other distributions on Capital Stock of any Subsidiary, (ii) pay any
Indebtedness owed to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, (iii) make any
Investment in the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, or (iv) transfer any of its
property or assets to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, except

                 (A) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement
in effect at or entered into on the date hereof,

                 (B) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a person
that was not a Subsidiary of the Company on the date hereof, in existence at
the time such person becomes a Subsidiary of the Guarantor or created on the
date it becomes a Subsidiary and not incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such person becoming a Subsidiary,

                 (C) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Subsidiary to transfer any of its real property (and any improvements thereon)
acquired after the date hereof to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that is
required by a lender to, or purchaser of any Indebtedness of, such Subsidiary
in connection with a financing of the acquisition of such property (and/or
construction of such improvements) by such Subsidiary permitted hereunder,

                 (D) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any agreement
that extends, refinances, renews or replaces any agreement containing any of
the restrictions described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C), provided,
however, that the terms and conditions of any such restrictions are not
materially less favorable to the Holders of the Securities than those under or
pursuant to the agreement evidencing the Indebtedness so extended, refinanced,
renewed or replaced,

                 (E) encumbrances or restrictions arising under law,

                 (F) any encumbrance or restriction arising under customary
non-assignment provisions in installment purchase contracts, and


<PAGE>

                 (G) in the case of clause (iv) above, restrictions contained
in security agreements permitted by the Indenture securing Indebtedness
permitted by the Indenture to the extent such restrictions restrict the
transfer of property subject to such security agreements or any renewals,
extensions, substitutions, refinancings or replacements of such Indebtedness,
provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such restrictions
shall not be materially less favorable to the Holders of the Securities than
those under or pursuant to the agreement evidencing the Indebtedness so
renewed, extended, substituted, refinanced, or replaced.

                 SECTION 10.13.  Purchase of Securities Upon Change in
Control.

                 (a)  If there shall have occurred a Change in Control,
Securities shall be purchased by the Company, at the option of the Holder
thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of aggregate Principal
Amount of $1,000, on a date that is not earlier than 45 days nor later than 60
days from the date the Change in Control Notice referred to below is given to
Holders or such later date as may be necessary for the Company and the
Guarantor to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act (such date, or
such later date, being the "Change in Control Purchase Date"), at a purchase
price in cash (the "Change in Control Purchase Price") equal to 101% of the
sum of the Issue Price plus accrued Original Issue Discount to the Change in
Control Purchase Date, subject to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder
of the requirements set forth in Section 10.13(c).

                 (b)  Within 30 days following a Change in Control and prior
to the mailing of the Change in Control Notice to Holders provided for in
paragraph (c) below, the Guarantor and the Company covenant to either (1)
repay in full all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor and Senior Indebtedness
of the Company whose terms require such payment in connection with such event
or (2) obtain the requisite consent from holders of such Senior Indebtedness
not repaid in order to permit the repurchase of the Securities as provided for
in this Section 10.13.  The Guarantor and the Company shall first comply with
this subsection (b) before the Company shall be required to repurchase the
Securities pursuant to this Section 10.13, and any failure to comply with this
subsection (b) shall constitute a Default in the performance of a covenant
for purposes of Section 5.01(b).

                 (c)  Within 30 days after the occurrence of a Change in
Control, the Company shall give written notice of such Change in Control (a
"Change in Control Notice") and of its offer (the "Change in Control Offer")
to purchase Securities as specified herein to the Trustee and to each Holder
of the Securities at his address appearing on the Security Register, by
first-class mail, postage prepaid.  The Trustee shall be under no obligation
to ascertain whether the Company is obligated to give a Change in Control
Notice.  The Change in Control Notice shall contain all instructions and
materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Securities, shall include
a form of Change in Control Purchase Notice to be completed by the Holder and
shall state or include:

                    (i)   that a Change in Control has occurred and the
circumstances and events causing the Change in Control and the date such
Change in Control is deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Section
10.13(c);

                    (ii)  the date by which a Holder must give a Change in

                    (iv)  the Change in Control Purchase Date;

                    (v)   that any Security not purchased will continue to
accrue Original Issue Discount;

                    (vi)  that Securities to be purchased shall, on the Change
in Control Purchase Date, become due and payable at the Change in Control
Purchase Price and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
in the payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price) such Securities shall
cease to accrue Original Issue Discount;

                   (vii)  (A) the most recently filed Annual Report on Form
10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements) of the Guarantor,
the most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as
applicable, and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the Guarantor filed
subsequent to such Quarterly Report (or in the event the Guarantor is not
required to prepare any of the foregoing forms, the comparable information
required to be prepared by the Guarantor pursuant to Section 10.18), (B) a
description of any material developments in the Guarantor's business since the
latest annual or quarterly report filed with the Trustee pursuant to Section
7.04 and, if material, any appropriate pro forma financial information
(including but not limited to pro forma historical income, cash flow and
capitalization after giving effect to such Change in Control) and (C) such
other information, if any, concerning the business of the Guarantor which the
Guarantor in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed
investment decision; and

                 (viii)   the procedures a holder must follow to exercise
rights under this Section 10.13(c) and a brief description of those rights and
the procedures for withdrawing a Change in Control Purchase Notice.


<PAGE>

                 (d)  Holders electing to have Securities purchased under
Section 10.13(a) will be required to surrender such Securities to the Paying
Agent specified in the Change of Control Notice at the address specified in
the notice by the close of business at least five Business Days prior to the
Change in Control Purchase Date.  Holders will be entitled to withdraw their
election if such Paying Agent receives, at the close of business not later
than three Business Days prior to the Change in Control Purchase Date, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth (i)  the name
of the Holder, (ii)  the certificate number of the Security in respect of
which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, (iii)  the aggregate
Principal Amount of the Securities delivered for purchase by the Holder as to
which his election is to be withdrawn, and (iv)  a statement that such Holder
is withdrawing his election to have such Securities purchased.  Each Paying
Agent will promptly return to the prospective Holders thereof any Securities
with respect to which a Change in Control Purchase Notice has been withdrawn
in compliance with this Indenture.

                 (e)  Upon receipt by the Paying Agent specified in the Change
of Control Notice of a Change in Control Purchase Notice, the Holder of the
Security in respect of which such Change in Control Purchase Notice was given
shall (unless such Change in Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn pursuant to
Section 10.13(d)) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Change in
Control Purchase Price with respect to such Security.  Such Change in Control
Purchase Price shall be paid to such Holder promptly following the later of
the Business Day following the Change in Control Purchase Date (provided the
conditions in Section 10.13(c)) have been satisfied) and the time of delivery
of such Security to the relevant Paying Agent at the office of such Paying
Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 10.13(c).

                 (f)  On or prior to the Change in Control Purchase Date, the
Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent specified in the Change of Control
Notice (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and
hold in trust as provided in Section 10.03) an amount of money in same day
funds (or New York Clearing House funds if such deposit is made prior to the
Change in Control Purchase Date) sufficient to pay the Change in Control
Purchase Price of all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be
purchased on that date.

                 (g)  Any Security that is to be purchased only in part shall
be surrendered to the Paying Agent specified in the Change of Control Notice
at the office of such Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so
requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company
shall execute, the Guarantor shall execute the Guarantee endorsed on, and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security,
without service charge, one or more new Securities of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder in the aggregate Principal Amount of
the Security so surrendered that is not purchased.

                 (h)  The Company and the Guarantor shall comply with any
applicable tender offer rules then in effect, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14e-1 promulgated thereunder, in connection with a
Change in Control Offer.  In the event of any conflict between such tender
offer rules and the provisions set forth in this Section 10.13, such tender
offer rules shall control.

                 SECTION 10.14.  Intentionally omitted.

                 SECTION 10.15.  Limitation on Guaranties.

                 (a)  The Guarantor will not permit any Subsidiary (other than
the Company), directly or indirectly, to assume, guarantee or in any other
manner become liable with respect to the payment of any Senior Indebtedness of
the Company or Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, unless (i) such
Subsidiarysimultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to
this Indenture providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Securities by
such Subsidiary, which guarantee shall include subordination provisions
substantially similar to those set forth in Article XI to the same extent as
the Securities are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company; and
(ii) such Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or
subrogation or any other rights against the Guarantor or any other Subsidiary
as a result of such payment by such Subsidiary under its guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such guarantee by a Subsidiary of the
Securities shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon the release or discharge of such
guarantee of payment of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company or Senior
Indebtedness of the Guarantor.

                 (b)  The Guarantor will not permit any Subsidiary (other than
the Company), directly or indirectly, to assume, guarantee or in any other
manner become liable with respect to the payment of any Indebtedness which is
pari passu with or subordinated to the Securities, unless such Subsidiary
simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
providing for a guarantee of the payment of the Securities by such Subsidiary;
provided, however, in the case of such Subsidiary's assumption, guarantee or
other liability with respect to Indebtedness subordinated to the Securities,
such assumption, guarantee or other liability shall be subordinated to such
Subsidiary's guarantee of the Securities to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the Securities; and provided, further, that
this Section 10.15(b) shall not be applicable to any guarantee, assumption or
other liability of any Subsidiary of the Company in existence on the date
hereof or that (i) existed at the time such person became a Subsidiary of the
Guarantor or its predecessor and (ii) was not incurred in connection with, or
in contemplation of, such person becoming a Subsidiary of the Guarantor or its
predecessor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such guarantee of the
Securities by a Subsidiary shall provide by its terms that it shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release or
discharge of such guarantee of such Indebtedness that is pari passu with or
subordinated to the Securities.

                 SECTION 10.16.  Disposition of Proceeds of Asset Sales.

                 (a)  The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding the Special Subsidiaries, Triton Air Holdings, Inc.
and their respective Subsidiaries) to, make any Asset Sale unless (i) such
Asset Sale is for not less than the fair market value of the assets or shares
sold (as determined by the Board of Directors and evidenced in a board
resolution, which determination shall be conclusive), (ii) at least 85% of the
consideration (not including the assumption of any Indebtedness by the
purchaser in connection with such Asset Sale) consists of cash and equivalents
and the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors and evidenced in a board resolution, which determination shall be
conclusive) of debt and equity securities listed on any recognized securities
exchange or over-the-counter market (except (x) in the case of an Asset Sale
involving oil and gas properties being sold to persons other than Subsidiaries
by one or more Subsidiaries of the Guarantor or the Guarantor, the
consideration may consist solely or in part of oil and gas properties having a
fair market value at least equal to the fair market value of the assets
exchanged (as determined by the Board of Directors and evidenced by a board
resolution, which determination shall be conclusive), or (y) in the case of an
Asset Sale involving Aero Services International, Inc., the consideration need
not be in cash and may consist in whole or in part of a promissory note not to
exceed $10,000,000, or (z) in the case of a farm-out transaction consistent
with industry standards and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture, including, but not limited to, Section 10.11) and (iii) as
otherwise set forth below.

                 (b)  Within 12 months of any Asset Sale, the Guarantor or
such Subsidiary shall either (i) apply or cause the application of the Net
Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale, or a portion thereof, to the permanent
repayment or prepayment of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor or Senior
Indebtedness of the Company or (ii) invest, or enter into a legally binding
agreement to invest, such Net Cash Proceeds, or a portion thereof, in
properties and assets to replace the properties and assets that were the
subject of the Asset Sale or in properties and assets that (as determined by
the Board of Directors and evidenced in a board resolution, which
determination shall be conclusive) will be used in the business of the
Guarantor or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, existing on the date hereof
or in businesses the principal purposes of which are related to the
exploration, development, production or transportation of oil or gas,
provided, however, that in the event the Guarantor or any Subsidiary conveys,
transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of, directly or indirectly, any of its
Colombian Assets in a transaction or series of related transactions within any
consecutive 12-month period the effect of which is to reduce the Oil and Gas
Reserve Estimate of the Colombian Assets owned by the Guarantor and/or its
Subsidiaries by 50% or more (which value shall be determined by reference to
the most recently available Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate, or by any subsequent
estimate prepared by a nationally recognized petroleum engineering firm) or
such transaction reduces the Guarantor's direct and indirect net revenue
interest in either the Santiago de las Atalayas or Tauramena contract areas of
the Llanos Basin to less than 50% of such interest as of the date of this
Indenture, calculated to give effect to back-in interests of and equalization
and unitization arrangements with third parties, then the Guarantor or
Subsidiary shall apply the Net Cash Proceeds resulting from such transaction
and every transaction thereafter with respect to the Colombian Assets to
either (A) permanently repay or prepay Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor or
Senior Indebtedness of the Company or (B) redeem the Securities in accordance
with the provisions of Article III (without regard to minimum principal amount
requirements) as if an optional redemption were being made, in each case
within 90 days of such transaction.  If any such legally binding agreement to
invest any Net Cash Proceeds referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence is terminated, then the Guarantor may invest such Net Cash Proceeds,
prior to the end of such 12-month period or within 90 days from such
termination, whichever is later, in the business of the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above.  The amount of such
Net Cash Proceeds not applied, used or invested as set forth in such sentence
constitutes "Excess Proceeds."

                 (c)  When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds equals
$10,000,000 or more, the Guarantor shall so notify the Trustee in writing and
the Company shall offer to purchase from all Holders of the Securities (an
"Asset Sale Offer"), and shall purchase from Holders accepting such Asset Sale
Offer on the date fixed for such Asset Sale Offer (the "Asset Sale Offer
Date"), the maximum amount (expressed in multiple integrals of aggregate
Principal Amount of $1,000) of Securities that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
10.16(e) (the "Asset Sale Amount"), at an offer price (the "Asset Sale Offer
Price") in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the Issue Price plus accrued
Original Issue Discount to the Asset Sale Offer Date, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section.  To the extent that the aggregate amount
of Securities tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds relating thereto (such shortfall constituting a "Deficiency"), then
the Guarantor may use such Deficiency, or a portion thereof, for general
corporate purposes.  Upon completion of an Asset Sale Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.


<PAGE>

                 (d)  If the Company becomes obligated to make an Asset Sale
Offer pursuant to Section 10.16(c), Securities shall be purchased by the
Company, at the option of the Holder thereof, in whole or in part in integral
multiples of aggregate Principal Amount of $1,000, on a date that is not
earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date the Asset Sale Offer
Notice referred to in Section 10.16(e) below is given to Holders, or such
later date as may be necessary for the Company to comply with requirements
under the Exchange Act (such date, or such later date, being the "Asset Sale
Purchase Date"), subject to proration in the event the Asset Sale Offered
Price is less than the aggregate Asset Sale Offered Price of all Securities
tendered and to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements
set forth in Section 10.16(f).

                 (e)  Within 30 days after the date that the aggregate amount
of Excess Proceeds equals or exceeds $10,000,000, the Company shall give
written notice of the Offer (an "Asset Sale Offer Notice") to the Trustee and
to each Holder of the Securities, at his address appearing on the Security
Register, by first-class mail postage prepaid.  The Trustee shall be under no
obligation to ascertain whether the Company is obligated to make an Asset Sale
Offer.  The Asset Sale Offer Notice shall contain all instructions and
materials necessary to enable the Holders to tender Securities, shall include
a form of Asset Sale Purchase Notice to be completed by the Holder and shall
state or provide:

                    (i)   that the Holder has the right to require the Company
to repurchase, subject to proration, such Holder's Securities at the Asset
Sale Offer Price and the date by which a Holder must give an Asset Sale
Purchase Notice;

                    (ii)  the Asset Sale Offer Price;

                   (iii)  the Asset Sale Purchase Date;

                    (iv)  that any Security not purchased will continue to
accrue Original Issue Discount;

                    (v)   that Securities to be purchased shall, on the Asset
Sale Purchase Date, become due and payable at the Asset Sale Offer Price and
from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of
the Asset Sale Offer Price) such Securities shall cease to accrue Original
Issue Discount;

                    (vi)  that the Securities to be purchased are subject to
proration in the event the Asset Sale Amount is less than the aggregate Asset
Sale Offer Price of all Securities tendered;


<PAGE>

                   (vii)  (A) the most recently filed Annual Report on Form
(including audited consolidated financial statements) of the Guarantor, the
most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable,
and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the Guarantor filed subsequent to such
Quarterly Report (or in the event the Guarantor is not required to prepare any
of the foregoing forms, the comparable information required to be prepared by
the Guarantor pursuant to Section 10.18), (B) a description of any material
developments in the Guarantor's business since the latest annual or quarterly
report filed with the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.04 and, if material, any
appropriate pro forma financial information (including, but not limited to,
pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect
to such Asset Sale) and (C) such other information, if any, concerning the
business of the Guarantor which the Company in good faith believes will enable
such Holders to make an informed investment decision; and

                 (viii)   the procedures a Holder must follow to exercise
rights under Section 10.16(c) and a brief description of those rights and the
procedures for withdrawing an Asset Sale Purchase Notice.

                 (f)  A Holder may exercise its rights specified in Section
10.16(c) upon (i) delivery to the Paying Agent specified in the Asset Sale
Offer Notice of a written notice (an "Asset Sale Purchase Notice") at any time
prior to the close of business on the Asset Sale Purchase Date, but not later
than the close of business on the second Business Day next preceding the Asset
Sale Purchase Date, stating (A) the certificate number of the Security that
the Holder will tender to be purchased and (B) the portion of the aggregate
Principal Amount of the Security that the Holder will tender to be purchased,
which portion must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and (ii)
delivery of such Security to such Paying Agent at such office prior to, on or
after the Asset Sale Purchase Date (together with all necessary endorsements),
such delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Asset Sale
Offer Price therefor; provided that Securities to be purchased are subject to
proration in the event the Asset Sale Amount is less than the aggregate Asset
Sale Offer Price of all Securities tendered for purchase.  If a Holder has
elected to deliver to the Company for purchase a portion of a Security, and if
the aggregate Principal Amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000, the Company shall, subject to proration, purchase such
portion from the Holder thereof pursuant to this Section 10.16.  Provisions of
this Indenture that apply to the purchase of all of a Security also apply to
the purchase of a portion of such Security.  Each Paying Agent shall promptly
notify the Company of the receipt by the former of any and all Asset Sale
Purchase Notices and any and all written notices of withdrawal thereof.

<PAGE>

                 (g)  Upon receipt by the Paying Agent specified in the Asset
Sale Offer Notice of an Asset Sale Purchase Notice, the Holder of the Security
in respect of which such Purchase Notice was given shall (unless such Asset
Sale Purchase Notice is withdrawn pursuant to Section 10.16(k)) thereafter be
entitled to receive solely the Asset Sale Offered Price with respect to such
Security.  Such Asset Sale Offered Price shall be paid to such Holder promptly
following the later of the Business Day following the Asset Sale Purchase Date
(provided the conditions in Section 10.16(f) have been satisfied) and the time
of delivery of such Security to the relevant Paying Agent at the office of
such Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section
10.16(f).

                 (h)  On or prior to the Asset Sale Purchase Date, the Company
or the Guarantor shall deposit with the Paying Agent specified in the Asset
Sale Offer Notice an amount of money in same day funds (or New York Clearing
House funds if such deposit is made prior to the Asset Sale Purchase Date)
sufficient to pay the aggregate Asset Sale Offered Price of, and accrued
Original Issue Discount on, all the Securities or portions thereof which are
to be purchased on that date.

                 (i)  Any Security that is to be purchased only in part shall
be surrendered to the Paying Agent specified in the Asset Sale Offer Notice at
the office of such Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so
requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company
shall execute, the Guarantor shall execute the Guarantee endorsed on, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without
service charge, one or more new Securities of any authorized denomination as
requested by such Holder in an aggregate principal amount equal to, and in
exchange for, the portion of the Principal Amount of the Security so
surrendered that is not purchased.

                 (j)  The Company and the Guarantor shall comply with any
applicable tender offer rules then in effect, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14e-1 promulgated thereunder, in connection with an
Asset Sale Offer.  In the event of any conflict between such tender offer
rules and the provisions set forth in this Section 10.16, such tender offer
rules shall control.

                 (k)  An Asset Sale Purchase Notice may be withdrawn before or
after delivery by the Holder to the relevant Paying Agent at the office of
such Paying Agent of the Security to which such Asset Sale Purchase Notice
relates, by means of a written notice of withdrawal (by facsimile transmission
or letter) received by such Paying Agent at such office not later than three
Business Days prior to the Asset Sale Purchase Date, specifying, as
applicable:


<PAGE>

                    (i)   the certificate number of the Security in respect of
which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted;

                    (ii)  the aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities
initially outstanding hereunder with respect to which such notice of
withdrawal is being submitted; and

                   (iii)  the aggregate Principal Amount initially outstanding
hereunder of the Security that remains subject to the original Asset Sale
Purchase Notice and that has been or will be delivered for purchase by the
Company.

                 A written notice of withdrawal may be in the form set forth
in the preceding paragraph.  Each Paying Agent will promptly return to the
prospective Holders thereof any Securities with respect to which a Purchase
Notice has been withdrawn in compliance with this Indenture.

                 (l)  The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, create or permit to exist or become effective any restriction
(other than restrictions existing under (i) Indebtedness as in effect on the
date of this Indenture or (ii) any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor
existing on the date of this Indenture or thereafter or Senior Indebtedness of
the Company existing on the date of this Indenture or thereafter) that would
materially impair the ability of the Company to make an Asset Sale Offer to
purchase the Securities upon an Asset Sale or, if such Asset Sale Offer is
made, to pay for the Securities tendered for purchase.

                 SECTION 10.17.  Compliance Certificates.

                 (a)  The Guarantor and the Company shall each deliver to the
Trustee, within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (105 days after
the end of the last fiscal quarter of each year), an Officers' Certificate
stating whether or not the signers know of any Default or Event of Default
that occurred during such fiscal quarter.  In the case of the Officers'
Certificate delivered within 105 days of the end of the Guarantor's and the
Company's fiscal year, such certificate shall contain a certification from the
principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal
accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of the Guarantor's and the
Company's respective compliance with all conditions and covenants under this
Indenture.  For purposes of this Section 10.17(a), such compliance shall be
determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice
provided under this Indenture.  If they do know of such a Default or Event of
Default, the certificate shall describe any such Default or Event of Default
and its status.  The first certificate to be delivered pursuant to this
Section 10.17(a) shall be for the first fiscal quarter beginning after the
execution of this Indenture.


<PAGE>

                 (b)  The Company and the Guarantor shall each deliver to the
Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate
signed by the Guarantor's and the Company's independent certified public
accountants stating (i) that their audit examination has included a review of
the terms of this Indenture and the Securities as they relate to accounting
matters, and (ii) whether, during the course of their audit examination
anything came to their attention that caused them to believe that the Company
or the Guarantor failed to comply with the terms, covenants, provisions, or
conditions of the Indenture insofar as they relate to accounting matters and
describing the nature of any such areas of noncompliance.

                 SECTION 10.18.  SEC Reports and Reports to Securityholders.
Within 15 days after the Guarantor files with the SEC copies of its annual
reports and other information, documents and reports (or copies of such
portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations
prescribe) which it is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Guarantor shall file the same with the Trustee.
 So long as the Securities remain outstanding, the Guarantor shall cause
quarterly reports (containing unaudited financial statements) for the first
three quarters of each fiscal year and annual reports (containing audited
financial statements and an opinion thereon by the Guarantors' independent
certified public accountants) which it would be required to file under Section
13 of the Exchange Act if it had a class of Securities listed on a national
securities exchange to be mailed to the Holders of Securities at their
addresses appearing in the register of Securities maintained by the Registrar
within 15 days of when such report would have been required to be filed under
Section 13 of the Exchange Act.  The Guarantor also shall comply with the
other provisions of TIA Section 314(a).


                                   ARTICLE XI

                           Subordination of Securities

                 SECTION 11.01.  Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness
of the Company.  The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a
Security, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to
the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article, the
indebtedness represented by the Securities and the payment of the Issue Price,
premium (if any), accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in
Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price or interest (if any), and any
other payments required hereunder, on each and all of the Securities are
hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment as provided
in this Article to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the
Company; provided, however, that the Securities, the Indebtedness represented
thereby and the payment of the Issue Price, premium (if any), accrued Original
Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale
Offer Price or interest (if any), and any other payments required hereunder on
each and all of the Securities in all respects shall rank equally with, or
prior to, all existing and future indebtedness (including, without limitation,
Indebtedness) of the Company that is subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of
the Company.

                 This Article XI shall constitute a continuing offer to all
persons who, in reliance upon such provisions, become holders of, or continue
to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company; and such provisions are made for
the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company; and such
holders are made obligees hereunder and they or each of them may enforce such
provisions.

                 SECTION 11.02.  Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution,
etc. In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or
any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or
proceeding in connection therewith, relative to the Company or to its
creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or
other winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether
or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the
benefit of creditors or any other marshaling of assets or liabilities of the
Company, then, and in any such event:

                 (1)  the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall
be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due on or in respect of
all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, or provision shall be made for such
payment, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any
payment or distribution of any kind or character (excluding securities of the
Company or any other corporation that are equity securities or are
subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness of the Company,
that may at the time be outstanding, to substantially the same extent as, or
to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in
this Article; such securities are hereinafter collectively referred to as
"Permitted Junior Securities") on account of the Principal Amount, premium (if
any), accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control
Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price or interest (if any), or any other
payment required hereunder, in connection with the Securities; and

                 (2)  any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of
any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (excluding
Permitted Junior Securities), by set-off or otherwise, to which the Holders or
the Trustee would be entitled but for the  provisions of this Article shall be
paid by the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making such payment
or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating
trustee or otherwise, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
Company or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or
trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of
such Senior Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued, ratably
according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the Senior
Indebtedness of the Company held or represented by each, to the extent
necessary to make payment in full in cash equivalents or cash, of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness
of the Company; and

                 (3)  if, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 11.02, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received,
subsequent to the occurrence of any of the events described in the preceding
clauses (a),(b), or (c) of this Section, any payment or distribution of assets
of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities, in respect of Principal Amount, premium (if any), accrued Original
Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale
Offer Price or interest (if any), or any other payment required hereunder on
the Securities before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full
or payment thereof provided for, then and in such event such payment or
distribution (excluding Permitted Junior Securities) shall be paid over or
delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating
trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other person making payment or
distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all
Senior Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary
to pay all Senior Indebtedness of the Company in full in cash equivalents,
cash or, as acceptable to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company,
any other manner, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

                 The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company with or into, another person or the liquidation or dissolution of the
Company following the conveyance, transfer or lease of its properties and
assets substantially as an entirety to another person upon the terms and
conditions set forth in Article VIII shall not be deemed a dissolution,
winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the
purposes of this Section if the person formed by such consolidation or the
surviving entity of such merger or the person which acquires by conveyance,
transfer or lease such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as
the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease, comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 11.03.  Suspension of Payment When Senior
Indebtedness of the Company in Default.

                 (a)  Unless Section 11.02 shall be applicable, upon (1) the
occurrence of a Payment Default and (2) receipt by the Trustee and the Company
from a holder or representative of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness
of written notice of such occurrence, then no payment or distribution of any
assets of the Company of any kind or character (excluding Permitted Junior
Securities) shall be made by the Company on account of the Principal Amount,
Issue Price, premium (if any), accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption
Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price or interest
(if any), or any other payment required to be made hereunder or on account of
the purchase or redemption or other acquisition of Securities unless and until
such Payment Default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to
exist or such Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall have been discharged or
paid in full, after which the Company shall resume making any and all required
payments in respect of the Securities, including any missed payments.

                 (b)  Unless Section 11.02 shall be applicable, upon (1) the
occurrence of a Non-payment Default and (2) receipt by the Trustee and the
Company from a holder or representative of holders of Designated Senior
Indebtedness of written notice of such occurrence, no payment or distribution
of any assets of the Company of any character (excluding Permitted Junior
Securities) shall be made by the Company on account of the Principal Amount,
Issue Price, premium (if any), accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption
Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price or interest
(if any), or any other payments required to be made hereunder or on account of
the purchase or redemption or other acquisition of Securities for a period
("Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the earlier of the dates of receipt
by the Company or Trustee of such notice from a holder or representative of
holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness and ending upon the earlier of (x)
more than 179 days having elapsed since receipt of such written notice by the
Company or Trustee, whichever was earlier, (y) the date on which such
Non-payment Default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to
exist or such Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall have been discharged or
paid in full or (z) the date on which such Payment Blockage Period shall have
been terminated by written notice to the Company or the Trustee from the
Designated Senior Indebtedness holder or representative initiating such
Payment Blockage Period, after which, in the case of clause (x), (y) or (z),
the Company shall resume making any and all required payments in respect of
the Securities, including any missed payments.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Indenture, only one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced
with respect to the Securities within any 365-day period and no Non-payment
Default with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness which existed or was
continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period will
be, or can be, made the basis for the commencement of a second Payment
Blockage Period, whether or not within a period of 365 consecutive days,
unless such event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of
not less than 90 consecutive days.  In no event shall a Payment Blockage
Period extend beyond 179 days from the date of the receipt of the notice
referred to in clause (2)
hereof.

                 (c)  In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security
prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, then and in such event
such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Senior
Representative or other representative of the holders of the Designated Senior
Indebtedness or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.

                 SECTION 11.04.  Payment Permitted if No Default.  Nothing
contained in this Article, elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the
Securities shall prevent the Company, at any time except during the pendency
of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up,
assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshaling of assets and
liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 11.02 or under the
conditions described in Section 11.03, from making payments at any time of the
Principal Amount, premium (if any), accrued Original Issue Discount,
Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price or
interest (if any), on the Securities.

                 SECTION 11.05.  Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company.  Subject to the payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated
(equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company which
by its express terms is subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to
the same extent as the Securities are subordinated and which is entitled to
like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, from time to time, to receive payments and
distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior
Indebtedness of the Company until the Principal Amount, premium (if any),
accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase
Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, interest (if any), and any other payment
required to be made hereunder in connection with the Securities shall be paid
in full.  For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to
the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company of any cash, property or
securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be
entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments over
pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee,
shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to
be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior
Indebtedness of the Company.


<PAGE>

                 SECTION 11.06.  Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.
The provisions of this Article are intended solely for the purpose of defining
the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities on the one hand and the
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on the other hand.  Nothing
contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities
is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other
than holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the Holders of the
Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the Principal Amount,
premium (if any), and accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price,
Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, interest (if any),
and any other payment required to be made hereunder in connection with the
Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance
with their terms; and (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of
the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than the
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

                 SECTION 11.07.  Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.  Each
Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the
Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the
Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes, including, in the
event of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the
Company whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership proceedings, or
otherwise, the timely filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of the
indebtedness of Company owning to such Holder in the form required in such
proceedings and the causing of such claim to be approved.

                 SECTION 11.08.  No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.

                 (a)  No right of any present or future holder of any Senior
Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as herein provided shall
at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act
on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by
any such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms,
provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge
thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.

                 (b)  Without limiting the generality of Subsection (a) of
this Section, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any
time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or
the Holder of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders
of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination
provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the
Securities to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, do any one or
more of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or
extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness of the
Company or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which
Senior Indebtedness of the Company is outstanding; (2) sell, exchange, release
or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing
Senior Indebtedness of the Company; (3) release any person liable in any
manner for the collection
or payment of Senior Indebtedness of the Company; and (4) exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights against the Company and any other person; provided,
however, that in no event shall any such actions limit the right of the
Holders of the Securities to take any action to accelerate the maturity of the
Securities pursuant to Article V of this Indenture or to pursue any rights or
remedies hereunder or under applicable laws if the taking of such action does
not otherwise violate the terms of this Article.

                 SECTION 11.09.  Notice to Trustee.

                 (a)  The Company shall give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of
any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any provision of this
Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of
any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee
in respect of the Securities, unless and until the Trustee shall have received
written notice thereof from the Company or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of
the Company or from any trustee, fiduciary or agent therefor; and, prior to
the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee shall be entitled in all
respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the
Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section at
least three Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any
money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the
payment of the Principal Amount, premium (if any), or accrued Original Issue
Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer
Price, interest (if any), and any other payment required to be made hereunder
in connection with any Security), then, anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to
receive such money and to apply the same to the purpose for which such money
was received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may
be received by it within three Business Days prior to such date.

                 (b)  The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to
it of a written notice to the Trustee and the Company by a person representing
himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or a trustee,
fiduciary or agent therefor).  In the event that the Trustee determines in
good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any
person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any
payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XI, the Trustee may request
such person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee
as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of the Company held by such person,
the extent to which such person is entitled to participate in such payment or
distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such person under
this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any
payment to such person pending judicial determination as to the right of such
person to receive such payment.

                 SECTION 11.10.  Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent.  Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company
referred to in this Article, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities
shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or
proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy,
receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, agent or other person making such payment or distribution,
delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of
ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or
distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and other
indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount
or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto
or to this Article.

                 SECTION 11.11.  Rights of Trustee as a Holder of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company; Preservation of Trustee's Rights.  The Trustee in
its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this
Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at
any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the
Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.  Nothing in this Article shall
apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section
6.05.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Trustee
is subject to TIA Section 310(b).

                 SECTION 11.12.  Article Applicable to Paying Agents.  In case
at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed
by the Company and be then acting under this Indenture, the terms "Trustee" as
used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise
requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within
its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were
named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided,
however, that this Section 11.12 shall not apply to the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent.

                 SECTION 11.13.  No Suspension of Remedies.  Nothing contained
in this Article shall limit the right of the Trustee or the Holders of
Securities to take any action to accelerate the maturity of the Securities
pursuant to Article V of this Indenture or to pursue any right or remedies
hereunder or under applicable law, subject to the rights, if any, under this
Article of the holders, from time to time, of Senior Indebtedness of the
Company.

                 SECTION 11.14.  Trustee's Relation to Senior Indebtedness of
the Company.  With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its
covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article XI,
and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company shall be read into this Article XI against the
Trustee.  The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the Trustee shall not be
liable to any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company if it shall
mistakenly pay over or deliver to Holders, the Company, or any other person
moneys or assets to which any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company
shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.


                                   ARTICLE XII

                       Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

                 SECTION 12.01.  Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.  The Company or the Guarantor may, at its option by resolution of
its Board of Directors, a certified copy of which has been delivered to the
Trustee, at any time, with respect to the Securities, elect to have either
Section 12.02 or Section 12.03 be applied to all outstanding Securities upon
compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article XII.

                 SECTION 12.02.  Defeasance and Discharge.  Upon the Company's
or the Guarantor's exercise under Section 12.01 of the option applicable to
this Section 12.02, the Company and the Guarantor shall each be deemed to have
been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding
Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon on the date the conditions set
forth below are satisfied (hereinafter "defeasance").  For this purpose, such
defeasance means that the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to have
paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding
Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon, which shall thereafter be
deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 12.05 and the
other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (A) and (B) below, and to have
satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities, the Guarantees
endorsed thereon and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the
expense of the Company shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the
same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated
or discharged hereunder:  (A) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities
to receive,


<PAGE>
solely from the trust fund described in Section 12.04 and as more fully set
forth in such Section, payments in respect of the Principal Amount, premium
(if any) and accrued Original Issue Discount on such Securities when such
payments are due, (B) the Company's and the Guarantor's respective obligations
with respect to such Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon under
Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 10.02, and 10.04, (C) the rights, powers, trusts,
duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the
Guarantor's obligations in connection therewith and (D) this Article XII.
Subject to compliance with this Article XII, the Company or the Guarantor may
exercise its option under this Section 12.02 notwithstanding the prior
exercise of its option under Section 12.03 with respect to the Securities and
the Guarantees endorsed thereon.

                 SECTION 12.03.  Covenant Defeasance.  Upon the Company's or
the Guarantor's exercise under Section 12.01 of the option applicable to this
Section 12.03, the Company and the Guarantor shall be released from their
respective obligations under the covenants contained in Articles VIII and XI
and in Sections 10.07 through 10.16 with respect to the outstanding Securities
and the Guarantees endorsed thereon on and after the date the conditions set
forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and the
Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon shall thereafter be deemed to
be not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or
declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in
connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding"
for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities and
the Guarantees endorsed thereon shall not be deemed outstanding for financial
accounting purposes).  For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that,
with respect to the outstanding Securities and the Guarantees endorsed
thereon, the Company and the Guarantor may omit to comply with and shall have
no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any
such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference
elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any
such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such
omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under
Section 5.01(b) or Section 5.01(g), but, except as specified above, the
remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and the Guarantees endorsed
thereon shall be unaffected thereby.  In addition, upon the Company's or the
Guarantor's exercise under Section 12.01 of the option applicable to Section
12.03, Sections 5.01(b) through 5.01(g) (other than Section 5.01(e) and
Section 5.01(f)) shall not constitute Events of Default.

                 SECTION 12.04.  Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.  The following shall be the conditions to application of either
Section 12.02 or Section 12.03 to the outstanding Securities and the
Guarantees endorsed thereon:


<PAGE>

                 (1)  The Company or the Guarantor shall irrevocably have
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee
satisfying the requirements of Section 6.08 who shall agree to comply with the
provisions of this Article XII applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for
the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security
for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities,
(A) cash in U.S. Dollars in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations
(defined below) that through the scheduled payment of principal and interest
in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than
one day before the due date of any payment, cash in U.S. Dollars in an amount,
or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge and which
shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and
discharge, (i) the Issue Price of (and premium, if any) and accrued Original
Issue Discount on the outstanding Securities on the Stated Maturity of such
Principal Amount (and premium, if any) or accrued Original Issue Discount and
(ii) any mandatory payments applicable to the outstanding Securities on the
day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of
this Indenture and of such Securities; provided that the Trustee shall have
been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such U.S.
Government Obligations to said payments with respect to the Securities.  For
this purpose, "U.S. Government Obligations" means securities that are (x)
direct obligations of the United States of America for the timely payment of
which its full faith and credit is pledged or (y) obligations of a person
controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the
United States of America the timely payment of which is unconditionally
guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of
America, which, in either case, are not callable or redeemable at the option
of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a depository receipt issued by a
bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended), as custodian with respect to any such U.S. Government Obligation or
a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government
Obligation held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such
depository receipt; provided that (except as required by law) such custodian
is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder
of such depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in
respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal
of or interest on the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced by such depository
receipt;


<PAGE>

                 (2)  In the case of an election under Section 12.02, the
Company or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel in the United States stating that (x) the Company or the Guarantor has
received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a
ruling or (y) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the
applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding
Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax
purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;

                 (3)  In the case of an election under Section 12.03, the
Company or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel in the United States to the effect that the Holders of the outstanding
Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax
purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to
Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not
occurred;

                 (4)  No Default or Event of Default with respect to the
Securities shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
or, insofar as Section 5.01(e) or 5.01(f) is concerned, at any time during the
period ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it being
understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the
expiration of such period);

                 (5)  Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result
in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or
any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or the
Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound;

                 (6)  In the case of an election under either Section 12.02 or
12.03, the Company or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day following the
deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally;

                 (7)  In the case of an election under either Section 12.02 or
12.03, the Company or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit made by the Company or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, pursuant to its election under Section 12.02 or
12.03 was not made by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, with
the intent of preferring the Holders over other creditors of the Company or
the Guarantor or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors of the Company or the Guarantor or others; and

                 (8)  The Company or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel in the United
States, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to
either the defeasance under Section 12.02 or the covenant defeasance under
Section 12.03 (as the case may be) have been complied with as contemplated by
this Section 12.04.

                 On and after the date the conditions set forth above are
satisfied, the United States dollars or U.S. Government Obligations so
deposited shall not be subject to the rights of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company or Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor pursuant
to the provisions of Article XI.

                 SECTION 12.05.  Deposited Money and U.S. Government
Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.  Subject to
the provisions of Section 4.02, all money and U.S. Government Obligations
(including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other
qualifying trustee, collectively, for purposes of this Section 12.05, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 12.04 in respect of the outstanding Securities
shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the
provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either
directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own
Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities
of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of the Principal Amount
(and premium, if any) and accrued Original Issue Discount, but such money need
not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Money and U.S. Government Obligations so held in trust are not subject to
Article XI.

                 The Company and the Guarantor shall pay and indemnify the
Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against
the cash or U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 12.04 or
the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such
tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the
outstanding Securities.

                 Anything in this Article XII to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company
Order any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in
Section 12.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section
12.04(1)), are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to
be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance.

                 SECTION 12.06.  Reinstatement.  If the Trustee or Paying
Agent is unable to apply any United States dollars or U.S. Government
Obligations in accordance with Section 12.02 or 12.03, as the case may be, by
reason of any order of judgment of any court or governmental authority
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the
Company's and the Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture and the
Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon shall be revived and reinstated
as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.02 or 12.03, as the
case may be, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to
apply all such money in accordance with section 12.02 or 12.03, as the case
may be; provided, however, that, if the Company or the Guarantor makes any
payment of the Principal Amount (or premium, if any) or accrued Original Issue
Discount on any Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the
Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the
money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.


                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                   Guarantees

                 SECTION 13.01.  Guarantee.  The Guarantor hereby
unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee the due and prompt payment of the Principal Amount,
premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption
Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, and interest
(if any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.
In case of the failure of the Company punctually to pay any such Principal
Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount,
Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price,
and interest (if any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this
Indenture, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made
promptly when and as the same shall become due and payable, and as if such
payment were made by the Company.  The Guarantor hereby further agrees that
any amounts to be paid by the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be paid
without deduction or withholding for any and all present and future
withholding taxes,levies, imposts and charges whatsoever imposed by or for the
account of the Cayman Islands or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein, or if deduction or withholding of any such taxes, levies,
imposts or charges shall at any time be required by the Cayman Islands or any
such subdivision or authority, the Guarantor will (subject to compliance by
the Holder of such Security with any relevant administrative requirements) pay
such additional amount in respect of Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue
Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control
Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, and interest (if any), in accordance
with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts paid to such Holder or the Trustee, as the case may
be, pursuant to this Guarantee, after such deduction or withholding, shall
equal the respective amounts of Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue
Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control
Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, and interest (if any), in accordance
with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, as specified in such
Security to which such Holder is entitled; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any such tax, levy, impost or charge which would
not be payable or due but for the fact (i) the Holder of such Security is a
domiciliary, national or resident of, or engaging in business or maintaining a
permanent establishment or being physically present in, the Cayman Islands or
such political subdivision or otherwise having some connection with the Cayman
Islands other than the holding or ownership of such Security or the collection
of Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue
Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer
Price, and interest (if any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities
and this Indenture, or the enforcement of such Security or this Guarantee or
(ii) where presentation is required, such Security was presented more than 30
days after the date such payment became due or was provided for, whichever is
later.  The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be as
if it were principal debtor and not merely surety, and shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity,
irregularity or unenforceability of the Securities, any failure to enforce the
provisions of any Security or this Indenture, or any waiver, modification or
indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto, by the Holder of any
Security or the Trustee, or any other circumstance which may otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor, provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or
indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal
amount of the Securities or the interest rate (if any) thereon or increase any
premium payable upon redemption thereof.  The Guarantor hereby waives
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in
the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a
proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to any
Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby required pursuant to the terms
of the Securities issued under this Indenture and all demands whatsoever, and
covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged with respect to any
Security except by payment in full of the Principal Amount, premium (if any),
Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in
Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, and interest (if any), in
accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.

                 SECTION 13.02.  Subrogation.  The Guarantor shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Holder of a Security against the Company in
respect of any amounts paid to such Holder by the Guarantor pursuant to the
provisions of this Guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not
be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based
upon, such right of subrogation until the Principal Amount, premium (if any),
Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in
Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price and interest (if any), in
accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, shall have
been paid in full.

                 SECTION 13.03.  Execution and Delivery of Guarantees.  To
evidence its guarantee set forth in Section 13.01, the Guarantor hereby agrees
to execute the Guarantee in a form established pursuant to Section 2.1, to be
endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.  Each
such Guarantee shall be signed manually or by facsimile by a person duly
authorized thereto by Board Resolution of the Guarantor.

                 Guarantees bearing the facsimile signature of any individual
who was at any time an officer of the Guarantor shall bind the Guarantor,
notwithstanding that such individual shall have ceased to be an officer prior
to the authentication and delivery of the Securities upon which such
Guarantees are endorsed or was not an officer at the date of such Securities.

                 The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the
authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the
Guarantee endorsed thereon on behalf of the Guarantor.

                 SECTION 13.04.  Agreement to Subordinate.  The Guarantor
agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that all
payments pursuant to the Guarantee of the Guarantor are subordinated in right
of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the
Guarantor, to the same extent and manner that all payments pursuant to the
Securities are subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full
of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

                       [FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF SECURITY]

                   Senior Subordinated Discount Note due 1997

                 1.   Interest

                 This Security shall not bear interest, except that if the
Principal Amount hereof or any portion of such Principal Amount is not paid
when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Indenture,
upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to paragraph 6
hereof, upon the date set for payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price
or other required payments pursuant to paragraph 8 hereof or upon the Stated
Maturity of this Security), then in each such case the overdue amount shall
bear interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum, compounded semiannually (to the
extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which
interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was due to the date
payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly
provided for. All such interest shall be payable on demand.

                 Original Issue Discount (the difference between the Issue
Price and the Principal Amount of the Security), in the period during which
any of the Securities remains outstanding, shall accrue at 12.5% per annum, on
a semiannual bond equivalent basis using a 360-day year composed of twelve
30-day months, commencing on the Issue Date of this Security.

                 2.  Method of Payment

                 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, Holders
must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect payments in respect of
the Securities.  The Company or the Guarantor will pay cash amounts in money
of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment
of public and private debts.  However, the Company may make such cash payments
by check payable in such money.

                 3.  Paying Agent and Registrar

                 Initially, Chemical Bank (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying
Agent and Registrar.  The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or
Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee.  The Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar.


<PAGE>

                 4.  Indenture

                 The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated
as of November 13, 1992 as amended by the supplement thereto dated July 1,
1993, the supplement thereto dated May 12, 1995 and the supplement thereto
dated ______, 1995 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and the
Trustee.  The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture
and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein
have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.  The Securities are
subject to all such terms, and holders are referred to the Indenture and the
Trust Indenture Act for a statement of those terms.

                 The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the
Company, limited to $240,000,000 aggregate Principal Amount.

                 5.  Subordination

                 The Indebtedness represented by the Securities is expressly
subordinate and junior in right of payment, in the manner and to the extent
set forth in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company whether outstanding on the date of such Indenture
or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed.  Each Holder of a
Security by his acceptance hereof agrees and accepts to be bound by such
provisions.

                6.  Redemption at the Option of the Company

                 No sinking fund is provided for the Securities.  The
Securities are redeemable as a whole, or from time to time in part, at any
time at the option of the Company, in a minimum amount of at least $20,000,000
aggregate Principal Amount or, if such aggregate Principal Amount outstanding
is less than $20,000,000, such smaller amount, for cash at a price equal to
the sum of the Issue Price plus accrued Original Issue Discount to the date of
redemption plus the Make-Whole Premium.

                 The Make-Whole Premium shall mean an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (a) over (b), where (a) equals the present value of the
Principal Amount of a Security, discounted on a semiannual bond equivalent
basis from November 1, 1997 to the Redemption Date at a per annum interest
rate equal to the lower of (x) the Standard Yield set forth in the table below
applicable to the Redemption Date for which the determination is being made
plus 100 basis points and (y) the Treasury Yield for such Redemption Date plus
100 basis points and (b) the Issue Price plus accrued Original Issue
Discount to the Redemption Date.


<PAGE>

Standard Yield Period                             Standard Yield

From issuance to and
  including November 1, 1993                      5.93%
From November 2, 1993 to and
  including November 1, 1994                      5.39%
From November 2, 1994 to and
  including November 1, 1995                      4.84%
From November 2, 1995 to and
  including November 1, 1996                      4.37%
From November 2, 1996 to and
  including October 31, 1997                      3.49%


                 "Treasury Yield" means the yield to maturity at the time of
computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as
compiled by and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical
Release H.15 (519) which has become publicly available at least two Business
Days prior to the date fixed for prepayment (or, if such Statistical Release
is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data))
most nearly equal to the then remaining average life of the Securities;
provided, that if the average life of the Securities is not equal to the
constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly
average yield is given, the Treasury Yield shall be obtained by linear
interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the
weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such
yields are given, except that if the average life of the Securities is less
than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States
Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

                7.  Notice of Redemption

                 Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not
more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to
be redeemed at the Holder's registered address.  If money sufficient to pay
the Redemption Price of all Securities to be redeemed on the Redemption Date
is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, on and
after such date Original Issue Discount ceases to accrue on such Securities or
portions thereof.

                8.  Offers to Repurchase the Securities by the Company

                In certain circumstances described in the Indenture, the
Company may be required to make offers to repurchase the Securities.


<PAGE>

                9.  Denominations; Transfer; Exchange

                The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 of Principal Amount and integral multiples of $1,000.
A Holder may register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance
with the Indenture.  The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things,
to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any
taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture.  The Registrar
need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities called for
redemption or any Securities in respect of which a notice of redemption, a
Change in Control Purchase Notice or a notice of repurchase by the Company or
has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be
redeemed or purchased in part, as the case may be, the portion of the Security
not to be redeemed or purchased) or for a period of 30 days before the
Redemption Date.

                10.  Persons Deemed Owners

                The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the
owner of this Security for all purposes.

                11.  Unclaimed Money

                The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall each return to the
Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of any
amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years;
provided, however, that the Trustee or any such Paying Agent, before being
required to make any such return, may at the expense of the Company cause to
be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New
York or mail to each such Holder notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days
from the date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed money then
remaining will be returned to the Company.  After return to the Company,
Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general
creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another
person.

                12.  Amendment; Waiver

                Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i)
the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities
at the time outstanding and (ii) certain defaults or noncompliance with
certain provisions may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time
outstanding.  Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture,
without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee
may amend the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, defect or
inconsistency, or  to comply with Article VIII of the Indenture, to provide
for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated
Securities or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of
any Holder of Securities.

                13.  Defaults and Remedies

                Under the Indenture, Events of Default include, among
others,(i) default in payment of the Principal Amount, Issue Price, accrued
Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price,
Asset Sale Offer Price or any other payment required to be made under the
Indenture, when the same becomes due and payable; (ii) failure by the Company
or the Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the
Securities, subject to notice and lapse of time; and (iii) certain events of
bankruptcy or insolvency. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the
Securities at the time outstanding, may declare all the Securities to be due
and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events
of Default which will result in the Securities becoming due and payable
immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.

                Holders  of Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the
Securities except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee may refuse to
enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives reasonable
indemnity or security.  Subject to certain limitations, Holders of 25% in
aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may
direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.  The Trustee may
withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a
Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (i) above) if it determines
that withholding notice is in their interests.

                14.  Trustee Dealings with the Company and the Guarantor

                Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee
under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the
owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect
obligations owed to it by the Company, the Guarantor or their respective
Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Guarantor or their
respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

                15.  No Recourse Against Others

                A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the
Company or the Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of
the Company or the Guarantor under the Securities or the Indenture or for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation.  By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases
all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
the issue of the Securities.

                16.  Authentication

                This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory
of the Trustee manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on
the other side of this Security.

                17.  Abbreviations

                Customary abbreviations may  be used in the  name of a
Securityholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT
(= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of
survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= custodian), and U/G/M/A (=
Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

                18.  Governing Law

                                                            Exhibit B


                        GUARANTEE OF TC HOLDINGS LIMITED



                19.  Guarantee.  For value received, TC Holdings Limited, a
company duly organized and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands
(herein called the "Guarantor", which term includes any successor corporation
under the Indenture referred to in the Security upon which this Guarantee is
endorsed), hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Holder of the Security
upon which this Guarantee is endorsed the due and prompt payment of Principal
Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount,
Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price and
interest (if any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this
Indenture.  In case of the failure of Triton Energy Corporation, a corporation
duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein
called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under such
Indenture) punctually to make any such payment of Principal Amount, premium
(if any), Issue Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price,
Change in Control Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price and interest (if
any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, the
Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made promptly when and
as the same shall become due and payable, and as if such payment were made by
the Company.

                The Guarantor hereby further agrees that any amounts to be
paid by the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be paid without deduction or
withholding for any and all present and future withholding taxes, levies,
imposts and charges whatsoever imposed by or for the account of the Cayman
Islands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein,
or if deduction or withholding of any such taxes, levies, imposts or charges
shall at any time be required by the Cayman Islands or any such subdivision or
authority, the Guarantor will (subject to compliance by the Holder of such
Security with any relevant administrative requirements) pay such additional
amount in respect of Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price, accrued
Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price,
Asset Sale Offer Price and interest (if any), in accordance with the terms of
the Securities and this Indenture, as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts paid to such Holder or the Trustee under such Indenture, as the case
may be, pursuant to this Guarantee, after such deduction or withholding, shall
equal the respective amounts of Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue
Price, accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control
Purchase Price, Asset Sale Offer Price and interest (if any), in accordance
with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, as specified in such
Security to which such Holder or the Trustee is entitled; provided, however
that the foregoing shall not apply to any such tax, levy, impost or charge
which would not be payable or due but for the fact that (i) the Holder of such
Security is a domiciliary, national or resident of, or engaging in business or
maintaining a permanent establishment or being physically present in, the
Cayman Islands or such political subdivision or otherwise having some
connection with the Cayman Islands other than the holding or ownership of such
Security or the collection of Principal Amount, premium (if any), Issue Price,
accrued Original Issue Discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase
Price, Asset Sale Offer Price and interest (if any), in accordance with the
terms of the Securities and this Indenture, or the enforcement of such
Security or this Guarantee or (ii) where presentation is required, such
Security was presented more than 30 days after the date such payment became
due or was provided for, whichever is later.

                The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder
shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely surety, and shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any
invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or such
Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or such
Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company
with respect thereto, by the Holder of such Security or such Trustee, or any
other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a surety or guarantor, provided, however, that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the
consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security or
the interest rate thereon or increase any premium payable upon redemption
thereof. The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of
the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company,
protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced
thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not
be discharged except by payment in full of the principal of (and premium, if
any) and interest on such Security.

                The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of such Security against the Company in respect of any amounts paid to such
Holder by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee;
provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to
receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation
until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on all Securities of
the same series issued under such Indenture shall have been paid in full.

                No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of this
Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, of the due and punctual
payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Security
upon which this Guarantee is endorsed at the times, place and rate, and in the
cash or currency prescribed therein.

                This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any
purpose until the certificate of authentication of such Security shall have
been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under such Indenture.

                All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in such
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.

                20.  Subordination.  The Guarantor agrees, and each Security
holder by accepting a Security agrees, that all payments pursuant to the
Guarantee of the Guarantor are subordinated and junior in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, to the
same extent and manner that all payments pursuant to the Securities are
subordinated and junior in right of payment, in the manner and to the extent
set forth in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer, whether outstanding on the date of such Indenture
or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed.

                IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to
be signed in facsimile by a person duly authorized in that behalf.

principal balance of this Note, and, if the principal balance of this Note is
paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to Maker.  In
determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific
contingency exceeds the highest lawful rate, Maker and Payee shall, to the
maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any
non-principal payment (other than payments which are expressly designated as
interest payments hereunder) as an expense, fee, or premium, rather than as
interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (iii)
spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of
this Note so that the interest rate is uniform throughout such term.

                SECTION  8.  APPLICABLE LAW.  THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO BE
PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE
UNITED STATES MAY APPLY TO THE TERMS HEREOF, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF TEXAS SHALL GOVERN THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, ENFORCEMENT AND
INTERPRETATION OF THIS NOTE.

                                                            Exhibit 10.30



                         THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE


          THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of November 16, 1995 (this
"Supplemental Indenture"), between TRITON ENERGY CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation, as issuer (the "Issuer"), and UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF
NEW YORK, a New York corporation, as trustee (the "Trustee").

                           W I T N E S S E T H :


          WHEREAS, the Issuer and the Trustee are parties to the Indenture
dated as of December 15, 1993 (as supplemented by the First Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of December 15, 1993 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"),
and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 12, 1995, and as the
same may be further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, the "Indenture"); and

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture, the Issuer
has provided for the issuance of its 9-3/4% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes
due 2000 in the aggregate principal amount of $170 million (the "Notes"),
which Notes constitute the only series of Securities heretofore issued
pursuant to the Indenture; and

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Issuer has adopted a Board
Resolution authorizing the Issuer to enter into this Supplemental Indenture;
and

          WHEREAS, the Issuer has requested the Trustee and the Trustee has
agreed to join in the execution of this Supplemental Indenture in accordance
with the terms of Section 8.2 of the Indenture and subject to the conditions
set forth herein;

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual
agreements herein contained, the Issuer and the Trustee mutually covenant and
agree for the equal and proportionate benefit of the Holders from time to time
of the Notes as follows:

          SECTION 1.  Amendment to the Indenture.

     Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.2 of the Indenture to the
contrary, if, at any time during the term of the Indenture, the Issuer effects
a transaction pursuant to which it becomes a Subsidiary of a holding company
(the "Parent"), organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands for the purpose
of becoming the parent holding company of the Issuer, the Issuer may deliver
to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such event has occurred,
and upon delivery of such Officers' Certificate, the Issuer, the Parent and
the Trustee shall enter into an amended and restated indenture substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Amended and Restated
Indenture") (which Amended and Restated Indenture provides for the guarantee
of the payment of the Notes by the Parent) without the consent of the Holders
of the Notes and without any other action on the part of such Holders and upon
the execution thereof, the Amended and Restated Indenture shall be binding
upon all Holders of the Notes.

     In the event that the creation of the holding company structure is
effected through the merger (the "Merger") of a Person that is a Subsidiary of
the Parent with and into the Issuer, with the Issuer being the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to satisfy the condition contained in Section 9.1(e) of the
Indenture and the Holders hereby waive any such requirement in connection with
the Merger; provided that such waiver does not constitute a waiver of any
other rights of the Holders under the Indenture.

     Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings given such terms in the Indenture.

          SECTION 2.  MISCELLANEOUS.

          2.1     The Trustee.  The recitals contained herein shall be taken
as the statements of the Issuer and the Trustee shall not assume
responsibility for, or be liable in respect of, the correctness thereof.  The
Trustee makes no representation as to, and shall not be liable or responsible
for, the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture.

          2.2  Limited Effect.  Except as expressly amended hereby, all of
the provisions, covenants, terms and conditions of the Indenture are ratified
and confirmed, and shall remain in full force.

          2.3  Counterparts.  This Supplemental Indenture may be executed by
one or more parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts, and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument.

          2.4  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE SHALL BE DEEMED
TO BE A CONTRACT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND FOR ALL PURPOSES
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE,
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

or upon the order of the Issuer (contained in the Issuer Order referred to
below in this Section 2.4) or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the
Trustee and to such recipients as may be specified from time to time by an
Issuer Order.  The maturity date, original issue date, interest rate, if any,
and any other terms of the Securities of such series shall be determined by
or pursuant to such Issuer Order and procedures.  If provided for in such
procedures and agreed to by the Trustee, such Issuer Order may authorize
authentication and delivery pursuant to oral instructions from the Issuer
or its duly authorized agent, which instructions shall be promptly confirmed
in writing.  In authenticating the Securities of such series and accepting
the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such
Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive (in the case of
subparagraphs (2), (3) and (4) below only at or before the time of the first
request of the Issuer to the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such
series) and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon,
unless and until such documents have been superseded or revoked:

       (1) an Issuer Order requesting such authentication and setting
       forth delivery instructions if the Securities of such series are not
       to be delivered to the Issuer, provided that, with respect to
       Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, (a) such Issuer
       Order may be delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee prior to the
       delivery to the Trustee of such Securities for authentication and
       delivery, (b) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of
       such series for original issue from time to time, in an aggregate
       principal amount not exceeding the aggregate principal amount
       established for such series, pursuant to an Issuer Order or pursuant
       to procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time
       to time by an Issuer Order, (c) the maturity date or dates, original
       issue date or dates, interest rate or rates, if any, and any other
       terms of Securities of such series shall be determined by an Issuer
       Order or pursuant to such procedures,(d) if provided for in such
       procedures, such Issuer Order may authorize authentication and
       delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions
       from the Issuer or its duly authorized agent or agents, which oral
       instructions shall be promptly confirmed in writing and (e) after the
       original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued,
       any separate request by the Issuer that the Trustee authenticate
       Securities of such series for original issuance will be deemed to be a
       certification by the Issuer that it is in compliance with all
       conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the
       authentication and delivery of such Securities;

             (2)  the Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or executed
         supplemental indenture referred to in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 by or
         pursuant to which the forms and terms of the Securities of such
         series were established;

             (3)  an Officers' Certificate setting forth the form or forms and
         terms of the Securities stating that the form or forms and terms of
         the Securities have been established pursuant to Sections 2.1 and
         2.3 and comply with this Indenture and covering such other matters as
         the Trustee may reasonably request; and

             (4)  either an Opinion of Counsel, or a letter from legal counsel
         addressed to the Trustee permitting it to rely on an Opinion of
         Counsel, substantially to the effect that:

             (a)  the form or forms of the Securities of such series and the
             related Guarantees have been duly authorized and established in
             conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

             (b)  in the case of an underwritten offering, the terms of the
             Securities of such series and the related Guarantees have been
             duly authorized and established in conformity with the
             provisions of this Indenture, and, in the case of an offering
             that is not underwritten, certain terms of the Securities of
             such series have been established pursuant to a Board Resolution,
             an Officers' Certificate or a supplemental indenture in accordance
             with this Indenture, and when such other terms as are to be
             established pursuant to procedures set forth in an Issuer Order
             shall have been established, all such terms will have been duly
             authorized by the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, and
             will have been established in conformity with the provisions of
             this Indenture;

             (c)  when the Securities of such series have been executed bythe
             Issuer and the Guarantees endorsed thereon have been executed
             by the Guarantor and the Securities of such series have been
             authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of
             this Indenture and delivered to and duly paid for by the
             purchasers thereof, they will have been duly issued under this
             Indenture and will be valid and legally binding obligations of
             the Issuer and the Guarantor, respectively, enforceable in
             accordance with their respective terms, and will be entitled to
             the benefits of this Indenture; and

                 (d)  the execution and delivery by the Issuer and the
             Guarantor, as the case may be, of, and the performance by the
             Issuer and the Guarantor, as the case may be, of its obligations
             under, the Securities of such series and the Guarantees endorsed
             thereon will not contravene any provision of applicable law or
             the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Issuer or the
             Guarantor or any agreement or other instrument binding upon the
             Issuer or the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries that is
             material to the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, considered as one
             enterprise, or, to such counsel's knowledge after the inquiry
             indicated therein (which shall be reasonable), any judgment, order
             or decree of any governmental agency or any court having
             jurisdiction over the Issuer, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, and
             no consent, approval or authorization of any governmental body or
             agency is required for the performance by the Issuer and the
             Guarantor of their respective obligations under the Securities and
             the Guarantees, except such as are specified and have been
             obtained and such as may be required by the securities or blue sky
             laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale
             of the Securities.

             In addition, if the authentication and delivery relates to a new
series of Securities created by an indenture supplemental hereto, such Opinion
of Counsel shall also state that all laws and requirements with respect to the
form and execution by the Issuer and the Guarantor of the supplemental
indenture with respect to the series of Securities have been complied with,
the Issuer and the Guarantor each has corporate power to execute and deliver
any such supplemental indenture and has taken all necessary corporate action
for those purposes and any such supplemental indenture has been executed and
delivered and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Issuer and the Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms.

             In rendering such opinions, such counsel may qualify any opinions
as to enforceability by stating that such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and is subject to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).  Such counsel may rely, as to
all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the State of
Texas and the federal law of the United States, upon opinions of other counsel
(copies of which shall be delivered to the Trustee), who shall be counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, in which case the opinion shall state
that such counsel believes that both such counsel and the Trustee are entitled
so to rely.  Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion
involves factual matters, such counsel has relied, to the extent such counsel
deems proper, upon certificates of officers of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
and certificates of public officials.

             The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and
deliver any Securities of any series under this Section 2.4 if the Trustee,
being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be
taken by the Issuer, or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors
or board of trustees, executive committee or a trust committee of directors or
trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose
the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders or would adversely
affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities,
this Indenture or otherwise.

             If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.3 that the
Securities of a series are to be issued in the form of one or more Global
Securities, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance
with this Section 2.4 and the Issuer Order with respect to such series,
authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities (and the Guarantor
shall execute the Guarantees endorsed thereon) that (i) shall represent and
shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
all of the Securities of such series to be issued in the form of Global
Securities and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the
Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such
Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or
pursuant to such Depositary's instructions, and (iv) shall bear a legend
substantially to the following effect:  "Unless and until it is exchanged
in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, this
Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to the
nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary
or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such
nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary."

             Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 2.3 must, at the
time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a
clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and any other applicable statute or regulation.

             SECTION 2.5  Execution of Securities and Guarantees.  The
Securities shall be signed on behalf of the Issuer by the chairman of the
Board of Directors, the president, any vice president or the treasurer of
the Issuer, under its corporate seal which may, but need not, be attested
by its secretary or one of its assistant secretaries.  The Guarantees shall
be signed on behalf of the Guarantor by the chairman of the Board of
Directors, the president, any vice president or the treasurer of the
Guarantor, under its corporate seal which may, but need not, be attested by
its secretary or one of its assistant secretaries.  Such signatures may be
the manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such officers.
The seals of the Issuer and the Guarantor may be in the form of facsimiles
thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on
the Securities and the Guarantees, respectively.  Typographical and other
minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such
signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security
or Guarantee that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.

             In case any officer of the Issuer or the Guarantor who shall have
signed any of the Securities or the Guarantees endorsed thereon shall cease to
be such officer before the Security or Guarantee so signed shall be
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such
Security and the Guarantee endorsed thereon nevertheless may be authenticated
and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security or
Guarantee endorsed thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer or
the Guarantor, as the case may be; and any Security or Guarantee endorsed
thereon may be signed on behalf of the Issuer and the Guarantor, as the case
may be, by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such
Security or Guarantee, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantor, as the case may be, although at the date of the execution and
delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.

             SECTION 2.6  Certificate of Authentication.  Only such Securities
and Guarantees endorsed thereon as shall bear thereon a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the
Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, or its
Authenticating Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or
be valid or obligatory for any purpose.  The execution of such certificate by
the Trustee or its Authenticating Agent upon any Security executed by the
Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been
duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture.  Each reference in this Indenture to
authenticationby the Trustee includes authentication by an agent appointed
pursuant to Section 6.14.


             SECTION 2.7  Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of
Interest.  The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form
in denominations established as contemplated by Section 2.3 or, with respect
to the Securities of any series, if not so established, in denominations of
$1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.  The Securities of each series shall
be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in
accordance with such plan as the officers of the Issuer executing the same may
determine with the approval of the Trustee, as evidenced by the execution and
authentication thereof.

             Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.  The
Securities of each series shall bear interest, if any, from the date, and such
interest, if any, shall be payable on the dates, established as contemplated
by Section 2.3.

             The Person in whose name any Security of any series is registered
at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series
with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to
receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date
notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Security subsequent to the
record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the
extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such
interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest
shall be paid to the Persons in whose names Outstanding Securities for such
series are registered (a) at the close of business on a subsequent record date
(which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment
of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on
behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of Securities not less than 15 days
preceding such subsequent record date or (b) as determined by such other
procedure as is mutually acceptable to the Issuer and the Trustee.  The term
"record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date
for payment of defaulted interest) for the Securities of any series shall mean
the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of such series
established as contemplated by Section 2.3, or, if no such date is so
established, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month,
the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest
payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such
calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.

         SECTION 2.8  Registration, Transfer and Exchange.  The Issuer will
keep at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in
Section 3.2 for each series of Securities a register or registers in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will provide
for the registration of Securities of each series and the registration of
transfer of Securities of such series.  Each such register shall be in written
form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted
into such form within a reasonable time.  At all reasonable times such register
or registers shall be open for inspection and available for copying by the
Trustee.

       Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security
of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as
provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new
Security or Securities of the same series, maturity date, interest rate, if
any, and original issue date in authorized denominations for a like aggregate
principal amount, each such Security having endorsed thereon a Guarantee
executed by the Guarantor.

        All Securities presented for registration of transfer shall (if so
required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied
by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.

             At the option of the Holder thereof, Securities of any series
(other than a Global Security, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for
a Security or Securities of such series having authorized denominations and an
equal aggregate principal amount, each such Security having endorsed thereon a
Guarantee executed by the Guarantor, upon surrender of such Securities to be
exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such
purpose in accordance with Section 3.2. All Securities surrendered upon any
exchange or registration of transfer provided for in this Indenture shall be
promptly cancelled and returned to the Issuer.

             The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
registration of transfer of Securities.  No service charge shall be made for
any such transaction or for any exchange of Securities of any series as
contemplated by the immediately preceding paragraph.

             The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a
transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next
preceding the first mailing or publication of notice of redemption of
Securities of such series to be redeemed, (b) any Securities selected, called
or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of
any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed
or (c) any Security if the Holder thereof has exercised his right, if any, to
require the Issuer to repurchase such Security in whole or in part, except the
portion of such Security not required to be repurchased.

             Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, unless
and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive
registered form, a Global Security representing all or a part of the
Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the
Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of
such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by
such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series
or a nominee of such successor Depositary.

             If at any time the Depositary for any Securities of a series
represented by one or more Global Securities notifies the Issuer that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Securities or if at any
time the Depositary for such Securities shall no longer be eligible under
Section 2.4, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to
such Securities.  If a successor Depositary for such Securities is not
appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice
or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer's election pursuant to
Section 2.3 that such Securities be represented by one or more Global
Securities shall no longer be effective and the Issuer shall execute, and the
Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery
of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver
Securities of such series in definitive registered form, having endorsed
thereon a Guarantee executed by the Guarantor, in any authorized denominations,
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global
Security or Securities representing such Securities in exchange for such Global
Security or Securities.

             The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine
that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global
Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Securities.
In such event the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of
such series, shall authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in
definitive registered form, having endorsed thereon a Guarantee executed by
the Guarantor, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities
representing such Securities, in exchange for such Global Security or
Securities.

        If specified by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to
Securities represented by a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global
Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part
for Securities of the same series in definitive registered form, having
endorsed thereon a Guarantee executed by the Guarantor, on such terms as are
acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary.  Thereupon, the Issuer shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service
charge,


<PAGE>

           (i)  to the Person specified by such Depositary, a new Security
           or Securities of the same series, having endorsed thereon a
           Guarantee or Guarantees executed by the Guarantor, of any authorized
           denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate
           principal  amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's
           beneficial interest in the Global Security; and

           (ii)  to such Depositary a new Global Security, having a
          Guarantee endorsed thereon, in a denomination equal to the difference,
          if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global
          Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities
          authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.

             Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in
definitive registered form in authorized denominations, such Global Security
shall be cancelled by the Trustee or an agent of the Trustee.  Securities in
definitive registered form issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant
to this Section 2.8 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized
denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to
instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall
instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Trustee or the Issuer or an agent of
the Issuer.  The Trustee or such agent shall deliver at its office such
Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are
so registered.

             All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities shall be valid and legally binding obligations of the
Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

             SECTION 2.9  Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen
Securities.  In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become
mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its
discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the
Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Security of the same
series, maturity date, interest rate, if any, and original issue date, having
endorsed thereon a Guarantee executed by the Guarantor, bearing a number or
other distinguishing symbol not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and
substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and in
substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen.  In every case the
applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Issuer, the Guarantor
and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee
such security or indemnity as may be required by the Trustee or the Issuer or
the Guarantor or any such agent to indemnify and defend and to save each of
the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor and any such agent harmless and, in
every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof
and in the case of mutilation or defacement, shall surrender the Security to
the Trustee or such agent.

             Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Issuer may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Trustee or its agent) connected
therewith.  In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature or
has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be
destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute
Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof
except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for
such payment shall furnish to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee and
any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee such security or
indemnity as any of them may require to hold each of them harmless, and, in
every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to
the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the
Guarantor or the Trustee evidence to the Trustee's satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.

             Every substitute Security of any series issued pursuant to the
provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security is
destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual
obligation of the Issuer and the Guarantor with respect to the Guarantees
endorsed thereon, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall
be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits
of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this
Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of
such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  All Securities shall
be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by
law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall
preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or
statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the
replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without
their surrender.

             SECTION 2.10  Cancellation of Securities; Disposition Thereof.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer
or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or
analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer, the Guarantor or any agent of
the Issuer or the Guarantor or the Trustee or any agent of the Trustee, shall
be delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation or, if surrendered
to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued
in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of
this Indenture.  The Trustee shall dispose of all cancelled Securities in
accordance with its standard procedures and shall deliver a certificate of
such disposition to the Company.  If the Issuer or its Agent or the Guarantor
or its Agent shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not
operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by
such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee or its
Agent for cancellation.

             SECTION 2.11  Temporary Securities.  Pending the preparation of
definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed,
lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form
satisfactory to the Trustee).  Temporary Securities of any series shall be
issuable in any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the
definitive Securities of such series, and having endorsed thereon Guarantees
duly executed by the Guarantor, substantially in the form of the definitive
Guarantees, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be
appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer
and the Guarantor with the concurrence of the Trustee as evidenced by the
execution and authentication thereof.  Temporary Securities may contain such
references to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate.  Every
temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the
Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and
with like effect, as the definitive Securities.  Without unreasonable delay
the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such
series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in
exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by
the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2 and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such
series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the
same series, having endorsed thereon Guarantees executed by the Guarantor and
having authorized denominations.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities
of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
definitive Securities of such series, unless otherwise established pursuant to
Section 2.3.

        SECTION 2.12  CUSIP Numbers.  The Issuer in issuing the Securities
may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee
shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to
Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is
made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities
or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any
such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such
numbers.


                                  ARTICLE THREE
                    COVENANTS OF THE ISSUER AND THE GUARANTOR

             Sections 3.6 through and including 3.16 shall apply only to the
Notes unless otherwise specified in the supplemental indenture relating to any
series of Securities hereafter created.

             SECTION 3.1  Payment of Principal and Interest.  The Issuer
covenants and agrees that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on each of the
Securities at the place, at the respective times and in the manner provided in
the Securities.

             SECTION 3.2  Offices for Notices and Payments, etc.  So long as
any of the Securities are Outstanding, the Issuer and the Guarantor will
maintain in each Place of Payment, an office or agency where the Securities
may be presented for payment, an office or agency where the Securities may be
presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as provided in this
Indenture, and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the
Issuer or the Guarantor in respect of the Securities or of this Indenture may
be served.  In case the Issuer or the Guarantor shall at any time fail to
maintain any such office or agency, or shall fail to give notice to the
Trustee of any change in the location thereof, presentation may be made and
notice and demand may be served in respect of the Securities or of this
Indenture at the Corporate Trust Office.  Each of the Issuer and the
Guarantor hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office for each such
purpose and appoints the Trustee as registrar and paying agent and as the
agent upon whom notices and demands may be served with respect to the
Securities.

             SECTION 3.3  No Interest Extension.  In order to prevent any
accumulation of claims for interest after maturity thereof, the Issuer will
not directly or indirectly extend or consent to the extension of the time for
the payment of any claim for interest on any of the Securities and will not
directly or indirectly be a party to or approve any such arrangement by the
purchase or funding of said claims or in any other manner; provided, however,
that this Section 3.3 shall not apply in any case where an extension shall be
made pursuant to a plan proposed by the Issuer to the Holders of all
Securities of any series then Outstanding.

             SECTION 3.4  Appointments to Fill Vacancies in Trustee's Office.
The Issuer, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of the
Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 6.10, a Trustee, so
that there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.

             SECTION 3.5  Provision as to Paying Agent.  (a)  If the Issuer
shall appoint a paying agent other than the Trustee, it will cause such paying
agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such paying
agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section
3.5,

            (1)  that it will hold all sums held by it as such paying agent
         for the payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on the
         Securities (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Issuer or by
         any other obligor on the Securities) in trust for the benefit of the
         Holders of the Securities and the Trustee; and

            (2)  that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the
         Issuer (or by any other obligor on the Securities) to make any
         payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any,
         on the Securities when the same shall be due and payable; and

            (3)  that it will, at any time during the continuance of any such
         failure, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to
         the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent.

             (b)  If the Issuer shall act as its own paying agent, it will, on
or before each due date of the principal of or interest, if any, on the
Securities, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the
Holders of the Securities a sum sufficient to pay such principal, premium, if
any, or interest, if any, so becoming due and will notify the Trustee of any
failure to take such action and of any failure by the Issuer (or by any other
obligor under the Securities) to make any payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities when the same shall
become due and payable.

             (c)  Anything in this Section 3.5 to the contrary
notwithstanding,the Issuer may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay or
cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust by it, or any paying
agent hereunder, as required by this Section 3.5, such sums to be held by the
Trustee upon the trusts herein contained.

             (d)  Anything in this Section 3.5 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any agreement of the Trustee or any paying agent to hold
sums in trust as provided in this Section 3.5 is subject to Sections 10.3 and
10.4.

             (e)  Whenever the Issuer shall have one or more paying agents, it
will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest, if any, on
any Securities, deposit with a paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the
principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to
be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal,
premium, if any, or interest, if any, and (unless such paying agent is the
Trustee) the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure
so to act.

             SECTION 3.6  Limitation on Indebtedness.  The Guarantor will not,
and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, incur,
create, assume, guarantee or in any other manner become directly or indirectly
liable or responsible for the payment of, any Indebtedness (including any
Acquired Indebtedness), other than Permitted Indebtedness, unless at the time
of such event (a) (i) any such Indebtedness (other than Senior Indebtedness of
the Guarantor and Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) has no sinking fund or
amortization payment date or final maturity date prior to the Stated Maturity
of the Notes and (ii) in the case of Indebtedness subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or the Guarantees thereof, the instrument evidencing such
Indebtedness shall include subordination provisions substantially similar to
those set forth in Articles Thirteen and Fourteen subordinating such
Indebtedness to the Notes and the Guarantees, as the case may be, to the same
extent as if the Notes were Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the
Guarantees were Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, in each case, with
respect to such Indebtedness and (b) after giving effect thereto and to any
acquisition being financed through the incurrence of such Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) on a pro forma basis, either (i) the ratio
expressed as a percentage of (A) the Indebtedness of the Guarantor and its
Restricted Subsidiaries to (B) the sum of (1) the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate
with respect to the Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries plus (2) the
value of the Guarantor's direct or indirect percentage ownership in
publicly-held Subsidiaries (other than its Restricted Subsidiaries) engaged in
oil and gas exploration, development, production or transportation and,
without duplication, the Special Subsidiaries, in each case based upon the
Average Quoted Price of the common stock of such Subsidiaries or Special
Subsidiaries, shall not be greater than 40% or (ii) the ratio expressed as a
percentage of (A) the Indebtedness of the Guarantor and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to (B) the sum of (1) the Indebtedness of the Guarantor and its
Restricted Subsidiaries plus (2) the product of the number of outstanding
shares of the Guarantor's Capital Stock as of the date of determination
multiplied by the Average Quoted Price of such Capital Stock plus (3) the
product of the numberof outstanding shares of the Issuer's Capital Stock
(other than any shares held by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary) as of the
date of determination multiplied by the Average Quoted Price of such Capital
Stock, shall not be greater than 25%.  For purposes of this calculation, (i)
a Subsidiary shall be considered publicly-held if there is a Quoted Price
available for its Capital Stock and (ii) the Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate
shall include, in connection with an acquisition, on a pro forma basis the
Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate, if any, of any acquired Person and shall be
determined as of the end of the fiscal year of the Guarantor and, if
applicable, the acquired Person, most recently concluded if then available,
but if not then available, the end of the previous fiscal year of the
Guarantor and, if applicable, the acquired Person; provided,
however, that the Guarantor may, at its option, make such calculation
utilizing a more recent Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate in lieu of the Oil and
Gas Reserve Estimate referred to in the preceding clause if (a) such
estimate is prepared, to the extent of at least 85% of the quantities of
proven oil and gas reserves set forth in such estimate (which shall be
determined on the basis that six thousand cubic feet of gas equal one
barrel of oil), by a nationally recognized independent petroleum engineer,
(b) such Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate is determined on a basis consistent
with the estimate prepared at fiscal year end, except that the oil and gas
prices and currency prices utilized therein shall be as of the date of such
more recent estimate and (c) an officer authorized by the Guarantor delivers
to the Trustee a certificate to the effect that such estimate has been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.6.


             SECTION 3.7  Limitation on Restricted Payments.  The Guarantor
will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly:

       (i)  declare or pay any dividend on, or make any distribution to
       holders of, any shares of the Guarantor's Capital Stock (other than
       (A) the payment of a dividend within 60 days after the date of
       declaration thereof, (B) dividends or distributions payable in shares
       of its Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to
       purchase such Capital Stock and (C) dividends on Preferred Stock, w
       which Preferred Stock by its terms is not mandatorily redeemable or
       redeemable at the option of the holder thereof prior to the Stated
       Maturity of the Notes, provided that the dividend rate on such
       Preferred Stock on the date of its issuance shall not exceed the yield
       to maturity on the Notes calculated on the basis of the average Quoted
       Prices of the Notes for the 20 consecutive trading days ending 5 days
       prior to the issuance of such Preferred Stock, but excluding dividends
       or distributions payable in Redeemable Stock or in options, warrants
       or other rights to purchase Redeemable Stock except for dividends on
       such Redeemable Stock payable in shares of Redeemable Stock),

       (ii)  purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any
       Capital Stock of the Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, or any
       options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock
       (other   than (A) redemption of Preferred Stock that is convertible
       into common stock, provided that the average Quoted Price of such
       common stock for the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
       full trading day prior to the date of the notice of such redemption
       equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price of such Preferred
       Stock, (B) with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary, purchases or
       redemptions pursuant to the Guarantor's Shareholders' Rights Plan
       or purchases or redemptions in


<PAGE>
       the ordinary course of business not to exceed $10,000 a year, (C) in
       connection with a transaction whereby a Subsidiary or a Special
       Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or a Subsidiary or a
       Special Subsidiary is being merged with or into the Guarantor or a
       Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture,
       and (D) through the issuance of Capital Stock of the Guarantor (other
       than Redeemable Stock)),

       (iii)  make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase,
       defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to any date
       earlier than six months before any scheduled principal payment,
       maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any
       Indebtedness which is subordinated in right of payment to, the prior
       payment of the Notes or to the Guarantees, provided, however, that
       such Indebtedness may be redeemed in connection with any refinancing
       of such Indebtedness so long as the new Indebtedness incurred in such
       refinancing is pari passu with, or is subordinated in right of payment
       to, the Indebtedness being refinanced and has an average life equal to
       or greater than the Indebtedness being refinanced,

       (iv)  declare or pay any dividend or distribution on any Capital
       Stock of any Subsidiary to any Person (other than the Guarantor or a
       Restricted Subsidiary) or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or
       retire for value, any Capital Stock of any Subsidiary (other than with
       shares of Capital Stock (except Redeemable Stock) of the Guarantor)
       held by any Person (other than the Guarantor or any of its Restricted
       Subsidiaries),

             (v)  incur, create or assume any guarantee of Indebtedness of any
         Affiliate (other than guarantees of Indebtedness of a Restricted
         Subsidiary by the Guarantor, guarantees of Indebtedness of the
         Guarantor by any Subsidiary or guarantees of Indebtedness of any
         Subsidiary or Special Subsidiary of the Guarantor by the Guarantor
         pursuant to a transaction whereby any such Subsidiary or Special
         Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, including, without
         limitation, (a) the execution by the obligor of such obligation of an
         Intercompany Agreement and (b) the inclusion of provisions in the
         guarantee substantially similar to those set forth in Articles
         Thirteen and Fourteen which subordinate such guarantee to the Notes
         and the Guarantees to the same extent as if the Notes were Senior
         Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantees were Senior Indebtedness
         of the Guarantor, in each case, with respect to such guarantee,
         provided that such guarantee is not otherwise prohibited by the terms
         of this Indenture), or

             (vi)  make any Investment (other than as permitted in the
    preceding clauses (ii) and (v) or a Permitted Investment) in any
    Person, other than an Investment in a Restricted Subsidiary or any
    Special Subsidiary which becomes a Restricted Subsidiary in connection
    with such Investment, provided that to the extent applicable (a) the
    obligation of the obligor in any such Investment is subject to an
    Intercompany Agreement and (b) the inclusion of provisions in the
    agreement governing the Investment substantially similar to those set
    forth in Articles Thirteen and Fourteen which subordinate the
    Investment to the Notes and the Guarantees to the same extent as if
    the Notes were Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantees
    were Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor,

(such payments or other actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(vi) are collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments") unless at the time
of and after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment (the amount of
any such Restricted Payment, if other than cash, as determined by the Board of
Directors, whose determination shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution) (I)
no Default or Event of Default exists or occurs as a result of such Restricted
Payment, (II) the Guarantor could incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 3.6 (provided that in the case of Restricted
Payments permitted in the preceding clauses (ii), (v) and (vi), the Guarantor
could incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness, including Permitted
Indebtedness) and (III) the aggregate amount expended for all Restricted
Payments (excluding any amount repaid, returned or discharged in respect of
any Restricted Payment) shall not exceed the sum of:

         (A)  50% of the aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income of the
         Guarantor or its predecessor (calculated to exclude net income of
         Subsidiaries that are not Restricted Subsidiaries and to exclude the
         after-tax effect of the net income of any Subsidiary to the extent
         that such Subsidiary is restricted or prohibited from declaring
         dividends) on a cumulative basis during the period beginning on the
         first day following the last fiscal year that ended prior to the
         date of this Indenture and ending on the last day of the Guarantor's
         last fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such proposed
         Restricted Payment (or, if such aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net
         Income shall be a loss, minus 100% of such loss) and 50% of the
         aggregate cumulative dividends received by the Guarantor from any
         Subsidiary or Special Subsidiary (other than a Restricted Subsidiary)
         during the same period, plus

             (B) the aggregate net proceeds received (including, without
         limitation, Indebtedness or redemption or repurchase obligations
         discharged, repaid or otherwise satisfied upon any conversion of
         convertible Indebtedness or Redeemable Stock into Capital Stock of
         the Guarantor or its predecessor) after the date of this Indenture
         as capital contributions from the issuance of Capital Stock other
         than Redeemable Stock;

provided, however, the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses
(II) or (III) (but not (I)) above shall not prevent the Guarantor or any
Restricted Subsidiary from (y) making Restricted Payments not to exceed
$5,000,000 in the aggregate (excluding any amount repaid, returned or
discharged in respect of any Restricted Payment) which amount shall be in
addition to any amounts paid under clause (III) above, or (z) making
Restricted Payments necessary for and directly related (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors and evidenced in a Board Resolution, which
determination shall be conclusive) to the development, transportation or
marketing of the oil and gas reserves of the Guarantor and its Restricted
Subsidiaries located in the Republic of Colombia, which amounts shall be in
addition to any amounts paid under clause (III) above, and that in each
case are not otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Indenture.

    SECTION 3.8  Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.  The Guarantor
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, enter into any transaction or series of related transactions
(including, without limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or lease of
assets, property or services) with any Affiliate (other than a wholly-owned
Subsidiary) of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary in an aggregate amount greater
than $1,000,000 unless (i) such transaction or series of related transactions
is on terms that are no less favorable to the Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as
the case may be, than those that would have been available in a comparable
arm's-length transaction with an unaffiliated third party and (ii) (A) with
respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving
aggregate payments in excess of $1,000,000, but less than $10,000,000, the
Guarantor delivers an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee generally
describing such transaction and certifying that such transaction or
transactions complies with clause (i) above and (B) with respect to a
transaction or series of transactions involving aggregate payments equal
to or greater than $10,000,000, such transaction or transactions shall
have received the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors of
the Board of Directors (as evidenced by a
Board Resolution by such disinterested directors, a certified copy of which
has been delivered to the Trustee).

             SECTION 3.9  Disposition of Proceeds of Asset Sales.  (a)  The
Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries (excluding the
Special Subsidiaries, Triton Air Holdings, Inc. and their respective
Subsidiaries) to, make any Asset Sale unless (i) such Asset Sale is for not
less than the fair market value of the assets or shares sold (as determined by
the Board of Directors and evidenced in a Board Resolution, which
determination shall be conclusive), (ii) at least 85% of the consideration (not
including the assumption of any Indebtedness by the purchaser in connection
with such Asset Sale) consists of cash and Cash Equivalents and the fair market
value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and evidenced in a
Board Resolution, which determination shall be conclusive) of debt and equity
securities listed on any recognized securities exchange or traded in any
recognized over-the-counter market, except (x) in the case of an Asset Sale
involving oil and gas properties being sold to Persons other than Subsidiaries
by one or more Subsidiaries of the Guarantor or the Guarantor, the
consideration may consist solely or in part of oil and gas properties having a
fair market value at least equal to the fair market value of the assets
exchanged (as determined by the Board of Directors and evidenced by a Board
Resolution, which determination shall be conclusive), (y) in the case of an
Asset Sale involving Aero Services International, Inc., the consideration need
not be for cash and may consist in whole or in part of a promissory note not
to exceed $10,000,000, and (z) the Guarantor may enter into farm-out
transactions consistent with industry standards and otherwise in accordance
with the terms of this Indenture, including, but not limited to, Section 3.8,
and (iii) as otherwise set forth below.

             (b)  Within 12 months of any Asset Sale, the Guarantor or such
Subsidiary shall either (i) apply or cause the application of the Net Cash
Proceeds of such Asset Sale, or a portion thereof, to the permanent repayment
or prepayment of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or Senior Indebtedness of
the Guarantor or the 1997 Notes or (ii) invest, or enter into a legally
binding agreement to invest, such Net Cash Proceeds, or a portion thereof,
in properties and assets to replace the properties and assets that were the
subject of such Asset Sale or in properties and assets that (as determined by
the Board of Directors and evidenced in a Board Resolution, which
determination shall be conclusive) will be used in the business of the
Guarantor or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, existing on the date of
this Indenture or in businesses the principal purposes of which are related to
the exploration, development, production or transportation of oil or gas,
provided, however, that in the event the Guarantor or any Subsidiary conveys,
transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of, directly or indirectly, any of its
Colombian Assets in a transaction or series of related transactions within any
consecutive 12-month period the effect of which is to reduce the Oil and Gas
Reserve Estimate of the Colombian Assets owned by the Guarantor and/or its
Subsidiaries by 50% or more (which value shall be determined by reference to
the most recently available Oil and Gas Reserve Estimate, or by any subsequent
estimate prepared by a nationally recognized petroleum engineering firm) or
such transaction reduces the Guarantor's direct and indirect net revenue
interest in either the Santiago de las Atalayas or Tauramena contract areas of
the Llanos Basin to less than 50% of such interest as of the date of this
Indenture, calculated to give effect to back-in interests of and equalization
and unitization arrangements with third parties, then the Guarantor or such
Subsidiary shall apply the Net Cash Proceeds resulting from such transaction
and every transaction thereafter with respect to the Colombian Assets to
either (A) permanently repay or prepay Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or
Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor or the 1997 Notes or (B) redeem the
Notes at a price equal to the Colombian Sale Redemption Price and otherwise
in accordance with the provisions of Article Twelve as if an optional
redemption were being made, in each case within 90 days of such transaction.
If any such legally binding agreement to invest any Net Cash Proceeds
referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence is terminated, then the
Guarantor may invest such Net Cash Proceeds, prior to the
end of such 12-month period or within 90 days from such termination, whichever
is later, in the business of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as provided in
clauses (i) and (ii) above.  The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not applied,
used or invested as set forth above constitutes "Excess Proceeds."

             (c)  When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds equals
$10,000,000 or more, the Guarantor shall so notify the Trustee in writing and
the Issuer shall offer to purchase from all Holders of the Notes (an "Asset
Sale Offer"), and shall purchase from Holders accepting such Asset Sale Offer
on the date fixed for such Asset Sale Offer (the "Asset Sale Offer Date"), the
maximum amount (expressed in integral multiples of aggregate principal amount
of $1,000) of Notes that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.9(e) (the "Asset Sale
Amount"), at an offer price (the "Asset Sale Offer Price") in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the Accreted Amount thereof on any Asset Sale Offer
Date prior to December 15, 1996 or 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to any Asset Sale Offer Date on or after
December 15, 1996, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
3.9(e).  To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to
an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds relating thereto (such
shortfall constituting a "Deficiency"), then the Guarantor may use such
Deficiency, or a portion thereof, for general corporate purposes.  Upon
completion of an Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero.

             (d)  If the Issuer becomes obligated to make an Asset Sale Offer
pursuant to Section 3.9(c), Notes shall be purchased by the Issuer, at the
option of the Holder thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of
aggregate principal amount of $1,000, on a date that is not earlier than 30
days nor later than 60 days from the date the Asset Sale Offer Notice referred
to in Section 3.9(e) below is given to Holders, or such later date as may be
necessary for the Issuer to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act
(such date, or such later date, being the "Asset Sale Purchase Date"), subject
to proration in the event the Asset Sale Amount is less than the aggregate
Asset Sale Offer Price of all Notes tendered and to satisfaction by or on
behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in Section 3.9(f).

             (e)  Within 30 days after the date that the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds equals or exceeds $10,000,000, the Issuer shall give written
notice of the offer (an "Asset Sale Offer Notice") to the Trustee and to each
Holder of the Notes, at their addresses appearing in the Note register, by
first-class mail postage prepaid.  The Trustee shall be under no obligation to
ascertain whether the Issuer is obligated to make an Asset Sale Offer.  The
Asset Sale Offer Notice shall contain all instructions and materials necessary
to enable the Holders to tender Notes, shall include a form of Asset Sale
Purchase Notice (as defined in Section 3.9(f)) to be completed by the Holder
and shall state or provide:

             (i)  that the Holder has the right to require the Issuer to
         repurchase, subject to proration, such Holder's Notes at the Asset
         Sale Offer Price and the date by which a Holder must give an Asset
         Sale Purchase Notice;

             (ii) the Asset Sale Offer Price;

             (iii) the Asset Sale Purchase Date;

             (iv) that any Note not purchased will continue to accrue original
         issue discount and interest, as applicable;

             (v)  that Notes to be purchased shall, on the Asset Sale Purchase
         Date, become due and payable at the Asset Sale Offer Price and from
         and after such date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment
         of the Asset Sale Offer Price) such Notes shall cease to accrue
         original issue discount and interest, as applicable;

             (vi) that the Notes to be purchased are subject to proration in
         the event the Asset Sale Amount is less than the aggregate Asset
         Sale Offer Price of all Notes tendered;

             (vii) (A) the Guarantor's most recently filed Annual Report on
        Form 10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements), the
        Guarantor's most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form
        10-Q, as applicable, and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the
        Guarantor filed subsequent to such Quarterly Report (or, if the
        Guarantor is not required to file any of the foregoing forms, the
        comparable information required to be prepared by the Guarantor
        pursuant to Section 4.3), (B) a description of any material
        developments in the Guarantor's business since its latest annual or
        quarterly report filed with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.3 and,
        if material, any appropriate pro forma financial information
        (including, but not limited to, pro forma historical income, cash flow
        and capitalization after giving effect to such Asset Sale) and (C)
        such other information, if any, concerning the business of the
        Guarantor which the Issuer in good faith believes will enable such
        Holders to make an informed investment decision; and

             (viii) the procedures a Holder must follow to exercise rights
        under Section 3.9(c) and a brief description of those rights and the
        procedures for withdrawing an Asset Sale Purchase Notice.

             (f)  A Holder may exercise its rights specified in Section 3.9(c)
upon (i) delivery to the Paying Agent specified in the Asset Sale Offer Notice
of a written notice (an "Asset Sale Purchase Notice") at any time prior to the
close of business on the Asset Sale Purchase Date, but not later than the
close of business on the second Business Day next preceding the Asset Sale
Purchase Date, stating (A) the certificate number of the Note that the Holder
will tender to be purchased and (B) the portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Note that the Holder will tender to be purchased, which portion
must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and (ii) delivery of such Note
to such Paying Agent at such office prior to or on or after the Asset Sale
Purchase Date (together with all necessary endorsements), such delivery being
a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Asset Sale Offer Price therefor;
provided that Notes to be purchased are subject to proration in the event the
Asset Sale Amount is less than the aggregate Asset Sale Offer Price of all
Notes tendered for purchase.  If a Holder has elected to deliver to the Issuer
for purchase a portion of a Note, and if the aggregate principal amount of
such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, the Issuer shall,
subject to proration, purchase such portion from the Holder thereof pursuant
to this Section 3.9.  Provisions of this Indenture that apply to the purchase
of all of a Note also apply to the purchase of a portion of such Note.  Each
Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Issuer of the receipt by the former of
any and all Asset Sale Purchase Notices and any and all written notices of
withdrawal thereof.

             (g)  Upon receipt by the Paying Agent specified in the Asset Sale
Offer Notice of an Asset Sale Purchase Notice, the Holder of the Note in
respect of which such Asset Sale Purchase Notice was given shall (unless such
Asset Sale Purchase Notice is withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.9(k)) thereafter
be entitled to receive solely the Asset Sale Offer Price with respect to such
Note.  Such Asset Sale Offer Price shall be paid to such Holder promptly
following the later of the Business Day following the Asset Sale Purchase Date
(provided the conditions in Section 3.9(f) have been satisfied) and the time
of delivery of such Note to the relevant Paying Agent at the office of such
Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 3.9(f).

             (h)  On or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Asset
Sale Purchase Date, the Issuer or the Guarantor shall deposit with the Paying
Agent specified in the Asset Sale Offer Notice (or if the Issuer is acting as


<PAGE>

its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 6.5)
an amount of money in same day funds (or New York Clearing House funds if such
deposit is made prior to the Asset Sale Purchase Date) sufficient to pay the
aggregate Asset Sale Offered Price of all the Notes or portions thereof which
are to be purchased on that date.

             (i)  Any Note that is to be purchased only in part shall be
surrendered to the Paying Agent specified in the Asset Sale Offer Notice at
the office of such Paying Agent (with, if the Issuer or the Trustee so
requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the
Issuer shall execute, the Guarantor shall execute the Guarantee endorsed
on, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such
Note, without service charge, one or more new Notes of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder in an aggregate principal amount
equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the
Note so surrendered that is not purchased.

       (j)  The Issuer and the Guarantor shall comply with any applicable
tender offer rules then in effect, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14e-1 promulgated thereunder, in connection with an Asset Sale Offer.
In the event of any conflict between such tender offer rules and the
provisions set forth in this Section 3.9, such tender offer rules shall control.

             (k)  An Asset Sale Purchase Notice may be withdrawn before or
after delivery by the Holder to the relevant Paying Agent at the office of
such Paying Agent of the Note to which such Asset Sale Purchase Notice relates,
by means of a written notice of withdrawal (by facsimile transmission or letter)
received by such Paying Agent at such office not later than three Business
Days prior to the Asset Sale Purchase Date, specifying, as applicable:

             (i)  the certificate number of the Note in respect of which such
         notice of withdrawal is being submitted;

             (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes initially
         outstanding hereunder with respect to which such notice of withdrawal
         is being submitted; and

             (iii)  the aggregate principal amount initially outstanding
         hereunder of the Note that remains subject to the original Asset Sale
         Purchase Notice and that has been or will be delivered for purchase
         by the Issuer.

A written notice of withdrawal may be in the form set forth in the preceding
paragraph.  Each Paying Agent will promptly return to the prospective Holders
thereof any Notes with respect to which an Asset Sale Purchase Notice has been
withdrawn in compliance with this Indenture.

             (l)  The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary
to, create or permit to exist or become effective any restriction (other than
restrictions existing under (i) Indebtedness as in effect on the date of this
Indenture or (ii) any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer existing on the date
of this Indenture or thereafter or any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor
existing on the date of this Indenture or thereafter) that would materially
impair the ability of the Issuer to make an Asset Sale Offer to purchase the
Notes upon an Asset Sale or, if such Asset Sale Offer is made, to pay for the
Notes tendered for purchase.

             SECTION 3.10  Limitation on Liens.  The Guarantor will not, and
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Lien of any kind upon any of their respective assets or properties
now owned or acquired after the date of this Indenture, or any income or
profits therefrom, securing any Indebtedness of the Guarantor that is
expressly by its terms subordinate or junior in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Guarantor, unless the Guarantees are equally and ratably
secured, provided, however, that if such Lien securing such junior or
subordinated Indebtedness ceases to exist, such equal and ratable Lien for the
benefit of the Holders of the Guarantees shall cease to exist; provided,
further, that the Lien securing such subordinated or junior Indebtedness shall
be subordinated and junior to the Lien securing the Guarantees with the same
relative priority as such subordinated or junior Indebtedness shall have with
respect to the Guarantees.

             For purposes of this Indenture, the Guarantees will be considered
equally and ratably secured with any other Lien if the Lien securing the
Guarantees is of at least equal priority and covers the same property or
assets as such other Lien.

             SECTION 3.11  Limitation Upon Other Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness.  Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor will incur, create,
assume, guarantee or in any other manner become directly or indirectly liable
with respect to or be responsible for, or permit to remain outstanding, any
Indebtedness (other than the Notes, the Guarantees, the 1997 Notes or the 1997
Guarantees) that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to any Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer or Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, unless
such Indebtedness is also pari passu with, or subordinate in right of payment
to, the Notes and the Guarantees pursuant to subordination provisions
substantially similar to those set forth in Articles Thirteen and Fourteen.

             SECTION 3.12  Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries.  The Guarantor will not, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any
other distributions on Capital Stock of any Subsidiary, (ii) pay any
Indebtedness owed to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, (iii) make any Investment
in the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, or (iv) transfer any of its property or
assets to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, except

             (A) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement in
         effect at or entered into on the date of this Indenture,

             (B) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Person that
         was not a Subsidiary of the Issuer on the date of this Indenture, in
         existence at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary of the
         Guarantor or created on the date it becomes a Subsidiary and not
         incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person
         becoming a Subsidiary,

             (C) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
      Subsidiary to transfer any of its real property (and any improvements
      thereon) acquired after the date of this Indenture, to the Guarantor
      or any Subsidiary that is required by a lender to, or purchaser of any
      Indebtedness of, such Subsidiary in connection with a financing of
      the acquisition of such property (and/or construction of such
      improvements) by such Subsidiary permitted under this Indenture,

             (D) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any agreement that
         extends, refinances, renews or replaces any agreement containing any
         of the restrictions described in the foregoing clauses (A) through
         (C), provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such
         restrictions are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the
         Notes than those under or pursuant to the agreement evidencing the
         Indebtedness so extended, refinanced, renewed or replaced,

             (E) encumbrances or restrictions arising under law,

             (F) any encumbrance or restriction arising under customary
         non-assignment provisions in installment purchase contracts, and

             (G) in the case of clause (iv) above, restrictions contained in
         security agreements permitted by this Indenture securing Indebtedness
         permitted by this Indenture to the extent such restrictions restrict
         the transfer of property subject to such security agreements or any
         renewals, extensions, substitutions, refinancings or replacements of
         such Indebtedness, provided, however, that the terms and conditions
         of any such restrictions shall not be materially less favorable to
         the Holders of the Notes than those under or pursuant to the
         agreement evidencing the Indebtedness so renewed, extended,
         substituted refinanced, or replaced.

             SECTION 3.13  Limitation on Guaranties.  (a)  The Guarantor will
not permit any Subsidiary (other than the Issuer), directly or indirectly, to
assume, guarantee or in any other manner become liable with respect to the
payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or Senior Indebtedness of the
Guarantor, unless (i) such Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a
supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for the guarantee of the
payment of the Notes by such Subsidiary, which guarantee shall include
subordination provisions substantially similar to those set forth in Article
Thirteen to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer; and (ii) such Subsidiary waives and will not in
any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of
reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the
Guarantor or any other Subsidiary as a result of such payment by such
Subsidiary under its guarantee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
guarantee by a Subsidiary of the Notes shall provide by its terms that it
shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the
release or discharge of such guarantee of payment of such Senior Indebtedness
of the Issuer or such Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor.

             (b)  The Guarantor will not permit any Subsidiary (other than the
Issuer), directly or indirectly, to assume, guarantee or in any other manner
become liable with respect to the payment of any Indebtedness which is pari
passu with or subordinated to the Notes, unless such Subsidiary simultaneously
executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for
a guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Subsidiary; provided, however,
in the case of such Subsidiary's assumption, guarantee or other liability with
respect to Indebtedness subordinated to the Notes, such guarantee, assumption
or other liability shall be subordinated to such Subsidiary's guarantee of the
Notes to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes;
and provided, further, that this Section 3.13(b) shall not be applicable to any
guarantee, assumption or other liability of any Subsidiary of the Guarantor in
existence on the date of this Indenture or that (i) existed at the time such
Person became a Subsidiary of the Guarantor or its predecessor and (ii) was
not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a
Subsidiary of the Guarantor or its predecessor.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such guarantee of the Notes by a Subsidiary shall provide by its
terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon the release or discharge of such guarantee of such Indebtedness that is
pari passu with or subordinated to the Notes.

             SECTION 3.14  Purchase of Notes Upon Change in Control.  (a)  If
there shall have occurred a Change in Control, Notes shall be purchased by the
Issuer, at the option of the Holder thereof, in whole or in part in integral
multiples of aggregate principal amount of $1,000, on a date that is not
earlier than 45 days nor later than 60 days from the date the Change in
Control Notice referred to in paragraph (c) below is given to Holders or such
later date as may be necessary for the Issuer and the Guarantor to comply with
requirements under the Exchange Act (such date, or such later date, being the
"Change in Control Purchase Date"), at a purchase price in cash (the "Change
in Control Purchase Price") equal to 101% of the Accreted Amount thereof on
any Change in Control Purchase Date prior to December 15, 1996 or 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to any
Change in Control Purchase Date on or after December 15, 1996, subject to
satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in
Section 3.14(c).

         (b)  Within 30 days following a Change in Control and prior to the
mailing of the Change in Control Notice to Holders provided for in paragraph
(c) below, the Issuer and the Guarantor covenant to either (1) repay in full
all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor and Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
the terms of which require such payment in connection with such event or (2)
obtain the requisite consent from holders of such Senior Indebtedness not
repaid in order to permit the repurchase of the Notes as provided for in this
Section 3.14.  The Issuer and the Guarantor shall first comply with this
subsection (b) before the Issuer shall be required to repurchase the Notes
pursuant to this Section 3.14, and any failure to comply with this subsection
(b) shall constitute a Default in the performance of a covenant for purposes
of Section 5.1(b).

             (c)  Within 30 days after the occurrence of a Change in Control,
the Issuer shall give written notice of such Change in Control (a "Change in
Control Notice") and of its offer (the "Change in Control Offer") to purchase
Notes as specified herein to the Trustee and to each Holder of the Notes at
its address appearing on the Note register, by first-class mail, postage
prepaid. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to ascertain whether the
Issuer is obligated to give a Change in Control Notice.  The Change in Control
Notice shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such
Holders to tender Notes, shall include a form of written notice to be completed
by Holders electing to have Notes purchased under Section 3.14(a) (a "Change in
Control Purchase Notice") and shall state or include:

             (i)  that a Change in Control has occurred and the circumstances
         and events causing the Change in Control and the date such Change in
         Control is deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Section
         3.14(c);

             (ii) the date by which a Holder must give a Change in Control
         Purchase Notice;

             (iii) the Change in Control Purchase Price;

             (iv)  the Change in Control Purchase Date;

             (v)  that any Note not purchased will continue to accrue original
         issue discount and interest, as applicable;

             (vi)  that Notes to be purchased shall, on the Change in Control
       Purchase Date, become due and payable at the Change in Control
       Purchase Price and from and after such date (unless the Issuer shall
       default in the payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price) such
       Notes shall cease to accrue original issue discount and interest,
       as applicable;

            (vii) (A) the Guarantor's most recently filed Annual Report on
         Form 10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements),
         the Guarantor's most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on
         Form 10-Q, as applicable, and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the
         Guarantor filed subsequent to such Quarterly Report (or, if the
         Guarantor is not required to file any of the foregoing forms, the
         comparable information required to be prepared by the Guarantor
         pursuant to Section 4.3), (B) a description of any material
         developments in the Guarantor's business since its latest annual or
         quarterly report filed with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.3 and,
         if material, any appropriate pro forma financial information
         (including but not limited to pro forma historical income, cash flow
         and capitalization after giving effect to such Change in Control)
         and (C) such other information, if any, concerning the business of the
         Guarantor which the Guarantor in good faith believes will enable such
         Holders to make an informed investment decision; and

             (viii)  the procedures a holder must follow to exercise rights
         under this Section 3.14(c) and a brief description of those rights
         and the procedures for withdrawing a Change in Control Purchase
         Notice.

             (d)  Holders electing to have Notes purchased under Section
3.14(a) will be required to deliver a Change in Control Purchase Notice and
surrender such Notes to the Paying Agent specified in the Change of Control
Notice at the address specified in the notice by the close of business at
least five Business Days prior to the Change in Control Purchase Date.
Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if such Paying Agent
receives, at the close of business not later than three Business Days prior to
the Change in Control Purchase Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission
or letter setting forth (i) the name of the Holder, (ii)  the certificate
number of the Note in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being
submitted, (iii)  the aggregate principal amount of the Notes delivered for
purchase by the Holder as to which its election is to be withdrawn, and (iv)
a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Notes
purchased.  Each Paying Agent will promptly return to the prospective Holders
thereof any Notes with respect to which a Change in Control Purchase Notice
has been withdrawn in compliance herewith.

             (e)  Upon receipt by the Paying Agent specified in the Change of
Control Notice of a Change in Control Purchase Notice, the Holder of the Note
in respect of which such Change in Control Purchase Notice was given shall
(unless such Change in Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn pursuant to
Section 3.14(d)) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Change in
Control Purchase Price with respect to such Note.  Such Change in Control
Purchase Price shall be paid to such Holder promptly following the later of
the Business Day following the Change in Control Purchase Date (provided the
conditions in Section 3.14(d) have been satisfied) and the time of delivery
of such Note to the relevant Paying Agent at the office of such Paying Agent
by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 3.14(c).

             (f)  On or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Change
in Control Purchase Date, the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent
specified in the Change of Control Notice (or if the Issuer is acting as its
own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 6.5) an
amount of money in same day funds (or New York Clearing House funds if such
deposit is made prior to the Change in Control Purchase Date) sufficient to
pay the Change in Control Purchase Price of all the Notes or portions thereof
which are to be purchased on that date.

             (g)  Any Note that is to be purchased only in part shall be
surrendered to the Paying Agent specified in the Change of Control Notice at
the office of such Paying Agent (with, if the Issuer or the Trustee so
requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Issuer
shall execute, the Guarantor shall execute the Guarantee endorsed on, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Note, without
service charge, one or more new Notes of any authorized denomination as
requested by such Holder in the aggregate principal amount of the Note so
surrendered that is not purchased.

       (h)  The Issuer and the Guarantor shall comply with any applicable
tender offer rules then in effect, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14e-1 promulgated thereunder, in connection with a Change in Control
Offer. In the event of any conflict between such tender offer rules and the
provisions set forth in this Section 3.14, such tender offer rules shall
control.


<PAGE>
             SECTION 3.15  Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.  The Guarantor
will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged before the same shall
become delinquent, (i) all material taxes, assessments and governmental
charges levied or imposed upon the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Guarantor
or upon the income, profits or property of the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) all material lawful claims for labor, materials and
supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon the property of the
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Guarantor
shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged
any such tax, assessment, charge or claims the amount, applicability or
validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate provision has been made.

             SECTION 3.16  Commission Reports and Reports to Holders of Notes.
Within 15 days after the Guarantor files with the Commission copies of its
annual reports and other information, documents and reports (or copies of such
portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may by rules and
regulations prescribe) which it is required to file with the Commission
pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Guarantor shall file
the same with the Trustee.  So long as the Notes remain outstanding, the
Guarantor shall cause quarterly reports (containing unaudited financial
statements) for the first three quarters of each fiscal year and annual
reports (containing audited financial statements and an opinion thereon by
the Guarantor's independent certified public accountants) which it would be
required to file under Section 13 of the Exchange Act if it had a class of
securities listed on a national securities exchange to be mailed to the
Holders of Notes at their addresses appearing in the register of Notes
maintained by the registrar within 15 days of when such report would have
been required to be filed under Section 13 of the Exchange Act.  The
Guarantor also shall comply with the other provisions of Section 314(a) of
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.


                                  ARTICLE FOUR
                    SECURITYHOLDERS LISTS AND REPORTS BY THE
                      ISSUER, THE GUARANTOR AND THE TRUSTEE

             SECTION 4.1  Issuer and Guarantor to Furnish Trustee Information
as to Names and Addresses of Securityholders.  The Issuer and the Guarantor
and  any other obligor on the Securities covenant and agree that they will
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee a list in such form as the
Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of
the Securities of each series:

                 (a)  semiannually and not more than 15 days after each
        January 1 and July 1, and

                 (b)  at such other times as the Trustee may request in
        writing, within 30 days after receipt by the Issuer or the
        Guarantor of any such request,

         provided that if and so long as the Trustee shall be the registrar
         for such series, such list shall not be required to be furnished.

             SECTION 4.2  Preservation and Disclosure of Securityholders
Lists.
(a)  The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of
each series of Securities (i) contained in the most recent list furnished to
it as provided in Section 4.1, and (ii) received by it in the capacity of
registrar or paying agent for such series, if so acting.  The Trustee may
destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 4.1 upon receipt of a
new list so furnished.

             (b)  In case three or more Holders of Securities (hereinafter
referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee and furnish to
the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security for
a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and
such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other
Holders of Securities of a particular series (in which case the applicants must
all hold Securities of such series) or with Holders of all Securities with
respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such Securities and such
application is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other
communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee
shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its
election, either

              (i)  afford to such applicants access to the information
     preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions
     of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, or

             (ii)  inform such applicants as to the approximate number of
     Holders of Securities of such series or of all Securities, as the
     case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved
     at the time by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of
     subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, and as to the approximate cost of
     mailing to such Securityholders the form of proxy or other
     communication, if any, specified in such application.

      If the Trustee shall elect not to afford to such applicants access
to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such
applicants, mail to each Securityholder of such series or all Holders of
Securities, as the case may be, whose name and address appears in the
information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2 a copy of the form of proxy
or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable
promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of
payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing,
unless within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such
applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material
to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the
Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders
of Securities of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, or
would be in violation of applicable law.  Such written statement shall
specify the basis of such opinion.  If the Commission, after opportunity for
a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed,
shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after
the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the
Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the
objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring,
the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Securityholders
with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of
such tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or
duty to such applicants respecting their application.

     (c)  Each and every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding
the same, agrees with the Issuer and the Trustee that neither the Issuer, the
Guarantor nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the
Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such
information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section 4.2,
regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the
Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material
pursuant to a request made under such subsection (b).

         Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or, if the Issuer or the Guarantor
         is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to

         time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic

         from time to time in such rules and regulations;

             (b)  to file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance

         Outstanding on the date of such report;

             (iv)  the amount, interest rate, if any, and maturity date of all

so to state, the circumstances surrounding the making thereof) made by the
Trustee, as such, since the date of the last report transmitted pursuant to
the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.4 (or if no such report has

mail:

                      (i)   to all Holders of Securities, as the names and
             addresses of such Holders appear upon the registry books of the
             Issuer; and

                      (ii)  to all other Persons to whom such reports are
             required to be transmitted pursuant to Section 313(c) of the
             Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

             (d)  A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such
transmission to Securityholders, be furnished to the Issuer and the Guarantor
and be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange upon which the Securities

             (h)  default by the Issuer or the Guarantor in the performance or

             Each of the Issuer and the Guarantor shall deliver to the
Trustee, immediately after it becomes aware of the occurrence thereof, written
notice of (i) any Event of Default under this Section 5.1, or (ii) any event
which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both would become an
Event of Default under clause (c) or clause (d), its status and what action the
Issuer or the Guarantor is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

           SECTION 5.2  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission.  If an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes (other than an Event of Default specified in
Section 5.1(f) or 5.1(g)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders
of at least a 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
by written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor (and to the Trustee if such
notice is given by Holders), may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the Notes and the accrued interest thereon (or, prior
to December 15, 1996, the Accreted Amount) to be immediately due and payable,
as specified below.  Upon a declaration of acceleration, such amount shall be
due and payable immediately after receipt by the Issuer and the Guarantor of
such written notice given hereunder.  If an Event of Default specified in
Section 5.1(f) or 5.1(g) occurs and is continuing, then the Notes and the
accrued interest thereon (or, prior to December 15, 1996, the Accreted Amount)
shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.  At any
time after such declaration of acceleration has been made and before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by written notice to the
Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration
and its consequences if:

             (a)  the Issuer or the Guarantor has paid or deposited with the
Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

             (i)  all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under Section 6.6
           and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
           advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and

             (ii)  the amounts payable in respect of any Notes which have
          become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and
          overdue interest thereon (to the extent of such overdue interest at
          the rate borne by the Notes); and

             (b)  the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree and if all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of
the principal amount or Accreted Amount of the Notes which have become due
solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.

             No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair
any right consequent thereon provided in Section 5.13.

             SECTION 5.3  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement
by Trustee.  The Issuer covenants that if an Event of Default described in
Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(b) occurs and is continuing, the Issuer will, upon
demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Notes,
the whole amount then due and payable on such Notes, with interest upon the
overdue amounts and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable, upon overdue interest, at the rate borne by the Notes;
and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover
the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

             If the Issuer fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such
demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may
institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and
unpaid and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce the same against the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon
the Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the
manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any
other obligor upon the Notes, wherever situated.

             If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce
its rights and the rights of the Holders of Notes by such appropriate judicial
proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce
any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement in this Indenture or the Notes or in aid of the exercise of any
power granted herein or therein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

             SECTION 5.4  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the
Notes or the property of the Issuer, the Guarantor or such other obligor or
their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal amount of
the Notes, premium, if any, accreted original issue discount, Redemption
Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Colombian Sale Redemption Price, Asset
Sale Offer Price, interest, if any, or any other payment required to be made
under this Indenture in connection with the Notes shall then be due and payable
as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether
the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer or the Guarantor for the
payment of any such amount) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention
in such proceeding or otherwise,

             (a)  to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or such
   lesser amount as may be provided for in the Notes, of the principal
   amount of the Notes, premium, if any, accreted original issue
   discount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price,
   Colombian Sale Redemption Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, interest, if
   any, or any other payment required to be made under this Indenture and
   to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or
   advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any
   claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
   advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of
   Notes allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

           (b)  to collect and receive any monies or other property payable
   or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

   and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator
   or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
   authorized by each Holder of Notes to make such payments to the Trustee
   and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such
   payments directly to the Holders of Notes, to pay to the Trustee any
   amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
   disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel,
   and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.6.

             Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a
Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Note in any such
proceeding.

             SECTION 5.5  Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of
Notes.  All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the
Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of
any of the Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto,
and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own
name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery or judgment, after
provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, shall be
for the ratable benefit of each and every Holder of a Note in respect of which
such judgment has been recovered.

             SECTION 5.6  Application of Money Collected.  Any money collected
by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following
order, upon presentation of the Notes and the notation thereon of the payment
if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

             FIRST:  To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under
Section 6.6;

             SECOND:  To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon
the Notes for the principal amount of the Notes, premium, if any,
accreted original issue discount, Redemption Price, Change in
Control Purchase Price, Colombian Sale Redemption Price, Asset Sale
Offer Price, interest, if any, or any other payment required to
be made under this Indenture, as the case may be, ratably,
without preference or priority of any kind, according to the aggregate
amounts due and payable on such Notes;

             THIRD:  The balance, if any, to the Issuer.

             SECTION 5.7  Limitations on Suits.  No Holder of any Notes shall
have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with
respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee,
or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

             (a)  such Holder has previously given written notice to the
        Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

             (b)  the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal
         amount of the Notes at the time outstanding shall have made written
         request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such
         Event of Default;

             (c)  such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee
         reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to
         be incurred in compliance with such request;

             (d)  the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
         request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
         proceeding; and

             (e)  no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
     given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a
     majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall
have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any
provision of this Indenture or any Note to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of any other Holders of Notes, or to obtain or to seek to obtain
priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under
this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and
ratable benefit of all such Holders.

             SECTION 5.8  Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Note
shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment
of the principal amount, premium, if any, accreted original issue discount,
Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase Price, Colombian Sale Redemption
Price, Asset Sale Offer Price, interest, if any, or any other payment required
to be made under this Indenture with respect to such Note, on the respective
due dates therefor specified in such Note (or, in the case of redemption, on
the Redemption Date or, in the case of repayment at the option of such Holder
as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, on the date such repayment is
due) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such
right shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

             SECTION 5.9  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.  If the Trustee
or any Holder of a Note has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or
to such Holder, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Guarantor, the
Trustee and each such Holder shall, subject to any determination in such
proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and each such
Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

             SECTION 5.10  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.  Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.9, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Trustee or to each and every Holder of a Note is intended to
be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy to the
extent permitted by law, shall be cumulative and in addition to every other
right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

             SECTION 5.11  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.  No delay or omission
of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy
accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy given by this Article Five or by law to the Trustee or
to any Holder of a Note may be exercised from time to time, and as often as
may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by such Holder, as the case may be.

             SECTION 5.12  Control by Holders of Notes.  The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes shall have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
on the Trustee, provided that

             (a)  such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law
         or with this Indenture or with the Notes, and

             (b)  the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
         Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

             SECTION 5.13  Waiver of Past Defaults.  The Holders of not less
than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by
notice to the Trustee, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes may waive any
past Default hereunder with respect to such Notes and its consequences, except


<PAGE>

             (a)  an Event of Default described in Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(b),
or

             (b)  a Default in respect of a covenant or provision that under
         Section 8.2 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
         Holder of each outstanding Note affected.

             Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for
every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

             SECTION 5.14  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.  The Issuer and
the Guarantor each covenants that (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer and the Guarantor each
expressly waives (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) all benefit or
advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had
been enacted.

             SECTION 5.15  Notice of Defaults.  If a Default or an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes and if it is known
to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of Notes notice of the
Default or Event of Default within 30 days after it occurs and is known to
have occurred by the Trustee, unless such Default or Event of Default has
been cured.

                                   ARTICLE SIX
                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

             SECTION 6.1  Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During
Default; Prior to Default.  With respect to the Holders of any series of
Securities issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event
of Default with respect to the Securities of a particular series and after the
curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred with
respect to such series, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties
as are specifically set forth in this Indenture.  In case an Event of Default
with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been
cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise with respect to such series of
Securities such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent man would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

             No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act or its own wilful misconduct, except that:

             (a)  prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect
        to the Securities of any series and after the curing or waiving of all
        such Events of Default with respect to such series which may have
        occurred:

                      (i)   the duties and obligations of the Trustee with
             respect to the Securities of any series shall be determined
             solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the
             Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such
             duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
             Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
             into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

                      (ii)  in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
             Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of
             the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
             therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished
             to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
             Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates
             or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically
             required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be
             under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they
             conform to the requirements of this Indenture;

             (b)  the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment
madein good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the
Trustee,unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in
ascertaining thepertinent facts; and

             (c)  the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
direction of the Holders pursuant to Article Five relating to the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under
this Indenture.

             None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require
the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal
financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise
of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for
believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
liability is not reasonably assured to it.


             SECTION 6.2  Certain Rights of the Trustee.  Subject to Section
6.1:

             (a)  the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, Officers' Certificate or any other
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other paper or document
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties;

             (b)  any request, direction, order or demand of the Issuer or the
Guarantor mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate or Issuer Order (unless other evidence in respect thereof be
herein specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the Board of Directors
may be evidenced to the Trustee by a Board Resolution;

             (c)  the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and
any advice of such counsel promptly confirmed in writing shall be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered
or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon
in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

             (d)  the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of
the trusts or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or
direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of this
Indenture (including, without limitation, pursuant to Article Five), unless
such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred
therein or thereby;

             (e)  the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the
discretion, rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;

             (f)  prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder and
after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default, the Trustee shall not be
bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, approval, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, coupon,
security, or other paper or document unless requested in writing so to do by
the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities of all series affected then Outstanding; provided that, if the
payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or
liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation
is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by
the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may
require reasonable indemnity against such expenses or liabilities as a condition
to proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such investigation shall be paid
by the Issuer or the Guarantor or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor
Trustee, shall be repaid by the Issuer or the Guarantor upon demand;

             (g)  the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through
agents or attorneys not regularly in its employ and the Trustee shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or
attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;

             (h)  The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any
default or Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities unless
either (i) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee assigned to the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee (or any successor division or department of the
Trustee) shall have actual knowledge of such default or Event of Default or
(ii) written notice of such default or Event of Default shall have been given
to the Trustee by the Issuer or the Guarantor or any other obligor on such
series of Securities or by any Holder of Securities of such series; and

             (i)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or
within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.

             SECTION 6.3  Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals, Disposition of
Securities or Application of Proceeds Thereof.  The recitals contained herein
and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication,
shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer or the Guarantor, and the
Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same.  The
Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this
Indenture, of the Securities or of any prospectus used to sell the Securities.
The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Issuer
of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof.

             SECTION 6.4  Trustee and Agents May Hold Securities; Collections,
etc.  The Trustee or any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee, in
its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of
Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or
such agent and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the
Issuer and the Guarantor and receive, collect, hold and retain collections
from the Issuer and the Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were
not the Trustee or such agent.

          SECTION 6.5  Moneys Held by Trustee.  Subject to the provisions of
Section 10.4 hereof, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or
applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they
were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the
extent required by mandatory provisions of law.  Neither the Trustee nor any
agent of the Issuer or the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be under any
liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder.

             SECTION 6.6  Compensation and Indemnification of Trustee and Its
Prior Claim.  The Issuer and the Guarantor covenant and agree to pay to the
Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, such
compensation as shall be agreed to in writing between the Issuer, the
Guarantor and the Trustee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law
in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Issuer
and the Guarantor covenant and agree to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by or on behalf of it in
accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the
reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and
of all agents and other persons not regularly in its employ) except any such
expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence or bad
faith.  The Issuer and the Guarantor also covenant to indemnify the Trustee
and each predecessor Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any and
all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense, including taxes (other than
taxes based on the income of the Trustee), incurred without negligence or
bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder and its duties
hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against or
investigating any claim or liability in the premises.  The obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantor under this Section 6.6 to compensate and
indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and to
pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for expenses,
disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder
and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the
resignation or removal of the Trustee and shall not be subordinate to the
payment of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and Senior Indebtedness of the
Guarantor pursuant to Article Thirteen and Article Fourteen, respectively.
Such additional indebtedness shall be a senior claim to that of the Securities
upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except
funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular Securities,
and the Securities are hereby subordinated to such senior claim.  When the
Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of
Default specified in Section 5.1 or in connection with Article Five hereof,
the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and
the compensation for the service in connection therewith are intended to
constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.  The
provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Trustee and the termination of this Indenture.

             SECTION 6.7  Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate,
etc.  Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, whenever in the administration of the
trusts of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that
a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any
action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be
herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith
on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and
established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such
certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered
or omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

             SECTION 6.8  Qualification of Trustee; Conflicting Interests.
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of
Section 310(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.  The Trustee shall have
a combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 as set forth in its
most recent published annual report of condition.  The Trustee shall comply
with Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 regarding
disqualification of a trustee upon acquiring a conflicting interest.

             SECTION 6.9  Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee;
Different Trustees for Different Series.  The Trustee for each series of
Securities hereunder shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States of America or of any state or the
District of Columbia having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$25,000,000, and which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal, state or
District of Columbia authority, or a corporation or other Person permitted to
act as trustee by the Commission.  If such corporation publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the
aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this
Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed
to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report
of condition so published.  No obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of
such obligor shall serve as trustee upon the Securities.  In case at any time
the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 6.9, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with
the effect specified in Section 6.10.

             A different Trustee may be appointed by the Issuer for any series
of Securities prior to the issuance of such Securities.  If the initial
Trustee for any series of Securities is to be a trustee other than United
States Trust Company of New York, the Issuer, the Guarantor and such Trustee
shall, prior to the issuance of such Securities, execute and deliver an
indenture supplemental hereto, which shall provide for the appointment of such
Trustee as Trustee for the Securities of such series and shall add to or change
any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or
facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee,
it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall
constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such
Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart
from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee.

             SECTION 6.10  Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor
Trustee.  (a)  The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed,
may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities
by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer.  Upon receiving such
notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor trustee
or trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in
duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the resigning trustee and one copy to the
successor trustee or trustees.  If no successor trustee shall have been so
appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30
days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may,
subject to the provisions of Article Five, on behalf of himself and all others
similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor
trustee.  Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem
proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

             (b)  In case at any time any of the following shall occur:

                      (i)   the Trustee shall fail to comply with the
        provisions of Section 6.8 with respect to any series of Securities
        after written request therefor by the Issuer or the Guarantor or
        by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
        Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or

                      (ii)  the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
        accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9 and shall fail to
        resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or the
        Guarantor or by any such Securityholder; or

                    (iii)   the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with
        respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a
        bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee
        or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer
        shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or
        affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
        liquidation;

then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the
applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor trustee for such
series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of
Directors one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions
of Article Five, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor
trustee with respect to such series.  Such court may thereupon, after such
notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and
appoint a successor trustee.

             (c)  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Securities of each series then Outstanding may at any time remove the
Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor
trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the
Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Issuer
and the Guarantor the evidence provided for in Section 7.1 of the action in
that regard taken by the Securityholders.  If no successor trustee shall have
been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment
within 30 days after the delivery of such evidence of removal, the Trustee
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of
a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may,
subject to the provisions of Article Five, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a
successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as
it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

             (d)  Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to
any series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such
series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as
provided in Section 6.11.

             SECTION 6.11  Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee.
Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute and
deliver to the Issuer and the Guarantor and to its predecessor trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation
or removal of the predecessor trustee with respect to all or any applicable
series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties
and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with
like effect as if originally named as trustee for such series hereunder; but,
nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer, the Guarantor or of the
successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee
ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 10.4, pay over to the successor
trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights,
powers, duties and obligations.  Upon request of any such successor trustee,
the Issuer and the Guarantor shall execute any and all instruments in writing
for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
trustee all such rights and powers.  Any trustee ceasing to act shall,
nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or
collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.6.

      If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities
of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and
each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series
shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain
such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all
the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect
to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not
retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add
to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to
provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more
than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such
supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same
trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under
separate indentures.

             No successor trustee with respect to any series of Securities
shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time
of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the
provisions of Section 6.8 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9.

             Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as
provided in this Section 6.11, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to the
Holders of Securities of each series affected, by mailing such notice to such
Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books.  If the
Issuer fails to give such notice within ten days after acceptance of
appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such
notice to be given at the expense of the Issuer.

             SECTION 6.12  Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to
Business of Trustee.  Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a
party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the
corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee
hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under the
provisions of Section 6.8 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

         In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to
the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall
have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee
may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and
deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the
Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to
the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any
predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such
cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the
Securities of such series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate
of the Trustee shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the certificate
of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of
any series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its
successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

             SECTION 6.13  Preferential Collection of Claims Against the
Issuer. The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.  A Trustee who has resigned or been removed
shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to the
extent indicated therein.

          SECTION 6.14  Appointment of Authenticating Agent.  As long as any
Securities of a series remain Outstanding, the Trustee may, by an instrument
in writing, appoint with the approval of the Issuer an authenticating agent
(the "Authenticating Agent") which shall be authorized to act on behalf of
the Trustee to authenticate Securities, including Securities issued upon
exchange, registration of transfer, partial redemption or pursuant to Section
2.9. Securities of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating
Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid
and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee.  Whenever
reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of
Securities of any series by the Trustee or to the Trustee's Certificate of
Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and
delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent for such series
and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by
such Authenticating Agent. Such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States
of America or of any state or the District of Columbia, authorized under such
laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $25,000,000 (determined as provided in Section 6.9 with
respect to the Trustee) and subject to supervision or examination by federal
or state authority.

             Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged
or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any
Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the
corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be
the Authenticating Agent with respect to all series of Securities for which it
served as Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or
any further act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent.  Any
Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible
shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to
the Issuer.  The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an
Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating
Agent and to the Issuer.

             Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a
termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect
to one or more series of Securities, the Trustee may appoint a successor
Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Issuer and the Issuer
shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such
series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.4.  Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of
its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as
Authenticating Agent. The Issuer agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent
for such series from time to time reasonable compensation.  The Authenticating
Agent for the Securities of any series shall have no responsibility or
liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee.

             Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 7.3 shall be applicable to any
Authenticating Agent.


                                  ARTICLE SEVEN
                         CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS

             SECTION 7.1  Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders.  Any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified
percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may
be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially
similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person
or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments are delivered to the Trustee.  Proof of execution of any
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any
purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in
favor of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor, if made in the manner
provided in this Article Seven.

             SECTION 7.2  Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of
Securities.  Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument
by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in the following
manner:

             (a)  The fact and date of the execution by any Holder of any
instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other
officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or
administer oaths that the person executing such instruments acknowledged to
him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution
sworn to before any such notary or other such officer.  Where such execution
is by or on behalf of any legal entity other than an individual, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the
authority of the person executing the same.

             (b)  The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security
register or by a certificate of the Security registrar.

             SECTION 7.3  Holders to be Treated as Owners.  The Issuer, the
Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the
Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Security shall be
registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of
such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and
notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the
purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject
to the provisions of this Indenture, interest, if any, on such Security and
for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor nor the
Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

             SECTION 7.4  Securities Owned by Issuer and Guarantor Deemed Not
Outstanding.  In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate
principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred
in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are
owned by the Issuer, by the Guarantor, by any Affiliate of the Issuer or the
Guarantor or by any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such
determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be
Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the
purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.  Securities
so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding
if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's
right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the
Issuer or the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or any
Affiliate of the Issuer or the Guarantor or any other obligor on the
Securities.  In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall
be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance
with such advice.  Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor
shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and
identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer or the Guarantor to be
owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described Persons; and,
subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such
Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and
of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the
purpose of any such determination.

             SECTION 7.5  Right of Revocation of Action Taken.  At any time
prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section
7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be,
specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a
Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included
among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented
to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and
upon proof of holding as provided in this Article Seven, revoke such action so
far as concerns such Security provided that such revocation shall not become
effective until three Business Days after such filing.  Except as aforesaid,
any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such
Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor or
on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any
notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security.  Any action taken
by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this
Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon
the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities
affected by such action.

             SECTION 7.6  Record Date for Consents and Waivers.  The Issuer
may, but shall not be obligated to, establish a record date for the purpose of
determining the Persons entitled to (i) waive any past default with respect to
the Securities of such series in accordance with Article Five of the
Indenture, (ii) consent to any supplemental indenture in accordance with Section
8.2 of the Indenture or (iii) waive compliance with any term, condition or
provision of any covenant hereunder.  If a record date is fixed, the Holders on
such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and any such Persons, shall
be entitled to waive any such past default, consent to any such supplemental
indenture or waive compliance with any such term, condition or provision,
whether or not such Holder remains a Holder after such record date; provided,
however, that unless such waiver or consent is obtained from the Holders, or
duly designated proxies, of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities of such series prior to the date which is the 180th day after such
record date, any such waiver or consent previously given shall automatically
and without further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further
effect.


                                  ARTICLE EIGHT
                             SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

             SECTION 8.1  Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of
Securityholders.  The Issuer, when authorized by a Board Resolution (which
resolution may provide general terms or parameters for such action and may
provide that the specific terms of such action may be determined in accordance
with or pursuant to an Issuer Order), the Guarantor, when authorized by a
Board Resolution and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter
into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to
the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of
the execution thereof) for one or more of the following purposes:

         (a)  to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the
         Trustee as security for the Securities of one or more series any
         property or assets;

         (b)  to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or
         the Guarantor, or successive successions, and the assumption by the
         successor Person of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the
         Issuer or the Guarantor pursuant to Article Nine;

         (c)  to add to the covenants of the Issuer or of the Guarantor such
         further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as the
         Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee shall consider to be for the
         protection of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if
         such covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions are to be for
         the protection of less than all series of Securities, stating that
         the same are expressly being included solely for the protection of
         such series) and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and
         continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants,
         restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default
         permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies
         provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided, however,
         that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction,
         condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for
         a particular period of grace after default (which period may be
         shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults)
         or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of
         Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such
         an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a
         majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such
         series to waive such an Event of Default;

             (d)  to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any
         provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may
         be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained
         herein or in any supplemental indenture, or to make any other
         provisions as  the Issuer may deem necessary or desirable, provided,
         however, that no such action shall materially adversely affect the
         interests of the Holders of the Securities;

         (e)  to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series
         or the form of Guarantees as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3;

         (f)  to provide for the issuance of Securities of any series in
         coupon form (including Securities registrable as to principal only)
         and to provide for exchangeability of such Securities for the
         Securities issued hereunder in fully registered form and to make all
         appropriate changes for such purpose;

           (g)  to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of this
         Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to effect the
         qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of
         1939, or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted, and
         to add to this Indenture such other provisions as may be expressly
         permitted by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, excluding, however, the
         provisions referred to in Section 316(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act
         of 1939 as in effect at the date as of which this instrument was
         executed or any corresponding provision provided for in any similar
         federal statute hereafter enacted; or

           (h)  to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment
         hereunder of a Trustee other than United States Trust Company of New
         York as Trustee for a series of Securities and to add to or change
         any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to
         provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder
         by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section
         6.9 hereof;

                 (i)  subject to Section 8.2 hereof, to add to or modify the
         provisions hereof as may be necessary or desirable to provide for the
         denomination of Securities in foreign currencies which shall not
         adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Securities in
         any material respect;

               (j)  to modify the covenants or Events of Default of the Issuer
         or the Guarantor solely in respect of, or add new covenants or Events
         of Default of the Issuer or the Guarantor that apply solely to,
         Securities not Outstanding on the date of such supplemental
         indenture; and

              (k)  to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment
         hereunder by a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of
         one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of
         this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate
         the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee,
         pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.11.

                 The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Issuer and
         the Guarantor in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to
         make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be
         therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment,
         mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall
         not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which
         affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this
         Indenture or otherwise.

             Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this
         Section may be executed without the consent of the Holders of any of
         the Securities then Outstanding, notwithstanding any of the
         provisions of Section 8.2.

             SECTION 8.2  Supplemental Indentures with Consent of
Securityholders.  With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article Seven) of
the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities then Outstanding of any series affected by such supplemental
indenture, the Issuer, when authorized by a Board Resolution (which resolution
may provide general terms or parameters for such action and may provide that
the specific terms of such action may be determined in accordance with or
pursuant to an Issuer Order), the Guarantor, when authorized by a Board
Resolution, and the Trustee may, from time to time and at any time, enter into
an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of
execution thereof) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any
supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders
of the Securities of such series; provided, that no such supplemental
indenture shall (a) extend the stated final maturity of the principal of any
Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend
the time of payment of interest, if any, thereon (or, in the case of an
Original Issue Discount Security, reduce the rate of accretion of original
issue discount thereon), or reduce or alter the method of computation of any
amount payable on redemption, repayment or purchase by the Issuer thereof
(or the time at which any such redemption, repayment or purchase may be made),
or make the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original
issue discount), or interest, if any, thereon payable in any coin or currency
other than that provided in the Securities or in accordance with the terms of
the Securities, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue
Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the
maturity thereof or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy in each case
pursuant to Article Five, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder
to institute suit for the payment thereof or, if the Securities provide
therefor, any right of repayment or purchase at the option of the
Securityholder or change in any manner adverse to the interests of the
Holders of any Securities the terms and conditions of the obligations of the
Guarantor in respect of the guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the
principal thereof (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, thereon, in
each case without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or
(b) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series, the consent
of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture,
without the consent of the Holders of each Security so affected.  No consent
of any Holder of any Security shall be necessary under this Section 8.2 to
permit the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor to execute supplemental
indentures pursuant to Sections 8.1 and 9.2.

        A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant,
Event of Default or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly
been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of
Securities, or which modifies the rights of Holders of Securities of such
series, with respect to such covenant or provision, shall be deemed not to
affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any
other series.

          Upon the request of the Issuer and the Guarantor, accompanied by a
copy of a resolution of the Boards of Directors of the Issuer and the
Guarantor (which resolutions may provide general terms or parameters for such
action and may provide that the specific terms of such action may be
determined in accordance with or pursuant to an Issuer Order) certified by
the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Issuer and the Guarantor,
respectively, authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture,
and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the
Holders of the Securities as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required
by Section 7.1, the Trustee shall join with the Issuer and the Guarantor in
the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental
indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this
Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may at its discretion,
but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.

             It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders
under this Section 8.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed
supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall
approve the substance thereof.

             Promptly after the execution by the Issuer, the Guarantor and the
Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 8.2, the Issuer (or the Trustee at the request and expense of the
Issuer) shall give notice thereof to the Holders of then Outstanding
Securities of each series affected thereby, as provided in Section 11.4.
Any failure of the Issuer to give such notice, or any defect therein,
shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such
supplemental indenture.

             SECTION 8.3  Effect of Supplemental Indenture.  Upon the
execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof,
this Indenture shall be and shall be deemed to be modified and amended in
accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights,
obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee,
the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Holders of Securities of each series
affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced
hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments,
and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall
be and shall be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this
Indenture for any and all purposes.

             SECTION 8.4  Documents to Be Given to Trustee.  The Trustee,
subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall be entitled to
receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this
Article Eight complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture
and that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of such
supplemental indenture have been satisfied.

             SECTION 8.5  Notation on Securities in Respect of Supplemental
Indentures.  Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the
execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this
Article Eight may bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee for such
series as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture or as to
any action taken by Securityholders.  If the Issuer, the Guarantor or the
Trustee shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to
conform, in the opinion of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor, to any
modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture
may be prepared and executed by the Issuer, the Guarantees thereon may be
executed by the Guarantor and such Securities may be authenticated by the
Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such series then
Outstanding.


                                  ARTICLE NINE
        CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE, LEASE, EXCHANGE OR OTHER DISPOSITION

       SECTION 9.1  Issuer or Guarantor May Consolidate, etc., on Certain
Terms.  Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2, nothing contained in this
Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of
the Issuer or the Guarantor with or into any other Person or Persons (whether
or not affiliated with the Issuer or the Guarantor), or successive
consolidations or mergers in which the Issuer or the Guarantor or their
respective successor or successors shall be a party or parties, or shall
prevent any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially
all the property and assets of the Issuer or the Guarantor to any other Person
(whether or not affiliated with the Issuer or the Guarantor) authorized to
acquire and operate the same; provided, however, the Issuer and the Guarantor
each hereby covenants and agrees, that any such consolidation, merger, sale,
lease, exchange or other disposition shall be upon the conditions that (a) the
Person (if other than the Issuer or the Guarantor) formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger, or to which such sale, lease, exchange or other
disposition shall have been made, shall be, in the case of the Issuer, a
corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the United States of
America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, and, in the case of
the Guarantor, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the
United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or the
Cayman Islands or any political subdivision thereof; (b) the due and punctual
payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on all the Notes, according
to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of
the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Issuer
or the due and punctual performance of the Guarantees and the due and punctual
performance and observance of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture
to be performed by the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be expressly
assumed, by supplemental indenture satisfactory in form to the Trustee
executed and delivered to the Trustee, by the Person (if other than the Issuer
or the Guarantor) formed by such consolidation, or into which the Issuer shall
have been merged, or by the Person which shall have acquired or leased such
property; (c) immediately after giving effect to such consolidation, merger,
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, no Event of Default, and no event
which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of
Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; (d) in the case of the
Guarantor, the Person (whether the Guarantor or such other Person) formed by
or surviving any such consolidation or merger, or to which such sale, lease,
exchange or other disposition shall have been made, would have a pro forma
Consolidated Net Worth after giving effect to the transaction at least equal
to the Consolidated Net Worth of the Guarantor prior to the transaction; and
(e) except in the case of a transaction involving a Special Subsidiary, the
Person (whether the Guarantor or such other Person) formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger, or to which such sale, lease, exchange or
other disposition shall have been made, could incur an additional $1.00 of
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) pursuant to Section 3.6
after giving effect to the transaction.

             SECTION 9.2  Successor Corporation to be Substituted.  In case of
any such consolidation or merger or any sale, conveyance or lease of all or
substantially all of the property of the Issuer or the Guarantor and upon the
assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture executed and
delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due
and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if
any, on all of the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of
the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Issuer
or the due and punctual performance of the Guarantees and the due and
punctual performance and observance of the covenants and conditions of this
Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, as the case may be, such
successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Issuer or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, with the same effect as if it had been named
herein as the party of the first part, and the Issuer or the Guarantor
(including any intervening successor to the Issuer or the Guarantor which
shall have become the obligor hereunder) shall be relieved of any further
obligation under this Indenture and the Securities or the Guarantees, as
the case may be; provided, however, that in the case of a sale, lease,
exchange or other disposition of the property and assets of the Issuer or
the Guarantor (including any such intervening successor), the Issuer or
the Guarantor (including any such intervening successor) shall continue to
be liable on its obligations under this Indenture and the Securities and
the Guarantees to the extent, but only to the extent, of liability to pay
the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities at the time,
places and rate prescribed in this Indenture and the Securities.
Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either
in its own name or in the name of the Issuer or the Guarantor, any or all of
the Securities or Guarantees issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not
have been signed by the Issuer or the Guarantor and delivered to the
Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor Person instead of the Issuer
and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture
prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities
which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of
the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such
successor Person thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the
Trustee for that purpose.  All the Securities and Guarantees so issued
shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this
Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such
Securities and Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution
hereof.

             In case of any such consolidation or merger or any sale, lease,
exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer or the Guarantor, such changes in phraseology and form
(but not in substance) may be made in the Securities and the Guarantees,
thereafter to be issued, as may be appropriate.

subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive an Officers' Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger,
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition and any such assumption complies
with the provisions of this Article Nine.

         Obligations, maturing as to principal and interest, if any, at such
         times and in such amounts as will insure the availability of cash,
         or (3) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a
         nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
         expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the
         Trustee, to pay (I) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest,
         if any, on all Securities of such series on each date that such
         principal or interest, if any, is due and payable, and (II) any
         mandatory sinking fund payments on the dates on which such
         payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of the
         Indenture and the Securities of such series;

             (B)  such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or

         Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (2), since the date hereof,
         there has been a change in the applicable United States federal
         income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and such opinion
         shall confirm that, the Holders of the Securities of such series
         will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax
         purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and
         will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in
         the same manner and at the same times, as would have been the case
         if such deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred.

             (d)  In addition to the foregoing and provided the exact amount
described in subparagraph (i) below can be determined at the time of making

         cash in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations, maturing as to
         principal and interest, if any, at such times and in such amounts as
         will insure the availability of cash, or (C) a combination thereof,
         sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
         independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
         thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay the principal of, accreted
         original issuer discount, and interest, if any, on all Notes on each
         date that such principal, accreted original issue discount or
         interest, if any, is due and payable; and

the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or
otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the
acceptance of the Securities having endorsed thereon a Guarantee by the
Holders thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue of the
Securities and the Guarantees.

             SECTION 11.2  Provisions of Indenture for the Sole Benefit of

legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture or under any
covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions
being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and
of the Holders of the Securities.

        SECTION 11.3  Successors and Assigns of Issuer and Guarantor Bound

and Holders of Securities.  Any notice or demand which by any provision of
this Indenture is required or permitted to be given or served by the Trustee

required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, may be given or served
by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail (except as otherwise

conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any
such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is
specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such
particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be
furnished.

             Each certificate or opinion provided for in this Indenture (other

certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer
knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the
matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as
aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know
that the same are erroneous.  Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel
may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, on information with
respect to which is in the possession of the Issuer or the Guarantor, upon the
certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer or
officers of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such
counsel knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations
with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion

or the Guarantor or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to
accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an
accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer or the
Guarantor, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the
certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting
matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as

the date of maturity of principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities of
any series or the date fixed for redemption, purchase or repayment of any such

premium, if any, or principal need not be made on such date, but may be made
on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made
on the date of maturity or the date fixed for redemption, purchase or
repayment, and, in the case of payment, no interest shall accrue for the
period after such date.

Indenture Act of 1939.  If and to the extent that any provision of this
Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision included in
this Indenture which is required to be included herein by any of Sections 310
to 317, inclusive, or is deemed applicable to this Indenture by virtue of the
provisions, of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, such required provision shall

irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York
and of the courts of the United States of America having jurisdiction in the

Guarantor's lawful agent in the United States of America upon which may be
served, and which may accept and acknowledge, for and on behalf of the
Guarantor all process in any action, suit or proceedings that may be
brought against the Guarantor in any of the courts referred to in this
Section, and agrees that such service of process, or the acceptance or
acknowledgement thereof by said agent, shall be valid, effective
and binding in every respect; provided, however, that if said agency shall
cease for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor hereby designates and appoints,
without power of revocation, the Secretary of State of the State of New York
to serve as its agent for service of process.  Nothing contained in this
Section 11.9 shall limit the right of the Holders of the Notes or any of them
to take proceedings against the Guarantor in any other court of competent
jurisdiction nor, by virtue of anything contained herein, shall the taking of
proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking or proceedings
in any other jurisdiction whether concurrently or not.

less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the particular Notes or portions
thereof to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days and not less
than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee from the outstanding
Notes not previously called for redemption, either pro rata, by lot or by
another method the Trustee shall deem fair and reasonable, and the aggregate
principal amounts to be redeemed may be equal to $1,000 or any integral
multiple thereof.

             The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the
Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Notes selected for
partial redemption, the aggregate principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

             For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to redemption of Notes shall relate, in the
case of any Note redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of
the aggregate principal amount of such Note which has been or is to be
redeemed.

          SECTION 12.5  Notice of Redemption.  Notice of redemption shall be
given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Notes to be
redeemed, at its address appearing in the Note register.

         All notices of redemption shall state:

            (a)  the Redemption Date;

            (b)  the Redemption Price;

            (c)  if less than all outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the
         identification (and, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part,
         the aggregate principal amount to be redeemed) of the particular
         Notes to be redeemed;

            (d)that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price together with
         accrued interest to the Redemption Date will become due and payable
         upon each such Note or portion thereof, and that unless the Issuer
         shall default in payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
         interest, interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said
         date;

            (e)  the place or places where such Notes are to be surrendered
         for payment of the Redemption Price;

            (f)  that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the
         Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price;

            (g)  the CUSIP number, if any, relating to such Notes; and

            (h)  in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the aggregate
         principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that after the
         Redemption Date upon surrender of such Note, new Note or Notes in the
         aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof
         will be issued.

         Notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed at the election of the
Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at its request, by the Trustee in the
name and at the expense of the Issuer.

             SECTION 12.6  Deposit of Redemption Price.  On or prior to 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit
with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Issuer is acting as its
own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money in same day
funds (or New York Clearing House funds if such deposit is made prior to the
applicable Redemption Date) sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the
Notes or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that Redemption Date
plus accrued interest to such Redemption Date.

             SECTION 12.7  Notes Payable on Redemption Date.  Notice of
redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Notes so to be redeemed shall,
on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein
specified plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date and from and after such
date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price)
such Notes shall cease to accrue interest.  Upon surrender of any such Note
for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Note shall be paid by the
Issuer at the Redemption Price.

             If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the Redemption Price thereof shall accrue
interest at the rate of 9-3/4% per annum.

             SECTION 12.8  Notes Redeemed in Part.  Any Note that is to be
redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the office or agency of the
Issuer maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 3.2 (with, if the
Issuer or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer or the Trustee duly
executed by, the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing),
and the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver
to the Holder of such Note without service charge, a new Note or Notes, of
any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate
principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal amount of the Note so surrendered.

                                ARTICLE THIRTEEN
                                  SUBORDINATION
             SECTION 13.1  Securities Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer.  (a)  The Issuer covenants and agrees, and each Holder of
Securities of each series, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and
agrees, that anything in this Indenture or the Securities of any series to the
contrary notwithstanding, the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities of each
series is subordinate and junior in right of payment, to the extent provided
herein, to all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, whether outstanding on the
date of execution of this Indenture or thereafter created, incurred or
assumed, and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer but the Securities shall in all respects
rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer.
The Securities shall rank senior to all existing and future Indebtedness of
the Issuer that is neither Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer nor Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness and only Indebtedness of the Issuer that is Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer shall rank senior to the Securities in accordance
with the provisions set forth herein.

             (b)  Subject to Section 13.4, if (i) the Issuer shall default in
the payment of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer when the same becomes due and payable,
whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or by declaration of
acceleration or otherwise, or (ii) any other default shall occur with respect
to Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the maturity of such Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer has been accelerated in accordance with its terms,
then, upon written notice of such default to the Issuer and the Trustee by the
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any trustee therefor, unless
and until, in either case, the default has been cured or waived, and any such
acceleration has been rescinded or such Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer has
been paid in full, no direct or indirect payment (in cash, property,
securities, by set-off or otherwise) shall be made or agreed to be made on
account of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any of
the Securities, or in respect of any redemption, retirement, purchase or other
acquisition of any of the Securities other than those made in capital stock of
the Issuer (or cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof).

             (c)  If any default (other than a default described in paragraph
(b) of this Section 13.1) shall occur under the Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer, pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately
without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such
acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods occurs (a
"Senior Nonmonetary Default"), then, upon the receipt by the Issuer and the
Trustee of written notice thereof (a "Payment Notice") from or on behalf of
holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer specifying an election to
prohibit such payment and other action by the Issuer in accordance with the
following provisions of this paragraph (c), the Issuer may not make any
payment or take any other action that would be prohibited by paragraph (b)
of this Section 13.1 during the period (the "Payment Blockage Period")
commencing on the date of receipt of such Payment Notice and ending on the
earlier of (i) the date, if any, on which the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer or their representative notify the Trustee that
such Senior Nonmonetary Default is cured or waived or ceases to exist or
the Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to which such Senior Nonmonetary
Default relates is discharged or (ii) the 179th day after the date of
receipt of such Payment Notice.  Notwithstanding the provisions described
in the immediately preceding sentence, the Issuer may resume payments on
the Securities following such Payment Blockage Period.

             (d)  If (i) (A) without the consent of the Issuer, a receiver,
conservator, liquidator or trustee of the Issuer or of any of its property is
appointed by the order or decree of any court or agency or supervisory
authority having jurisdiction, and such decree or order remains in effect for
more than 60 days or (B) the Issuer is adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent or
(C) any of its property is sequestered by court order and such order remains
in effect for more than 60 days or (D) a petition is filed against the Issuer


<PAGE>

under any state or federal bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or receivership
law of any jurisdiction whether now or hereafter in effect (including
without limitation the Bankruptcy Code), and is not dismissed within 60
days after such filing; or (ii) the Issuer (A) commences a voluntary case or
other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or other relief
with respect to itself or its debt or other liabilities under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect
(including without limitation the Bankruptcy Code) or seeking the
appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other
similar official of it or any substantial part of its property, or (B)
consents to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession
by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced
against it, or (C) fails generally to, or cannot, pay its debts generally
as they become due or (D) takes any corporate action to authorize or effect
any of the foregoing; or (iii) any Subsidiary of the Issuer takes,
suffers or permits to exist any of the events or conditions referred to in
the foregoing clause (i) or (ii), then all Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer (including any interest thereon accruing
after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall first be paid in full
before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other
property, shall be made to any Holder of any Securities on account thereof.
Any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property
(other than securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by
a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate,
at least to the extent provided in these subordination provisions with
respect to the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities to the payment of all
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer then outstanding and to any securities
issued in respect thereof under any such plan of reorganization or
adjustment) which would otherwise (but for these subordination provisions)
be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities of any series shall
be paid or delivered directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders
until all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including any interest thereon
accruing after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall have been
paid in full.In the event of any such proceeding, after payment in full of
all sums owing with respect to Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, the
Holders of the Securities, together with the holders of any obligations of
the Issuer ranking on a parity with the Securities, shall be entitled to
be paid from the remaining assets of the Issuer the amounts at the time
due and owing on account of unpaid principal of and interest, if any, on
the Securities and such other obligations before any payment or other
distribution, whether in cash, property or otherwise, shall be made on
account of any capital stock or any obligations of the Issuer ranking
junior to the Securities and such other obligations.

             (e)  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or
distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property
(other than securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by
a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate,
at least to the extent provided in the subordination provisions with respect
to the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities, to the payment of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer then outstanding and to any securities issued in
respect thereof under any such plan of reorganization or readjustment), shall
be received by the Trustee or any Holder in contravention of any of the terms
hereof, such payment or distribution of securities shall be received in trust
for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered and transferred to the
holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer then outstanding in
accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders for
application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer remaining
unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer in full. In the event of the failure of the Trustee or any Holder to
endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, each holder of
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is hereby irrevocably authorized to
endorse or assign the same.

          (f)  No present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer shall be prejudiced in the right to enforce subordination of the
indebtedness evidenced by the Securities by any act or failure to act on the
part of the Issuer or any Holder of Securities.  Nothing contained herein
shall impair, as between the Issuer and the Holders of Securities of each
series, the obligation of the Issuer to pay to such Holders the principal of
and interest, if any, on such Securities or prevent the Trustee or the
Holder from exercising all rights, powers and remedies otherwise permitted
by applicable law or hereunder upon a default or Event of Default hereunder,
all subject to the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer to remove cash, securities or other property otherwise payable or
deliverable to the Holders.

        (g)  Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer shall not be deemed to have
been paid in full unless the holders thereof shall have received cash,
securities or other property equal to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness
of the Issuer then outstanding.  Upon the payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Holders of Securities of each series shall be
subrogated to all rights of any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
to receive any further payment or distributions applicable to the Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer until the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities
of such series shall have been paid in full and such payments or distributions
received by such Holders, by reason of such subrogation, of cash, securities
or other property which otherwise would be paid or distributed to the holders
of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, shall, as between the Issuer and its
creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, on the
one hand, and such Holders, on the other hand, be deemed to be a payment by
the Issuer on account of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, and not on account
of the Securities of such series.

             (h)  The provisions of this Section 13.1 shall not impair any
rights, interests, remedies or powers of any secured creditor of the Issuer in
respect of any security interest the creation of which is not prohibited by
the provisions of this Indenture.

             (i)  The securing of any obligations of the Issuer, otherwise
ranking on a parity with the Securities or ranking junior to the Securities,
shall not be deemed to prevent such obligations from constituting,
respectively, obligations ranking on a parity with the Securities or ranking
junior to the Securities.

             SECTION 13.2  Reliance on Certificate of Liquidating Agent;
Further Evidence as to Ownership of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer.  Upon
any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer, the Trustee and the
Holders shall be entitled to rely upon an order or decree issued by any court
of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution or winding up or
liquidation or reorganization or arrangement proceedings are pending or upon a
certificate of the bankruptcy trustee, receiver, assignee for the benefit of
creditors or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to
the Trustee or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons
entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer and other indebtedness of the Issuer, the amount
thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon
and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Thirteen.  In the
absence of any such bankruptcy trustee, receiver, assignee or other Person,
the Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon written notice by a Person
representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
(or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) as evidence that
such Person is a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (or is such a
trustee or representative).  If the Trustee determines, in good faith, that
further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a
holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to participate in any payment
or distributions pursuant to this Article Thirteen, the Trustee may request
such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer held by such
Person, as to the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate
in such payment or distribution, and to other facts pertinent to the rights
of such Person under this Article Thirteen, and if such
evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person
pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such
payment.

             SECTION 13.3  Payment Permitted If No Default.  Nothing contained
in this Article Thirteen or elsewhere in this Indenture, or in any of the
Securities, shall prevent (a) the Issuer at any time, except during the
pendency of any default with respect to Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
described in Section 13.1(b) or Section 13.1(c) or of any of the events
described in Section 13.1(d), from making payments of the principal of or
interest, if any, on the Securities, or (b) the application by the Trustee or
any paying agent of any moneys deposited with it hereunder to payments of the
principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities, if, at the time of such
deposit, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, did not have
the written notice provided for in Section 13.5 of any event prohibiting the
making of such deposit, or if, at the time of such deposit (whether or not
in trust) by the Issuer with the Trustee or paying agent (other than the
Issuer) such payment would not have been prohibited by the provisions of
this Article Thirteen, and the Trustee or any paying agent shall not be
affected by any notice to the contrary received by it on or after such date.

        SECTION 13.4  Disputes with Holders of Certain Senior Indebtedness
of the Issuer.  Any failure by the Issuer to make any payment on or under any
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, other than any Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer as to which the provisions of this Section 13.4 shall have been waived
by the Issuer in the instrument or instruments by which the Issuer incurred,
assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer, shall not be deemed a default under Section 13.1 hereof if (i) the
Issuer shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such
obligation, and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute
shall have been issued against the Issuer which is in full force and effect
and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become
final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek
further appeal or review, or (B) if a judgment that is subject to further
review or appeal has been issued, the Issuer shall in good faith be
prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review, and a stay of
execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review.

             SECTION 13.5  Trustee Not Charged with Knowledge of Prohibition.
Anything in this Article Thirteen or elsewhere in this Indenture contained to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall not at any time be charged
with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making
of any payment of moneys to or by the Trustee and shall be entitled to assume
conclusively that no such facts exist and that no event specified in clauses
(b) and (c) of Section 13.1 has happened unless and until the Trustee shall
have received an Officers' Certificate to the effect or notice in writing to
that effect signed by or on behalf of the holder or holders, or the
representatives, of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer who shall have been
certified by the Issuer or otherwise established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Trustee to be such holder or holders or representatives
or from any trustee under any indenture pursuant to which such Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer shall be outstanding; provided, however, that, if
the Trustee shall not have received the Officers' Certificate or notice
provided for in this Section 13.5 at least three Business Days preceding the
date upon which by the terms hereof any moneys become payable for any
purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of either the principal
of or interest, if any, on any Security), then, anything herein contained
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and
authority to receive such moneys and apply the same to the purpose for which
they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary
that may be received by it within three Business Days preceding such date.
The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee and to each
paying agent of any facts that would prohibit any payment of moneys to or by
the Trustee or any paying agent, and the Trustee shall not be charged with
knowledge of the curing of any default or the elimination of
any other fact or condition preventing such payment or distribution unless and
until the Trustee shall have received an Officers' Certificate to such effect.

         SECTION 13.6  Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.  Each Holder of
Securities by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on his
behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate
the subordination as between such Holder and holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer as provided in this Article Thirteen and appoints the Trustee its
attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

             SECTION 13.7  Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Indebtedness
of the Issuer.  The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in
this Article Thirteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
which may at the time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive
the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.  Nothing in this Article
Thirteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or
pursuant to Section 6.6.

         SECTION 13.8  Article Applicable to Paying Agents.  In case at any
time any paying agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the
Issuer and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this
Article Thirteen shall in such case (unless the context shall otherwise
require) be construed as extending to and including such paying agent within
its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if the paying agent were
named in this Article Thirteen in addition to or in place of the Trustee;
provided, however, that Sections 13.5 and 13.7 shall not apply to the Issuer
if it acts as paying agent.

             SECTION 13.9  Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or
Omissions of the Issuer or Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer.  No
right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any
way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the
Issuer or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or
by any noncompliance by the Issuer with the terms, provisions and covenants
of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder
may have or be otherwise charged with.  The holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer, may at any time or from time to time and in their absolute
direction, change the manner, place or terms of payment, change or extend the
time of payment of, or renew or alter, any such Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer, or amend or supplement any instrument pursuant to which any such
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is issued or by which it may be secured, or
release any security therefor, or exercise or refrain from exercising any
other of their rights under such Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, including,
without limitation, the waiver of default thereunder, all without notice to
or assent from the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee and without
affecting the obligations of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Holders of
Securities under this Article Thirteen.

             SECTION 13.10  Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer.  The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any
fiduciary duty to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, and
shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or
distribute money or assets to Securityholders or the Issuer.  With respect to
the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Trustee undertakes to
perform or to observe only such of its covenants or obligations as are
specifically set forth in this Article Thirteen and no implied covenants or
obligations with respect to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer shall
be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.

                                ARTICLE FOURTEEN
                                   GUARANTEES

             SECTION 14.1  Guarantee.  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally
guarantees to each Holder of a Security of each series authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee the due and prompt payment of the principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest on such Security and the due and prompt payment
of any sinking fund payments provided for pursuant to the terms of such
Security, when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the
Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or
otherwise, according to the terms of such Security and of this Indenture.  In
case of the failure of the Issuer punctually to make any such principal,
premium, interest or sinking fund payment, the Guarantor hereby agrees to
cause any such payment to be made promptly when and as the same shall become
due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of
acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were
made by the Issuer. The Guarantor hereby further agrees that any amounts to
be paid by the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be paid without
deduction or withholding for any and all present and future withholding
taxes, levies, imposts and charges whatsoever imposed by or for the account
of the Cayman Islands or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein, or if deduction or withholding of any such taxes,
levies, imposts or charges shall at any time be required by the Cayman
Islands or any such subdivision or authority, the Guarantor will (subject
to compliance by the Holder of such Security with any relevant
administrative requirements) pay such additional amount in respect of
principal (and premium, if any) interest and sinking fund payment, if any, as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts paid to such Holder or the
Trustee, as the case may be, pursuant to this Guarantee, after such deduction
or withholding, shall equal the respective amounts of principal (and premium,
if any), interest and sinking fund payments, if any, as specified in such
Security to which such Holder is entitled; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any such tax, levy, impost or charge which would
not be payable or due but for the fact (i) the Holder of such Security is a
domiciliary, national or resident of, or engaging in business or maintaining a
permanent establishment or being physically present in, the Cayman Islands or
such political subdivision or otherwise having some connection with the Cayman
Islands other than the holding or ownership of such Security or the collection
of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such Security or the
enforcement of such Security or this Guarantee or (ii) where presentation is
required, such Security was presented more than 30 days after the date such
payment became due or was provided for, whichever is later.  The Guarantor
hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be as if it were principal
debtor and not merely surety, and shall be absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or
unenforceability of any Security of any series of this Indenture, any failure
to enforce the provisions of any Security of any series or this Indenture, or
any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Issuer with respect
thereto, by the Holder of any Security of any series or the Trustee, or any
other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the
consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of a Security or the
interest rate thereon or increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof.
The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing
of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any
right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest or notice with
respect to any Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect
to any sinking fund payment required pursuant to the terms of a Security
issued under this Indenture and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that
this Guarantee will not be discharged with respect to any Security except by
payment in full of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on
such Security.

             SECTION 14.2  Subrogation.  The Guarantor shall be subrogated to
all rights of the Holder of a Security against the Issuer in respect of any
amounts paid to such Holder by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of
this Guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled
to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such
right of subrogation until the principal of (and premium, if any) and
<PAGE>

interest on all Securities of the relevant series shall have been paid in
full.

             SECTION 14.3  Execution and Delivery of Guarantees.  To evidence
its guarantee set forth in Section 14.1, the Guarantor hereby agrees to
execute the Guarantee in a form established pursuant to Section 2.1, to be
endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.  Each
such Guarantee shall be signed manually or by facsimile by a person duly
authorized thereto by Board Resolution of the Guarantor.

             Guarantees bearing the facsimile signature of any individual who
was at any time an officer of the Guarantor shall bind the Guarantor,
notwithstanding that such individual shall have ceased to be an officer prior
to the authentication and delivery of the Securities upon which such
Guarantees are endorsed or was not an officer at the date of such Securities.

             The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the
authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the
Guarantee endorsed thereon on behalf of the Guarantor.

         SECTION 14.4  Agreement to Subordinate.  The Guarantor agrees, and
each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that all payments pursuant
to the Guarantee of the Guarantor are subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, to the same
extent and manner that all payments pursuant to the Securities are
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer.

             IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amended
and Restated Indenture to be duly executed, all as of the date first above
written.

                         [FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF NOTE]

                9-3/4% Senior Subordinated Discount Note due 2000

             1.   Interest.  There will be no payments of interest on this
Note prior to  December 15, 1996.  Commencing December 15, 1996, interest
on this Note will accrue at the rate of 9-3/4% per annum and will be
payable in cash semiannually on each December 15  and June 15, commencing
June 15, 1997, to Holders of record on the close of business on the
immediately preceding December 1 and June 1; provided that if the principal
amount hereof or any portion of such principal amount is not paid
when due (whether upon acceleration  pursuant to Section 5.2 of the
Indenture, upon the  date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant
to paragraph 6 hereof, upon the date set for payment of the Change in
Control Purchase Price or Colombian Asset Redemption Price, or other
required payments pursuant to paragraph 8 hereof or upon the Stated
Maturity of this Note), then in each such case the overdue amount
shall bear interest at the rate of 9-3/4% per annum, compounded
semiannually (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable), which interest shall accrue from the date such
overdue amount was due to the date payment of such amount, including
interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for.  All such interest
shall be payable on demand.

             2.  Original Issue Discount.  Original issue discount (the
difference between the issue price and the principal amount of the Note), in
the period during which any of the Notes remains outstanding, shall accrue at
a rate of 9 3/4% per annum, on a semiannual bond equivalent basis using a
360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months, commencing on the date of
issuance of this Note.

             3.  Method of Payment.  Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Indenture, payments in respect of the Notes shall be made at the office
or agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the City and State
of New York or, at the option of the Issuer, payments in respect of the
Notes may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders of Notes.  The
Issuer will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the
time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

             4.   Paying Agent and Registrar.  Initially, United States Trust
Company of New York (the "Trustee"), will act as paying agent and registrar.
The Issuer may appoint and change any paying agent or registrar without
notice, other than notice to the Trustee.  The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as paying agent or registrar.

             5.  Indenture.  The Issuer issued the Notes under an Indenture,
dated as of December 15, 1993, and amended and restated as of ____________,
199_, among the Issuer, TC Holdings Limited (the "Guarantor") and the Trustee
(the "Indenture").  The terms of the Notes include those stated in the
Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act of 1939").
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Indenture.  The Notes are subject to all such terms,
and holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939
for a statement of those terms.

              The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Issuer,
limited to $170 million aggregate principal amount.

             6.  Subordination.  The Indebtedness represented by the Notes is
expressly subordinate and junior in right of payment, in the manner and to the
extent set forth in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer whether outstanding on the date of such Indenture
or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed. Each Holder of a Note
by its acceptance hereof agrees and accepts to be bound by such provisions.

             7.  Redemption at the Option of the Issuer.  No sinking fund is
provided for the Notes.  Commencing December 15, 1997, the Notes will be
subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'
notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption
date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on December 15 of the
years indicated below:

         Year                                              Percentage

         1998     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   102.438%
         1999 and thereafter  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   100.000%

               8.  Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed
at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each
Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address.  If money
sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Notes to be redeemed on the
Redemption Date, together with accrued interest thereon to the Redemption
Date, is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date,
on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Notes or portions
thereof.

               9.  Offers to Repurchase the Notes by the Issuer.  In certain
circumstances relating to Asset Sales and Changes in Control described in the
Indenture, the Issuer may be required to make offers to repurchase the Notes.

               10.   Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.  The Notes are in
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of principal
amount and integral multiples of $1,000.  A Holder may register the transfer
of or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture.  The registrar may
require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or
permitted by the Indenture.  The Issuer shall not be required to exchange
or register a transfer of (a) any Notes for a period of 15 days next
preceding the first mailing or publication of notice of redemption of
Notes to be redeemed, (b) any Notes selected, called or being called for
redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Note to be
redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed or (c) any
Note if the Holder thereof has exercised its right, if any, to require
the Issuer to repurchase such Note in whole or in part, except
the portion of such Note not required to be repurchased.

<PAGE>
               11.  Persons Deemed Owners.  The registered Holder of this Note
may be treated as the owner of this Note for all purposes.

               12.  Unclaimed Money.  The Trustee and each paying agent shall
each return to the Issuer upon written request any money held by them for the
payment of any amount with respect to the Notes that remains unclaimed for two
years.  After return to the Issuer, Holders entitled to the money must look to
the Issuer for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned
property law designates another person.

               13.  Amendment; Waiver.  Subject to certain exceptions set
forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the
written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding and (ii) certain defaults or
noncompliance with certain provisions may be waived with the written consent
of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at
the time outstanding.  Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the
Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Guarantor and
the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Notes to cure any ambiguity,
defect or inconsistency, or to comply with Article Nine of the Indenture,
or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any
Holder of Notes.

               14.  Defaults and Remedies. Under the Indenture, Events of
Default include, among others, (i) default in the payment of any installment
of interest on the Notes as and when the same becomes due and payable, and
continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; (ii) default in the
payment of the principal amount, Redemption Price, Change in Control Purchase
Price, Colombian Sale Redemption Price or Asset Sale Offer Price when the same
becomes due and payable; (iii) failure by the Issuer or the Guarantor to
comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes, subject to notice
and lapse of time; (iv) certain Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Guarantor or
certain Subsidiaries of the Guarantor for money borrowed in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount of $10,000,000 or more becoming due and payable
prior to final maturity thereof or default in any payment when due at final
maturity of any such Indebtedness; (v) certain judgments or orders rendered
against the Issuer, the Guarantor or certain Subsidiaries of the Guarantor in
an aggregate principal amount of more than $10,000,000; and (vi) certain
events of bankruptcy or insolvency.  If an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, may declare all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes becoming
due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.

               Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes
except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee may refuse to enforce the
Indenture or the Notes unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security.
Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its
exercise of any trust or power.  The Trustee may withhold from Holders of
Notes notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of
amounts specified in clauses (i) and (ii) above) if it determines that
withholding notice is in their best interests.

               15.  Trustee Dealings with the Issuer and the Guarantor.
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the
Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may
become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect
obligations owed to it by the Issuer, the Guarantor or their respective
Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Issuer, the Guarantor or their
respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

               16.  No Recourse Against Others.  A director, officer, employee
or stockholder, as such, of the Issuer or the Guarantor shall not have any
liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantor under the Notes,
the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation.  By accepting a Note having
endorsed thereon a Guarantee, each Note Holder waives and releases all such
liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue
of the Notes and the Guarantees.

               17.  Authentication.  This Note and the Guarantee endorsed
hereon shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee
manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other side
of this Note.

Guarantees are subject to defeasance and covenant defeasance as provided in
the Indenture.

               19.  Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the
name of a Holder of Notes or an assignee, such as TEN COM (= tenants in
common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with
right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= custodian), and
U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

               20. GOVERNING LAW. THIS NOTE, THE GUARANTEES ENDORSED HEREON
AND THE INDENTURE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED
WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF
LAW.

               The Issuer will furnish to any Holder of Notes upon written
request and without charge a copy of the Indenture.  Requests may be made to:

                        GUARANTEE OF TC HOLDINGS LIMITED

         19.  Guarantee.  For value received, [_________________________], a
company duly organized and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands
(herein called the "Guarantor", which term includes any successor corporation
under the Indenture referred to in the Security upon which this Guarantee is
endorsed), hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Holder of the Security
upon which this Guarantee is endorsed the due and prompt payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Security when and as
the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by
declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, according to
the terms thereof and of the Indenture referred to therein.  In case of the
failure of Triton Energy Corporation, a corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Issuer",
which term includes any successor corporation under such Indenture)
punctually to make any such principal, premium or interest payment, the
Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made promptly when
and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity,
by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as
if such payment were made by the Issuer.

         The Guarantor hereby further agrees that any amounts to be paid
by the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be paid without deduction or
withholding for any and all present and future withholding taxes, levies,
imposts and charges whatsoever imposed by or for the account of the Cayman
Islands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein,
or if deduction or withholding of any such taxes, levies, imposts or charges
shall at any time be required by the Cayman Islands or any such subdivision
or authority, the Guarantor will (subject to compliance by the Holder of
such Security with any relevant administrative requirements) pay such
additional amount in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts paid to such Holder or
the Trustee under such Indenture, as the case may be, pursuant to this
Guarantee, after such deduction or withholding, shall equal the respective
amounts of principal (and premium, if any) and interest as specified in
such Security to which such Holder or the Trustee is entitled; provided,
however that the foregoing shall not apply to any such tax, levy, impost
or charge which would not be payable or due but for the fact that (i) the
Holder of such Security is a domiciliary, national or resident of, or
engaging in business or maintaining a permanent establishment or being
physically present in, the Cayman Islands or such political subdivision
or otherwise having some connection with the Cayman Islands other than
the holding or ownership of such Security or the collection
of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such Security or the
enforcement of such Security or this Guarantee or (ii) where presentation is
required, such Security was presented more than 30 days after the date such
payment became due or was provided for, whichever is later.

         The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder
shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely surety, and shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any
invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or such
Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or such
Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Issuer
with respect thereto, by the Holder of such Security or such Trustee, or any
other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a surety or guarantor, provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence
shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount
of such Security or the interest rate thereon or increase any premium
payable upon redemption thereof.  The Guarantor hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with
a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to
require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest or notice with respect
to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands
whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by
payment in full of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such
Security.

         The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of such Security against the Issuer in respect of any amounts paid to such
Holder by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee;
provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or
to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of
subrogation until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on
all Securities of the same series issued under such Indenture shall have
been paid in full.

         No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of this
Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, of the due and punctual
payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed at the times, place and
rate, and in the cash or currency prescribed therein.

         This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose
until the certificate of authentication of such Security shall have been
manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under such Indenture.

         All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in such
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.

<PAGE>
          20.  Subordination.  The Guarantor agrees, and each Security
holder by accepting a Security agrees, that all payments pursuant to the
Guarantee of the Guarantor are subordinated and junior in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, to the
same extent and manner that all payments pursuant to the Securities are
subordinated and junior in right of payment, in the manner and to the extent
set forth in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer, whether outstanding on the date of such Indenture
or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to
be signed in facsimile by a person duly authorized in that behalf.


                                          TC HOLDINGS LIMITED

     3.01     Guarantor Guarantee.     The Guarantor hereby unconditionally
and  irrevocably  guarantees  to  the Lender and Eximbank the full, prompt and
complete payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise)  of  the principal of and interest on the Credit, together with any
and  all other amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lender or Eximbank under
this Agreement or the Note(s).  If the Borrower shall fail to pay when due any
or  all sums hereby guaranteed (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise),  the  Guarantor shall forthwith pay, without any demand or notice,
the  full amount due and payable by the Borrower  in U.S. Dollars at the place
and in the manner required by this Agreement or the Note(s).  This is a
guarantee  of  payment  and not merely of collection, and shall remain in full
force  and  effect until all the obligations of the Borrower hereby guaranteed
are  paid  in  full.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Guarantor
waives  all  defenses  of a surety or guarantor to which it may be entitled by
statute or otherwise.

          3.02     Guarantee Continuing and Unconditional.

      (a)  The Guarantor Guarantee is a continuing, absolute and unconditional
guarantee  of  payment  as primary obligor and not merely as surety, and shall
apply  to all obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the Note(s)
whenever arising.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Guarantor  Guarantee  shall  not be released, discharged or otherwise affected
by:  (i)   the lack of genuineness, legality, validity, regularity or
enforceability of this Agreement or the Note(s) or any other agreement or
document contemplated hereby;  (ii) the surrender, release, exchange,
substitution, taking of any additional collateral, or  impairment of any
collateral;  (iii)  failure by the Borrower to comply with any of the terms of
this Agreement or the Note(s); (iv) any change in the name, authorized
activities, capital stock, corporate existence, structure, personnel or
ownership  of  the Borrower; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
other  similar  proceeding  affecting  the Borrower or its assets; or (vi) any
other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, the
Guarantor, the Lender or Eximbank or any other Person, or any other
circumstance  whatsoever  that  might,  but for the provisions of this Section
3.02,  constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense to the Guarantor's
obligations hereunder.

     (b)  The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and expressly waives all diligence,
presentments, demands, protests and notices of any kind whatsoever, including,
without limitation, notices of nonperformance or nonpayment, notices of
default,  notices  of  protest,  notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of
this  Guarantor Guarantee, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring
of  new  or additional obligations by the Borrower under this Agreement or the
Note(s).

         (c)  The Guarantor consents that, without notice to the Guarantor and
without  the necessity for any additional endorsement, consent or guarantee by
the  Guarantor,  the  liabilities  of the Borrower hereby guaranteed may, from
time to time, be renewed, extended, increased, accelerated, modified
(including  without  limitation any change in interest rate or a switch from a
floating  to  fixed rate of interest) , amended, compromised, waived, released
or  discharged  by the Lender or Eximbank, and any security which is or in the
future may be held, or any other guarantee issued for, the payment of the
indebtedness of the Borrower under this Agreement or the Note(s) may be
exchanged, sold or surrendered by the Lender or Eximbank, all without
impairing  or  affecting in any way the obligation of the Guarantor hereunder.
Neither the Lender or Eximbank shall be obliged to enforce any remedies
against  the  Borrower  or  any guarantee or security which it may hold before
being entitled to payment from the Guarantor of the obligations hereby
guaranteed.

     3.03     Reinstatement.  The Guarantor Guarantee shall be
automatically  reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment
by  or  on behalf of the Borrower in respect of obligations hereby guaranteed
is  recovered  from  or repaid by the Lender, Eximbank or any other party as a
result of any proceeding in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
otherwise.

        3.04     Endorsement of Note(s).  To evidence further the Guarantor
Guarantee contained in this Section 3, the Guarantor agrees to endorse, in the
form specified in Annex A-1 and A-2, each Note issued by the Borrower
hereunder, including any replacement Note issued pursuant to Section 5.06.

                  SECTION 4. EXIMBANK GUARANTEE REQUIREMENTS

     4.01     Eligibility for Eximbank Guarantee

     (a)     Subject to the Utilization Procedures described in Annex B
attached  hereto, "Items" shall mean (i) goods exported from the United States
under  a Purchase Contract, (ii) services performed under a Purchase Contract,
and (iii) certain bank, financial intermediary and legal fees directly related
to  the  Eximbank  financing, all of which goods, services and fees shall have
been  approved  by  Eximbank as eligible under the Eximbank Guarantee and thus
eligible for financing under the Credit.  Except with respect the Items
described in subclause (iii) of the foregoing sentence, the Foreign Cost
associated  with  each  Item  shall be less than 50% of the Production Cost of
such Item; and the Borrower shall have made or caused to be made a cash
payment  ("Cash  Payment") for the purchase of such Item in an amount equal to
not less than 15% of the Contract Price of such Item.  Eximbank shall
determine  what  does and does not constitute an Item, and such determination,
in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes.

      (b)     To be eligible for the Eximbank Guarantee, all Items that are to
be  financed under the Credit and that are to be exported by ocean vessel must
be transported from the United States in vessels of U.S. registry, as required
by 46 U.S.C. 1241-1 (Public Resolution No. 17 of the 73rd Congress of the
United States, as amended), except to the extent that a waiver of this
requirement  is  obtained  from the U.S. Maritime Administration ("MARAD"), as
described in Annex B.  Notwithstanding Section 4.01(a), if any Items are
shipped on vessels of non-U.S. registry without a MARAD waiver, or contrary to
the  provisions  of  a MARAD waiver, such Items will not be eligible under the
Eximbank Guarantee and thus will not be eligible for financing under the
Credit.

     (c)     If an Item is shipped on ocean vessels or aircraft of U.S.
registry, the cost of shipment may be included in the U.S. Content of the
Item.  If an Item is shipped on ocean vessels or aircraft of non-U.S.
registry, the cost of shipment may be part of the Foreign Cost associated with
such  Item  if  such  cost has been included in the Contract Price of the Item
and, in the case of ocean vessels, a MARAD waiver has been obtained..

     (d)     The Borrower shall obtain or cause to be obtained insurance
against  marine and transit hazards on all shipments of the Items in an amount
not less than the amount of the Disbursements that have been or are to be made
with respect to those shipments.  United States insurers shall be given a
non-discriminatory  opportunity  to bid for such insurance business related to
the Items.  The cost of the premiums for such insurance may be included in the
U.S. Content of the insured Item if: (i) the insurance is placed in the United
States with U.S. companies; and (ii) the premiums are paid in the United
States in Dollars.  In all other cases, the cost of the premiums may be
included  in  the  Foreign Cost associated with the Item if such cost has been
included in the Contract Price of the Item.

         4.02     Coverage of Eximbank Guarantee.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Eximbank Guarantee Agreement, a Disbursement made with
respect to an Item shall be covered by the  Eximbank Guarantee up to the
following maximum amount:

      (a)     an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 85% of the Contract Price
of such Item, or (ii) 100% of the U.S. Content of such Item; plus

     (b)     an amount equal to 100% of the applicable Exposure Fee.


                        SECTION 5. TERMS OF THE CREDIT

         (a)     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and as
long  as no Event of Default exists, the Lender agrees to loan to the Borrower

Disbursements.     For each Disbursement under the Credit, Eximbank shall have
issued to the Lender either (x) a Certificate Authorizing Reimbursement in the
form  of Exhibit 3 of Annex B hereof, or (y) a Certificate Approving Letter of
Credit in the form of Exhibit 5 of Annex B hereof.

       (b)     The Borrower shall repay all amounts disbursed under the Credit
in  ten  (10)  approximately  equal, successive semi-annual installments, with
each  such  installment to be payable on a Payment Date, provided that, on the
last  Payment  Date,  the Borrower shall repay in full the principal amount of
the Credit then outstanding.

     5.02     Interest Payment.

          (a)     To Lender

     (i)     Subject to the provisions of Section 12.14 concerning the Highest

all amounts disbursed and outstanding from time to time under the Credit,
calculated  at  an  interest  rate per annum equal to the sum of (x) 0.25% per
annum, and (y) LIBOR for the applicable Interest Period(s), or any other
interest rate in effect for such amounts.

     (ii)     If all or any part of principal, accrued interest, fees or other
amounts  owing  to  the Lender under this Agreement or any Note is not paid in
full  when  due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, the
Borrower  shall  pay to the Lender on demand interest on the unpaid amount (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) for the period from the date such
amount  was  due until such amount shall have been paid in full at an interest
rate per annum equal to  (x) 1% per annum above the interest rate then
applicable under  Section 5.02(a)(i) until the end of the then current
Interest Period, and (y) thereafter 1% per annum above the Alternate Rate.

     (b)     To Eximbank

     (i)     Notwithstanding Section 5.02(a)(i), if Eximbank shall have made a
claim  payment to the Lender with respect to any Floating Rate Note subject to
the  Accelerated Payment Method (as defined in the Guarantee Agreement), then,
beginning  on  the date of such claim payment, the definition of Special LIBOR
shall  apply  to  each  such Floating Rate Note (in place of the definition of
LIBOR  contained in each such Floating Rate Note) for all purposes, including,
without limitation, Section 5.02(b)(ii).

     (ii)     Notwithstanding Section 5.02(a)(ii), if Eximbank shall have made
a  claim  payment to the Lender with respect to any Note subject to either the
Accelerated  Payment  Method  or the Installment Payment Method (as defined in
the  Guarantee  Agreement), then, beginning on the date of such claim payment,
if  any  amount  of principal of or accrued interest on any Note then owing to
Eximbank is not paid in full when due, whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall pay to Eximbank on demand
interest on such unpaid amount (to the extent permitted by applicable law) for
the  period  from  the  date such amount was due to Eximbank until such amount
shall have been paid in full at an interest rate per annum equal to one
percent  (1%)  per annum above the interest rate then applicable under Section
5.02(a)(i) (as modified, if required, by 5.02(b)(i)).

         (iii)     Except as otherwise provided in 5.02(b)(ii) with respect to
amounts  of  principal and accrued interest, if, at any time, any amount owing
to Eximbank under this Agreement or any Note is not paid in full when due, the
Borrower  shall  pay  to Eximbank on demand interest on such unpaid amount for
the  period  from  the date such amount was due ("Payment Default Date") until
such  amount  shall have been paid in full at an interest rate per annum equal
to one percent (1%) per annum above the U.S. Treasury Rate.  The "U.S.
Treasury  Rate"  shall mean the interest rate specified in the Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates for six-month (180
days) Treasury Bills under the category entitled "Treasury Bills, Auction
Average  (Investment)"  (or, if not included under such category, the category
entitled  "Treasury  Constant  Maturities"), which is in effect on the Payment
Default Date.

     5.03     Alternative Interest Rate
 .
     (a)     If the Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be
conclusive  and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error), prior to the
commencement  of  any  Interest Period that: (i) Dollar deposits of sufficient
amount  and maturity for funding a Disbursement are not generally available to
the  Lender in the London interbank market in the ordinary course of business;
or  (ii)  by  reason of circumstances generally affecting the relevant market,
adequate  and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of interest to
be applicable to a Disbursement; or (iii) the relevant rate of interest
referred  to  in  the definition of LIBOR which is to be used to determine the
rate  of  interest  for  a Disbursement does not cover the funding cost to the
Lender  of making or maintaining the Disbursement, then the Lender, so long as
such  condition  shall exist, shall give notice to the Borrower of the rate of
interest which the Lender determines is equal to the Alternate Rate (expressed
as  an annual rate), and interest shall accrue during each applicable Interest
Period at the rate set forth in the notice.

       (b)     If, in the Lender's reasonable judgment, it becomes unlawful at
any  time  for  the Lender to make or maintain Disbursements based upon LIBOR,
the  Lender,  so  long as such condition shall exist, shall give notice to the
Borrower  of  the rate of interest which the Lender determines is equal to the
Alternate Rate (expressed as an annual rate), and interest shall accrue during
each applicable Interest Period at the rate set forth in such notice.

       5.04     Prepayment.  Subject to Section 5.05, the Borrower may from
time  to time prepay on any Interest Payment Date all or part of the principal
amount  of the Credit, provided that: (i) any partial prepayment shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $5,000,000; (ii) the Borrower shall have given the
Lender and Eximbank at least ten (10) days prior written notice of the
prepayment  (which  notice shall be irrevocable); and (iii) the Borrower shall
have paid in full all amounts due under the Credit as of the date of such
prepayment,  including interest which has accrued to the date of prepayment on
the amount prepaid.  Prepayments shall be applied to the installments of
principal  of the Credit in the inverse order of their maturity, and, in cases
where more than one Note is outstanding, pro rata to each Note.

         5.05     Recapture. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender, upon the
written request of the Lender, the applicable Make Whole Amount and such other
amounts  as  shall be sufficient (in the reasonable judgment of the Lender) to
compensate  the  Lender for any loss, expense or liability (including, without
limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the
liquidation  or  redeployment  of deposits from third parties or in connection
with  obtaining  funds to make or maintain any Disbursement, but excluding any
loss of profit) which the Lender reasonably determines is attributable to:

        (i)     any payment or prepayment of the Credit on a date prior to the
originally  scheduled  maturity  thereof,  or on a date other than an Interest
Payment  Date  as permitted in Section 5.04 (including, without limitation, by
reason of acceleration), or

      (ii)     any failure by the Borrower to borrow any advance that has been
requested in a Request for Reimbursement (as provided in Annex B).

     5.06     Evidence of Debt

        (a)     The Borrower agrees that to evidence further its obligation to
repay  all  amounts disbursed under the Credit, with interest accrued thereon,
it shall issue and deliver to the Lender, in accordance with the written
instructions  of the Lender, one or more promissory notes (the Note(s)"). Each
Note  shall  be  in the form of either Annex A-1 or Annex A-2, or as otherwise
agreed upon by the parties hereto, shall bear the Guarantor's guarantee
endorsement,  and shall be valid and enforceable as to its principal amount at
any time only to the extent of the aggregate amounts then disbursed and
outstanding  under  the Credit, and, as to interest, only to the extent of the
interest  accrued thereon.   Any notations by the Lender on any Note regarding
payments made on account of the principal thereof, in absence of manifest
error, shall be conclusive and binding.

      (b)     If requested by the Lender, within ten (10) days after the Final
Disbursement  Date,  the  Borrower shall issue and deliver to the Lender a new
Note(s) in exchange for the Note(s) previously issued and delivered in
accordance  with  Section  6.01(i),  whereupon the Lender shall surrender such
previously  issued Note(s) for cancellation to the Borrower through Eximbank.
The principal amount of such new Note(s) shall equal in the aggregate the
principal amount of the Credit then disbursed and outstanding.

     (c)     If requested by the Lender or Eximbank pursuant to Section
7.02(b)(ii),  the Borrower shall issue and deliver to the Lender a new Note(s)
in exchange for the Note(s) previously issued and delivered in accordance with
this  Agreement,  whereupon  the Lender shall surrender such previously issued
Note(s) for cancellation to the Borrower through Eximbank.

     (d)     If any Note is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Borrower
shall issue and deliver a new Note of the same date, maturity and denomination
as  the  Note  so  mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed; provided that, in the
case of any mutilated Note, such mutilated Note shall be returned to the
Borrower  after  examination by Eximbank, and, in the case of any lost, stolen
or destroyed Note, the Borrower and Eximbank shall have first received
evidence of such loss, theft or destruction reasonably satisfactory to each of
them.

Final Disbursement Date, the Borrower shall have the one-time option with
respect  to  each  loan bearing interest at a floating rate of converting such
loan to a Lender Fixed Rate, provided that on the date of conversion the
aggregate  principal  amount of such loans bearing interest at a floating rate
made to the Borrower which are to be converted must equal or exceed U.S.
$10,000,000,  unless  otherwise  agreed to by the Lender.  Any such conversion
may  only  occur (i) after the Borrower has given the Lender and  Eximbank not
less  than  thirty  (30) Business Days notice (unless the Borrower, the Lender
and  Eximbank  agree  to a shorter notice period), (ii) after the Borrower has
issued and delivered to the Lender a Fixed Rate Note and Eximbank has endorsed
such  Fixed  Rate  Note,  and (iii) on one of the Payment Dates.  In the event
that  the Borrower elects to convert less than all of the loans, the remaining
loans shall no longer be eligible for conversion pursuant to this paragraph.

reasonable  judgment  of  the  Lender, such change would be disadvantageous to
it).

Agreement and the payment of the Note(s) and all other amounts due hereunder.

transactions  hereby  contemplated  shall be consummated, to pay, or reimburse
the Lender and Eximbank, respectively, promptly upon demand for the payment of

     7.04     Additional or Increased Costs

taxation of any amounts payable to the Lender (other than taxes imposed on the
overall  net  income  of the Lender or of the office out of which it is acting
hereunder); (ii) imposes or modifies any Reserve/Premium Requirements
affecting the Lender; or (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this
Agreement or the Note(s), there shall be any increase in the cost to the
Lender  of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Utilization,
then  the  Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by the Lender, pay to
the  Lender  additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate the Lender for such
increased cost.

         (b)     Without duplication of Section 7.04(a), if the Lender, in its
reasonable  judgment,  determines  at any time that any Regulatory Change will
have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained  by  the  Lender (which term, for purposes of this Section 7.04(b),
shall  include  any corporation controlling the Lender) based on the existence
of the Lender's obligations hereunder, then the Borrower shall pay to the
Lender, upon demand by the Lender, such additional amounts as shall be
required  to  compensate  the Lender for the increased cost to the Lender as a
result thereof (which compensation shall include, without limitation, an
amount equal to any reduction in return on assets or equity of the Lender to a
level  below that which it could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change,
taking into account the Lender's policies as to capital adequacy).

       (c)     "Regulatory Change" shall mean the introduction or change after
the  date of this Agreement of or in United States or foreign national, state,
municipal  laws  or  regulations  (including any statute, treaty, rule, order,
writ, injunction, decree, judgment, or judicial opinion of any court or
tribunal)  or in the interpretation or administration thereof, or the adoption
or making after such date of any directives, requirements, or requests
(whether or not having the force of law) by any United States or foreign
national, state, or municipal court or governmental or monetary authority.

     (d)     The Lender shall take such reasonable steps as it shall determine
in  its sole discretion to minimize amounts demanded under this Section 7.04.

minimize amounts demanded under this Section 7.04, any costs and expenses
incurred in such transfer shall be paid by the Borrower.

         (e)     Each demand for payment by the Lender under this Section 7.04
shall  be  accompanied by a certificate showing in reasonable detail the basis
for the calculation of the amounts demanded, which certificate, in the absence
of manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

United States or any other ordinance, decree, constitutional provision,
regulation or other requirement of any Governmental Authority (including,
without limitation, any restriction on interest that may be paid by the

revenues,  properties  or  assets may be subject, or result in the creation or
imposition  of  any Lien upon any of the revenues, properties or assets of the
Borrower pursuant to any such agreement or instrument.

accordance  with  its  respective  terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited  by  applicable  insolvency,  reorganization, liquidation, moratorium,
readjustment of debt or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors'  rights  generally  and by the application of general principles of
equity regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
at  law or in equity.  The Borrower's payment obligations under this Agreement

pari  passu in priority of payment and in right of security with all other
unsecured debt of the Borrower.

Agreement  and the Note(s) are valid, binding and not subject to revocation by

governmental agency which might: (i) materially and adversely affect the
Borrower's financial condition, business or operations; (ii) restrain or
enjoin or have the effect of restraining or enjoining the performance or
observance  of  the  terms and conditions of any of the Borrower Documents; or

not, violate any applicable law of the United States or Colombia.

Statements  present fairly the financial condition of the Borrower at the date

fiscal  year.  The Borrower Financial Statements reflecting the Borrowers full
consolidated operations have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  in the United States consistently applied as
described in Section 9.02(b).  Except as fully reflected in the Borrower
Financial  Statements, there are no liabilities or obligations with respect to
the  Borrower  of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise and whether or not due) for the period to which the Borrower
Financial  Statements  relate  that,  either individually or in the aggregate,
would  be  material to the Borrower.  Since the date of the Borrower Financial
Statements, there has been no material adverse change in the financial
condition, business, prospects or operations of the Borrower.

      (a)     Existence and Authority.  The Guarantor is duly organized and
validly  existing  under  the laws of Delaware, with full power, authority and
legal  right  to own its property and carry on its business as now conducted.
The  Guarantor has taken all actions necessary or advisable to authorize it to
execute, deliver, perform and observe the terms and conditions of  this
Agreement and the Note(s).

enforceability, priority or admissibility in evidence in the state of New York
of  this Agreement and the Note(s), it is not necessary that this Agreement or
the Note(s) be registered, recorded, enrolled or otherwise filed with any
court or other Governmental Authority, or be notarized, or that any
documentary,  stamp  or other similar tax, imposition or charge of any kind be
paid on or in respect of this Agreement or the Note(s).

     (c)     Restrictions.  The execution, delivery and performance or
observance by the Guarantor of the terms of, and consummation by the Guarantor
of  the  transactions contemplated by, each of this Agreement and the Note(s),
does not and will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of: (i)
the  charter,  by-laws  or similar documents of the Guarantor; (ii) any law of
the  United  States  or any other ordinance, decree, constitutional provision,
regulation or other requirement of any Governmental Authority (including,
without  limitation,  any  restriction on interest that may be paid); or (iii)
any order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or other
tribunal.    Further, the execution, delivery and performance or observance by
the Guarantor of the terms of this Agreement and the Note(s) does not and will
not conflict with or result in a breach of any agreement or instrument to
which the Guarantor is a party, or by which it or any of its revenues,
properties  or  assets may be subject, or result in the creation or imposition
of  any  Lien  upon any of the revenues, properties or assets of the Guarantor
pursuant to any such agreement or instrument.

     (d)     Binding Effect; Senior Debt.  This Agreement has been, and the
Note(s) when executed will be,  duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
  This Agreement constitutes, and the Note(s) when executed will constitute, a
direct,  general and unconditional obligation of the Guarantor which is legal,
valid  and binding upon the Guarantor and enforceable against the Guarantor in
accordance  with  its  respective  terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited  by  applicable  insolvency,  reorganization, liquidation, moratorium,
readjustment of debt or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors'  rights  generally  and by the application of general principles of
equity regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity.   The Guarantor's payment obligations under this
Agreement rank, and under the Note(s), when issued, will rank, in all respects
at  least  pari passu in priority of payment and in right of security with
all  unsecured  debt  of the Guarantor.  The debt obligations of the Guarantor
under this Agreement and evidenced by the Notes are and will be Senior
Indebtedness, as defined in the Indenture.

     (e)     Choice of Law.  The choice of  law provisions of this
Agreement  and the Note(s) are valid, binding and not subject to revocation by

documents will be recognized and such law will be applied.

        (f)     Legal Proceedings.  No legal proceedings are pending or, to
the best of the Guarantor's knowledge, threatened before any court or
governmental agency which might: (i) materially and adversely affect the
Guarantor's financial condition, business or operations; (ii) restrain or
enjoin or have the effect of restraining or enjoining the performance or
observance  of  the  terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Note(s); or

enforceability of this Agreement or the Note(s).

     (g)     Guarantor Financial Statements.  The Guarantor Financial
Statements present fairly the financial condition of the Guarantor at the date
of such statements and the results of the operations of the Guarantor for such
fiscal year.  The Guarantor Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
consistently  applied.    Except as fully reflected in the Guarantor Financial
Statements, there are no liabilities or obligations with respect to the
Guarantor  of  any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not due) for the period to which the Guarantor
Financial  Statements  relate  that,  either individually or in the aggregate,
would be material to the Guarantor.  Since the date of the Guarantor Financial
Statements, there has been no material adverse change in the financial
condition, business, prospects or operations of the Guarantor.

        (h)     No Taxes. There is no Tax imposed on or in connection with:
(i)  the  execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Note(s);

delivery of the particulars of such occurrence and the corrective action
proposed to be taken by the Guarantor with respect thereto.

in the Indenture.

legal suit, action or proceeding, and irrevocably submits generally and
unconditionally to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action
or  proceeding.    The Borrower and the Guarantor each agrees that a judgment,

shall  be  conclusive  and  binding upon the Borrower or the Guarantor, as the
case  may  be,  by suit upon such judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the judgment.

     11.03     Service of Process

     (a)     In the case of the Courts of the State of New York or of the
Federal Courts sitting in the State of New York, the Borrower and the
Guarantor each hereby designates, appoints and empowers CT Corporation System,
1623  Broadway,  New York, New York  10019, as its authorized agent to accept,
receive  and acknowledge, for and on behalf of the Borrower and the Guarantor,

hereby authorized to accept, receive and acknowledge the same for and on

shall  be  legal  and binding upon the Borrower and the Guarantor, as the case
may  be,  for  all purposes notwithstanding any failure to mail copies of such
legal  process  to  the  Borrower or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or any
failure  on  the part of the Borrower or the Guarantor, as the case may be, to
receive  the  same, and shall be deemed completed upon the delivery thereof to
such agent whether or not such agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower
or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or upon the earliest other date

referenced in Section 12.02, such service to be effective upon the date
indicated  on  the postal receipt returned from the Borrower or the Guarantor,

        (d)     The Borrower and the Guarantor each agrees that it will at all
times continuously maintain an agent to receive service of process in the
State of New York on behalf of itself and its properties and revenues, and, in
the  event  that  for  any reason its agent mentioned above shall not serve as
agent for the Borrower or the Guarantor, as the case may be, to receive
service of process in the State of New York on its behalf, the Borrower or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, shall promptly appoint a successor satisfactory
to the Lender and Eximbank so to serve, advise the Lender and Eximbank
thereof,  and  deliver  to  the Lender and Eximbank evidence in writing of the
successor agent's  acceptance  of  such  appointment.  The foregoing
provisions constitute,  among other things, a special arrangement for service
between the parties to this Agreement for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. Section
1608.

       11.04     Waiver of Immunity.  The Borrower and the Guarantor hereby
each irrevocably agrees that, to the extent that the Borrower or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, or any of its assets has or may hereafter
acquire  any right of immunity, whether characterized as sovereign immunity or
otherwise, from any legal proceedings, whether in the United States or
elsewhere,  to  enforce or collect upon the Credit or the Note(s) or any other

such  immunity  and  agrees  not to assert any such right or claim in any such
proceeding, whether in the United States or elsewhere.

     11.05     Waiver of Security Requirements.  To the extent the Borrower
and  the Guarantor may, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to any of the Borrower Documents brought in the United States or elsewhere, be
entitled  under applicable law to require or claim that the Lender or Eximbank
post security for costs or take similar action, the Borrower and the Guarantor
hereby  each  irrevocably  waives  and agrees not to claim the benefit of such
entitlement.

      11.06     No Limitation.  Nothing in this Section 11 shall affect the
right of the Lender or Eximbank to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the
Borrower or the Guarantor in the United States or in any other jurisdiction.

                           SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS

     12.01     Computations.  Each determination of an interest rate or fee
by  the  Lender or Eximbank pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or the

the Borrower and the Guarantor.  All computations of interest and fees
hereunder  and  under  the Note(s) shall be made on the basis of a year of 360
days  and  actual days elapsed.  All such calculations shall include the first
day and exclude the last day of the period of calculation.

       12.02     Notices.  Except as otherwise specified, all notices given
hereunder shall be in writing in the English language, shall include the
applicable  Eximbank  guarantee number and shall be given by mail, telecopier,
tested telex or personal delivery and shall be deemed to be given for the
purposes of this Agreement on the day that such notice is received by the
intended  recipient  thereof, except for notices given by Eximbank pursuant to
Section 10, which shall be deemed given on the earlier of: (i) the day on
which  such  notice  is received by the intended recipient; or (ii) the day on
which such  notice is deposited in the mail or sent by telecopier, tested
telex or  personal  delivery.    Unless otherwise specified in a notice
delivered in accordance with this Section 12.02, all notices shall be
delivered to the parties hereto at their respective addresses indicated on
the Term Sheet.

     12.03     Disposition of Indebtedness.  With the prior written consent
of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the Lender may
sell, assign, transfer, pledge, negotiate, grant participations in or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of its interest in all or any part of the
Borrower's indebtedness under this Agreement and the Note(s) to any party
(collectively, a "Disposition of Indebtedness"), and any such party shall
enjoy all the rights and privileges of the Lender under this Agreement and the
Note(s);  provided,  however,  that such Disposition of Indebtedness shall not
relieve the Lender of its duties under this Agreement or the Eximbank
Guarantee Agreement without the prior written consent of Eximbank.  The
Borrower  and  the  Guarantor shall, at the request of the Lender, execute and
deliver to the Lender, or to any party that the Lender may designate, any such
further  instruments  as  may be necessary or desirable to give full force and
effect to a Disposition of Indebtedness by the Lender.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Borrower nor the
Guarantor  may  assign  or  otherwise transfer any of its debts or obligations
under this Agreement or the Note(s) without the prior written consent of
Eximbank and the Lender.

      12.04     Benefit of Agreement.  This Agreement shall be binding upon
and  inure  to  the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto.

     12.05     Termination of Eximbank Guarantee.  In the event the
Eximbank Guarantee terminates in its entirety pursuant to terms and conditions
of the Eximbank Guarantee Agreement, as of the date of termination, the rights
of Eximbank under Section 10 shall automatically be deemed to have been
assigned to the Lender.

     12.06     Disclaimer; Indemnification.  Neither Eximbank nor the
Lender  shall  be  responsible  in any way for the performance of the Purchase
Contracts,  and no claim against the Supplier or any other person with respect
to  the  performance  of the Purchase Contracts will affect the obligations of
the Borrower or the Guarantor under any of the Borrower Documents.

      12.07     No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay on the
part  of  the  Lender  or Eximbank in exercising any right, power or privilege
under  this Agreement or the Note(s) and no course of dealing between or among
the  Borrower,  the  Guarantor,  the Lender and/or Eximbank shall operate as a
waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under the Note(s) preclude any other right, power or
privilege hereunder or thereunder.  The rights and remedies expressly provided
herein  are  cumulative  and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the
Lender or Eximbank would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the
Borrower or the Guarantor in any case shall entitle the Borrower or the
Guarantor,  as  the  case  may be, to any other or further notice or demand in
similar  or  other  circumstances  or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Lender or Eximbank to any other or further action in any circumstances without
notice or demand.

     12.08     Entire Agreement.  This Agreement contains the entire
agreement among the parties hereto regarding the Credit.  This Agreement shall
completely  and  fully  supersede all prior understandings or agreements, both
written and oral, between the parties hereto regarding the Credit.  THIS
AGREEMENT  REPRESENTS  THE  FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE
CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL
AGREEMENTS BY THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE
PARTIES.



         12.09     Amendment or Waiver.  This Agreement may not be changed,
discharged  or  terminated  without the written consent of the parties hereto,
and no provision hereof may be waived without the written consent of the party
to be bound thereby.

     12.10     Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed in separate
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         12.11     Judgment Currency.  All payments of principal, interest,
fees  or  other  amounts  due hereunder and under the Note(s) shall be made in
Dollars,  regardless  of  any law, rule, regulation or statute, whether now or
hereafter in existence or in effect in any jurisdiction, which affects or
purports  to  affect such obligations.  The obligation of the Borrower and the
Guarantor  in  respect  of any amount due under this Agreement or the Note(s),
notwithstanding any payment in any other currency (whether pursuant to a
judgment  or  otherwise), shall be discharged only to the extent of the amount
in Dollars that the Person entitled to receive that payment may, in accordance
with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in that other
currency (after any premium and costs of exchange) on the Business Day
immediately succeeding the day on which that Person receives that payment.  If
the  amount  in Dollars that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of
the amount originally due, the Borrower and the Guarantor shall pay such
additional amounts, in Dollars, to compensate for the shortfall.  Any
obligation  of  the  Borrower  or the Guarantor not discharged by that payment
shall be continue to be due as a separate and independent obligation and shall
accrue  interest  in accordance with Section 5.02 until discharged as provided
herein.

     12.12     English Language.  All documents to be delivered by any
party hereto pursuant to the terms hereof shall be in the English language or,
if originally written in another language, shall be accompanied by an accurate
English  translation  upon which the other parties hereto shall have the right
to rely for all purposes under this Agreement and the Note(s).

        12.13     Severability.  To the extent permitted by applicable law,
the  illegality  or  unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall
not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

     12.14     Maximum Interest Rate.  Regardless of any provision
contained in this Agreement or any Note, the Lender shall never be entitled to
contract  for,  charge, take, reserve, receive or apply as interest any amount
in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the Lender ever contracts
for,charges, takes, reserves, receives or applies as interest any such excess,
it  shall be deemed a partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as
such;  and, if the loans are paid in full, any remaining excess shall promptly
be paid to the Borrower.  In determining whether interest paid or payable
exceeds  the  Highest  Lawful  Rate, the Borrower and the Lender shall, to the
maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, (a) treat all advances as but a
single extension of credit (and the Lender and the Borrower agree that such is
the  case  and  that provision herein for multiple advances is for convenience
only), (b) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than as interest, and (c) "spread" the total amount of interest
throughout  the  entire  contemplated term of the loans; provided that, if the
loans are paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated
term,  and if the interest received for the actual period of existence exceeds
the Highest Lawful Rate, the Lender shall refund the excess, and, in such
event,  the  Lender shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws
for  contracting  for,  charging,  taking, reserving, or receiving interest in
excess of  the Highest Lawful Rate.

        WHEREAS, the United States suppliers in order to comply with Colombian
law have utilized companies domiciled in Colombia to supply equipment and

                         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of February 8, 1996 among
TRITON ENERGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Triton Delaware"), TRITON
ENERGY LIMITED, a Cayman Islands company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Triton Delaware ("Triton Cayman"), and TEL MERGER CORP., a Delaware
corporation and a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Triton Cayman
("Sub").

          WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Triton Delaware,
Triton Cayman and Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of
their respective stockholders to reorganize (the "Reorganization") so that
Triton Cayman becomes the parent holding company for Triton Delaware;

          WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Triton Delaware, Sub
and Triton Cayman have approved the merger of Sub with and into Triton
Delaware (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, whereby each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share ("Triton Delaware Common Stock"), of Triton Delaware
(other than those shares held by Triton Delaware in its treasury and those
outstanding shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock ("Electing Shares") with
respect to which an Equity Unit Election (as hereinafter defined) has been
properly made and not withdrawn, subject to the Equity Unit Limitation (as
hereinafter defined)), will be automatically converted into one class A
ordinary share, par value $.01 per share (the "Class A Share"), of Triton
Cayman;

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Triton Delaware has determined that
holders of an aggregate of not less than 15% but not more than 25% (the
"Equity Unit Limitation") of the outstanding shares of Triton Delaware Common
Stock in the aggregate, may make an unconditional election (the "Equity Unit
Election") to receive an equity unit ("Equity Unit") consisting of (i) one
Class B ordinary share, par value $.01 per share (the "Class B Share" and,
together with the Class A Shares, the "Ordinary Shares"), and (ii) 1/10th of
one share of Triton Delaware's Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share ("Triton Delaware Preferred Stock"), which securities will be paired
and after such pairing may only be traded together as a unit and will not be
separately transferable, for each share of Triton Delaware Common Stock owned
of record by such stockholder in lieu of such shares being automatically
converted into Class A Shares;

          WHEREAS, the Merger requires the approval of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Triton Delaware Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon at the meeting of holders of Triton Delaware Common
Stock to be called therefor (the "Triton Delaware Stockholder Approval");

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

<PAGE>
                                 ARTICLE III

                  CONVERSION, ELECTION AND EXCHANGE OF STOCK

     3.1     CONVERSION

          At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any shares:

     (a)     Common Stock of Sub.  The issued and outstanding shares of common
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, equal to the number of shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

     (b)     Cancellation of Triton Delaware-Owned Stock.  Each outstanding
Class A Share and each share of Triton Delaware Common Stock that is owned by
Triton Delaware prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Ordinary Shares or
other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange for such
Class A Shares or shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock.

     (c)     Conversion of Triton Delaware Common Stock.  (i) Each issued and
outstanding share of Triton Delaware Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and other than Electing Shares
which shall be converted as described in (ii) below) shall be automatically
converted into and shall become one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable Class A Share and (ii) each share of Triton Delaware Common
Stock with respect to which an Equity Unit Election has been effectively made
and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 3.2(c), (d) and (e), subject to
the limitation contained in Section 3.2(f), shall be automatically converted
into a one Depositary Share (which will be evidenced by a receipt) consisting
of one Class B Share and 1/10th of one share of Triton Delaware Preferred
Stock which will trade together as an Equity Unit and not be separately
transferable.

     (d)     Conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock.  At the Effective Time
of the Merger, each outstanding share of 5% convertible preferred stock, no
par value ("Triton Delaware Convertible Preferred Stock"), of Triton Delaware
(other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be automatically
converted into and shall become one 5% convertible preference share, par value
$.01 per share ("Convertible Preference Shares"), of Triton Cayman.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Triton
Delaware Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger held by a holder who demands an appraisal
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor
provision) ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into Convertible
Preference Shares unless such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holder's right to such an appraisal.  If, after the Effective Time of the
Merger, such holder fails to perfect or loses any such right to an appraisal,
each such share of such holder shall be treated as a share that had been
converted as of the Effective Time of the Merger into one Convertible
Preference Share in accordance with the first sentence of this subsection.

     (e)     Stock Option Plans.  Triton Cayman shall assume all the rights
and obligations of Triton Delaware under the 1981 Employee Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan, 1985 Stock Option Plan, Amended and Restated 1986 Convertible
Debenture Plan, 1988 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, 1989 Stock Option Plan,
Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan and Amended and Restated
Restricted Stock Plan, as each such plan has been or may be amended to the
Effective Time of the Merger (collectively, the "Plans").  The outstanding
options or debentures assumed by Triton Cayman shall be exercisable or
convertible upon the same terms and conditions as under the Plans and the
agreements relating thereto immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, except that upon the exercise of such options or the conversion of
such debentures, Class A Shares shall be issuable in lieu of shares of Triton
Delaware Common Stock.  The number of Class A Shares issuable upon the
exercise of an option or the conversion of a debenture immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger and the option price of each such optionand
the conversion price of each such debenture shall be the option price and the
conversion price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger.  All options or debentures issued pursuant to the Plans after the
Effective Time of the Merger shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase, or
convert into, Class A Shares in accordance with the terms of the Plans.

     3.2     EQUITY UNIT ELECTION

     (a)     Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date referred to in
subsection (c) below, is a record holder of shares of Triton Delaware Common
Stock shall be entitled to make an Equity Unit Election with respect to any or
all of such person's shares (such shares thereby becoming Electing Shares,
subject to the provisions of this Section 3.2) on or prior to such Election
Date to receive a Receipt representing an Equity Unit consisting of one Class
B Share and 1/10th of one share of Triton Delaware Preferred Stock for each
Electing Share in lieu of such shares being automatically converted into Class
A Shares.  The Class B Share and 1/10th of one share of Triton Delaware
Preferred Stock contained in an Equity Unit may only be traded together as an
Equity Unit and will not be separately transferable.

     (b)     Prior to the mailing to the record holders of Triton Delaware
Common Stock as of the record date for the special meeting of stockholders of
Triton Delaware (the "Stockholders Meeting") of the Proxy Statement/Joint
Prospectus relating to the Stockholders Meeting (the "Proxy Statement"),
Triton Delaware shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the Equity Units.

     (c)     Triton Delaware shall prepare and mail a form of election (the
"Form of Election") with the Proxy Statement to the record holders of Triton
Delaware Common Stock as of the record date for the Stockholders Meeting,
which Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Triton
Delaware Common Stock who wishes to make an Equity Unit Election.  Triton
Delaware will use reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election and the
Proxy Statement available to all persons who become holders of Triton Delaware
Common Stock during the period between such record date and the Election Date
referred to below.  Any suchholder's election to receive Equity Units shall
have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its
designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day (the
"Election Date") next preceding the date of the Stockholders Meeting, a Form
of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by the stock
certificates representing such Electing Shares to which such Form of Election
relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in a form acceptable for transfer
on the books of Triton Delaware.

     (d)     Any Form of Election may be revoked by the stockholder submitting
it to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
(i) prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date or (ii) after
the date of the Proxy Statement, if (and to the extent that) the Exchange
Agent is legally required to permit revocations and the Effective Time of the
Merger shall not have occurred prior to such date.  In addition, all Forms of
Election shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in
writing by Triton Delaware that the Merger has been abandoned.  If a Form of
Election is revoked, the certificate or certificates representing the Electing
Shares to which such Form of Election relates shall be promptly returned to
the stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange Agent.

     (e)     The determination of the Exchange Agent as to whether or not the
Equity Unit Election has been properly made or revoked pursuant to this
Section 3.2 with respect to Electing Shares and when elections and revocations
were received by it shall be binding.  If the Exchange Agent determines that
any Equity Unit Election was not properly made with respect to shares of
Triton Delaware Common Stock, such shares shall be treated by the Exchange
Agent as shares which were not Electing Shares at the Effective Time of the
Merger, and such shares will be automatically converted into Class A Shares
pursuant to subsection (g) below.  The Exchange Agent shall also make all
computations as to the allocation and the proration contemplated by Section
3.2(f), and any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on the
holders of Electing Shares.  The Exchange Agent may, with the agreement of
Triton Delaware, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 3.2 for
the implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary
or desirable fully to effect such elections.

     (f)     (i) The maximum number (the "Maximum Election Number") of shares
of Triton Delaware Common Stock with respect to which Equity Unit Elections
can be made shall be 25% of the number of shares of Triton Delaware Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and
the minimum number (the "Minimum Election Number") of shares of Triton
Delaware Common Stock with respect to which Equity Unit Elections can be made
shall be 15% of the number of shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (such
limitations, the "Equity Unit Limitation").

     (ii)  If the number of Electing Shares exceeds the Maximum Election
Number, then such Electing Shares shall be automatically converted into Equity
Units and Class A Shares in accordance with the terms of subsection (g) below
in the following manner:

(I)  A proration factor (the "Proration Factor") shall be determined by
dividing the Maximum Election Number by the total number of Electing Shares.

     (II)  The number of Electing Shares covered by each Equity Unit Election
to be converted into Equity Units shall be determined by multiplying the
Proration Factor by the total number of Electing Shares covered by such Equity
Unit Election.

     (III)  All Electing Shares, other than those shares converted into Equity
Units in accordance with Section (f)(ii)(II), shall be converted into Class A
Shares as if such shares were not Electing Shares in accordance with the terms
of subsection (g) below.

     (iii)  If the number of Electing Shares is less than the Minimum Election
Number, no Class B Shares or Triton Delaware Preferred Stock will be issued
and all Electing Shares shall be converted into Class A Shares as if such
shares were not Electing Shares in accordance with the terms of subsection (g)
below.

     (iv)  If the number of Electing Shares is less than or equal to the
Maximum Election Number and greater than or equal to the Minimum Election
Number, then all Electing Shares shall be converted into Equity Units in
accordance with the terms of Section 3.1(c)(ii), and all shares of Triton
Delaware Common Stock other than Electing Shares shall be converted into Class
A Shares in accordance with the terms of Section 3.1(c)(i).

     (g)     If (i) the number of Electing Shares is less than the Minimum
Election Number, (ii) the Exchange Agent determines that any Equity Unit
Election was not properly made with respect to shares of Triton Delaware
Common Stock or (iii) the Electing Shares are prorated and only a portion of
the Electing Shares are converted into Equity Units, each such Electing Share
that is not automatically converted into Equity Units shall be treated by the
Exchange Agent as a share which was not an Electing Share at the Effective
Time of the Merger and shall be converted into one Class A Share.

     (h)     A portion of each stockholder's Triton Delaware Common Stock
exchanged for Equity Units in the Reorganization will be transferred to Triton
Delaware as consideration for the issuance of the Triton Delaware Preferred
Stock and the remaining portion of such Triton Delaware Common Stock so
exchanged will be transferred to Triton Cayman as consideration for the
issuance by Triton Cayman of the Class B Shares.  Allocation of the value of
the exchanged Triton Delaware Common Stock between the Triton Delaware
Preferred Stock and Class B Shares issued in exchange for such Triton Delaware
Common Stock shall be determined based on the respective fair market values of
the Triton Delaware Preferred Stock and the Class B Shares at the date of the
Reorganization.

     3.3     EXCHANGE OF STOCK

     (a)     Exchange Procedures.  Following the Effective Time of the Merger,
each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates theretofore
representing shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock (other than those
stockholders who elect to receive Equity Units in the Merger) may, but shall
not be required to, surrender the same to Triton Cayman for cancellation or
transfer, and each such holder or transferee will be entitled to receive
certificates representing the same number of Class A Shares as the shares of
Triton Delaware Common Stock previously represented by the stock certificates
surrendered.  Following the Effective Time of the Merger, receipts evidencing
depositary shares representing the Equity Units will be issued to holders of
Electing Shares, subject to Section 3.2, and certificates representing Class A
Shares will be issued to holders of Electing Shares to the extent that such
Electing Shares are not converted into Equity Units as provided in Section
3.2.  If any certificate representing Class A Shares is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the certificate theretofore representing Triton
Delaware Common Stock surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to
such issuance that the certificate surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
issuance shall either: (i) pay Triton Cayman or its agents any taxes or other
governmental charges required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing Class A Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the certificate so surrendered; or (ii) establish to the satisfaction of
Triton Cayman or its agents that such taxes or governmental charges have been
paid.  Until so surrendered or presented for transfer each outstanding
certificate which, prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, represented
Triton Delaware Common Stock shall be deemed and treated for all corporate
purposes to represent the ownership of the same number of Class A Shares as
though such surrender or transfer and exchange had taken place.

     (b)  No Further Ownership Rights in Triton Delaware Common Stock.  All
Class A Shares or Equity Units issued upon the surrender for exchange of
certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock theretofore represented by such
certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger which may have been declared or made by
Triton Delaware on such shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time of the Merger, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Triton Delaware Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.  If, after
the Effective Time of the Merger, certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
III, except as otherwise provided by law.


                                  ARTICLE IV

                   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PLANS

          At the Effective Time of the Merger, each employee benefit plan and
incentive compensation plan to which Triton Delaware is then a party shall be
assumed by, and continue to be the plan of, the Surviving Corporation.  To the
extent any employee benefit or incentive compensation plan of Triton Delaware
provides for the issuance or purchase of, or otherwise relates to, Triton
Delaware Common Stock, after the Effective Time of the Merger, such plan shall
be deemed to provide for the issuance or purchase of, or otherwise relate to,
Class A Shares.


                                  ARTICLE V

                             CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     5.1     CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE
MERGER

subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

     (a)     Stockholder Approval.  The Triton Delaware Stockholder Approval

     (b)     Form S-4.  The registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by Triton Delaware and Triton Cayman in
connection with the issuance of the Class A Shares, Equity Units consisting of
the Class B Shares and the Triton Delaware Preferred Stock in the Merger shall
have become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and shall
not be the subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order.


                                  ARTICLE VI

                      TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     6.1     TERMINATION

Cayman, other than the provisions of this Section 6.2 and Article VII.

          This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or

by the stockholders of Triton Delaware provided, however, that after any such

                         CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

                                      OF

                          TRITON ENERGY CORPORATION




                                  ARTICLE I.

          The name of the corporation is Triton Energy Corporation.


                                 ARTICLE II.

          The period of its duration is perpetual.


                                 ARTICLE III.

          The purposes of the corporation are to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware.


                                 ARTICLE IV.

          The aggregate number of shares which this corporation shall have
authority to issue is Two Hundred Five Million (205,000,000) shares consisting
of Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of Common Stock of the par value
of $0.01 per share and Five Million (5,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock of
the par value of $0.01 per share.

          The Preferred Stock may be divided into and issued into series.  If
the shares of any such class are to be issued in series, then each series
shall be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of
any such class and variations and the relative rights and preferences as
between different series can be fixed and determined by the Board of
Directors.  The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each
series shall include, without limitation thereto, the determination of any or
all of the following and the shares of each series may vary from the shares
of any other series in the following respects:

          The Board of Directors of this corporation is hereby authorized to
issue the Preferred Stock at any time and from time to time, in one (1) or
more series and for such consideration as may be fixed from time to time by
the Board of Directors, but not less than the par value thereof.  The number
of shares to comprise each such series, which number may be increased (but not
above the total number of authorized shares of the class except where
otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in creating such series) or
decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding), shall
be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  The Board of
Directors is hereby expressly authorized, before issuance of any shares of a
particular series, to determine any and all rights, preferences and
limitations pertaining to such series including but not limited to:

     (1)     Voting rights, if any, including without limitation, the
 authority to confer multiple votes per share, voting rights as to specified
 matters or issues such as mergers, consolidations or sales of assets, or
 voting rights to be exercised either together with holders of common stock as
 a single class, or independently as a separate class;

     (2)     Rights, if any, permitting the conversion or exchange of any such
 shares, at the option of the holder into any other class or series of shares
 of this corporation and the price or prices or the rates of exchange and any
 adjustment thereto at which such shares will be convertible or exchangeable;

     (3)     The rate (or method of determining the rate) of dividends, if
 any, payable on shares of such series, the conditions and the dates upon
 which such dividends shall be payable and whether such dividends shall be
 cumulative or non-cumulative;

     (4)     The amount payable on shares of such series in the event of any
 liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of this corporation;



<PAGE>
      (5)   Redemption, repurchase, retirement and sinking fund rights,
    preferences and limitations, if any, the amount payable on shares of such
    series in the event of such redemption, repurchase or retirement, the
    terms and conditions of any sinking fund, the manner of creating such fund
    or funds and whether any of the foregoing shall be cumulative or
    non-cumulative; and

      (6)  Any other preference and relative, participating, optional or other
    special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of shares
    of such series not fixed and determined herein, to the extent permitted to
    do so by law.

          All shares of Preferred Stock shall be of equal rank and shall be
identical, except with respect to the particulars that may be fixed by the
Board of Directors as above provided and as to the date from which dividends
thereon, if any, shall be cumulative if made cumulative by the Board of
Directors.

          No stockholder of the corporation will, solely by reason of holding
shares of any class, have any preemptive or preferential right to purchase or
subscribe for any shares of the corporation, now or hereafter to be
authorized, or any notes, debentures, bonds or other securities convertible
into or carrying warrants, rights or options to purchase shares of any class,
now or hereafter to be authorized, whether or not the issuance of any such
shares or such notes, debentures, bonds or other securities would adversely
affect the dividend, voting or any other rights of such stockholder.  The
Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of, and the corporation may
issue, shares of any class of the corporation, or any notes, debentures, bonds
or other securities convertible into or carrying warrants, rights or options
to purchase any such shares, without offering any shares of any class to the
existing holders of any class of stock of the corporation.  Any such
securities or additional shares of stock may be issued or disposed of by the
Board of Directors to such persons and on such terms as in its discretion may
be deemed advisable.

          At each election for directors every stockholder entitled to vote at
such election shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number
of shares owned by him for as many persons as there are directors to be
elected and for whose election he has a right to vote.  Cumulative voting, for
the election of directors or otherwise, is expressly prohibited.  Election of
directors need not be by ballot.  On all matters coming before the
stockholders, other than the election of directors, each share of issued and
outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote.

                                  ARTICLE V.

          The post office address of the corporation's registered office is
c/o Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, County of New
Castle, Delaware 19801, and the name of its registered agent at such address
is The Corporation Trust Company.

                                 ARTICLE VI.

          Subject to the rights of any series of Preferred Stock designated
pursuant to Article IV, the number of directors will be determined in
accordance with the Bylaws of the corporation.


                                 ARTICLE VII.

          To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware
as the same exist or may hereafter be amended, a director of the corporation
will not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.  Any repeal or modification of
this Article will not increase the personal liability of any director of the
corporation for any act or occurrence taking place before such repeal or
modification, or adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.  The
provisions of this Article shall not be deemed to limit or preclude
indemnification of a director by the corporation for any liability of a
director that has not been eliminated by the provisions of this Article.


                                ARTICLE VIII.

          The corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended, indemnify and advance expenses to any and all persons it has power
to indemnify and advance expenses to under such law from and against any and
all of the expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by
such law.  Such indemnification and advancement of expenses may be provided
pursuant to any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his director or officer capacity
and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, will continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent,
and will inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person.

<PAGE>

                                 ARTICLE IX.

          The corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

                                  ARTICLE X.


          The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or
repeal the Bylaws of the corporation or to adopt new Bylaws.
