TRUE NORTH COMMUNICATIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES LIST OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES
 
  The following consolidated financial statements of the Registrant and the
Independent Public Accountant's Report covering these financial statements,
appearing in the Registrant's 1994 Annual Report on pages 6 through 19 are
incorporated herein by reference in Item 8:
 
  Consolidated Balance Sheets--December 31, 1993 and 1994
 
  Consolidated Statements of Income--Years ended December 31, 1992, 1993 and
  1994
 
  Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity--Years ended December 31,
  1992, 1993 and 1994
 
  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows--Years ended December 31, 1992, 1993
  and 1994
 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--December 31, 1994
 
  All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not required under
the related instructions, or are inapplicable, or the information called for
therein is included elsewhere in the financial statements or related notes
thereto contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report.
Accordingly, such schedules have been omitted.

  Publicis Communication owns 51% of Publicis.FCB BV and 80% of Publicis
Conscel. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Publicis
Communication and Subsidiaries include the results of operations and financial
position of Publicis.FCB BV and Publicis Conscel.

  These financial statements have been prepared and audited based upon 
accounting and auditing standards and practices acceptable for external 
financial reporting purposes in France. These practices and standards can vary 
from U.S. accounting practice. Following is a reconciliation prepared by 
Registrant of reported net income to net income which would be reported under 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (amounts in thousands):

</TABLE> 

Notes:
1. Net income as reported was computed using the average exchange rates for the 
   year.
2. Certain elements of goodwill are charged directly to equity or income in the 
   year it arises, or are not otherwise amortized for French financial reporting
   purposes. The goodwill amortization expense adjustment was computed using 
   forty years as the estimated useful life for each of the related goodwill 
   components.
3. Under French generally accepted accounting principles, restructuring actions 
   taken in 1995 up to the date of the audit opinion must be recorded in the
   1994 financial statements. Application of EITF 94-3 to these financial
   statements result in this adjustment which, under U.S. generally accepted
   accounting principles, will result in a 1995 charge to earnings of an
   equivalent amount (allowing for currency exchange fluctuations). Of the total
   amount of this adjustment, $1,273 relates to management and staff severance
   actions taken in 1995, $1,637 relates to the 1995 abandonment of excess lease
   space, $472 relates to the 1995 closure of a sale promotion agency, and
   $2,374 relates to legal and other associated restructuring costs incurred in
   1995.
4. Under French generally accepted accounting principles, the utilization of tax
   credit carryforwards of acquired companies are reflected in earnings. Under
   U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, this amount is accounted for
   as a reduction of the initial purchase price and related goodwill.

       NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF 31/12/1994.


PREAMBLE:

The accounts of the FCA! Group, acquired in December 1993 are consolidated 
within Publicis Communication since January 1st 1994.

The economical restructuration of the FCA! Group carried out during the year 
1994 entailed:
- -   a combination of its French advertising agencies with those of Publicis 
    Conseil and of its media buying subsidiary with Publicis Centre Media;
- -   the insertion of its European activities within the BMZ network;
- -   in the USA, the merger of its subsidiary Bloom with Publicis New York.
These internal operations have no impact on the profit and loss account nor on 
the net equity of the Group.

The assessed Goodwill of the FCA! Group was immediately written-off against net 
equity as at December 31st, 1993.


I.  CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES.
    ------------------------

    PUBLICIS COMMUNICATION GROUP'S consolidated financial statements as at
    December 31, 1994 have been prepared in accordance with the French
    legislation and are in conformity with generally accepted international
    accounting principles.

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company's
    wholly owned and majority owned domestic and international subsidiaries. The
    subsidiary companies with less than 50% ownership are consolidated on an
    equity basis.

    The company translates the financial statements of its international 
    subsidiaries into French Francs using official exchange rates as of 
    December 31.


II. SUMMARY OF MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES.
    ------------------------------------

    COMPANIES CONSOLIDATED:
    ----------------------

    Since January 1st, 1994 the FCA! Group has been included within the Publicis
    Communication's scope of consolidation, after various mergers and
    restructurations. It is, therefore, very difficult and almost impossible to
    make a comparison with 1993 consolidated figures. However, on a constant
    basis, Publicis Communication's activities would have grown by 1%.
<PAGE>
 
GENERAL:
- -------

The accounting policies used as at December 31, 1994 are identical to those used
in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Publicis Group.


TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS:
- ------------------------------

Tangible assets are valued at cost and the depreciation is calculated according 
to the most suitable method in order to take into account the economical 
criteria. Listed below are the methods most currently used within the Publicis 
Communication Group:

Building                               :   20 years straightline
Leasehold property and improvements    :   10 years straightline
Furniture and Equipment                :   5-10 years straightline
Motor Vehicles                         :   4 years straightline

Premiums paid to acquire marketable leasehold property and the cost of acquired
goodwill are not amortized except in cases where the estimated market value is
considered to be inferior to the acquisition cost.


GOODWILL:
- --------

The excess costs over the net book value of subsidiaries, after reallocating
potential capital gains to the assets concerned, by their nature, are
considered:

 - on the one hand, to be intangible assets, justified by elements such as:
   market shares, trade marks, clients' lists, brands ... Usually they are not
   amortized. However, each year, a careful examination is made to determine
   their market value. If their market value is durably inferior to their
   acquisition cost, a provision for depreciation is made.

 - on the other hand, to be unidentified elements amortized over a maximum 
   period of 40 years.
 
In any case, all goodwill of small value are immediately depreciated at 100%.

The application of the Sapin Law to a full year period has strongly affected the
profitability of our Media buying activities, and could endanger the actual 
value of goodwill raised on these companies.

However, given that the long term effects of the Sapin Law are not completely 
known and that the restructuration steps taken up to now should improve this 
sector's future profitability, Media buying goodwill amounting to 50 million 
francs, has not been depreciated this year.
<PAGE>
 
Nevertheless, if this sector does not recover rapidly, we will have to register 
an exceptional depreciation of media buying goodwill.


WORK IN PROGRESS:
- ----------------

Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.


BILLINGS:
- --------

Since March 31, 1993, the Sapin Law has been changing the accounting principles 
applicable to Media Buying activities. In order to be able to show comparable 
Billings with last year and to be in line with the principles applied by our 
foreign competitors, our consolidated Media Revenues raised in France have been 
capitalised using the international multiple of 6,67.


RETIREMENT INDEMNITIES:
- ----------------------

FRENCH SUBSIDIARIES:
- -------------------

Retirement indemnities acquired by employees over 60 years of age appear, with 
their related social charges, in the provision for contingencies. The yearly 
movements in the provision for the retirement indemnities shown on the Balance 
Sheet are accounted for in the yearly expenses.

Probable retirement indemnities acquired by employees between 55 and 60 years of
age, with their related social charges, are shown in the Contingent Liabilities.

Probable retirement indemnities, acquired by employees under 55 years of age are
not taken into account due to the high turnover in our profession.

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES:
- --------------------

Retirement indemnities are accrued for in accordance with the laws and 
regulations specific to each country.


INCOME TAX:
- ----------

All actual and deferred Income Taxes payable are accounted for. Deferred Income 
Tax assets or potential fiscal credits are not recognised with the exception of 
a latent fiscal credit of 33-1/3% calculated on the provision for the French 
statutory profit sharing.

                             CABINET ROBERT MAZARS

We have examined the consolidated balance sheet of PUBLICIS COMMUNICATION and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and the related consolidated statements of 
income, stockholders' equity and changes in financial position for the year in 
the period ended December 31, 1994. These statements present a net equity (group
share) of 361.434.000 FF and a net income (group share) of 70.738.000 FF. Our 
examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards 
and, accordingly, include such tests of the accounting records and other
auditing procedures that we considered necessary in the circumstances.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly the 
financial position of PUBLICIS COMMUNICATION and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1994, and the result of their operations and the changes in their financial 
position for the year in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.
