ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

GENERAL

           Triton Energy Limited, a Cayman Islands company (the "Company"), is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Triton Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Triton  Delaware"),  an  international  oil  and  gas  exploration  company
primarily  engaged  in  exploration  and  production  through subsidiaries and
affiliates.  The Company was formed in August 1995 to permit the creation of a
holding  company  structure for Triton Delaware and has engaged in no business
since  its  formation.  Triton  Delaware  has  called a special meeting of its
stockholders  to be held on March 25, 1996 at which the stockholders will vote
on  the  proposed  reorganization  of Triton Delaware (the "Reorganization").
Pursuant  to  the  Reorganization, the Company would become the parent holding
company of Triton Delaware  through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of
the  Company  with  and  into  Triton  Delaware.    If  the  Reorganization is
consummated,  Triton  Delaware will become a subsidiary of the Company and the
Company  will  continue  to  conduct  the businesses (through subsidiaries and
affiliates)  in  which Triton Delaware is now engaged.  The Company and Triton
Delaware  have  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission a Proxy
Statement/Joint  Prospectus  dated  as  of  February  23, 1996 relating to the
special  meeting  and  the  securities  to  be issued if the Reorganization is
consummated.    Triton  Delaware's  principal  properties  and  operations are
located  in  Colombia  and Malaysia-Thailand. Triton Delaware also has oil and
gas  interests  in other Latin American and Asian countries, Europe, Australia
and North America.

          Triton Delaware was incorporated in Texas in 1962 and reincorporated
in Delaware in 1995.  The Company's principal executive offices are located at
Caledonian  House,  Mary  Street,  P.  O. Box 1043, George Town, Grand Cayman,
Cayman Islands.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

                The Company has no significant properties and has conducted no
business since its inception.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

          Omitted pursuant to General Instruction J(2) of Form 10-K.

                                   PART II

ITEM  5.   MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
           MATTERS

           All of the Company's common equity is held by Triton Delaware.  The
Company has never paid dividends on its common equity.

           If the Reorganization is consummated, each outstanding share of
Common  Stock  of  Triton Delaware at the effective time of the Reorganization
(the  "Effective  Time")  (other than shares held in treasury and shares as to
which an election to receive Equity Units (as defined below) has been made and
not withdrawn, subject to certain limitations) will be automatically converted
into  one  Class A Ordinary Share of the Company. Holders of not less than 15%
but  not  more  than 25% of the outstanding shares of Triton Delaware's Common
Stock  at  the  Effective  Time,  in  the aggregate, may make an unconditional
election  to  receive an equity unit ("Equity Unit") consisting of one Class B
Ordinary  Share  of  the  Company  and one-tenth of one share of participating
preferred  stock of Triton Delaware for each share of  Common Stock of Triton
Delaware owned  in  lieu of such shares being converted into Class A Ordinary
Shares.  Each  such  Class  B  Ordinary  Share  and  one-tenth  of  a share of
participating  preferred  stock  would  be paired and after such pairing could
only  be  traded  together  as  a  unit.  If  holders  of less than 15% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock of Triton Delaware, in the aggregate, elect
to  receive  Equity  Units, no Equity Units will be issued and all such shares
would  be automatically converted into Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company.
The  Class  A  Ordinary  Shares have been approved for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange under the  symbol "OIL," the same symbol under which the Common
Stock  of  Triton Delaware is currently listed, and the Equity Units have been
approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "OIL.B."

ITEM 6.     SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

            Omitted pursuant to General Instruction (J)(2) of Form 10-K.  The
Company has conducted no business since its inception.

ITEM  7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
            RESULTS OF OPERATION.

             Omitted pursuant to General Instruction (J)(2) of Form 10-K.  The
Company  has  conducted  no  business  since its inception in August 1995.  In
November  1995,  Triton  Delaware  solicited the consent of the holders of its
publicly  issued  notes  to  certain  amendments to the indentures pursuant to
which  such  notes  were issued.  Such amendments included a provision for the
issuance  of  guarantees by the Company of Triton Delaware's obligations under
the  notes  in  the  event  a  transaction  such  as  the  Reorganization were
consummated.

                            NOTES TO BALANCE SHEET

1.     GENERAL

Triton Energy Limited (formerly named TC Holdings Limited, "Triton Cayman"), a
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Triton Energy Corporation ("Triton Delaware"), a
Delaware  Corporation,  was  incorporated on August 23, 1995 under the laws of
the  Cayman  Islands.  Triton Cayman was formed to become the ultimate holding
company  of  Triton  Delaware if the Board of Directors of Triton Delaware and
the stockholders of Triton Delaware approve such transaction.  Triton Delaware
is  an  international  oil  and  gas  exploration company primarily engaged in
exploration  and  production  through  subsidiaries  and  affiliates.   Triton
Delaware's  principal  properties  and  operations are located in Colombia and
Malaysia-Thailand.    Triton  Delaware also has oil and gas interests in other
Latin American and Asian countries, Europe, Australia and North America.

Triton  Cayman  had no operations from the date of incorporation on August 23,
1995 to December 31, 1995.

2.     TAXATION

Under  current  Cayman  Islands  law, Triton Cayman is not required to pay any
Cayman  Islands  taxes  on  either income or capital gains.  Triton Cayman has
applied  for  and  expects  to  receive  an  Undertaking as to Tax Concessions
Certificate to be issued by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to the provisions
of the Tax Concessions Law which would provide that Triton Cayman would not be
subject to any future income or capital gains taxes which may be imposed for a
period of twenty years beginning on the date of the Undertaking.
