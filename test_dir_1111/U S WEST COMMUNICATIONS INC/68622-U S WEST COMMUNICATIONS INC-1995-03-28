                                 PART I 

   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 

   General 

   U S WEST Communications, Inc. (the "Company") is incorporated 
   under the laws of the State of Colorado and has its principal  
   offices at 1801  California Street, Denver, Colorado, 80202,  
   telephone number (303) 896-3099.  The Company is an indirect, 
   wholly owned subsidiary of U S WEST, Inc. ("U S WEST"). 

   The Company was formed January 1, 1991, when Northwestern Bell 
   Telephone Company ("Northwestern Bell") and Pacific Northwest 
   Bell Telephone Company ("Pacific Northwest Bell") were merged 
   into The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company  
   ("Mountain Bell"), which simultaneously changed its name to  
   U S WEST Communications, Inc. U S WEST acquired ownership of  
   Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell on  
   January 1, 1984, when American Telephone and Telegraph Company 
   ("AT&T") transferred its ownership interests in these three
   wholly-owned operating telephone companies to U S WEST.  This 
   divestiture was made pursuant to a court approved consent decree  
   entitled the Modification of Final Judgment ("MFJ"), which arose 
   out of an antitrust action brought by the United States 
   Department of Justice against AT&T. 

   Company Operations 

       The Company provides telecommunications services in the 
   states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, 
   Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, 
   Washington and Wyoming (the "14  state region").  The Company  
   serves approximately  80% of the population in these states and
   approximately 40% of the land area.  At December 31, 1994, the 
   Company had approximately 14,336,000 telephone network access 
   lines in service, a 3.6% increase over year end 1993.  (4.0% 
   growth excluding the effects of the sale of 60,000 lines in rural 
   telephone exchanges.) 
        
       Under the terms of the MFJ, the 14 state region was divided 
   into 29 geographical areas called local access and transport 
   areas ("LATAs") with each LATA generally centered on a 
   metropolitan area or other identifiable community of interest.  
   The principal types of telecommunications services offered by the 
   Company are (i) local service, (ii) intraLATA long-distance  
   service and (iii) exchange access service (which connects  
   customers to the facilities of interLATA service providers).  
   For the year ended December 31, 1994, local service, exchange 
   access service and intraLATA long distance service accounted for  
   45%, 33% and 15%, respectively, of the sales and other revenues 
   of the Company.  In 1994, revenues from a single customer, AT&T,  
   accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's sales and other 
   revenues. 

   Research and Development 

       The Company recognized $23, $42 and $55 for research and 
   development expense in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.   
   Approximately half of this activity was conducted at Bell 
   Communications Research, Inc., one-seventh of which is owned by
   Company.

   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued) 

   Regulation 

       The Company is subject to varying degrees of regulation by 
   state commissions with respect to intrastate rates and service,  
   and access charge tariffs.  Under traditional rate of return 
   regulation, intrastate rates are generally set on the basis of  
   the amount of revenues needed to produce an authorized rate of 
   return (refer to page 9 of Management's Discussion). 
        
       The Company has sought alternative forms of regulation 
   ("AFOR") plans which provide for competitive parity, enhanced  
   pricing flexibility and improved capability in bringing to market 
   new products and services.  In a number of states where AFOR 
   plans have been adopted, such actions have been accompanied by
   requirements to refund revenues, reduce existing rates or upgrade 
   service, any of which could have adverse short-term effects on 
   earnings.  Similar agreements may have resulted under traditional 
   rate of return regulation (refer to page 18 of Management's 
   Discussion). 

       The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the 
   Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") with respect to 
   interstate access tariffs (that specify the charges for the  
   origination and termination of interstate communications) and
   other matters.  The Company's interstate services have been 
   subject to price cap regulation since January 1991.  Price caps 
   are a form of incentive regulation and, ostensibly, limit prices  
   rather than profits.  However, the FCC's price cap plan includes 
   sharing of earnings in excess of authorized levels with 
   interexchange carriers.  The Company believes that competition 
   will ultimately be the determining factor in pricing telecom-
   munications services.  In January 1994, the FCC announced that it 
   will begin reviewing its current form of regulation. 

   Competition 

       Historically, communications, entertainment and information 
   services were provided by different companies in different 
   industries.  The convergence of these technologies is changing 
   both the competitive environment and the way the Company does 
   business.  This convergence, which is being fueled by techno-
   logical advances, will lead to more intense competition from 
   companies with which the Company has not historically competed. 

       The Company's principal current competitors are competitive 
   access providers ("CAPs").  Competition from CAPs is currently 
   limited to providing large business customers (with high-volume  
   traffic) private line access to the facilities of interexchange 
   carriers.  AT&T's entrance into the cellular communications 
   market through its  acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications,  
   Inc. may create increased competition in local exchange as well 
   as cellular services.  The loss of local exchange customers to  
   competitors would affect multiple revenue streams, including 
   those related to local and access services, and long distance 
   network services, and could have a material, adverse effect on 
   the Company's operations. 

       In addition to CAPs and providers of wireless services, a 
   major potential source of future competition includes cable 
   television companies which may offer telecommunications and  
   other information services in addition to existing video 
   services.

   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued) 

   Competition (continued) 

   Competition from long distance companies continues to erode the 
   Company's market share of intraLATA long distance services such 
   as WATS and "800."  These revenues have declined over the last  
   several years as customers have migrated to interexchange 
   carriers that have the ability to offer these services on both an
   intraLATA and interLATA basis.  The Company is prohibited from 
   providing interLATA long distance services. 

       The actions of state and federal public policymakers will 
    play an important role in determining how increased competition  
    affects the Company.  The Company is working with regulators and 
    legislators to help ensure that public policies keep pace with 
    our rapidly changing industry and allow the Company to bring new
    services to the marketplace. 

       The Company supports regulatory reform.  It is increasingly 
    apparent that the legal and regulatory framework under which the 
    Company operates, which includes restrictions on equipment 
    manufacturing, prohibitions on cross-ownership of cable 
    television by telephone companies and restrictions on the  
    transport of communications, entertainment and information 
    across LATA boundaries, limits both competition and consumer 
    choice.  The Company believes that it is in the public interest 
    to lift these restrictions  and to place all competitors under 
    the same rules to ensure the industry's technological develop-
    ment and long-term financial health. 

    Competitive Strategy 

       The Company intends to implement its competitive strategy by 
    focusing on three key objectives: 1) business growth through the 
    development of broadband networks; 2) customer loyalty through 
    continuous improvement in customer service; and 3) improved 
    productivity through systems re-engineering and other cost 
    controls.

    ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES 

    The properties of the Company do not lend themselves to 
    description by character and location of principal units.  At  
    December 31, 1994, the percentage distribution of total net 
    telephone plant by major category for the Company was as
    follows:

              c.  Land and buildings (occupied 
                  principally by central offices) .....          14%

              d.  General equipment and vehicles ......          10%

              e.  Miscellaneous equipment and inside 
                  wiring (substantially all of which 
                  are on the premises of customers) ...           1%

    </TABLE>

    At December 31, 1994, substantially all of the installations of  
    central office equipment were located in buildings owned by the 
    Company situated on land which it owns in fee, while many 
    garages, and administrative and business offices were in leased 
    quarters.

    Total investment in telephone plant increased to $29.4 billion 
    at December 31, 1994, from $28.0 billion at December 31, 1993, 
    after giving effect to retirements, but before deducting 
    accumulated depreciation.  The Company's 1994 capital
    expenditures of $2.5 billion were substantially devoted to the  
    continued modernization of telephone plant, including 
    investments in fiber optic cable, to improve customer services 
    and network productivity.  1995 capital expenditures are
    anticipated to be $2.1 billion and the majority of these are  
    expected to be financed through internally generated funds.

    ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

    With respect to lawsuits, proceedings and other claims pending 
    at year-end, it is the opinion of management that after final 
    disposition, any monetary liability or financial impact to the 
    Company beyond that provided at year-end, would not be material 
    to the consolidated financial position of the Company.

    The Company's volume growth resulted in a normalized increase 
    in net income of $101 or 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 
    1994, compared with the same period last year.  Net income in 
    1994 was normalized for a gain of $51 on the sale of certain  
    rural telephone exchanges.  For 1993, normalizing items 
    include the restructuring charge of $534 (after tax), the  
    federally mandated income tax increase of $54 and the 1993   
    extraordinary charges of $3,041 for the discontinuance of  
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71,
    and $77 for the early extinguishment of debt. 

    Volume growth also resulted in a 7.4 percent increase in 
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
    amortization and other ("EBITDA"), also excluding the 1993
    restructuring charge.  The Company believes EBITDA is an 
    important indicator of the operational strength of the 
    business.

    OPERATING REVENUES 

    Total operating revenues were $8,998, a $342 or 4.0% increase 
    over the prior year. In the tables below, price changes 
    primarily represent the aggregate effects of price changes  
    resulting from regulatory proceedings and growth represents
    increased market penetration (through increased access lines and  
    additional sales of products and services to existing 
    customers).  Different regulatory commissions govern the 
    interstate and intrastate jurisdictions, resulting in varying 
    price and refund impacts.

    Local service revenues include local telephone exchange, local 
    private line and public telephone services.  The increase in 
    local service revenues was primarily attributable to access line  
    growth, which exceeded 5 percent in the states of Arizona, 
    Colorado, Idaho and Utah.

    Access Charges 

    Access charges are collected primarily from the interexchange  
    carriers for their use of the local exchange network.  For 
    interstate access services, there is also a fee collected  
    directly from telephone customers.  Approximately 35 percent of
    access revenues and 13 percent of total revenues are derived 
    from providing access service to AT&T.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    </TABLE>
       An increase of 7.8 percent in interstate billed access 
    minutes of use more than offset the effects of price decreases.  
    Interstate price reductions have been phased in by the Federal 
    Communications Commission ("FCC") over a number of years.  In 
    response to competitive pressure and FCC orders, the Company 
    reduced its annual interstate access prices by approximately  
    $40 during 1994, in addition to $60, effective July 1, 1993.  
    The Company believes access prices will continue to decline, 
    whether mandated by the FCC or as a result of an increasingly 
    competitive market for access services.

    Intrastate access charges increased primarily as a result of 
    higher demand. Intrastate minutes of use grew by 13 percent in  
    1994.  Demand for private line services, for which revenues are 
    generally not usage-sensitive, also increased.

    </TABLE>
    Long-distance network service ("long-distance") revenues are 
    derived from calls made within the Company's service area  
    boundaries, commonly referred to as "LATAs." The effects of  
    competition continue to impact long-distance revenues. 
    Long-distance revenues decreased principally due to the effects  
    of multiple toll carrier plans implemented in Oregon and 
    Washington in May and July  1994, respectively.  These 
    regulatory arrangements allow independent telephone companies
    to act as toll carriers.  The impact in 1994 was a decrease in  
    long-distance revenue of $68, partially offset by an increase of 
    $10 in intrastate access revenue and a decrease of $48 in access  
    fees (otherwise paid to independent companies).  These 
    regulatory arrangements decreased net income by approximately
    $6 in 1994 and will decrease 1995 net income by $10 to $12. 

    Other Services 

    Other services revenues are derived from billing and collection 
    services provided to interexchange carriers, and new services  
    such as voice messaging.  The 8.6 percent increase in 1994 was  
    due to higher revenue from these billing and collection 
    services, and continued market penetration of new service 
    offerings.

    OPERATING EXPENSES 

    Total operating expenses were $6,848, a $146 or 2.2% increase 
    over the same period last year, excluding the 1993 restructuring 
    charge.

    OPERATING EXPENSES (continued) 
        
    Employee-related costs include basic salaries and wages, 
    overtime, contract labor, benefits (including pension and health 
    care) and payroll taxes.  Higher costs of approximately $90 were  
    a result of additional overtime payments, contract labor, and  
    basic salaries and wages, all related to the implementation of  
    customer service and streamlining initiatives.  A pension credit 
    reduction of $66 resulted from a change in actuarial 
    assumptions, including decreases in the discount rate and the  
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  Partially 
    offsetting these increases were the effects of employees leaving  
    the Company under the restructuring program, lower health-care 
    benefit costs including a reduction in the accrual for post-
    retirement benefits and lower incentive compensation payments
    to employees. 

    During the  summer of 1994, increased customer demand put 
    additional stress on current processes and systems, and affected  
    the quality of service in certain markets.  The pace of the  
    Company's restructuring program also contributed to quality of 
    service issues.  However, the issues pertaining to quality of 
    service underscore the need to re-engineer the business.  The 
    Company achieved target levels of service at year end by  
    implementing customer service initiatives and slowing the pace 
    of its restructuring program.  To continue improving upon the
    level of service quality achieved by year-end 1994, the Company 
    will incur additional near-term costs for temporary employees, 
    overtime and contract labor.  The Company will also stretch out  
    its 1993 restructuring plan an additional year, to  1997.  As a  
    result of these actions, the annual benefits related to 
    restructuring will not be fully realized until 1998 (see 
    "Restructuring Charges"). 

    Other operating expenses include access charges, network 
    software expenses, cost of services and products provided by  
    affiliates, and other administrative expenses.  Contributing to  
    the increase in other operating expenses were additional network  
    software expenses and advertising costs incurred for the 
    increased deployment of new products and expansion of markets 
    for existing products.  The increase was partially offset by the  
    $48 reduction in access expense related to the effects of the  
    multiple toll carrier plan (see "Long-Distance Network 
    Service"). 
        
    The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was 
    primarily a result of a higher depreciable asset base and 
    increased depreciation rates.  The Company's discontinuance of 
    SFAS No. 71 in September 1993 has resulted in the use of shorter 
    asset lives to more closely reflect the economic lives of 
    telephone plant.  The Company continues to pursue improved 
    capital recovery within the regulated environment. 

    INTEREST AND OTHER 

    Interest expense decreased in 1994 due to the effects of a debt  
    refinancing program in 1993 and a reclassification of 
    capitalized interest.  Pursuant to the discontinuance of SFAS  
    No. 71, interest capitalized as a component of telephone plant 
    construction is now being reflected as an offset to interest 
    expense, rather than as an income component of other income 
    (expense).

    INTEREST AND OTHER (continued) 
        
    Other expense increased over the same period last year due to 
    the reclassification of capitalized interest to interest expense 
    in 1994. 

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 

    The increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from 
    the effects of discontinuing SFAS No. 71, an increase in 1994 
    income before income taxes and the 1993 restructuring charge.  
    Partially offsetting these increases is the cumulative effect on 
    deferred income taxes from the 1993 federally mandated increase  
    in income taxes. 
        
    RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 

    The Company's 1993 results reflect an $880 million restructuring 
    charge (pretax).  The related restructuring plan (the "Plan") is 
    designed to provide faster, more responsive customer services 
    while reducing the costs of providing these services.  As part 
    of the Plan, the Company is developing new systems that will 
    enable it to monitor networks to  reduce the risk of service  
    interruptions, activate telephone service on demand, provide 
    automated inventory systems and centralize its service centers 
    so that customers can have their telecommunications needs  
    resolved with one phone call.  The Company is consolidating its 
    existing 560 customer service centers into 26 centers in 10 
    cities and reducing its total work force by approximately 9,000  
    employees (including the remaining employee reductions pursuant 
    to the restructuring plan announced in 1991). 

    Implementation of the Plan is expected to extend into 1997, 
    rather than being completed in 1996 as originally scheduled.  
    Implementation schedules are driven by customer demand and  
    related service issues, concerns with system stability as major  
    customer impacting systems are integrated, and staffing 
    agreements negotiated with the Company's unions.  These changes 
    do not alter the Company's plan to fundamentally re-engineer the  
    way it conducts business in the emerging competitive 
    environment.  The total cash expenditures of $880 under the Plan
    remain unchanged.

    (1) The Plan also provides for capital expenditures of $440 over 
        the life of the restructuring plan.  In 1994, capital 
        expenditures related to restructuring were $265. 
    </FN>
    </TABLE>
    Employee separation costs include severance payments, health-
    care coverage and postemployment education benefits.  Systems  
    development costs include the replacement of existing, single-
    purpose systems with new systems designed to provide integrated, 
    end-to-end customer service.  The work-force reductions would
    not be possible without the development and installation of the 
    new systems, which will eliminate the current, labor-intensive 
    interfaces between existing processes.  Real estate  costs 
    include preparation costs for the new service centers.  The
    relocation and retraining costs are related to moving employees 
    to the new service centers and retraining  employees on the 
    methods and systems required in the new, restructured mode of 
    operation. 

    The Company estimates that full implementation of the Plan will 
    reduce employee-related expenses by approximately $400 per year.  
    These savings are expected to be offset by the effects of 
    inflation.

    Systems Development 

    The Company's existing information management systems were 
    largely developed to support analog technology in a monopoly  
    environment.  These systems are increasingly inadequate due to 
    the effects of increased competition, new forms of regulation  
    and changing technology that have driven consumer demand for 
    new services that can be delivered quickly, reliably and 
    economically.  The sequential systems currently in  place are 
    slow, labor-intensive and costly to maintain, and often cannot  
    be adapted to support new product and service offerings, 
    including future multimedia services envisioned by U S WEST. 
        
    The systems re-engineering program in place involves development 
    of new systems for the following core processes: 

         Service delivery - to support service on demand for all  
    products and services, including repair.  These systems will  
    permit one customer service representative to handle all facets 
    of a customer's requirements as contrasted to the numerous 
    points of customer interface required today. 

         Service assurance - for performance monitoring from one  
    location and remote testing in the new environment, including 
    identification and resolution of faults prior to customer 
    impact, and one-system dispatch environment. 

         Capacity provisioning - for integrated planning of future 
    network capacity, including the installation of software 
    controllable service components.

    </TABLE>
    Original estimates of system expenditures in 1995 and 1996 were 
    $140 and $115, respectively.  Though current estimates in total 
    are not materially different, the timing and amount of 
    expenditures by category has changed. 
        
    The majority of systems development labor will be supplied 
    through the use of temporary employees, contractors and new  
    employees with special skills.  While it is likely that a small 
    number of the new employees will be retained after completion of  
    the Plan due to their specialized skills, it is planned that 
    any related increase in headcount will be offset through other 
    employee reductions. 
        
    Systems expenses charged to current operations consist of all  
    costs associated with the information management function, 
    including planning, developing, testing and maintaining data  
    bases for general purpose computers, in addition to systems 
    costs related to maintenance of telephone network applications.   
    The key related administrative (i.e. general purpose) systems 
    include customer service, order entry, billing and collection, 
    accounts payable, payroll, human resources and property records.   
    Ongoing systems costs comprised approximately six percent of
    total operating expenses in 1994, 1993 and 1992.  The Company  
    expects systems costs charged to current operations as a percent 
    of total operating expenses to approximate the current level 
    throughout the life of the  Plan.  However, systems costs could  
    increase relative to other operating costs as the business 
    becomes more technology dependent.

    </TABLE>
    The Company anticipated Plan expenditures of approximately $421 
    in 1994.  However, the Company slowed the  pace of its 
    re-engineering implementation to address issues pertaining to 
    the quality of service. 

    The Company's 1991 restructuring plan included a pretax charge  
    of $240 due to planned work-force reductions of approximately 
    6,000 employees.  All expenditures and work-force reductions 
    associated with the 1991 plan were completed by the end of 1994. 

    OTHER ITEMS 

    Federal Regulatory Issues 

    In January 1995, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in  
    San Francisco upheld the June 15, 1994, Seattle Federal District  
    Court ruling that affirmed U S WEST's challenge to the  
    constitutionality of the telephone company video programming 
    restriction in the 1984 Cable Act.  The act prevents telephone  
    companies from providing video programming within their regions.  
    U S WEST argued, and the courts agreed, that the restriction 
    violates its First Amendment right to  free speech.  The 
    decision would allow the Company to provide video programming 
    directly to its regional telephone subscribers.  The Federal 
    Government can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Company 
    is evaluating its options in light of this ruling.  In January 
    1995, the FCC instituted a proceeding to modify and promulgate 
    rules on the provision of video programming. 

    In January 1995, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 
    District of Columbia overruled the  FCC's "range-of-rates" 
    decision.  This FCC decision permitted non-dominant carriers to 
    file ranges for rates, rather than specific price points.  The 
    Court of Appeals held that the Communications Act requires all
    carriers to specify prices on their tariffs.  The effect of this 
    decision will be to require non-dominant carriers (like  MCI, 
    or Time Warner's Full Service Network) to file tariffs with 
    considerably more price detail.

    Federal Regulatory Issues (continued) 

    In October 1994, the 9th  U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
    overruled the FCC's Computer III non-structural separation 
    decision for the provision of enhanced services on an integrated  
    basis.  The effect of the decision is to return to the provision 
    of such service through a separate subsidiary, which could make 
    it more difficult for local exchange carriers to offer enhanced 
    services.  In January 1995, the FCC granted a waiver for the 
    continued provision of enhanced services, pending further 
    proceedings by the FCC. 

    In August 1994, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the  
    District of Columbia upheld an FCC ruling that neither telephone  
    companies nor customer programmers need to obtain a franchise  
    from local governments to provide Video Dial Tone ("VDT") 
    service.  The decision means that local telephone companies will 
    avoid additional franchise fees related to the provisioning of 
    VDT services. 

    In June 1994, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District  
    of Columbia overturned the FCC's requirement that local 
    telephone companies allow physical collocation by third parties 
    (competitive access providers), within their central offices, 
    for the installation and operation of equipment that connects to 
    the local telephone network.  The decision essentially affirms 
    the private property rights of corporations.  The court also  
    ordered the FCC to reconsider its requirement that allows 
    competitors to interconnect equipment to the local network
    from a point outside a central office.  In light of the rulings,  
    the Company is evaluating how it can provide future inter-
    connection services. 

    On June 20, 1994, the seven regional Bell operating companies 
    ("RBOCs") asked the divestiture court for a waiver of the 
    Court's restriction on the RBOCs' provision of wireless long-
    distance services.  The consent decree restricts the RBOCs from
    providing long-distance services as well as manufacturing.  The 
    request for a waiver closely follows a recommendation by the 
    Department of Justice that the RBOCs be allowed to provide 
    wireless long-distance services. 

    The FCC has adopted a regulatory structure known as "Open  
    Network Architecture" ("ONA"), under which the Company is 
    required to unbundle its telephone network services in a manner 
    that will accommodate the service needs of the growing number
    of information service providers.  Under ONA, the number of 
    local exchange service competitors could increase significantly. 

    The Company's interstate services have been subject to price cap 
    regulation since January 1991.  Price caps are a form of 
    incentive regulation designed to limit prices rather than 
    profits.  The price cap plan is currently under review by the
    FCC.

    State Regulatory Issues 

    The Company has sought alternative forms of regulation ("AFOR") 
    plans that provide for competitive  parity, enhanced pricing  
    flexibility and improved capability in bringing to market new 
    products and services.  In a number of states where AFOR plans  
    have been adopted, such actions have been accompanied by 
    agreements to refund revenues, reduce existing rates or upgrade 
    service, any of which could have adverse short-term effects on 
    earnings.  Similar results may have occurred under traditional 
    rate of return regulation.  In addition to the FCC price cap 
    plan, the Company has AFOR plans in the states of Colorado, 
    Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon and South 
    Dakota. 

       There are pending regulatory actions in local regulatory  
    jurisdictions that call for price decreases, refunds or both.  
    In one such instance, the Utah Supreme Court has remanded a Utah 
    Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to the PSC for 
    reconsideration, thereby establishing certain exceptions to the 
    rule against retroactive ratemaking: 1) unforeseen and 
    extraordinary events, and 2) misconduct. The PSC's initial order 
    denied a refund request from an interexchange carrier and other 
    parties that relates to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  This case 
    is still in the discovery process.  If a formal filing -- made 
    in accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court -- alleges 
    that the exceptions apply, the range of possible risk is $0 to 
    $140. 

    Interest Rate Risk Management 

    The Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in  
    interest rates.  Derivative financial instruments are used by  
    the Company to manage these risks.  The objective of the 
    Company's interest rate risk management program is to minimize  
    the total cost of debt.  To meet this objective the Company uses 
    risk-reducing and risk-adjusting strategies.  Interest rate 
    forward contracts were used in 1993 to reduce the debt issuance 
    risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Interest rate  
    swaps are used to adjust the risks of the debt portfolio on a 
    consolidated basis by varying the ratio of fixed- to floating-
    rate debt.  The market value of the debt portfolio and its 
    risk-adjusting derivative instruments are monitored and compared 
    to predetermined benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
    risk management program. 

    In 1993, the Company refinanced $2.7 billion of callable debt 
    with new lower-cost fixed-rate debt.  The Company achieved an 
    annual interest expense reduction of approximately $35 as a  
    result of this refinancing.  In conjunction with the 
    refinancing, the Company executed forward contracts to sell U.S.   
    Treasury securities to reduce debt issuance risks and to lock in 
    the cost of $1.5 billion of the future debt issue.  At December  
    31, 1994, deferred credits of $8 and deferred charges of $51 on 
    closed interest rate forward contracts are included as part of 
    the carrying value of the underlying debt.  The deferred credits 
    and charges are being recognized  as a yield adjustment over the  
    life of the debt, which matures at various dates through 2043.  
    The net deferred charge is directly offset by the lower coupon 
    rate achieved on the new debt.

    Notional amounts on interest rate swaps outstanding at December 
    31, 1994, were $781 with various maturities that extend to 1999.   
    The estimated effect of the Company's interest rate derivative  
    transactions was to adjust the level of fixed-rate debt from 
    73.8 percent to 86.2 percent of the total debt portfolio.

    ITEM 8.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
             DATA

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

    To the Shareowner and Board of Directors of U S WEST 
    Communications, Inc.

    We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the
    consolidated financial statement schedules of U S WEST
    Communications, Inc. listed in the index on page 38 of this
    Form 10-K.  These financial statements and financial statement
    schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.
    Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and financial statement schedules based on our 
    audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
    auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and 
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
    audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that 
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of U S WEST Communications, Inc. as of
    December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
    accepted accounting principles.  In addition, in our opinion,
    the financial statement schedules referred to above, when 
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information required to be included therein.

    As discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company discontinued accounting for its
    operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types 
    of Regulation," in 1993.  As discussed in Note 13 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its
    method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than 
    pensions and other postemployment benefits in 1992.

                          U S  WEST COMMUNICATIONS,  INC. 
                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
                              (Dollars in millions) 

   NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

   BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The Consolidated Financial Statements 
   include the accounts of U S WEST Communications, Inc. and its  
   wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company").  The Company is an 
   indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of U S WEST, Inc.  The Company 
   was formed as a result of the January 1, 1991, merger of The 
   Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company, Northwestern 
   Bell Telephone Company and Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone 
   Company.  The merger was accounted for as a transfer of assets  
   among entities under common control similar to that of a pooling-
   of-interests. 

   In the third quarter of 1993, the Company discontinued accounting  
   for its operations under Statement of Financial Accounting 
   Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain 
   Types of Regulation."  Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to 
   Consolidated Financial Statements. 

   Certain reclassifications within the Consolidated Financial  
   Statements have been made to conform to the current year 
   presentation. 
        
   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  Cash and cash equivalents include  
   highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
   months or less which are readily convertible into cash and which 
   are not subject to significant risk resulting from changes in 
   interest rates. 
        
   MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES:  New and reusable materials are carried  
   principally at average cost, except for significant individual  
   items which are valued based on specific costs.  Non-reusable 
   material is carried at its estimated salvage value. 
        
   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: The investment in property, plant 
   and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.   
   Additions, replacements and substantial betterments are 
   capitalized.  Capitalized costs include applicable salaries and  
   employee benefits, materials, taxes and certain other items.  The
   cost of repairs and maintenance for property, plant and equipment  
   is charged to expense as incurred. 

   The Company's provision for depreciation of property, plant and 
   equipment is based on various straight-line group methods using  
   remaining useful (economic) lives based on industry-wide studies.  
   Prior to discontinuing SFAS No. 71, depreciation was based on 
   lives specified by regulatory commissions.  When depreciable 
   property, plant and equipment is retired or sold, the original  
   cost less the net salvage value is generally charged to 
   accumulated depreciation. 

   The Company capitalizes interest related to qualifying 
   construction projects and amortizes this cost over the remaining  
   service lives of the related assets.  Capitalized interest is 
   recorded as a reduction of interest expense.  Prior to the 
   Company's discontinuance of SFAS No. 71, capitalized interest 
   was recorded as an element of other expense.  Total amounts 
   capitalized by the Company were $36, $19 and $23 in 1994, 1993 
   and 1992, respectively. 
        
   REVENUE RECOGNITION: Local telephone service revenues are 
   generally billed monthly in  advance.  These revenues are   
   recognized when services are provided.  Nonrecurring and usage  
   sensitive revenues derived from installation, exchange access 
   and long distance services are billed and recognized monthly as 
   services are provided.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
                              (Dollars in millions) 

   NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  Net interest income or expense on 
   interest rate swaps is recognized over the life of the swaps as 
   an adjustment to interest expense.  Gains and losses on forward 
   contracts, designated as hedges of interest rate exposure on debt  
   refinancings, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to  
   interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. 
       
   COMPUTER SOFTWARE:  The cost of computer software, whether 
   purchased or developed internally, is charged to expense with two 
   exceptions.  Initial operating system software is capitalized and 
   amortized over the life of the related hardware, and initial 
   network applications software is capitalized and amortized over  
   three years.  Subsequent upgrades to capitalized software are  
   expensed.  Capitalized computer software of $146 and $148 at  
   December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively is recorded in property,  
   plant and equipment.  The Company amortized capitalized computer 
   software costs of $86, $51 and $24 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, 
   respectively. 
       
   INCOME  TAXES:  The provision for income taxes consists of an 
   amount for taxes currently payable and an amount for tax 
   consequences deferred to future periods in accordance with SFAS  
   No. 109.  The Company implemented SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for  
   Income Taxes," in 1993.  Adoption of the new standard did not
   have a material effect on the financial position or results of  
   operations, primarily because of the Company's earlier adoption 
   of SFAS No. 96. 

   For financial statement purposes, investment tax credits are 
   being amortized over the economic lives of the related property, 
   plant and equipment in accordance with the deferred method of 
   accounting for such credits. 

   NOTE 2: MAJOR CUSTOMER 

   The Company provides network access services to interexchange  
   carriers, the largest volume of which is provided to AT&T.  
   During 1994, 1993 and 1992, billings for all services to AT&T 
   approximated $1,130, $1,159 and $1,191, respectively.  The 
   decreases are primarily due to price decreases prescribed by the  
   Federal Communications Commission ("FCC").  Related accounts 
   receivable at December 31, 1994 and 1993, totaled $98 and $97, 
   respectively.

   NOTE 3: CONTINGENCIES 

   There are pending regulatory actions in local regulatory  
   jurisdictions that call for price  decreases, refunds or both.   
   In one such instance, the Utah Supreme Court has remanded a Utah 
   Public Service Commission ("PSC") order to the PSC for 
   reconsideration, thereby establishing certain exceptions to the 
   rule against retroactive ratemaking:  1) unforeseen and 
   extraordinary events, and 2) misconduct.  The PSC's initial order 
   denied a refund request from an interexchange carrier and other 
   parties that relates to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  This case is 
   still in the discovery process.  If a formal filing -- made in  
   accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court -- alleges that 
   the exceptions apply, the range of possible risk is $0 to $140.

   NOTE 4: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

   The Company purchases various services, as noted, from affiliated 
   companies.  The amount paid by the Company for these services is 
   determined in accordance with FCC and state cost allocation 
   rules, which prescribe various cost allocation methodologies that 
   are dependent upon the service provided.  Management believes
   that such cost allocation methods are reasonable.  The costs of 
   those services are billed to the regulated company. 

   It is not practicable to provide a detailed estimate of the 
   expenses which would be recognized on a stand-alone basis.  
   However, the Company believes that corporate services, including 
   those related to shareholder relations, procurement, tax, legal 
   and human resources, are obtained more economically through 
   affiliates than they would be on a stand-alone basis, since the 
   Company absorbs only a portion of the total costs.  Additionally, 
   through its 1/7  ownership interest in Bellcore (see footnote 1 
   below), the Company obtains benefits associated with research and 
   development activities which exceed the Company's share of the 
   total costs.

   NOTE 5: RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 

   The Company's 1993 results reflect an $880 million restructuring 
   charge (pretax).  The related restructuring plan (the "Plan") is 
   designed to provide faster, more responsive customer services 
   while reducing the costs of providing these services.  As part of 
   the Plan, the Company is developing new systems that will enable 
   it to monitor networks to reduce the risk of service 
   interruptions, activate telephone service on demand, provide 
   automated inventory systems and centralize its service centers so  
   that customers can have their telecommunications needs resolved 
   with one phone call.  The Company is consolidating its existing 
   560 customer service centers into 26 centers in 10 cities and  
   reducing its total work force by approximately 9,000 employees  
   (including the remaining employee reductions associated with the 
   restructuring plan announced in 1991).  The Plan provides for 
   the reduction of 2,450 management and 6,550 occupational 
   employees. 
   <TABLE>

   Following is a schedule of the costs included in the 1993 
   restructuring charge:

   ==============================================================
   </TABLE>
   Employee separation costs include severance payments, health-care  
   coverage and postemployment education benefits.  Systems 
   development costs include the replacement of existing, single-
   purpose systems with new systems designed to provide integrated, 
   end-to-end customer service.  The work-force reductions would
   not be possible without the development and installation of the 
   new systems, which will eliminate the current, labor-intensive 
   interfaces between existing processes.  Real estate costs include  
   preparation costs for the new service centers.  The relocation 
   and retraining costs are related to moving employees to the sites 
   of the new service centers and retraining employees on the new  
   methods and systems required in the new, restructured mode of 
   operation.

   NOTE 6: DISCONTINUANCE OF SFAS NO. 71 

   The Company incurred a non-cash, extraordinary charge of $3 
   billion, net of an income tax benefit of $2.3 billion, in  
   conjunction with its decision to discontinue accounting for its  
   operations in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the  
   Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," as of September 30,
   1993.  SFAS No. 71 generally applies to regulated companies that  
   meet certain requirements, including a requirement that a company 
   be able to recover its costs, competition notwithstanding, by 
   charging its customers at prices established by its regulators.  
   The Company's decision to discontinue the application of SFAS No.
   71 was based on the belief that competition, market conditions 
   and the development of broadband technology, more than prices  
   established by regulators, will determine the future cost 
   recovery by the Company.  As a result of this change, the 
   remaining asset lives of the Company's telephone plant have been 
   shortened to more closely reflect the useful (economic) lives of 
   such plant. 
   
   Following is a list of the major categories of property, plant 
   and equipment and the manner in which lives were affected by the 
   discontinuance of SFAS No. 71:

  </TABLE>
  The Company employed two methods to determine the amount of the 
  extraordinary charge.  The "economic life" method assumed that a 
  portion of the plant-related effect is a regulatory asset that was 
  created by the under-depreciation of plant under regulation.  This  
  method yielded the plant-related adjustment that was confirmed by 
  the second method, a discounted cash flows analysis.

  NOTE 10: FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

  Fair values of cash equivalents, other current amounts receivable 
  and payable, and short-term debt, approximate the carrying amount 
  due to their short-term nature.

  The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices 
  where available or, if not available, is based on discounting 
  future cash flows using current interest rates.  The fair values 
  of interest rate swaps approximate their recorded value. 

  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the carrying amount of the  
  Company's debt was $5,727 and $5,352, respectively, and the fair  
  value was $5,200 and $5,500, respectively. 

  NOTE 11: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

  The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage
  its market exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.  Swap 
  agreements are primarily used to effectively convert existing 
  commercial paper to fixed rate debt.  This allows the Company to 
  achieve interest savings over issuing fixed rate debt directly. 

  Under an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another 
  party to exchange interest payments at  specified intervals over 
  a defined term.  Interest payments are calculated by reference to 
  the notional amount based on the fixed and variable rate terms of 
  the swap agreements.  The net interest received or paid as part of
  the interest rate swap is accounted for as an adjustment to 
  interest expense. 

  The Company also entered into a currency swap to convert Swiss 
  franc-denominated debt to dollar-denominated debt.  This allowed  
  the Company to achieve interest savings over issuing fixed rate 
  dollar-denominated debt.  Under the currency swap, the Company  
  agreed with another party to exchange dollars for  francs within 
  the terms of the loan which include periodic interest payments 
  and principal upon origination and maturity.  The currency swap 
  and foreign currency debt are combined and accounted for as if 
  dollar-denominated debt were issued directly. 

  The following table summarizes terms of swaps as of December 31,
  1994.  Variable rates are primarily indexed to the 30 day 
  commercial paper rate.

  NOTE 11: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) 

  In 1993, the Company executed forward contracts to sell U.S.  
  Treasury Securities to reduce debt issuance risks by allowing the 
  Company to lock in the treasury rate component of the future debt 
  issue.  At December 31, 1994, deferred credits of $8 and deferred 
  charges of $51 on closed interest rate forward contracts are 
  included as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt. The  
  deferred credits and charges are being recognized as a yield  
  adjustment over the life of the debt, which matures at various 
  dates through 2043.  The net deferred charge is directly offset by 
  the lower coupon rate achieved on the debt issuance.  At December 
  31, 1994, there were no open forward contracts on interest rates. 

  The counterparties to these derivative contracts are major 
  financial institutions.  The Company is exposed to credit loss in 
  the event of non-performance by these counterparties.  The Company 
  manages this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of the 
  counterparty and establishing dollar and term limitations which
  correspond to the respective credit rating of each counterparty.  
  The Company does not have significant exposure to an individual  
  counterparty and does not anticipate non-performance by any 
  counterparty.

  NOTE 13: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

  Pension Plans 

  The Company is a participant in a defined benefit pension plan 
  administered by U S WEST, which covers substantially all 
  management and occupational employees.  Prior to 1993, the 
  Company was a participant in two defined benefit pension plans
  administered by U S WEST, which were merged into one plan 
  effective January 1, 1993.  Benefits for management employees are 
  based upon a final pay formula, while occupational benefits are  
  based upon a flat benefit formula.  The projected unit credit 
  method is used for financial reporting purposes and the aggregate 
  cost method for funding purposes.  No funding was required in 
  1994, 1993 or 1992.  Net pension credits for 1994, 1993 and 1992 
  were $0, $66 and $102, respectively. 

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions 

  The Company provides certain health care and life insurance 
  benefits for retired employees.  Effective January 1, 1992, the 
  Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
  ("SFAS") No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
  Benefits Other Than Pensions." SFAS No. 106 mandates that 
  employers reflect in their current expenses an accrual for the 
  cost of providing retirement medical and life insurance benefits  
  to current and future retirees.  Prior to 1992, the Company  
  recognized these costs as they were paid.  Adoption of SFAS No.  
  106 resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge against 1992 earnings 
  of $1,675, net of a deferred tax benefit of $1,022, for the prior  
  service of active and retired employees.  The  effect upon 1992  
  income before change in accounting principle of adopting SFAS No. 
  106 was approximately $36. 

  In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 106, for financial  
  reporting purposes, the Company elected to  immediately recognize   
  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for current and 
  future retirees, net of the fair value of plan assets. 

  The Company used the projected unit credit method for the 
  determination of postretirement medical costs for financial 
  reporting purposes.  Net postretirement benefit costs for 1994, 
  1993 and 1992 were $220, $248 and $258, respectively.  The amount 
  funded by the Company will generally follow the  amount of expense 
  allowed in regulatory jurisdictions. 

  Other Postemployment Benefits 

  The Company also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for 
  Postemployment Benefits," effective January 1, 1992.  SFAS No. 112  
  requires that employers accrue for the estimated costs of 
  benefits, such as workers' compensation and disability, provided  
  to former or inactive employees who are not eligible for 
  retirement.  Adoption of SFAS No. 112 resulted in a one-time,  
  non-cash charge against 1992 earnings of $49, net of a deferred 
  tax benefit of $30.

  NOTE 14: INCOME TAXES 

  The Company is included in the consolidated tax return of 
  U S WEST.  Under an agreement with U S WEST, the Company 
  recognizes income taxes on a separate return basis.  At December  
  31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had outstanding taxes payable to 
  U S WEST of $29 and $96, respectively.
