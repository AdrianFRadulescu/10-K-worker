Addendum III

         Due to the merger of a corporation with and into the Company
effectuated on August 31, 1995, which effectively doubled the size of the
Company, and the substitution of KPMG Peat Marwick L.L.P. for Coopers & Lybrand
L.L.P. as the Company's principal accountants following the merger, an accurate
and full completion of the Annual Report on Form 10-K could not be provided
within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense.

Addendum IV(3)

         As a result of the merger on August 31, 1995, which effectively
doubled the size of the Company and was accounted for in a manner similar to a
pooling of interests, the operations from the corresponding period will not be
comparable to the earnings statements to be included in the Form 10-K for the
period ended August 31, 1995.  A reasonable estimate of the results for the
period ended August 31, 1995, is set forth in the Company's press release
attached hereto as Exhibit A.

TRISTAR CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL 1995

SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, NOVEMBER 6, 1995 -- TRISTAR CORPORATION (NASDAQ/NMS symbol
TSAR) today announced results for the year ended August 31, 1995.

The previously announced merger of Eurostar Perfumes, Inc. ("Eurostar"), the
Company's major supplier, into Tristar plays a significant role in its reported
results  for fiscal 1995 and for restated 1994 results. This merger was
accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.  Accordingly the
results as reported include both the activities of Tristar as a distributor in
the NAFTA countries as well as all of the sales activities of Eurostar in
Central and South America and Eurostar's development and manufacturing
activities.

Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 were $12,308,000 as compared to
$12,714,000 for the same period in fiscal 1994, a decrease of 3.2%.  The net
loss for the quarter ended August 31, 1995 was $1,374,000, or $0.08 per share,
compared to a net loss of $270,000, or $0.02 per share, for the same quarter in
fiscal 1994.  Although operating income for the quarter ended August 31, 1995
improved over the corresponding quarter in fiscal 1994 (i.e. $613,000 vs.
$373,000), this improvement was not evident in the net income, largely due to
expenses related to the merger, e.g. (1) merger related expenses of $686,000
and (2) the write-off of $656,000 of the deferred warrant valuation as
triggered by the merger.

For the year ended August 31, 1995, net sales were $44,728,000 as compared to
$51,244,000 for the same period in fiscal 1994, a decrease of 12.7%.  For the
1995 fiscal year, the Company incurred a net loss of $932,000, or $0.06 per
share, compared to a net income of $1,390,000, or $0.08 per share, for the same
period in fiscal 1994.  Included in nonoperating income (expense) for fiscal
1995 was other income of $2,065,000 from the court approved distribution of the



<PAGE>   5
proceeds and earned interest of an executive liability indemnification
insurance policy owned by the Company.

During fiscal 1995, the Company continued to make investments in the
development and introduction of new products and in the marketing of both new
and existing products in all channels of distribution.  Additional investments
were also continued in developing and expanding both the chain store and mass
merchandising channels in the domestic market and in expanding the Latin
American markets.

Mr. Loren M. Eltiste, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of TRISTAR
CORPORATION stated, "The integration of Tristar and Eurostar has progressed
very smoothly, and some of the benefits of the merger become evident in the
reported financial results for fiscal 1995 as compared to the results of
Tristar prior to the merger.  One of those benefits is that the Company is able
to report income from operations for the fiscal years of 1995 and 1994 as
compared to operating losses reported by Tristar on a standalone basis in prior
periods.  Sales, while down in fiscal 1995 from fiscal 1994, now include
markets in Central and South America.  It is management's belief, that had it
not been for the currency devaluation in Mexico in December 1994 and its
negative impact on direct and indirect sales into Mexico, that sales in fiscal
1995 would have been comparable to fiscal 1994.

Gross margins as a percentage of sales were negatively affected primarily by
increased costs of certain key components due to decreased purchasing power of
the U.S. dollar in certain foreign markets and by the mix of products
manufactured and sold as compared to fiscal 1994. Even as the Company expanded
its marketing activities in all distribution channels, SG&A expenses decreased
primarily as a result of expense controls and selective work force reductions.

The new Tristar is providing increased opportunities as the Company coordinates
its marketing efforts and programs in all of the Western Hemisphere and as it
takes advantage of the development and manufacturing activities formerly under
Eurostar.  Under the assumption that

<PAGE>   6

in fiscal 1996 there will be no major currency, economic, or political
upheavals in the countries serviced by Tristar, the Company believes it should
return to a pattern of sales growth in both domestic markets as well as in
foreign markets."
        
TRISTAR CORPORATION is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and marketing an
extensive line of value-priced products comprised of designer alternative
fragrances, contemporary cosmetics, and selected toiletry products.  These
products are distributed by the Company in the Western Hemisphere primarily to
chain stores, mass merchandisers, retail outlets, distributors, and
wholesalers.
