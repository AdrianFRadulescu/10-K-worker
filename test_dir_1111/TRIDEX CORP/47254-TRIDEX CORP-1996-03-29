                                     PART I

GENERAL

              Tridex Corporation ("Tridex" or the "Company"), through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries Magnetec Corporation ("Magnetec"), Ithaca Peripherals
Incorporated ("Ithaca"), Ultimate Technology Corporation ("Ultimate") and Cash
Bases GB Limited ("Cash Bases"), is primarily engaged in the design,
development, manufacture and sale of specialty printers, terminal devices and
other peripheral products. The Company's market is the interface between the
consumer and the retailer or other service provider in a variety of transactions
- - at the retail point-of-sale ("POS"), an automated teller machine ("ATM"), a
kiosk, or a lottery terminal. The Company's products include custom-designed dot
matrix and thermal printer mechanisms used to print receipts, coupons, event and
lottery tickets, bank statements and product or service information; optical
mark-sense readers and document transport systems used for automated data entry
to lottery terminals, educational test scoring and vote tally systems; and POS
printers, POS customer displays, POS keyboards and terminal devices, and cash
drawers used in the retail industry.

ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

              (A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS SINCE APRIL 1, 1995

              In December 1995, the Company reorganized its printer business by
combining Magnetec and Ithaca into a new Printer Group. The combination provides
a strong and highly focused engineering organization to rapidly develop new
products and an integrated marketing force. In connection with this
reorganization and with reductions in the level of employment in other areas of
the Company, a restructuring provision of $425,000 was recorded in December
1995.

              In December 1995, the Company changed its fiscal year to end on
December 31. Previously, the Company's fiscal year ended on the Saturday closest
to March 31. This report includes the nine months ended December 31, 1995 as a
transitional fiscal year.

              (B) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

              Tridex presently operates in one industry segment, the design,
manufacture and sale of specialty printers, terminal devices and other
peripheral products.

              (C) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

              (i) PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

              Tridex designs, manufactures and sells specialty dot matrix impact
printers, thermal printers, printer mechanisms and optical mark-sense readers
for OEM applications, and dot matrix impact printers, customer displays,
keyboards, terminal devices and custom cash drawers for POS applications.

              Tridex's printers and printer mechanisms are high performance,
full-featured peripherals that utilize the Company's electromechanical printing
components and subassemblies. Tridex designs and manufactures a wide variety of
printer products, including printers for automated applications such as
interactive kiosks and ATMs, printers for lottery and pari-mutuel terminals and
other gaming applications and standalone printers for POS and industrial
applications. In addition to designing its own printer products, Tridex also
provides mechanical design services to customers who integrate printers
into specialty applications. The Company's optical mark-sense readers
and document transport systems may be used in, or in connection with, products
that feature the Company's printer mechanisms and printheads. The Company's
cash drawers, constructed of metal, are high quality, custom products, for use
with POS terminals primarily in supermarkets, specialty stores and convenience
stores. Cash drawers are fabricated in the United Kingdom and are sold
primarily in Western Europe through a direct sales force.



                                       2
<PAGE>   3
              Tridex manufactures and markets POS customer displays, keyboards
and terminal devices for use in Twinax, Unix/Aix and PC-based POS applications.
Tridex's specialty printers, printer components, terminals and other peripheral
products are sold to systems integrators, original equipment manufacturers and
directly to end users by a direct sales force comprised of 20 people located in
Connecticut, New York, New Hampshire, Illinois, California, Georgia, the United
Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain.

              Sales of printers, including POS printers, and printer components
accounted for 52% of the Company's net sales for the nine months ended December
31, 1995, and 58% and 71% of net sales for the fiscal years ended April 1, 1995
("fiscal 1995") and April 2, 1994 ("fiscal 1994"), respectively. Sales of POS
printers accounted for 32% of such net sales in the nine months ended December
31, 1995 and 36% and 45% of such net sales in those same periods. Sales of POS
customer displays, keyboards, terminals and related products accounted for 30%
of net sales in the nine months ended December 31, 1995 and 23% and 27% of such
net sales for the fiscal years ended April 1, 1995 and April 2, 1994,
respectively. Solenoid sales were less than 2% of total sales in fiscal 1994
with none in fiscal 1995 as the product line was sold on October 1, 1993. Sales
of custom cash drawers accounted for 18% of net sales in the nine months ended
December 31, 1995 and 19% of the net sales for the fiscal year ended April 1,
1995, the first fiscal year to include such sales. Cash Bases had consolidated
revenues of pounds sterling 6.4 million (approximately $9.6 million) for its
fiscal year ended April 30, 1994.

              (ii) SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS

              The principal materials used by Magnetec are copper wire, magnetic
metals, injection molded plastic parts, formed metal parts and electronic
subassemblies, all of which are readily available from a number of sources.
Ithaca is dependent upon a single source of supply for printer mechanisms for
its POS printers. The loss of this supply source would have a material adverse
effect on Tridex and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Ithaca has a contract
with this source of supply to provide a sufficient quantity of printer
mechanisms until March, 1998. Ithaca enjoys good relations with this source of
supply and has received no indication that the supply agreement will not be
renewed beyond the expiration of the current contract. Ithaca cannot be
certain, however, that the supply agreement will be renewed, or if renewed,
that the renewal terms will be as favorable as those under the current
contract. The principal raw materials for cash drawers are sheet metal and
molded plastic parts which are available from several sources.

              (iii) PATENTS

              Tridex considers one of its patents to be material to the conduct
of its business. The Company has rights to a patent expiring in 2008 involving a
unique automated cut-off device which is an option offered in certain of its POS
printers. Tridex considers certain of its other patents, manufacturing processes
and designs to be proprietary in nature, and, therefore, valuable assets.

              (iv) SEASONALITY AND PRACTICES RELATING TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS

              Sales of the Company's products are not subject to material
seasonal variations. As a result, the Company has not historically been required
to maintain significant inventories of raw materials or finished goods in order
to fill customer orders.

              (v) CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

              During the nine months ended December 31, 1995, no one customer
accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales. Sales to Indiana Cash
Drawer Company, an unrelated distributor of POS products, accounted for 4.7% of
consolidated net sales during the nine months ended December 31, 1995, and 8.3%
and 10.5% of net sales in fiscal years 1995 and 1994, respectively.


                                       3
<PAGE>   4
              (vi) BACKLOG

              The Company's backlog of firm orders was approximately $10,138,000
as of February 24, 1996 and $11,852,000 as of May 27, 1995 compared to a backlog
of approximately $7,800,000 as of May 28, 1994. Tridex expects to fill all of
its backlog within the current fiscal year.

              (vii) COMPETITION

              The markets for the Company's products are highly competitive.
Through its operating subsidiaries the Company competes with approximately 2
domestic and 5 foreign manufacturers for sales of printer mechanisms and
components, with approximately 3 domestic and 2 foreign manufacturers for sales
of optical mark-sense readers and POS printers, with approximately 3 domestic
manufacturers for sales of POS terminal devices, with approximately 3 domestic
and 4 foreign manufacturers for sales of POS customer displays, and with 4
manufacturers of high quality cash drawers. In the market for POS printers, the
Company competes with Epson America, Inc., which holds a dominant market
position.

              All of the Company's products compete on the basis of price,
performance, quality and reliability. Some of the Company's lower production
volume products sold to the lottery, interactive kiosk, general gaming and
automatic teller machine industries compete based upon the Company's ability to
provide highly specialized and custom engineering and continuous technical
support. In the kiosk industry, Tridex has established itself as a major
independent supplier of printer mechanisms to a number of major interactive
kiosk manufacturers. With respect to its higher volume products, the Company
competes based on its product design, quality, and reliability, customer support
and in some cases based upon the uniqueness of its products. The Company also
competes on the basis of its design capabilities and quality control procedures.

              In certain markets, the Company's competitors can sometimes offer
lower prices than the Company because of lower overhead, attributable to higher
volume production and off-shore manufacturing locations, which enjoy cheaper
sources of labor and raw materials. Many of the Company's domestic competitors,
particularly those that are divisions of substantially larger companies, have
greater financial and other resources than Tridex.

              (viii) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

              The Company spent approximately $2.3 in the nine months ended
December 31, 1995 and $2.4 and $2.0 million in the fiscal years 1995 and 1994,
respectively, on engineering, design and product development efforts in
connection with specialized engineering and design to introduce a number of new
products and to custom-tailor products for the Company's customers.

              (ix) ENVIRONMENT

              Somerville, Massachusetts - Allu Realty Trust ("Allu"), a
Massachusetts business trust, with transferable shares, all of which are owned
by Tridex, is the former owner of land improved with a manufacturing-warehouse
building located at 100 Foley Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (the "Site").
Although Allu has sold the property to 100 Foley Street Incorporated ("Foley"),
an unrelated entity, Allu and Tridex remain responsible for certain
environmental problems associated with the Site.

                  During July 1984, Allu and Tridex disclosed to the
Massachusetts Department of the Attorney General the existence of chromium, oil
and grease at the Site. As a result, the Environmental Protection Division of
the Department of the Attorney General and the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection ("MDEP") conducted an investigation of the Site. At
MDEP's request, the Company retained an environmental engineering firm, which
completed a Phase II investigation study of the Site. The Company has conducted
further studies to more specifically characterize and assess the Site and to
determine appropriate long term clean-up. In January 1993, the Company entered
into an agreement with Foley pursuant to which Tridex and Foley agreed to pay
75% and 25%, respectively, of the costs incurred after January 1, 1992 in




                                       4
<PAGE>   5
connection with the investigation and remediation of the Site (the "Site
Participation Agreement"). The Site Participation Agreement also provides that,
to the extent there are available proceeds from the sale of the Site or, if not
sold, from the operation of the Site after January 1, 1997, Tridex shall be
reimbursed for all or a portion of the $260,000 it expended in connection with
the Site prior to January 1, 1992. Under the terms of an Escrow Agreement
entered into by Tridex and Foley simultaneously with the Site Participation
Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), Tridex and Foley each placed $125,000 into
escrow to fund the payment of their obligations under the Site Participation
Agreement. Under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Tridex must place an
additional $100,000 in escrow at the request of the Escrow Agent and thereafter
the amount of any additional funds required by the Escrow Agent to be placed in
escrow shall be contributed 75% by Tridex and 25% by Foley. Approximately $3,000
was being held in escrow as of December 31, 1995, all of which was contributed
by Foley.

              As of December 31, 1995, the Company had spent approximately
$639,000 in connection with the Site. Of this amount, approximately $468,000
relates to investigation or remediation costs incurred at the Site. Although it
is difficult to distinguish between amounts spent for investigation and
remediation, the Company estimates that approximately $370,000 has been spent in
connection with investigation and approximately $98,000 has been spent in
connection with remediation of the Site. The Company estimates that it will
spend approximately $150,000 to $300,000 in connection with the Site during
1996, including expenditures from the escrow account. Based upon preliminary
estimates provided by a consulting environmental engineer and based upon the
likely future uses of the property, as of December 31, 1995, the Company had
accrued $347,000 for the estimated liability associated with the site, which
represents the currently estimated minimum cost of remediation, after
considering the cost sharing arrangement discussed above. Accordingly, although
no assurances can be given regarding the materiality of the total costs which
may be incurred, the Company does not believe at this time that the remediation
of the Site is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The implementation of
clean-up measures may commence, and may be completed, in 1996, in which case
the entire amount of remediation costs to be borne by the Company would be
incurred and paid in 1996. The precise scope and timing of remediation is
dependent upon a proposed sale of the property, which is subject to
negotiations to which the Company is not a party. The Company expects that, as
in the past, funds being held in escrow, cash from operations and the Company's
credit facilities will be sufficient to pay the costs of remediation without a
material effect on the Company's operations.

              The Company has also been notified by an adjacent property owner,
Cooper Industries ("Cooper"), that certain petroleum products that may have
migrated from the Site have been detected in a monitoring well located on
Cooper's property. The Company and Foley are investigating possible oil
contamination along the border between the Site and the property owned by
Cooper.

              (x) EMPLOYEES

              As of February 24, 1996, Tridex and its subsidiaries employed
approximately 452 persons.

              (D) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS
AND EXPORT SALES

              Prior to fiscal 1995, the Company had no foreign operations and
export sales were minimal. Primarily as a result of the acquisition of Cash
Bases in June 1994, the Company had approximately $8.8 million of sales which
originated outside the United States during the nine months ended December 31,
1995 ($10.9 million in fiscal 1995). For the amounts of revenue, operating
profit or loss and identifiable assets by geographic area, see Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. In addition, the
Company had export sales from the United States of approximately $1.6 



                                       5
<PAGE>   6
million in the nine months ended December 31, 1995 and $4.0 million in fiscal
1995, of which $2.4 million was to Canada and the majority of the balance to
Europe.

              No dividends on the common stock have been declared in more than
five years. The Company does not anticipate declaring dividends in the
foreseeable future. The Company's agreement with Fleet Bank, N.A. prohibits the
payment of cash dividends for the term of the agreement. The indenture covering
the Company's 10.5% Debentures limits the payment of cash dividends to 50% of
aggregate consolidated net income earned after December 27, 1992 for so long as
any of the debentures are outstanding. The Company is permitted by the indenture
to pay dividends in common stock.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         (A) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         (i) NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1994

         Consolidated net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 1995
increased $6,682,000 (17%) to $46,029,000 from $39,347,000 in the comparable
period of the prior year. The increase is due to greater volume of shipments of
point-of-sale (POS) terminals, pole displays and other peripherals and to the
sales of Cash Bases, which was acquired on June 20, 1994 and included in only
six and one third months of the nine months ended December 31, 1994.

         Consolidated gross profit increased $830,000 (6%) to $13,997,000 from
$13,167,000 in the prior year's period, primarily due to the greater volume of
shipments of POS terminals and POS printers and to the effect of the Cash Bases
acquisition. Gross profit in the current period was adversely impacted by the
production inefficiencies experienced at Cash Bases and by the relocation of
Magnetec. In addition, certain production start-up costs associated with the
Company's new on-line lottery printer negatively affected margin. Consolidated
gross profit percentage decreased to 30.4% of sales from 33.5% of sales in the
prior year's period. The decrease in gross margin percentage reflects a change
in sales mix of products into the POS markets and the non-recurring costs and
unfavorable variances discussed above.

         Consolidated engineering, design and product development costs
increased $630,000 (38%) to $2,310,000 from $1,680,000 in the prior year's
period. The increase is primarily the result of the inclusion of such costs for
Cash Bases, as well as the cost of developing new products and enhancing
existing products, particularly for the POS market.

         Consolidated selling, administrative and general expenses increased
$3,019,000 (37%) to $11,097,000 from $8,078,000 in the prior year's period. The
increase in selling expenses is primarily the result of the inclusion of such
costs for Cash Bases and the increased staff to support a greater selling
effort, in both the United States and the European markets. The increase in
general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the inclusion of
such costs for Cash Bases and certain non-recurring charges. Such non-recurring
charges include a provision for damages of $680,000 awarded in a lawsuit with a
former landlord, the cost of establishing an unfunded pension arrangement of
$339,000, and other non-recurring charges totaling approximately $246,000.

         During the quarter ended December 31, 1995, the Company recorded a
provision for restructuring of $425,000 to cover the costs associated with the
formation of the printer group, reductions of levels of employment in other
areas of the Company and the discontinuance of certain products. A substantial 
portion of the provision relates to employee severance costs.

         Consolidated operating profit for the current period decreased to
$165,000 from $3,409,000 in the prior year's period, primarily as a result of
the non-recurring charges discussed above and unfavorable results at Cash Bases.
Operating profit was adversely impacted by production inefficiencies, increased
operating costs at Cash Bases and temporary softness in the European cash drawer
market. Consolidated operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 8.7% in the
prior year's period.



                                       9
<PAGE>   10
         Net interest expense increased $172,000 (20%) to $1,035,000 from
$863,000 in the prior year's period. The increase in interest expense was due
primarily to additional borrowings under working capital facilities and to the
indebtedness incurred to acquire Cash Bases.

         Other non-operating expense, net for the current period includes a
provision of $75,000 for environmental matters, $42,000 for loss on the
anticipated disposal of unused real estate, and $29,000 for net realized
transactional foreign exchange gains. The prior year's period includes an
additional gain of $115,000 related to the October 1993 sale of the Company's
solenoid product line and net realized gains on foreign exchange of $15,000,
offset by an additional provision of $120,000 for loss on the anticipated
disposal of unused real estate.

         The provision for taxes for the nine-month period ended December 31,
1995 is $17,000. The provision amount is low relative to the pre-tax loss due to
the accrual for state income taxes and non-deductible amortization of goodwill.
The effective tax rate in the prior period was 42.5%.

         Net loss for the current period was $997,000 (or $0.27 per share) as
compared to net income of $1,475,000 (or $0.38 per share) in the prior year's
period. The average number of common shares outstanding during the nine months
ended December 31, 1995 was 3,721,513. Common equivalent shares are not
considered in net loss per share calculations as the incremental shares are
non-dilutive. The average number of common and common equivalent shares
outstanding during fiscal 1995 was 3,860,106 shares.

         (ii) FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994

         Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year (52 weeks) ended April 1,
1995 increased $20,989,000 (62%) to $54,677,000 from $33,688,000 in the prior
year (52 weeks) ended April 2, 1994. Sales of all printers and printer
components accounted for 58% and 71% of total sales in fiscal 1995 and 1994,
respectively. Terminal devices and customer displays represented 23% and 27%,
respectively, of total sales in fiscal 1995 and 1994. Cash drawers represented
19% of total sales in fiscal 1995. The inclusion of Cash Bases' operations from
the date of acquisition on June 20, 1994 contributed $10,528,000 of the revenue
increase over the prior year. The remainder of the period-to-period increase
primarily was the result of increased unit shipments of printers into the POS
market, as well as increased shipments of printer products into the gaming and
wagering and financial services markets, and increased sales of terminal
devices.

         Consolidated gross profit increased $6,168,000 (51%) to $18,249,000
from $12,081,000 in the prior year, primarily as a result of the contribution of
Cash Bases and the increased sales in the gaming and wagering market and in the
POS market. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to
33% of sales from 36% of sales in the prior year. The decrease in gross margin
primarily reflects the sales of lower margin products into the POS and gaming
and wagering markets, and to a lesser degree, the inclusion of Cash Bases.

         Consolidated engineering, design and product development costs
increased $382,000 (19%) to $2,359,000 from $1,977,000 in the prior year. The
increase reflects the inclusion of such costs for Cash Bases, as well as the
cost of developing new products and enhancing existing products.

         Consolidated selling, administrative and general expenses increased
$3,319,000 (41%) to $11,350,000 from $8,031,000 in the prior year. The increase
in selling expenses is the result of the inclusion of such costs for Cash Bases,
increased sales commissions and the increased staff to support a greater selling
effort in both the United States and European markets. The increase in general
and administrative expenses is the result of additional employee costs and
professional services to support business growth.

         Consolidated operating profit for the 1995 fiscal year increased
$2,467,000 (119%) to $4,540,000 from $2,073,000 in the prior year, primarily as
a result of the contribution of Cash Bases and increased sales in the gaming and
wagering market and in the POS market. Consolidated operating profit as a
percentage of net sales increased to 8% from 6% in the prior year.

         Net interest expense increased $151,000 (15%) to $1,171,000 from
$1,020,000 in the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily
to the additional indebtedness incurred to acquire Cash Bases offset by the
effect of the conversion of debt securities to common stock in the prior year.

         Other non-operating expense (net) for the 1995 fiscal year includes
provisions for estimated loss on the disposal of non-productive property of
$170,000 and estimated clean-up costs associated with certain environmental
matters of $60,000, offset by an additional gain of $115,000 from a contingent
payment related to the October 1993 sale of the Magnetec solenoid product line
and net realized gains on foreign exchange of $84,000.

         The provision for income taxes for fiscal 1995 reflects an effective
tax rate of 19.7%. The provision is net of a tax credit of $770,000 recorded in
the fourth quarter which reflects an adjustment to the Company's valuation
allowance to recognize federal deferred tax benefits available to be used by the
Company.

         Net income for the 1995 fiscal year was $2,686,000 (or $.69 per share)
as compared to $1,613,000 (or $.44 per share) in the prior year. The average
number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased to 3,867,827
shares from 3,661,278 shares in the prior year due primarily to the issuance of
common stock to acquire Cash Bases, the exercise of options and warrants, and
the effect of conversion of various debt securities to common stock at the end
of the prior year.

(iii) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company's working capital at December 31, 1995 was $7,474,000
compared with $5,963,000 at April 1, 1995. The current ratio was 1.6 to 1.0 at
December 31, 1995 compared with 1.4 to 1.0 at April 1, 1995. The increase in
working capital and current ratio are due primarily to the effect of the amended
Fleet Credit Agreement discussed below.

         On December 15, 1995, the Company and Fleet Bank, N.A. entered into an
amended and restated credit agreement (the "Fleet Credit Agreement") to
significantly increase the Company's borrowing capacity at more favorable rates
and terms than provided for in their 1994 credit agreement. The Fleet Credit
Agreement provided the Company with a working capital facility of $5,000,000
(the "Working Capital Facility") and a term facility of $5,500,000 (the "Term
Loan Facility"). The Working Capital Facility expries June 30, 1997, bears
interest payable monthly at a rate one percentage point above Fleet's prime
rate and bears a non-utilization fee of .25% of the unused balance. The Term
Loan Facility is for a term of six years, bears interest payable monthly at a
rate 1.25 percentage points above Fleet's prime rate and requires principal to
be paid in monthly installments of approximately $82,000 beginning May 31,
1996. The Fleet Credit Agreement also permitted the Company to designate a 
LIBOR rate on outstanding debt with a maximum margin of 3.25 percentage 
points over the market rate. The Company used the proceeds of the Term Loan 
Facility to refinance amounts outstanding under the 1994 credit agreement with 
Fleet, which consisted of $2,041,000 under an acquisition term loan facility 
and $3,250,000 under a working capital facility.

         The Working Capital Facility provides critical capital for the Company.
If for any reason this or comparable financing is not available to the Company,
it would have an adverse effect on the Company and its ability to conduct its
operations as previously conducted. The Company is required to comply with
certain financial covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum
leverage ratio, a minimum debt service coverage ratio and a minimum current
ratio, otherwise the lender may withdraw its commitment. As of December 31,
1995, the Company did not satisfy the minimum tangible net worth, minimum debt
service coverage ratio or positive net income covenants. On March 15, 1996,
Fleet agreed to waive compliance with those covenants for the period ended
December 31, 1995 and to amend the Working Capital Facility to reduce the
minimum tangible net worth requirement for the quarter ended March 31, 1996.
Fleet also has adjusted the maximum amount available 



                                       11
<PAGE>   12
under the Working Capital Facility to $3,000,000 and has eliminated the LIBOR
interest rate option. The adjusted Working Capital Facility is sufficient for
the Company's anticipated working capital requirements in 1996.  The Company
expects to be in full compliance with all covenants under the Fleet Credit
Agreement during 1996.   Other than as described above and in February and May
of 1993, when it obtained waivers under its previous loan agreement of a
covenant regarding the quick ratio, the Company has been in compliance with the
covenants in its loan agreements during the past three years. 

         On June 20, 1994 the Company completed the acquisition of Cash Bases.
The purchase price of pounds sterling 3,500,000 (approximately $5.330 million)
was paid pounds sterling 3,067,000 (approximately $4.672 million) in cash and
pounds sterling 433,000 (approximately $658,000) by delivery of 96,788 shares
of Tridex common stock, of which 72,647 shares were placed in escrow to secure
the accuracy of certain representations and warranties made by the sellers. The
escrowed shares were released as scheduled, since the Company made no claims
against the sellers for breach of representations and warranties prior to the
scheduled release dates. In addition, the Company guaranteed for approximately
eighteen months that the sales price of all such shares sold by sellers would
not be less than the average market price of Tridex common stock at the time of
the acquisition ($6.80 per share). During the nine months ended December 31,
1995, the Company reimbursed the sellers an aggregate of $29,000 on the sale of
27,942 shares of common stock including losses on foreign exchange. No further
payments are required. The Company financed the cash portion of the purchase
price through its 1994 credit agreement with Fleet.

         During the nine months ended December 31, 1995, the Company's operating
cash needs were satisfied with cash generated from operations and borrowings
under its credit facilities. At December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately
$700,000 in commitments for capital expenditures and had availability of
$5,000,000 remaining under the Working Capital Facility. The Company expects
that funds generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings under the
Working Capital Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash needs for
working capital, scheduled debt retirements and capital expenditures, including
tooling for new products during 1996.

         Over the long term, the Company believes that funds generated from
operations and borrowings under the Working Capital Facility, if necessary, will
continue to satisfy its working capital needs, support growth and meet scheduled
debt retirements.

         (B) IMPACT OF INFLATION

         Tridex believes that its business has not been affected to a
significant degree by inflationary trends because of the low rate of inflation
during the past three years and cost reduction programs at each of its
operations. Tridex believes that any increase in cost due to inflation can be
recovered by price increases or offset by cost reductions and productivity
improvements.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tridex

1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

                      TRIDEX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.       BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

             BUSINESS: Tridex Corporation (the "Company"), through its
         wholly-owned subsidiaries Magnetec Corporation ("Magnetec"), Ithaca
         Peripherals Incorporated ("Ithaca"), Ultimate Technology Corporation
         ("Ultimate") and Cash Bases GB Limited ("Cash Bases"), (collectively
         the "Company"), operates in one industry segment, computer peripheral
         equipment. Operations in this segment include the design, development,
         manufacture and sale of specialty dot matrix impact printers, thermal
         printers, printer mechanisms, and optical mark-sense readers for OEM
         applications, and dot matrix impact printers, customer displays,
         terminal device, keyboards and cash drawers for POS applications.

             PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated
         financial statements include the accounts of the Company after
         elimination of all material intercompany accounts and transactions. All
         material subsidiaries are wholly-owned.

             CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR END: In December 1995, the Company changed
         its fiscal year to end on December 31. Previously, the Company's fiscal
         year ended on the Saturday closest to March 31.

             CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents consist primarily of
         certificates of deposit with maturities of less than ninety days and
         are carried at cost which approximates market value.

             USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in
         conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
         management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
         and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
         reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
         Actual results could differ from those estimates.

             FOREIGN CURRENCY: The financial position and results of operations
         of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency
         as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries
         have been translated at current exchange rates, and related revenues
         and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates.
         The aggregate effect of translation adjustments so calculated is
         included as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Transaction
         gains and losses are included in other income.

             INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
         (principally first-in, first-out) or market.

             PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION: Plant and equipment and
         leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided for
         primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
         The estimated useful life of machinery, furniture and equipment is five
         to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
         the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset.

             EXCESS OF COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED: The excess
         of cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) resulted from
         the acquisitions of Cash Bases in fiscal year 1995, Ultimate in 1993
         and Ithaca in 1991. The amount applicable to these acquisitions totaled
         $9,608,000 at December 31, 1995, and is being amortized on the straight
         line method between ten and twenty years. Accumulated amortization of
         the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired was
         $2,890,000 and $2,238,000 at December 31, 1995 and April 1, 1995,
         respectively. The Company periodically reviews goodwill to assess
         recoverability based upon expectations of non-discounted cash flows
         from operations for each subsidiary having a material goodwill balance.
         The Company believes that no material impairment of goodwill exists at
         December 31, 1995 or April 1, 1995.

             OTHER ASSETS: Other current assets includes marketable securities
         available for sale, accounted for at market value of $309,000, with an
         unrealized gain of $86,000, net of related tax effect of $29,000,
         recorded as a component of shareholders' equity. The market value of
         such securities approximated carrying value at April 1, 1995. Included
         in other assets are deferred tax assets of $860,000 (see Note 10) and
         the net book value of real estate held for sale in the amount of
         $196,000. Also included in other assets are bond issue costs (see Note
         6) which are being amortized over the term of the bond. Accumulated
         amortization of other assets was $479,000, and $637,000 at December 31,
         1995, and April 1, 1995, respectively.

             REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recognized when the product is
         shipped. In the nine months ended December 31, 1995 and the year ended
         April 1, 1995, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of
         consolidated net sales. In the year ended April 2, 1994, one customer
         accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales.

             INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense is based on estimated taxes
         payable or refundable on a tax return basis for the current year and
         changes in the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities during the
         year. Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which
         are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial
         statement purposes. Effective April 4, 1993, the Company adopted FAS
         109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," which mandates the liability method
         for computing deferred income taxes. The objective of the liability
         method is to recognize the amount of current and deferred taxes payable
         or refundable at the financial statement date resulting from all events
         that have been recognized in the financial statement based upon the
         provisions of enacted tax laws. See Note 10 for a further discussion.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.       BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (CONTINUED)



             EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE: Primary earnings (loss) per common and
         common equivalent share are based on the weighted average number of
         common shares outstanding during the period, including stock options
         and warrants when the result is dilutive. Fully diluted earnings per
         common share assumes conversion of dilutive securities, when the result
         is dilutive.

2.       BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:

             On June 20, 1994 the Company completed the acquisition of Cash
         Bases, of Newhaven, England. The purchase price of pounds sterling
         3,500,000 (approximately $5.330 million) was paid pounds sterling
         3,067,000 (approximately $4.672 million) in cash and pounds sterling
         433,000 (approximately $658,000) by delivery of 96,788 shares of Tridex
         common stock, of which 72,647 shares were placed in escrow to secure
         the accuracy of certain representations and warranties made by the
         sellers. The escrowed shares were released as scheduled since the
         Company made no claim against the sellers for breach of representations
         and warranties prior to scheduled release dates. In addition, the
         Company guaranteed for approximately eighteen months the sellers that
         the sales price of all such shares sold by sellers would not be less
         than the average market price of Tridex common stock at the time of the
         acquisition ($6.80 per share). During the nine months ended December
         31, 1995, the Company reimbursed the sellers an aggregate of $29,000 on
         the sale of 27,942 shares of common stock including losses on foreign
         exchange. No further payments are required.

             The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of
         accounting. The acquired company's assets and liabilities have been
         recorded in the Company's financial statements at their estimated fair
         values at the acquisition date. The Consolidated Statements of
         Operations include the results of operations of the acquired company
         from the acquisition date.

             The following pro forma data (unaudited) reflect the fiscal 1995
         acquisition of Cash Bases as if the acquisition had occurred at the
         beginning of fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1994; such data does not purport to
         be indicative of what would have occurred had these transactions been
         made on that date:

6.       BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT AND LONG TERM DEBT:

             On December 15, 1995, the Company and Fleet Bank, N.A. ("Fleet"),
         entered into an amended agreement (the "Fleet Credit Agreement") to
         provide the Company with a $5,000,000 working capital revolving credit
         facility (the "Working Capital Facility") and a $5,500,000 term loan
         facility (the "Term Loan Facility"). The Working Capital Facility,
         included on the accompanying balance sheet as "Bank loans payable",
         expires on June 30, 1997, bears interest payable monthly at a rate one
         percentage point above Fleet's prime rate or 9.5% at December 31,
         1995, and bears a non-utilization fee of .25% of the unused facility.
         Availability under the Working Capital Facility is limited to 80% of
         the Company's eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible
         inventory (not to exceed $1,500,000). The Term Loan Facility, included
         in the accompanying table as "Term loan payable", is for a term of six
         years, bears interest payable monthly at a rate of 1.25 percentage
         points above Fleet's prime rate, or 9.75% on December 31, 1995, and
         requires principal to be paid in monthly installments of approximately
         $82,000 commencing in May, 1996. The Fleet Credit Agreement permitted 
         the Company to designate a LIBOR rate on outstanding debt with a
         maximum margin of 3.25 percentage points over the market rate. The
         Fleet Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security
         interest in certain assets, imposes certain covenants (including a
         minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum debt
         service coverage ratio and a minimum current ratio) and restricts the
         amount available for payment in cash dividends and capital stock
         distributions. As of December 31, 1995, the Company did not satisfy
         the minimum tangible net worth, minimum debt service coverage ratio or
         positive net income covenants. On March 15, 1996, Fleet agreed to
         waive compliance with those covenants for the period ended December
         31, 1995, and to amend the Working Capital Facility to reduce the
         minimum tangible net worth requirement for the quarter ended March 30,
         1996. Fleet also has adjusted the maximum amount available under the 
         Working Capital Facility to $3,000,000 and has eliminated the LIBOR 
         interest rate option. The adjusted Working Capital Facility is 
         sufficient for the Company's anticipated working capital requirements 
         in 1996.

6.       BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT AND LONG TERM DEBT: (CONTINUED)

             The Company expects to be in full compliance with all covenants 
         under the Fleet Credit Agreement during 1996.

             The components of long term debt are:

             The 10.5% Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 1997 (the
         "10.5% Debentures") were privately placed in 1993 in conjunction with
         the acquisition of Ultimate. Interest is payable quarterly on March 15,
         June 15, September 15 and December 15. The Company is required to make
         a sinking fund payment of $740,000 on December 15, 1996. The 10.5%
         Debentures are convertible into Tridex common stock at $9.00 per share.
         As of December 31, 1995, the Company has reserved 385,555 shares of
         common stock pursuant to the conversion feature. The indenture
         restricts the amount available for the payment of cash dividends and
         capital stock distributions. In conjunction with the issuance of the
         10.5% Debentures, the Company issued to each debenture holder
         detachable warrants to purchase common stock of Tridex Corporation (the
         "Warrants") at a rate of 10 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
         debentures. The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years at
         $9.25 per share. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had reserved
         45,500 shares of common stock for the exercise of the Warrants. The
         estimated fair market value of the Warrants has been recorded as a
         discount to the principal amount of the outstanding debentures and is
         being amortized over the term of the debt. Costs incurred in connection
         with the issuance of the 10.5% Debentures of approximately $448,000 are
         recorded in other assets and are being amortized over the term of the
         debentures.

             The 8% Subordinated Convertible Term Promissory Notes (the "8%
         Notes") were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of Ultimate
         from its former shareholders. The 8% Notes are payable in quarterly
         installments over five years and are convertible into Tridex common
         stock at $12.00 per share. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had
         reserved 133,333 shares of common stock pursuant to this conversion
         feature. The discount on the 8% Notes represents imputed interest at a
         rate of approximately 18%. The discount, recorded as a reduction of the
         purchase price of Ultimate, is being amortized over the life of the
         notes using the interest rate method.

             Cash Bases has an agreement with Barclay's Bank that provides line
         of credit, term loan and equipment financing facilities. At December
         31, 1995, pounds sterling 255,000 ($396,000) was outstanding under the
         line of credit facility with availability of pounds sterling 245,000.
         Other long term debt consists of the term notes payable and equipment
         financing obligations of Cash Bases. The equipment financing
         obligations are collateralized by the underlying equipment.

             Maturities of long-term debt, including sinking fund requirements
         and scheduled retirement of the 10.5% Debentures and 8% Notes are as
         follows: $2,411,000 in 1996, $4,633,000 in 1997, $1,021,000 in 1998,
         $985,000 in 1999, $985,000 in 2000 and $902,000 thereafter. Interest
         expense is stated net of interest income of $14,000 in the nine months
         ended December 31, 1995, $33,000 in fiscal 1995 and $11,000 in fiscal
         1994.

7.       PENSION PLAN:

             Effective December 31, 1995, the Company established a
         non-qualified unfunded pension arrangement for Alvin Lukash, a
         significant shareholder and former corporate officer and director. The
         pension arrangement which replaces a prior consulting services
         agreement, requires the Company to pay an annual benefit of $100,000
         payable monthly through the sooner of March 31, 2000 or the death of
         Mr. Lukash. The unfunded accumulated benefit obligation at December 31,
         1995 of $318,000 is included in Accrued Liabilities in the accompanying
         balance sheet. The Company recorded the actuarial present value of the
         benefits calculated at a 7.2% discount rate and related fees totaling
         $339,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 1995.

8.       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

          (a)     LEASE OBLIGATIONS:

             At December 31, 1995, the Company was lessee on long term operating
         leases for equipment and real property. The terms of certain leases
         provide for escalating rent payments in later years of the lease as
         well as payment of minimum rent and real estate taxes. Rent expense
         amounted to approximately $861,000 in the nine months ended December
         31, 1995, $997,000 in fiscal 1995, and $676,000 in fiscal 1994. Minimum
         aggregate rental payments required under operating leases that have
         initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year
         as of December 31, 1995 are as follows: $1,003,000 in 1996, $947,000 in
         1997; $899,000 in 1998; $873,000 in 1999; $810,000 in 2000 and
         $1,949,000 thereafter.



         (b)      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

             The Company is involved in one significant environmental matter:

             Allu Realty Trust ("Allu"), a Massachusetts business trust, with
         transferable shares, all of which are owned by Tridex, is the former
         owner of land improved with a manufacturing-warehouse building located
         at 100 Foley Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (the "Site"). Although
         Allu has sold the property to 100 Foley Street Incorporated ("Foley"),
         an unrelated entity, Allu and Tridex remain responsible for certain
         environmental problems associated with the Site.

             During July 1984, Allu and Tridex disclosed to the Massachusetts
         Department of the Attorney General the existence of chromium, oil and
         grease at the Site. As a result, the Environmental Protection Division
         of the Department of the Attorney General and the Massachusetts
         Department of Environmental Protection ("MDEP") conducted an
         investigation of the Site. At MDEP's request, the Company retained an
         environmental engineering firm, which completed a Phase II
         investigation study of the Site. The Company has conducted further
         studies to characterize and assess the Site more specifically and to
         determine appropriate long term clean-up measures. In January 1993, the
         Company entered into an agreement with Foley pursuant to which Tridex
         and Foley agreed to pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of the costs
         incurred after January 1, 1992 in connection with the investigation and
         remediation of the Site (the "Site Participation Agreement"). The Site
         Participation Agreement also provides that, to the extent there are
         available proceeds from the sale of the Site or, if not sold, from the
         operation of the Site after January 1, 1997, Tridex shall be reimbursed
         for all or a portion of the $260,000 it expended in connection with the
         Site prior to January 1, 1992. Under the terms of an Escrow Agreement
         entered into by Tridex and Foley simultaneously with the Site
         Participation Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), Tridex and Foley each
         placed $125,000 into escrow to fund the payment of their obligations
         under the Site Participation Agreement. Under the terms of the Escrow
         Agreement, Tridex must place an additional $100,000 in escrow at the
         request of the Escrow Agent and thereafter the amount of any additional
         funds required by the Escrow Agent to be placed in escrow shall be
         contributed 75% by Tridex and 25% by Foley. Approximately $3,000 is
         being held in escrow as of December 31, 1995, all of which was
         contributed by Foley.

8.       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: (CONTINUED)

         (b)      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: (CONTINUED)

             As of December 31, 1995, the Company had spent approximately
         $639,000 in connection with the Site. Of this amount, approximately
         $468,000 relates to investigation or remediation costs incurred at the
         Site. Although it is difficult to distinguish between amounts spent for
         investigation and remediation, the Company estimates that approximately
         $370,000 has been spent in connection with investigation and
         approximately $98,000 has been spent in connection with remediation of
         the Site. The Company estimates that approximately $150,000 to $300,000
         will be spent in connection with the Site during fiscal 1996, including
         expenditures from the escrow account. Based upon preliminary estimates
         provided by a consulting environmental engineer and based upon the
         likely future uses of the property, as of December 31, 1995, the
         Company had accrued $347,000 for the estimated liability associated
         with the Site which represents currently estimated minimum cost of
         remediation, after considering the cost sharing arrangement discussed
         above. Accordingly, although no assurances can be given regarding the
         materiality of the total costs which may be incurred, the Company does
         not believe at this time that the remediation of the Site is reasonably
         likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition,
         results of operations or liquidity. The implementation of clean-up
         measures may commence, and may be completed, in 1996, in which case the
         entire amount of remediation costs to be borne by the Company would be
         incurred and paid in 1996. The precise scope and timing of remediation
         is dependent upon a proposed sale of the property, which is subject to
         negotiations to which the Company is not a party. The Company expects
         that, as in the past, funds being held in escrow, cash from operations
         and the Company's credit facilities will be sufficient to pay the costs
         of remediation without a material effect on the Company's operations.

             The Company has also been notified by an adjacent property owner,
         Cooper Industries ("Cooper"), that certain petroleum products that may
         have migrated from the Site have been detected in a monitoring well
         located on Cooper's property. The Company and Foley are investigating
         possible oil contamination along the border between the Site and the
         property owned by Cooper.



          (c)     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:

             In November, 1990, Tridex filed suit against a former landlord,
         Gorham Island Associates ("GIA") seeking monetary damages and
         rescission of a lease covering 5,700 square feet of office space in
         Westport, Connecticut (the "Lease"). In January, 1991, GIA filed suit
         against Tridex seeking payment of all amounts due under the Lease for
         the balance of the Lease term (aggregating approximately $1,021,000)
         and other damages. In December, 1995, the court rendered a decision
         against the Company and awarded damages of $988,000, which includes
         back rent charges, interest and attorneys fees. In March 1996 the
         Company and GIA agreed to settle the suit for $742,500. The Company has
         recorded a provision in the quarter ended December 31, 1995 to provide
         for the settlement and related fees.

9.       STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS:

         1989 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

             The 1989 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") permits stock-based
         incentive compensation in the form of: (a) stock options, (b) stock
         appreciation rights, (c) restricted stock, (d) deferred stock, (e)
         stock purchase rights and (f) other stock-based compensation. Pursuant
         to the Plan, up to 1,250,000 shares of common stock may be distributed
         to officers and key employees of the Company. Options granted are at
         prices equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at
         the date of grant. No charge against income was required with respect
         to options. Options granted are exercisable at the discretion of the
         Stock Option Committee, but in no event shall the period be for more
         than ten years. Ninety days after an employee's termination, the
         outstanding options are canceled. At December 31, 1995 the Company had
         reserved 1,029,470 shares of common stock for issuance upon the
         exercise of options granted under the Plan. The following table
         summarizes the activity of the Plan for the nine months ended December
         31, 1995 and for the prior two years.

             Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the
         tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
         financial statements. The Company's gross deferred tax assets and
         liabilities were comprised of the following:

10.      INCOME TAXES: (CONTINUED)

             At December 31, 1995, a valuation allowance of $1,171,000 has been
         recorded which relates primarily to state net operating loss and
         federal foreign tax credit carryforwards, and certain state deferred
         tax deductions for which a tax benefit will not likely be realized. The
         net change since April 1, 1995 in the valuation allowance for deferred
         tax assets was an increase of $282,000 related primarily to foreign tax
         credits and deferred state tax benefits which will not likely be
         realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset for
         presentation in the consolidated balance sheet.

             At December 31, 1995, the Company had $8,100,000 of state net
         operating loss carryforwards that expire principally in 1996 through
         2000. Federal business and foreign tax credit carryforwards which are
         available to offset future federal income taxes total $615,000 and
         principally expire in 1997 through 2002. The Company has a federal
         minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $211,000 which will be
         available to reduce federal tax in future years.

             Differences between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and
         the company's effective income tax rate are analyzed below:

11.      DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

             The carrying amount of cash, trade accounts receivable, other
         current assets, trade accounts payable, and accrued expenses
         approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those
         instruments. The carrying value of marketable securities available for
         sale is equal to fair value, as discussed in Note 1. The carrying
         amount of borrowings under the Working Capital Facility, the Term Loan
         Facility and the Barclay's agreement approximate their fair value. The
         fair value of the Company's debt is estimated based on the quoted
         market prices of the same or similar issues or on the current rates
         offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The
         estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments are as follows:

12.      NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

             The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
         Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
         of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (FAS
         121) in March 1995. FAS 121 requires that long-lived assets and certain
         identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever changes in
         circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
         recoverable. The entity must estimate the future cash flows expected to
         result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, and
         recognize an impairment loss for any difference between the fair value
         of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset. FAS 121 must be
         adopted for the year beginning after December 15, 1995. The effect, if
         any, on the Company's financial position or results of operations from
         adoption of FAS 121 is not expected to be material.

             The FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting
         for Stock-Based Compensation," in October 1995 effective for years
         beginning after December 15, 1995. Under provisions of this accounting
         standard, the Company is not required to change its method of
         accounting for stock-based compensation. Management expects to retain
         its current method of accounting.

13.      SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS:

             During the quarter ended December 31, 1995, the Company recorded
         provisions for the following non-recurring operating expenses:
         litigation settlement of $680,000, restructuring costs of $425,000,
         pension of $339,000 and other non-recurring items totaling $246,000. In
         addition, the Company recorded other charges of $42,000 for estimated
         loss on disposal of unused real estate and $75,000 for environmental
         clean-up. The provision for restructuring covers the costs associated
         with the formation of the printer group and the discontinuance of
         certain products. A substantial portion of the provision relates to
         employee severance costs.

             During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, the Company recorded an
         additional provision for the estimated loss on disposal of unused real
         estate of $50,000 and an additional provision for estimated
         environmental clean-up costs of $60,000. Also in the fourth quarter,
         the Company recorded an adjustment to fully recognize federal deferred
         tax benefits as discussed in Note 10.

             During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company recorded
         several non-recurring charges, including: a provision for the estimated
         loss on disposal of unused real estate of $132,000; estimated
         environmental clean-up costs of $270,000; and a provision for
         litigation matters totaling $280,000. Also in the fourth quarter, the
         Company recorded one-time tax credits, including the reversal of an
         excess income tax accrual of $300,000 and the adjustment to the
         valuation allowance discussed in Note 10.

</TABLE>

        Net sales are based on the location of the operation. Transfers between
    geographic areas are recorded at amounts generally above cost and in
    accordance with the regulations of applicable taxing jurisdictions.
    Operating profit consists of total net sales less operating expenses and
    corporate expenses, and does not include either interest, other income or
    income taxes. Identifiable assets of geographic areas are those assets used
    in the Company's operations in each area.

        The Company had export sales from its United States operations of
    approximately $1,644,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 1995 and
    $4,073,000 in fiscal 1995. Such sales were primarily to Canada and were not
    material in prior years. Export sales from the Company's foreign operations
    totaling approximately $4,900,000 are primarily to European countries. The
    Company recorded net foreign exchange transaction gains of approximately
    $29,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 1995 and $85,000 in the year
    ended April 1, 1995.

Act.

         Section 1. Definitions. As used in this Article:

         "Indemnified Person" includes any person (or such person's legal
representative) who is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or
shareholder of the corporation and any person who is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or
agent of another enterprise; and any director, officer or employee who is or

                                       36
<PAGE>   3
was serving at the request of the corporation as a fiduciary of an employee
benefit plan or trust maintained for the benefit of employees of the corporation
or employees of any other enterprise;

         "Loss" includes judgements, fines (including ERISA excise taxes),
penalties, and expenses (including amounts paid in settlement and reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements);

         "Party" includes a person who was, is or is threatened to be made, a
defendant or respondent in a Proceeding; and

         "Proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, or appeal thereof, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, involving any person in his capacity as an Indemnified Person.

         Section 2. Indemnification.

         (a) For actions other than by or in the right of the corporation, the
corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person made a Party to any
Proceeding against any Loss actually incurred by the Indemnified Person in
connection with such Proceeding, except as otherwise provided in Section 3(a).

         (b) For actions by or in the right of the corporation, the corporation
shall indemnify any Indemnified Person made a Party to any Proceeding against
reasonable expenses actually incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection
with such Proceeding in relation to matters as to which such Indemnified Person
is finally adjudged not to have breached his duty to the corporation, or where
the court, on application as provided in Section 5 below, shall have determined
that such Indemnified Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to be
indemnified, and then for such amount as the court shall determine. The
corporation shall not so indemnify any Indemnified Person for amounts paid to
the corporation, to a plaintiff or to counsel for a plaintiff in settling or
otherwise disposing of such a Proceeding, with or without court approval; or for
expenses including attorneys' fees incurred in defending such a Proceeding which
is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.

         Section 3. Exclusions From Indemnification. The indemnification
provided for in Section 2(a) above shall not be provided to any Indemnified
Person unless (a) the Indemnified Person was successful on the merits in the
defense of any such Proceeding, or (b) it shall be concluded under Section 4
below that such Indemnified Person acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, or, if
applicable, the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the
employee benefit plan or trust (and consistent with the provisions of such plan
or trust) and, with respect to any criminal action, that he had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, or (c) the court, on application as
provided in Section 5 below shall have determined that such Indemnified Person
is fairly and reasonably entitled to be indemnified, and then for such amount as
the court shall determine; provided, however, that if the claim giving rise to
indemnification under Section 2(a) is based upon the Indemnified Person's
purchase or sale of securities of the corporation or of another enterprise, the
corporation shall only indemnify such Indemnified Person upon the determination
of a court as described in Section 3(c) herein.

         Section 4. Conclusion of Good Faith. The conclusion of good faith
provided for in Section 3(b) above may be reached by any one of the following:
(a) the board of directors of the corporation by a consent in writing signed by
a majority of those directors who were not parties to such Proceeding; (b)
independent legal counsel selected by a consent in writing signed by a majority
of those directors who were not parties to such Proceeding; (c) in the case of
any employee or agent who is not an officer or director of the corporation, the
corporation's general counsel; or (d) the shareholders of the corporation by the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of shares not owned
by parties to such Proceeding. The Indemnified Person may also apply to a court
for such conclusion, upon application as provided in Section 5 below, even
though the conclusion reached under any of the foregoing shall have been adverse
to the Indemnified Person. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall
not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnified Person did not satisfy
the good faith standard of conduct required under Section 3(b).

         Section 5. Application to the Court. Where an application for
indemnification or an application for a conclusion of good faith as provided in
this Article is made to a court, it shall be made to the court in which the
Proceeding is pending or to the superior court for the judicial district where
the principal office of the corporation is located. The application shall
conform to the applicable rules of the court. Notice of such application shall
be provided to the corporation, and to any other persons as the court may
designate.

         Section 6. Advance Payment of Expenses. The corporation shall pay the
indemnifiable expenses of an Indemnified Person in advance of the final
disposition of any Proceeding except to the extent that the defense of a claim
against the Indemnified Person is undertaken pursuant to any directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the corporation. 

                                       37
<PAGE>   4
The advance payment of such expenses will be subject to the Indemnified Person's
first agreeing in writing to repay such advances if it is thereafter determined
that the Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification under this
Article.

         Section 7. Notices, Insurance. Promptly after receipt by the
Indemnified Person of a notice of or threat of commencement of any Proceeding
for which indemnification may be sought from the corporation under this Article,
the Indemnified Person shall notify the corporation in writing of such notice or
threat. If, at the time of receipt of such notice, the corporation has any
directors' or officers' liability insurance in effect, the corporation will give
prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer, and take
all necessary and desirable action to cause such insurer to pay any amounts and
expenses which the Indemnified Person is obligated to pay as a result of such
Proceeding, in accordance with the terms of such insurance policies. The
corporation may obtain insurance providing for greater indemnification than that
described in this Article.

Article VII. Miscellaneous.

         Section 1. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on
the last calendar day of December.

         Section 2. Informal directors or committee action. Except for an
amendment to these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any
meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, may be taken without
a meeting if written consent thereto is signed by all members of the Board or
such committee, as the case may be, and such consent is filed with the minutes
of proceedings of the Board or Committee.

         Section 3. Waivers of notice. Whenever any notice of the time, place or
purposes of any meeting of the stockholders, directors or any committee is
required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws,
a written waiver thereof, signed by any person entitled to such notice and filed
with the records of the meeting, whether before or after the holding thereof, or
actual attendance at such meeting in person or by proxy, shall be deemed
equivalent to the giving of such notice to such person.

         Section 4. Amendments. Except as otherwise provided by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall have power to adopt,
amend or repeal the By-laws of the corporation.

                  (a) The Borrowers shall have the right to reduce or terminate
the amount of unused Working Capital Commitment at any time or from time to
time, provided that: (i) the Borrowers shall give notice of each such reduction
or termination to the Bank as provided in Section 2.8; and (ii) each partial
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $500,000. The
Working Capital Commitment once reduced or terminated may not be reinstated.

                  (b) At any time that the Working Capital Commitment is
terminated pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.7, the Borrowers shall
furnish the Bank for deposit in a cash collateral account maintained at the Bank
adequate cash reserves for the benefit of the Bank on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date in the amount of any F/E

                                       49
<PAGE>   12
Credits for any Foreign Exchange Transaction which remain outstanding on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date, or must otherwise provide for a financial
institution acceptable to the Bank to indemnify the Bank against loss in
connection with outstanding Foreign Exchange Transactions, pursuant to
indemnification documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.

         Section 2.8. Certain Notices. Notices by the Borrowers to the Bank of
each Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.4, and each prepayment or conversion
pursuant to Section 2.5(a), and each reduction or termination of the Working
Capital Commitment pursuant to Section 2.7 shall be irrevocable and shall be
effective only if received by the Bank not later than 12:00 noon Hartford,
Connecticut time, and (a) in the case of Borrowings and prepayments of,
conversions into and (in the case of LIBOR Loans) renewals of (i) Variable Rate
Loans, given one Banking Day prior thereto;(ii) LIBOR Loans, given two Banking
Days prior thereto; (iii) Offered Loans, given two Banking Days prior thereto;
and (b) in the case of reductions or termination of the Working Capital
Commitment, given three Banking Days prior thereto. Each such notice shall
specify the Loans to be borrowed, prepaid, converted or renewed and the amount
(subject to Section 2.9) and type of the Loans to be borrowed, or converted, or
renewed or prepaid and the date of the Borrowing or prepayment, or conversion or
renewal (which shall be a Banking Day). Each such notice of reduction or
termination shall specify the amount of the Working Capital Commitment to be
reduced or terminated. Each Notice of Borrowing for a Foreign Exchange
Transaction shall be accompanied by the customary application and other
documentation for such transaction.

         Section 2.9. Minimum Amounts. Except for Borrowings which exhaust the
full remaining amount of the Borrowing Base or prepayments or conversions which
result in the prepayment or conversion of all Term Loans or Working Capital
Loans, as the case may be, of a particular type, each Borrowing, optional
prepayment, conversion and renewal of principal of Loans of a particular type
shall be in an amount at least equal to (a) $25,000 with respect to Variable
Rate Loans, and (b) $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess
thereof with respect to Fixed Rate Loans (borrowings, prepayments, conversions
or renewals of or into Loans of different types or, in the case of Fixed Rate
Loans, having different Interest Periods at the same time hereunder to be deemed
separate borrowings, prepayments, conversions and renewals for the purposes of
the foregoing, one for each type of Interest Period).

         Section 2.10. Interest.

                  (a) Interest shall accrue on the outstanding and unpaid
principal amount of each Loan for the period from and including the date of such
Loan to but excluding the date such Loan is due at the following rates per
annum: (i) for Variable Rate Loans, at a variable rate per annum equal to the
Variable Rate plus the Margin; (ii) for LIBOR Loans, at a fixed rate equal to
the LIBO Rate plus the Margin for the period from and including the first day of
the Interest Period therefor to but excluding the last day of such Interest
Period; and (iii) for an Offered Loan, at a fixed rate equal to the Offered Rate
for the period from and including the first day of the Interest Period therefor
to but excluding the last day of such Interest Period. If the principal amount
of any Loan and any other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder or under
either Note shall not be paid when due (at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise), interest shall accrue on such amount to the fullest extent permitted
by law from and including such due date to but excluding the date such amount is
paid in full at the Default Rate for such type of Loan.

                  (b) The interest rate on Variable Rate Loans shall change when
the Variable Rate changes and interest on each such Loan shall be calculated on
the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed. Interest
on each Fixed Rate Loan shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days
for the actual number of days elapsed.

                  (c) Accrued interest on all types of Loans shall be due and
payable in arrears upon any payment of principal and on the last day of each
calendar month, commencing December 31, 1995, and on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date with respect to the Working Capital Loans and on the Maturity
Date with respect to the Term Loan; provided that interest accruing at the
Default Rate shall be due and payable from time to time on demand of the Bank.

         Section 2.11. Fees.

                  (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the Bank a
commitment fee on the daily average unused Working Capital Commitment (without
giving effect to Borrowing Base limitations) for the period from and including
the date hereof to the Revolving Credit Termination Date at a rate per annum
equal to one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%), calculated on the basis of a year
of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed. The accrued commitment fee
shall be due and payable in arrears upon any reduction or termination of the
Working Capital Commitment and on the last day of each March, June, September
and December, commencing on the first such date after the Closing Date.

                  (b) Advisory Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the Bank an
advisory fee in the amount of $69,793.34. The first nonrefundable installment of
the advisory fee in the amount of $15,000 was received by the Bank upon
acceptance by the Borrowers of the commitment letter. The second nonrefundable
installment of the advisory fee in the amount of $54,793.34 shall be fully
earned by the Bank on the Closing Date and shall be due and payable by the
Borrowers to the Bank on the Closing Date.

         Section 2.12. Payments Generally. All payments under this Agreement or
the Notes shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds not later than
1:00 p.m. Hartford, Connecticut, time on the relevant dates specified above
(each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have
been made on the next succeeding Banking Day) at the Lending Office of the Bank.
The Bank may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such
payment which is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of any
Borrower with the Bank. Until the Bank and the Borrowers otherwise agree, the
Bank shall debit the Parent's account number 9361886549 with the Bank for the
amount of any payment required hereunder, but the Bank may also debit any
ordinary deposit account of any Borrower if the amount in account number
9361886549 is insufficient to make any required payment. The Borrowers shall, at
the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note, specify to the
Bank the principal or other amount payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement
or such Note to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it
fails to so specify, or if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Bank may apply such payment as it may elect in its sole
discretion). If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any Note
would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Banking Day, such date shall be
extended to the next succeeding Banking Day and interest shall be payable for
any principal so extended for the period of such extension.

         Section 2.13. LIBOR Margins. The Margin that will apply to LIBOR Loans
is set forth below and is based upon the Borrowers' Adjusted Leverage Ratio as
at the end of the Borrowers' most recent fiscal quarter, as reported in
accordance with Section 6.8:

Margin adjustments resulting from such calculations will become effective on the
Banking Day following the date that such calculations are received by the Bank
after delivery in accordance with Section 6.8.

         Section 2.14. Interest Periods; Renewals.

                  (a) In the case of each Fixed Rate Loan, the Borrowers shall
select an Interest Period of any duration in accordance with the definition of
Interest Period in Section 1.1, subject to the following limitations: (i) no
Interest Period may extend beyond an Amortization Date unless, after giving
effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Loans having
Interest Periods which end after such Amortization Date shall be equal to or
less than the principal amount to be outstanding hereunder after such
Amortization Date; (ii) notwithstanding clause (i) above, no Interest Period
shall have a duration less than one month (in the case of a LIBOR Loan) or one
year (in the case of an Offered Loan), and if any such proposed Interest Period
would otherwise be for a shorter period, such Interest Period shall not be
available; (iii) if an Interest Period would end on a day which is not a Banking
Day, such Interest Period shall be extended to the next Banking Day, unless, in
the case of a LIBOR Loan, such Banking Day would fall in the next calendar month
in which event such Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding
Banking Day; (iv) no more than five Interest Periods may be outstanding at any
one time.

                  (b) Upon notice to the Bank as provided in Section 2.8, the
Borrowers may renew any LIBOR Loan on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor as the same type of Loan with an Interest Period of the same or
different duration in accordance with the limitations provided above. If the
Borrowers shall fail to give notice to the Bank of such a renewal, such LIBOR
Loan shall automatically become a Variable Rate Loan on the last day of the
current Interest Period; provided that the foregoing shall not prevent the
conversion of any type of LIBOR Loan into another type of Loan in accordance
with Section 2.5.

         Section 2.15. Offered Loans. From time to time, upon request of a
Borrower, the Bank may quote (orally or in writing) a fixed rate of interest (an
"Offered Rate") that would be applicable to designated principal amounts of the
Term Loan specified by such Borrower and for an Interest Period of a duration
specified by such Borrower. On the date of such quotation (or within such period
as shall be agreed upon by a Borrower and the Bank) a Borrower may deliver to
the Bank a written request (the "Offered Loan Request") in accordance with
Section 2.8 (which may be sent by facsimile), 

                                       51
<PAGE>   14
stating each Offered Loan and its amount, the Offered Rate quoted by the Bank
and the duration and first day of the Interest Period for such Offered Loan,
which day shall be the Banking Day on which such Offered Rate was quoted by the
Bank (or such other day as the Bank shall specify in making its quotation). If
such Offered Loan Request is timely and in accordance with the Bank's quotation,
the Bank will indicate its acceptance of and agreement to such Offered Loan
Request by signing a copy thereof and will send such copy to the Borrowers,
whereupon the designated principal amount referred to in such Offered Loan
Request shall become an Offered Loan on the date specified in such request and
the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of such designated
principal amount during the Interest Period specified in such Offered Loan
Request, at the Offered Rate specified in such Offered Loan Request. If,
however, the Bank does not sign and return to a Borrower a copy of such Offered
Loan Request within one Banking Day of the date of delivery thereof by a
Borrower to the Bank, then no such designated principal amount will become an
Offered Loan.

         Section 2.16. Interest Rate Protection. The Borrowers may enter into
Interest Rate Protection Agreements mutually satisfactory to the Borrowers and
the Bank. The obligations of the Borrowers to the Bank or one or more of its
affiliates under such Interest Rate Protection Agreements will automatically
constitute obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and will be secured
by any Lien granted under the Facility Documents pari passu with the other
obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.

         Section 2.17. Cash Bases GB Pledge Agreement. The Borrowers have
requested that the Cash Bases GB Pledge Agreement be amended within the
six-month period following the Closing Date to reduce the percentage of stock
pledged by the Parent to the Bank from 100% to 66%. The Bank is willing to enter
into such an amendment, in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, provided
that no Default or Event of Default then exists and the Bank receives an opinion
of British counsel in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank and such other
certificates as it may reasonably require.

                  ARTICLE 2. YIELD PROTECTION; ILLEGALITY; ETC.

         Section 3.1. Additional Costs.

                  (a) The Borrowers shall pay to the Bank from time to time on
demand such amounts as the Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it
for any costs which the Bank determines are attributable to its making or
maintaining any Fixed Rate Loans under this Agreement or the Notes or its
obligation to make any such Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount
receivable by the Bank hereunder in respect of any such Loans or such obligation
(such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein
called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which: (i)
changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to the Bank under this
Agreement or the Notes in respect of any of such Loans (other than taxes imposed
on the overall net income of the Bank or of its Lending Office for any of such
Loans by the jurisdiction in which the Principal Office or such Lending Office
is located); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, deposit
insurance or assessment, minimum capital, capital ratio or similar requirements
relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or
other liabilities of, the Bank (including any of such Loans or any deposits
referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.1); or (iii) imposes
any other condition affecting this Agreement or the Notes (or any of such
extensions of credit or liabilities). The Bank will notify the Borrowers of any
event occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle the Bank to
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) as promptly as practicable after it
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation.

                  (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of
this Section 3.1, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, the
Bank either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above
a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities
of the Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of
extensions of credit or other assets of the Bank which includes LIBOR Loans or
(ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of
liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if the Bank so elects by notice
to the Borrowers, the obligation of the Bank to make or renew, and to convert
Loans of any other type into, Loans of such type hereunder shall be suspended
until the date such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect, and the Borrowers
shall on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the
outstanding Loans of such type, either prepay such Loans or convert such Loans
into another type of Loan in accordance with Section 2.5.

                  (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of
this Section 3.1 (but without duplication), the Borrowers shall pay to the Bank
from time to time on request such amounts as the Bank may determine to be
necessary to compensate the Bank for any costs which it determines are
attributable to the maintenance by it or any of its affiliates pursuant to any
law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any interpretation, directive or
request (whether or not having the force of law and whether in effect on the
date of this Agreement or thereafter) of any court or governmental or monetary
authority of capital in respect of its Loans hereunder or its obligation to make
Loans hereunder (such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount
equal to any reduction in return on assets or equity of the Bank to a level
below that

                                       52
<PAGE>   15
which it could have achieved but for such law, regulation, interpretation,
directive or request). The Bank will notify the Borrowers if it is entitled to
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) as promptly as practicable after it
determines to request such compensation.

                  (d) Determinations and allocations by the Bank for purposes of
this Section 3.1 of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to subsections
(a) or (b), or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to subsection (c),
on its costs of making or maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or
on amounts receivable by, or the rate of return to, it in respect of Loans or
such obligation, and of the additional amounts required to compensate the Bank
under this Section 3.1, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations
and allocations are made on a reasonable basis; provided, however, that the Bank
shall provide ninety days' notice of any additional amounts required to
compensate the Bank under this Section 3.1 (the "Adjustment"), and the Borrowers
may thereafter attempt to negotiate the amount of the Adjustment in good faith
with the Bank within ninety days of the day on which the Borrowers are so
notified. If the Borrowers and the Bank are unable to agree on the amount of the
Adjustment within such ninety-day period, then the amount of the Adjustment
shall be the amount set forth in the aforementioned notice from the Bank to the
Borrowers. Whatever the final Adjustment may be, if the Bank shall still have
any Loans outstanding to the Borrowers upon the expiration of such ninety-day
period, then the Adjustment shall be effective retroactive to the date on which
the Borrowers first received notice of the Adjustment. The Bank shall not be
obligated to offer LIBO Rates with respect to Interest Periods commencing during
the period following any such notice and prior to agreement by the Bank and the
Borrowers as to the amount of the Adjustment.

         Section 3.2. Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if the Bank determines (which determination shall be
conclusive) that:

                  (a) quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits
referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.1 are not being
provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
determining the rate of interest for any LIBOR Loans as provided in this
Agreement; or

                  (b) the relevant rates of interest referred to in the
definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.1 upon the basis of which the rate of
interest for any LIBOR Loans is to be determined do not adequately cover the
cost to the Bank of making or maintaining such Loans; then the Bank shall give
the Borrowers prompt notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in
effect, the Bank shall be under no obligation to make or renew Loans of such
type or to convert Loans of any other type into Loans of such type and the
Borrowers shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
the outstanding Loans of the affected type, either prepay such Loans or convert
such Loans into another type of Loans in accordance with Section 2.5.

         Section 3.3. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for the Bank or its Lending
Office to (a) honor its obligation to make or renew LIBOR Loans hereunder or
convert Loans of any type into Loans of such type, or (b) maintain LIBOR Loans
hereunder, then the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof and the
Bank's obligation to make or renew LIBOR Loans and to convert other types of
Loans into Loans of such type hereunder shall be suspended until such time as
the Bank may again make, renew or convert and maintain such affected Loans and
the Borrowers shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period for
the outstanding LIBOR Loans, as the case may be (or on such earlier date as the
Bank may specify to the Borrowers), either prepay such Loans or convert such
Loans into another type of Loans in accordance with Section 2.5.

         Section 3.4. Certain Compensation. The Borrowers shall pay to the Bank,
upon the request of the Bank, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in
the reasonable opinion of the Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
expense which the Bank determines is attributable to:

                  (a) any payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of a Fixed
Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loan
(whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise); or

                  (b) any failure by the Borrowers to borrow, convert into or
renew a Fixed Rate Loan to be made, converted into or renewed by the Bank on the
date specified therefor in the relevant notice under Section 2.4, 2.5 or 2.14,
as the case may be.

         Without limiting the foregoing, such compensation shall include an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of: (i) the amount of interest which
otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, converted
or renewed or not borrowed, converted or renewed for the period from and
including the date of such payment, prepayment or conversion or failure to
borrow, convert or renew to but excluding the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert
or renew, to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan
which would have commenced on the date specified therefor in the relevant
notice) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein;
over (ii) with respect to a LIBOR Loan, the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by the Bank) the Bank would have bid in the London interbank market
for Dollar deposits for amounts comparable to such principal amount and
maturities comparable to such period, and with respect to an Offered Loan, the
rate determined by the Bank to be its marginal cost of funds for commonly
available liabilities issued by it on the date of such Loan for a term


                                       53
<PAGE>   16
comparable to such Interest Period. A determination of the Bank as to the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

                         ARTICLE 4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         Section 4.1. Documentary Conditions Precedent. The obligation of the

1, 1995, and the related consolidated and consolidating income statement and
statements of cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity of the Borrowers
and their Consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended, and the
accompanying footnotes, together with the opinion thereon as to the consolidated
statements, of Price Waterhouse, independent certified public accountants, and
the interim consolidated and consolidating balance sheet of the Borrowers and
their Consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 1995, and the related
consolidated and consolidating income statement and statements of cash flows and
changes in stockholders' equity for the six-month period then ended, copies of

and their Consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered by such statements,
all in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (subject to year-end
adjustments in the case of the interim financial statements). There are no
liabilities of the Borrowers or any of their Consolidated Subsidiaries, fixed or
contingent, which are material but are not reflected in the financial statements
or in the notes thereto, other than liabilities arising in the ordinary course
of business since April 1, 1995. No information, exhibit or report furnished by
the Borrowers to the Bank in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement
contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact
or any fact necessary to make the statement contained therein not materially
misleading. Since April 1, 1995, there has been no material adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise), business, operations or prospects of any
Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries.

         Section 5.6. Ownership and Liens. Such Borrower and each of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries has title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of
its properties and assets, real and personal, including the properties and
assets, and leasehold interests reflected in the financial statements referred

ordinary course of business), and none of the properties and assets owned by

         Section 5.7. Taxes. Such Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has
filed all tax returns (federal, state and local) required to be filed and has
paid all taxes, assessments and governmental charges and levies thereon to be
due, including interests and penalties. Absent fraud, the years still subject to
audit by the Internal Revenue Service are the taxable years ending 1991, 1992,

Borrower, each Multiemployer Plan, is in compliance in all material respects
with, and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with, the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable federal or
state law, and no event or condition is occurring or exists concerning which
such Borrower would be under an obligation to furnish a report to the Bank in
accordance with Section 6.8(k) hereof. As of the most recent valuation date for
each Plan, each Plan was "fully funded," which for purposes of this Section 5.8
shall mean that the fair market value of the assets of the Plan is not less than
the present value of the accrued benefits of all participants in the Plan,
computed on a Plan termination basis. To the best knowledge of such Borrower, no
Plan has ceased being fully funded as of the date these representations are made
with respect to any Loan under this Agreement.

complete and accurate list of the Subsidiaries of such Borrower, showing the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and showing the
percentage of such Borrower's ownership of the outstanding stock or other
interest of each such Subsidiary. All of the outstanding capital stock or other
interest of each such Subsidiary has been validly issued, is fully paid and
nonassessable and is owned by such Borrower free and clear of all Liens.

         Section 5.10. Credit Arrangements. Schedule 5.10 is a complete and
correct list of all credit agreements, indentures, purchase agreements,
guaranties, Capital Leases and other investments, agreements and arrangements
presently in effect providing for or relating to extensions of credit (including
agreements and arrangements for the issuance of letters of credit or for
acceptance financing) in respect of which such Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is in any manner directly or contingently obligated; and the

citation, summons or order has been issued, no complaint has been filed, no
penalty has been assessed and no investigation or review is pending or

                                       57
<PAGE>   20
its Subsidiaries would be required to place any notice or restriction relating

nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any indenture, loan or credit
agreement or any lease or other agreement or instrument or subject to any

been amended or otherwise modified, and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with
its terms. There exists no default in respect of any such Subordinated Debt.

immediately due and payable without notice, presentment, demand, protest or
other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrowers.

                            ARTICLE 10. MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 10.1. Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the Borrowers and the Bank,
and any provision of this Agreement may be waived by the Borrowers and the Bank.
No failure on the part of the Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

         Section 10.2. Usury. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the Notes shall be
subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to the
extent that receipt thereof would be contrary to provisions of law applicable to
the Bank limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by the
Bank.

         Section 10.3. Expenses. The Borrowers shall reimburse the Bank on
demand for all reasonable costs, expenses and charges (including, without
limitation, telephone, telex, courier expenses, printing costs, reasonable fees
and charges of external legal counsel for the Bank and reasonable costs
allocated after the Closing Date by its internal legal department) incurred by
the Bank in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery,
filing, recording, performance, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of
this Agreement, the Notes or any Facility Document. The Borrowers agree to
indemnify the Bank and its directors, officers, employees and agents from, and
hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses incurred by any of them arising out of or by reason of any
investigation or litigation or other proceedings (including any threatened
investigation or litigation or other proceedings) relating to any actual or
proposed use by the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of the proceeds of the Loans,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
incurred in connection with any such investigation or litigation or other
proceedings (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Person to be indemnified).

         Section 10.4. Survival. The obligations of the Borrowers under Section
10.3 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the
Commitments.

         Section 10.5. Assignment; Participations. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Borrowers, the Bank and
their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or
transfer its rights or obligations hereunder. The Bank may assign, or sell
participations in, all or any part of any Loan to another bank or other entity,
in which event (a) in the case of an assignment, upon notice thereof by the Bank
to the Borrowers, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment
(unless otherwise provided therein), the same rights, benefits and obligations
as it would have if it were the Bank hereunder; and (b) in the case of a
participation, the participant shall have no rights under the Facility
Documents. The agreement executed by the Bank in favor of the participant shall
not give the participant the right to require the Bank to take or omit to take
any action hereunder except action directly relating to (i) the extension of a
payment date with respect to any portion of the principal of or interest on any
amount outstanding hereunder allocated to such participant, (ii) the reduction
of the principal amount outstanding hereunder or (iii) the reduction of the rate
of interest payable on such amount or any amount of fees payable hereunder to a
rate or amount, as the case may be, below that which the participant is entitled
to receive under its agreement with the Bank. The Bank may furnish any

                                       66
<PAGE>   29
information concerning the Borrowers in the possession of the Bank from time to
time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants); provided that the Bank shall require any such prospective
assignee or such participant (prospective or otherwise) to agree in writing to
maintain the confidentiality of such information.

         Section 10.6. Notices. Unless the party to be notified otherwise
notifies the other party in writing as provided in this Section, and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, notices shall be delivered in person or
sent by overnight courier, facsimile, ordinary mail, cable or telex addressed to
such party at its "Address for Notices" on the signature page of this Agreement.
Notices shall be effective: (a) on the day on which delivered to such party in
person, (b) on the first Banking Day after the day on which sent to such party
by overnight courier, (c) if given by mail, 48 hours after deposit in the mails
with first-class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, and (d) if given by
facsimile, cable or telex, when the facsimile, cable or telex is transmitted to
the facsimile, cable or telex number as aforesaid; provided that notices to the
Bank shall be effective upon receipt.

         Section 10.7. Setoff. The Borrowers agree that, in addition to (and
without limitation of) any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim the
Bank may otherwise have, the Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to offset
balances (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) held by it
for the account of any Borrower at any of the Bank's offices, in Dollars or in
any other currency, against any amount payable by any Borrower under this
Agreement or any Note which is not paid when due (regardless of whether such
balances are then due to such Borrower), in which case it shall promptly notify
the Borrowers thereof; provided that the Bank's failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity thereof.

         SECTION 10.8. JURISDICTION; IMMUNITIES. EACH BORROWER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY CONNECTICUT STATE OR UNITED
STATES FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN CONNECTICUT OVER ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY NOTE, AND EACH BORROWER
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH CONNECTICUT STATE OR FEDERAL
COURT. EACH BORROWER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS
IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES OF SUCH PROCESS TO
SUCH BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 10.6. EACH BORROWER AGREES
THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND
MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER
MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. EACH BORROWER FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO VENUE IN
SUCH STATE AND ANY OBJECTION TO AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH STATE ON THE
BASIS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS. EACH BORROWER FURTHER AGREES THAT ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT AGAINST THE BANK SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN CONNECTICUT STATE
OR UNITED STATES FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN CONNECTICUT. EACH BORROWER WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JURY TRIAL.

                  (a) Nothing in this Section 10.8 shall affect the right of the
Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the
right of the Bank to bring any action or proceeding against any Borrower or its
property in the courts of any other jurisdictions.

                  (b) To the extent that any Borrower has or hereafter may
acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether from service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid
of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
such Borrower hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes.

         Section 10.9. Table of Contents; Headings. Any table of contents and
the headings and captions hereunder are for convenience only and shall not
affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

         Section 10.10. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are
intended to be severable. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement
shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction,
such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity
or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions
hereof in any jurisdiction.

                                       67

         Section 10.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument, and any party hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any
such counterpart.

         Section 10.12. Integration. The Facility Documents set forth the entire
agreement between the parties hereto relating to the transactions contemplated
thereby and supersede any prior oral or written statements or agreements with
respect to such transactions.

         SECTION 10.13. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF
CONNECTICUT.

         Section 10.14. Confidentiality. The Bank agrees (on behalf of itself
and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives)
to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in accordance with safe and
sound banking practices, any nonpublic information supplied to it by the
Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement which is identified by the Borrowers as
being confidential at the time the same is delivered to the Bank, provided that
nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such information (i) to the
extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, (ii) to
counsel for the Bank, (iii) to bank examiners, auditors or accountants, (iv) in
connection with any litigation to which the Bank is a party or (v) to any
assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) so long as such
assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of such information; and provided finally that in
no event shall the Bank be obligated or required to return any materials
furnished by the Borrowers.

         Section 10.15. Treatment of Certain Information. Each Borrower (a)
acknowledges that services may be offered or provided to it (in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise) by the Bank or by one or more of its subsidiaries
or affiliates and (b) acknowledges that information delivered to the Bank by any
Borrower may be provided to each such subsidiary and affiliate.

         SECTION 10.16. COMMERCIAL WAIVER. EACH BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE
LOANS EVIDENCED BY THE NOTES ARE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
NOTICE AND HEARING UNDER SECTIONS 52-278a THROUGH 52-278n OF THE CONNECTICUT
GENERAL STATUTES AS NOW OR HEREAFTER AMENDED AND AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY OF THE
BANK, OR ANY SUCCESSOR THERETO, TO ISSUE A WRIT OF PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT
COURT ORDER. FURTHER, EACH BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, THE BENEFITS OF ALL VALUATION, APPRAISEMENTS, HOMESTEAD, EXEMPTION, STAY,
REDEMPTION AND MORATORIUM LAWS NOW IN FORCE OR WHICH MAY HEREAFTER BECOME LAWS.
EACH BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT MAKES THESE WAIVERS AND THE WAIVERS CONTAINED
IN SECTION 10.8 KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND ONLY AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSIDERATION OF
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THESE WAIVERS WITH ITS ATTORNEYS.

         SECTION 10.17. Multiple Borrowers.

                  (a) It is understood and agreed by each Borrower that the
handling of this credit facility on a joint borrowing basis as set forth in this
Agreement is solely as an accommodation to the Borrowers and at their request,
and that the Bank shall not incur liability to the Borrowers as a result
thereof. To induce the Bank to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower
hereby agrees to indemnify the Bank and to hold the Bank harmless from and
against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and claims of damage
or injury asserted against the Bank by any Borrower or by any other Person
arising from or incurred by reason of the Bank's handling of the financing
arrangements of the Borrowers as provided herein, reliance by the Bank on any
request or instruction from the Parent or any other Borrower or any other action
taken by the Bank with respect to this Section 10.17.

                  (b) Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Bank that the
request for joint handling of the Loans to be made by the Bank hereunder was
made because the Borrowers are engaged in an integrated operation which required
financing on a basis permitting the availability of credit from time to time to
each Borrower as required for the continued successful operation of each
Borrower of the integrated operation of the Borrowers. Each Borrower expects to
derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from such availability because the
successful operation of the Borrowers is dependent on the continued successful
performance of the functions of the integrated group.

                  (c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates the Parent as
its attorney to borrow, sign and endorse notes, and execute and deliver all
instruments, documents, writings and further assurances now or hereafter
required hereunder, on behalf of each Borrower, and does hereby authorize the
Bank to pay over or credit all Loan proceeds hereunder to the Parent as the
Borrowers' attorney in fact, recognizing, however, that Lender is not bound by
such authorization and may elect either to disburse loan proceeds to each
Borrower directly for its use, to the Parent as attorney for

                                       68
<PAGE>   31
any Borrower or to the Parent for its own account, in which case the Parent may
advance or lend such proceeds to the other Borrowers. Each Borrower further
agrees that all obligations hereunder or referred to herein or under any other
Facility Document shall be joint and several, and that each Borrower shall make
payment upon any notes issued pursuant hereto and any and all other obligations
hereunder or referred to herein or under any other Facility Document upon their
maturity by acceleration or otherwise, and that such obligation and liability on
the part of each Borrower shall in no way be affected by any extensions,
renewals and forbearances granted by the Bank to any Borrower, failure of the
Bank to give any Borrower notice of borrowing or any other notice, any failure
of the Bank to pursue or preserve its rights against any other Borrower, the
release by the Bank of any collateral now or hereafter acquired from any
Borrower, failure of the Bank to realize upon such collateral in a commercially
reasonable manner, and that such agreement by each Borrower to pay upon any
notice issued pursuant hereto is unconditional and unaffected by prior recourse
by the Bank to the other Borrowers or any collateral for such Borrowers'
obligations or the lack thereof.

                  (d) Each Borrower hereby grants a right of contribution to
each other Borrower for any amount paid by such other Borrower in satisfaction
of any obligations under this Agreement, any Note or any other Facility
Document; provided, however, that the aggregate of the rights of contribution
against any Borrower hereunder shall not exceed such Borrower's net worth. In
calculating the net worth of any Borrower for purposes of this paragraph, such
Borrower's obligations under the Facility Documents will not be included in its
liabilities and such Borrower's rights of contribution against other Borrowers
for amounts paid under the Facility Documents will not be included in its
assets.

                  (e) All notices to, or other communications with, the
Borrowers or any one of them shall be sufficient if given to any of the
Borrowers. Although the Bank may require that all of the Borrowers or a
particular Borrower execute any document (including any Notice of Borrowing) in
any matter pertaining to this Agreement or any of the other Facility Documents,
any one of the Borrowers may bind all of the Borrowers and any document
(including any Notice of Borrowing) signed by any Borrower, and any and all
action taken by any Borrower, is sufficient to represent all of the Borrowers.
Without limiting the foregoing, any single Borrower may make representations and
warranties on behalf of all the Borrowers or any other Borrower, and such
representations and warranties shall be of the same force and effect as if made
directly by such other Borrowers.

         Section 10.18. Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall
not avoid the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default if such action is
taken or condition exists.

         Section 10.19. Time of the Essence. Time and punctuality shall be of
the essence with respect to this instrument, but no delay or failure of the Bank
to enforce any of the provisions herein contained and no conduct or statement of
the Bank shall waive or affect any of the Bank's rights hereunder.

         Section 10.20. Reference to and Effect on the Facility Documents.

                  (a) Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, on and after the
date hereof each reference in the Facility Documents to the Credit Agreement or
the Notes, shall mean and be a reference to this Credit Agreement as amended and
restated hereby or the Notes as amended and restated in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

                  (b) The Existing Credit Agreement is amended and restated in
its entirety by this Agreement and the "Notes" delivered under the Existing
Credit Agreement are amended and restated in their entirety by the Notes
delivered pursuant to this Agreement. The Bank shall use its best efforts to
deliver to the Borrowers on the Closing Date the Notes issued to the Banks under
the Existing Credit Agreement marked "REPLACED AND REISSUED"; provided, however,
that the failure to deliver said Notes to the Borrowers shall not adversely
affect the replacement of said Notes. All other Facility Documents shall remain
in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Security Agreement and all of the
Collateral described therein, the Pledge Agreement and all of the Pledged
Collateral described therein, the Cash Base GB Pledge Agreement and all of the
Charged Property described therein, and each other security document and all of
the collateral described in such security document, do and shall continue to
secure the payment of all Obligations or Secured Liabilities (as therein
defined), in each case as amended hereby and by the separate amendments to such
documents.

                  (c) The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this
Agreement shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of
any right, power or remedy of the Bank under any of the Facility Documents, nor
constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Facility Documents.

                                AMENDMENT NO. 1


                AMENDMENT dated as of March 15, 1996, among TRIDEX CORPORATION,
a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, ITHACA
PERIPHERALS INCORPORATED, a corporation organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware, ULTIMATE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the
laws of the State of New York, MAGNETEC CORPORATION, a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Connecticut, CASH BASES INCORPORATED, a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (collectively,
all such corporations being the "Borrowers" and each, individually, a
"Borrower"), and FLEET BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking
association organized under the laws of the United States of America (the
"Bank").

                                   Background

          A.              The Borrowers (other than Cash Bases Incorporated)
and the Bank have entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of December 15, 1995 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to
time, the "Credit  Agreement:).

          B.              The Borrowers have informed the Bank that they did
not meet certain of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement
for the period ended December 31, 1995, and have requested, among other things,
that the Bank waive its compliance with those covenants for that period.

          C.              The Borrower and the Bank have agreed to amend the
Credit Agreement as hereinafter set forth.

                                   Agreement

          In consideration of the Background, which is incorporated by 
reference, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

          SECTION 1.      Defined Terms.  Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.

          SECTION 2.      Amendments to Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement
is effective as of the date hereof and, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 5 hereof, is amended as follows:

               (a)        The definition of "Revolving Credit Termination Date"
contained in Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is deleted and the following 
is substituted therefor:

                 "Revolving Credit Termination Date" means June 30, 1997;
                 provided that if such date is not a Banking Day, the Revolving
                 Credit Termination Date shall be the next succeeding Banking
                 Day (or, if such next succeeding Banking Day falls in the next
                 calendar month, the next preceding Banking Day) or (ii) the
                 earlier date of termination of the Working Capital Commitment
                 pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof.

               (b)        The figure "$5,000,000" contained in the definition 
of Working Capital Commitment in Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is 
deleted and the figure "$3,000,000" is substituted therefor.

               (c)        The following is added after the phrase "outstanding 
F/E Credits" in the sixth line of Section 2.1 (c) of the Credit Agreement:

                 but in no event shall Working Capital Loans exceed the
                 aggregate outstanding amount of $3,000,000 from time to time

               (d)        Section 8.1 of the Credit Agreement is deleted and 
the following is substituted therefor: 

          Section 8.1.    Minimum Tangible Net Worth.  The Borrowers
          shall maintain at all times, as measured at the end of each fiscal
          quarter, a Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of not less than
          $5,500,000 (except for the quarter ended March 31, 1996, for which
          such Consolidated Tangible Net Worth  shall not be less than
          $5,250,000), and such minimum

                                       72

deposit funds with the Trustee equal to the then present value of the remaining
retirement benefit provided for in Paragraph 2 above. The Trust shall be
irrevocable, except that the Trust shall provide that any Trust assets remaining
after all retirement payments provided for in Paragraph 2 above have been made
shall revert to Tridex and the Trust shall also provide that prior to Mr.
Lukash's death, the Trust assets shall not be reachable by Tridex or its
creditors except in the case of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Tridex. The
Trust shall be in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

         As used herein, a "Change of Control Transaction" shall mean a change
in control of Tridex that results other than from a transaction or series of
transactions between or among two or more of Alvin Lukash, Leslie Lukash,
Mildred Lukash, Seth Lukash, Laura Lukash Knee and Samuel Knee (collectively the
"Lukash Group") and is of a nature that would be required to be reported (i) in
response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, or (ii) on a Form 8-K filed under the Exchange Act or (iii)
in any other filing by Tridex with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
provided that, without limitation, a Change of Control Transaction shall also be
deemed to have occurred if:

         (A) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
         the Exchange Act), other than a member of the Lukash Group, becomes a
         "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act),
         directly or indirectly, of securities of Tridex representing 25% or
         more of the voting power of the then-outstanding securities of Tridex;
         or

         (B) during any period of two consecutive calendar years there is a
         change of 40% or more in the composition of the Board of Directors of
         Tridex in office at the beginning of the period except for changes
         approved by at least two-thirds of the directors then in office who
         were directors at the beginning of the period; or

                                       79
<PAGE>   2
         (C) Tridex shall cease to be a publicly-owned corporation whose shares
         entitled to vote for the election of directors are listed on the
         American Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange.

         4. Calculation of Lump Sum Payment. The lump sum payment provided for
in Paragraph 3 above shall be calculated by applying a discount rate equal to
the applicable annual interest rate established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of an immediate
annuity distributable to a plan participant upon plan termination for the second
month preceding the month in which the Change of Control Transaction occurs.

         5. Status Under ERISA. This Agreement is intended to constitute a plan
that is funded and maintained by Tridex primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and Section 401(a)(1)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and
shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.

         6. Plan Administration. This Agreement shall be administered by the
Board of Directors of the Company which shall have full discretionary authority
to interpret the provisions of the plan and which shall, to the extent required
by ERISA, constitute the administrator of the pension benefit plan created
hereby. The Board may establish its own operative and administrative rules and
procedures in connection with this Agreement to the extent that they are
consistent with Section 503 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder.

         7. Withholding of Taxes. Tridex may withhold from any payments made
under this Agreement all federal, state, or local taxes as shall be required
pursuant to any law, regulation or ruling.

         8. Notices. Any notices or other communications under this Agreement
shall be sufficient if in writing and sent by registered or certified mail to
Lukash at the last address he has filed in writing with Tridex or in the case of
Tridex, at its principal executive offices.

         9. Non-alienation. Lukash shall not have any right to pledge,
hypothecate, anticipate or in any way create a lien upon any amounts provided
under this Agreement; and no benefits payable hereunder shall be assignable in
anticipation of payment either by voluntary or involuntary acts, or by operation
of law.

         10. Successor Tridex. This Agreement shall bind Tridex, its successors
and assigns. Subject to the provisions of Section 12, Tridex, shall use its best
efforts to require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of Tridex to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the
same manner and to the same extent that Tridex would be required to perform if
no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Tridex" shall
mean Tridex as hereinbefore defined and any successor to or assignee of all or
substantially all of its business and/or assets.

         11. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction or under any circumstances will be ineffective
to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only without invalidating
or rendering unenforceable the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction
or under such circumstances, and any such invalidity or unenforceable shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction or
under any other circumstances.

         12. No Assignment. This Agreement is personal in nature, and neither
this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned (whether
voluntarily or by operation of law) by either party without the prior written
consent of the other, and any purported assignment without such consent shall be
null and void.

         13. Modification. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
in a writing duly signed by each of the parties hereto.

         14. Waivers. The failure of either party to require performance of any
term or obligation of the Agreement, and the waiver by either party of any
breach of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of such terms or obligation
and will not foreclosure subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or
deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.

         15. Counterparts, Section Heading. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The section heading
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted
and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of
Connecticut, without any reference to the principals governing the conflict
applicable in that or any other jurisdiction.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
date and year first above written.
