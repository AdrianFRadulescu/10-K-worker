                                ITEM 1. BUSINESS
                                  THE COMPANY
 
     Virginia Electric and Power Company was incorporated in Virginia in 1909
and has its principal office at One James River Plaza, Richmond, Virginia
23219-3932, telephone (804) 771-3000. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion Resources), a Virginia corporation.
 
     Virginia Electric and Power Company is a regulated public utility engaged
in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy within
a 30,000 square mile area in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. It
transacts business under the name VIRGINIA POWER in Virginia and under the name
NORTH CAROLINA POWER in North Carolina. It sells electricity to retail customers
(including governmental agencies) and to wholesale customers such as rural
electric cooperatives and municipalities. The Virginia service area comprises
about 65 percent of Virginia's total land area, but accounts for over 80 percent
of its population. As used herein, the terms "Virginia Power" and the "Company"
shall refer to the entirety of Virginia Electric and Power Company, including,
without limitation, its Virginia and North Carolina operations, and all of its
subsidiaries.
 
     The Company has franchises or permits for electric operations in
substantially all cities and towns now served. It also has certificates of
convenience and necessity from the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the
Virginia Commission) for service in all territory served at retail in Virginia.
The North Carolina Utilities Commission (the North Carolina Commission) has
assigned territory to the Company for substantially all of its retail service
outside certain municipalities in North Carolina.

     The Company strives to operate its generating facilities in accordance with
prudent utility industry practices and in conformity with applicable statutes,
rules and regulations. Like other electric utilities, the Company's generating
facilities are subject to unanticipated or extended outages for repairs,
replacements or modifications of equipment or otherwise to comply with
regulatory requirements. Such outages may involve significant expenditures not
previously budgeted, including replacement energy costs.

     The Company had 10,344 full-time employees on December 31, 1995. A total of
3,746 of the Company's employees are represented by the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers under a contract extending to March 31, 1998.
 
     For additional information on significant corporate issues relating to the
utility business, see COMPETITION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES below.
 
     Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters
discussed in this annual report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements
which involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to regulatory,
economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the
Company's operations, rates, markets, products, services and prices, and other
factors discussed herein and in the Company's other filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
 
                                   REGULATION
 
GENERAL
 
     In a wide variety of matters in addition to rates, Virginia Power is
presently subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North
Carolina Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of
Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), the Army Corps of Engineers, and other federal, state and
local authorities. Compliance with numerous laws and regulations increases the
Company's operating and capital costs by requiring, among other things, changes
in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the
location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. The commissions
regulating the Company's rates have historically permitted recovery of such
costs.
 
     Virginia Power may not construct, or incur financial commitments for
construction of, any substantial generating facilities or large capacity
transmission lines without the prior approval of state and federal governmental
agencies having jurisdiction over various aspects of its business. Such
approvals relate to, among other things, the environmental impact of such
activities, the relationship of such activities to the need for providing
adequate utility service and the design and operation of proposed facilities.
 

 
<PAGE>
     On January 11, 1996, the Virginia Commission granted interim approval for
limited affiliate services between Virginia Power and a subsidiary, A&C Enercom,
Inc., in connection with the purchase by the subsidiary of certain assets of two
energy services businesses. On March 12, 1996, Virginia Power filed an amendment
to its application seeking approval of additional services and asset transfers
between it and the subsidiary.
 
     The City of Falls Church, Virginia has indicated that it intends to pursue
the establishment of a municipal electric system, and it sent the Company a
formal Request for Transmission Service pursuant to Sections 211 and 213 of the
Federal Power Act on January 11, 1995. Virginia Power has approximately 4,100
customers in the City. Mwh sales by customer class in Falls Church are:
Residential - 36,000; Commercial - 67,000; Industrial - 0; and Other - 5,000.
The Company denied the request and filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment
against the City with the Virginia Commission. The Commission has ruled that
Falls Church must seek approval from the Commission prior to implementing plans
to condemn Company facilities within the City. Revenues from retail sales within
the City of Falls Church account for less than .2% of the company's total
revenues. As a result, Virginia Power will not experience a material loss of
revenues or net income should a municipal electric system be created. No other
municipality has communicated to Virginia Power any interest in forming a
municipal electric system.
 
     On September 18, 1995, the Virginia Commission established a proceeding to
review and consider its policy regarding restructuring of, and competition in,
the electric utility industry. The Commission directed its Staff to investigate
the emerging issues in the industry and prepare a report of its findings and
recommendations on or before March 29, 1996. All interested parties may file
written comments and requests for oral argument in response to the Staff Report
on or before May 30, 1996.
 
     Various provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act) that could
affect the Company include those provisions encouraging the development of
non-utility generation, giving FERC authority to order transmission access for
wholesale transactions, requiring higher energy efficiency and alternative fuels
use, restructuring of nuclear plant licensing procedures and requiring state
regulatory authorities to give full rate treatment for the effects of
conservation and demand management programs, including the effects of reduced
sales. While the full impact of the Energy Act on the Company cannot at this
time be quantified, it is likely, over time, to be significant.
 
FERC
 
     On March 29, 1995, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would
require all FERC jurisdictional utilities to provide open access to the
interstate transmission system. Crucial elements of the Commission's proposal
included the following: all jurisdictional utilities must file
non-discriminatory open access transmission tariffs; utilities must take service
under the open access tariffs for their own wholesale sales and purchases of
electric energy; and utilities will be allowed the opportunity to recover
stranded costs. The Company filed its comments on August 7, 1995 and supported
the Commission's objective of promoting comparable open-access transmission
service. However, the Company urged the Commission to reconsider its proposal to
draft generic tariffs for the electric industry. The Company also challenged
FERC's authority to impose tariffs of general applicability and urged the
adoption of principles of comparability that it will apply to evaluate terms and
conditions of tariffs filed by utilities. The Company urged that any pro forma
tariffs included in the final rule should provide for comparable service at
rates that permit the utility to recover all its costs of service.

     See COMPETITION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES under BUSINESS and COMPETITION
under MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL
 
     From time to time, the Company may be identified as a potentially
responsible party (PRP) with respect to a Superfund site. EPA (or a state) can
either (a) allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation,
feasibility study and remedial action or (b) conduct the remedial investigation
and action and then seek reimbursement from the parties. Each party can be held
jointly, severally and strictly liable for all costs, but the parties can then
bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from their
insurance companies. As a result of the Superfund Act or other laws or
regulations regarding the remediation of waste, the Company may be required to
expend amounts on remedial investigations and actions. Although the Company is
not currently aware of any sites or events, including those sites currently
identified likely to result in significant liabilities, such amounts, in the
future, could be significant.
 
     Permits under the Clean Water Act and state laws have been issued for all
of the Company's steam generating stations now in operation. Such permits are
subject to reissuance and continuing review.
 


<PAGE>
     The Company is subject to the Clean Air Act (Air Act), which provides the
statutory basis for ambient air quality standards. In order to maintain
compliance with such standards and reduce the impact of emissions on ambient air
quality, the Company may be required to incur significant additional
expenditures in constructing new facilities or in modifying existing facilities.
The Company has completed its compliance plan for Phase II of the Clean Air Act,
with the exception of some additional studies concerning Phase II nitrogen oxide
(NOx) controls. The plan will involve switching to lower sulfur coal, purchase
of emission allowances and additional NOx and sulfur dioxide (SO2) controls.
Maximum flexibility and least-cost compliance will be maintained through annual
studies. Capital expenditures on Clean Air Act compliance over the next 5 years
are projected to be approximately $61 million. Changes in the regulatory
environment, availability of allowances, and emission control technology could
substantially impact the timing and magnitude of compliance expenditures.
 
     The Company continues to work with the West Virginia Office of Air Quality
concerning opacity requirements applicable to the Mt. Storm Power Station.
 
     For additional information on Environmental Matters, see Note Q to
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS and ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS below.

NUCLEAR
 
     All aspects of the operation and maintenance of the Company's nuclear power
stations are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are
subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and operation of a nuclear
unit may be suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or
safety so requires.
 
     From time to time, the NRC adopts new requirements for the operation and
maintenance of nuclear facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require
changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities.
If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it could result in
substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining the Company's
nuclear generating units.
 
     On July 18, 1995, the Virginia Commission instituted an investigation
regarding spent nuclear fuel disposal. It directed interested parties to provide
comments on legal and public policy issues related to spent nuclear fuel storage
and disposal, including, but not limited to, whether to allow utilities to
recover from ratepayers some or all money paid to the Nuclear Waste Fund
established by the Nuclear Policy Act of 1982, whether to establish an escrow
account for spent nuclear fuel storage and/or disposal, and whether utilities
should develop their own plans for storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
The Commission's Order Establishing Investigation recites that Virginia Power
has paid $343.6 million to the Nuclear Waste Fund through 1994, including $44.8
million in 1994, and that future payments could exceed $400 million assuming its
North Anna and Surry reactors continue to operate through the end of their
existing operating licenses. Virginia Power and others filed comments on October
31, 1995. On February 27, 1996, the Commission Staff filed its Report
recommending that adoption of a definitive policy on the spent nuclear fuel
disposal fee be delayed until (1) a ruling is forthcoming on pending litigation
which seeks to impose an obligation on the federal government to begin
acceptance of spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998, (2) the outcome
of proposed legislation which would amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to
require the development of a centralized interim storage facility has been
determined, and (3) a vision of the likely outcome of the electric utility
industry's restructuring efforts has been more fully conceptualized.

CONSTRUCTION AND NUCLEAR FUEL EXPENDITURES
     Virginia Power's estimated construction and nuclear fuel expenditures,
including Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC), for the three-year
period 1996-1998, total $1.6 billion. It has adopted a 1996 budget for
construction and nuclear fuel expenditures as set forth below:

generated funds, the Company retired $312.3 million of securities through
mandatory debt maturities and retired an additional $126.7 million of securities
through optional redemptions. The Company's long-term financings included $200
million of First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, $40 million of unsecured
Medium-Term Notes, and $135 million of Preferred Securities issued by a
subsidiary trust.
 
     Effective September 1, 1995, a $300 million revolving credit facility was
established to support the Company's commercial paper program, replacing the
Inter-Company Credit Agreement with Dominion Resources. At December 31, 1995,
$169 million of commercial paper was outstanding.
 
     Virginia Power's 1996 construction and nuclear fuel requirements, exclusive
of AFC, are estimated to be $569 million. Debt maturities in 1996 will total
$259.6 million. It is expected that approximately $601 million will be obtained
from cash flow from operations. The remaining $227.6 million of capital
requirements will be obtained by a combination of sales of securities and
short-term borrowings.

     Substantially all of the Company's electric sales are subject to recovery
of changes in fuel costs either through fuel adjustment factors or periodic
adjustments to base rates, each of which requires prior regulatory approval.
 

 
<PAGE>
     Each of these jurisdictions has the authority to disallow recovery of costs
it determines to be excessive or imprudently incurred. Various cost items may be
reviewed on occasion, including costs of constructing or modifying facilities,
on-going purchases of capacity or providing replacement power during generating
unit outages.
     The principal rate proceedings in which the Company was involved in 1995
are described below by jurisdiction. Rate relief obtained by the Company is
frequently less than requested.
 
VIRGINIA
 
     On January 13, 1995, the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed a decision of
the Virginia Commission in Virginia Power's 1992 rate case that disallowed rate
recovery of the gross receipts tax component of certain purchased power costs.
On March 3, 1995, the Court denied the motions of Virginia Power and certain
industrial cogenerators for a rehearing, and on October 2, 1995, the United
States Supreme Court denied the Writ of Certiorari sought by those cogenerators.
 
     On April 20, 1995, the Virginia Commission declined to approve Virginia
Power's proposed Schedule DEF -- Dispersed Energy Facility, a rate schedule that
would have allowed the Company to respond to the request of an industrial or
commercial customer to build and operate a generating facility at its business
location and to sell to that customer all of the electricity and associated
steam from that facility under a long-term contract. The Commission stated that
the scope of the proposal was not an appropriate experiment under Virginia law,
and that, without a specific construction proposal before it, the Commission
could not approve the concept. The Commission stated, however, that upon a
proper record it would consider the public interest of allowing a DEF-type
facility to be constructed. Virginia Power subsequently negotiated a specific
DEF arrangement with Chesapeake Paper Products Company, and on December 18,
1995, it applied to the Virginia Commission for the approvals required for that
arrangement. (See COMPETITION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES below).
 
     The Staff of the Virginia Commission has, in Virginia Power's Annual
Informational Filing proceeding for 1994, recommended that there be imputed to
Virginia Power for ratemaking purposes income reflecting (a) the estimated value
of credit support that Dominion Resources' nonutility subsidiaries allegedly
receive from Virginia Power and (b) the income earned by Dominion Resources on
the invested proceeds of its unallocated equity for which Virginia Power
provides the funds for payment of dividends. Virginia Power filed a response
opposing these recommendations. The Staff's reply agreed with Virginia Power
that no decision on these issues is required in the pending proceeding. On
February 23, 1996, the Commission issued its Order, finding that the Company did
not earn outside of its authorized range for the calendar year 1994, and
indicating that it will investigate the described issues further in a subsequent
proceeding. The Commission Order also approved higher collection levels for
decommissioning of nuclear plants.
 
     On April 20, 1995, the Virginia Commission authorized Virginia Power to
implement a pilot program providing a real time pricing (RTP) option for its
industrial customers with loads in excess of 10 MW. Under this option, all or a
portion of an industrial customer's load growth would be supplied at projected
incremental hourly production costs, adjusted for line losses and taxes, plus a
margin of 0.6 cents per Kwh. Additionally, a marginal cost-based Generation
Capacity Adder and a Transmission Capacity Adder would be applicable during
those hours when the Virginia Power system is approaching its forecasted annual
peak demand. Up to 20% of an industrial customer's existing load could be served
on an RTP basis if the customer executes a five-year contract for such service.
 
     On September 19, 1995, Virginia Power filed an application to revise its
annual fuel factor. The Company proposed that the present fuel factor be
decreased by $97.1 million. The Staff of the Virginia Commission proposed
certain adjustments, which Virginia Power did not oppose, resulting in a
recommended reduction of $107.3 million. On October 31, 1995, the Virginia
Commission approved the reduction of $107.3 million, effective November 1, 1995.
 
NORTH CAROLINA
 
     On February 13, 1995, the Supreme Court of North Carolina denied Virginia
Power's motion for rehearing of the appeal of its 1992 North Carolina rate case,
which disallowed recovery of certain capacity costs paid to a cogenerator and a
portion of the compensation of certain Company officers. On May 15, 1995,
Virginia Power filed with the United States Supreme Court a Petition for a Writ
of Certiorari asking the Court to reverse the North Carolina Court's decision as
to the recovery of capacity costs. On January 22, 1996, the United States
Supreme Court denied the Writ of Certiorari sought by the Company.
 
     On June 27, 1995, the North Carolina Commission approved a Self-Generation
Deferral Rate that is a part of an Energy Agreement between the Company and
Weyerhaeuser. The agreement involves the use of a negotiated pricing structure
which will result in the deferral of the installation of additional
self-generation facilities by Weyerhaeuser. The rate to be charged
 

 
<PAGE>
must be prefiled each year, and the Company is prohibited from recovering from
other customers the difference between the new rate and the rate that
Weyerhaeuser would otherwise have been charged.
     On September 15, 1995, Virginia Power filed an application with the North
Carolina Commission for approval of a $1.3 million annual increase in fuel
rates. On December 8, 1995, the Commission approved an increase of $.8 million
reflecting a disallowance of $.5 million by reason of resolution of issues
surrounding the renegotiation of a coal transportation contract with CSX
Transportation, Inc.

     For information as to energy supply mix and the average fuel cost of energy
supply, see RESULTS OF OPERATIONS under MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
NUCLEAR OPERATIONS AND FUEL SUPPLY
 
     In 1995, the Company's four nuclear units achieved a combined capacity
factor of 85.4 percent.
 
     The North Anna Unit 2 steam generator replacement project was completed in
1995 at a total Company cost of $96 million.
 
     The Company utilizes both long-term contracts and spot purchases to support
its needs for nuclear fuel. Virginia Power's nuclear fuel supply and related
services are expected to be adequate to support current and planned nuclear
generation requirements. The Company continually evaluates worldwide market
conditions in order to obtain an adequate nuclear fuel supply. Current
agreements, inventories and market availability should support planned fuel
cycles throughout the remainder of the 1990s.
 
     On-site spent nuclear fuel storage at the Surry Power Station is adequate
for the Company's needs through 1998 when, in accordance with the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act, the DOE is to begin acceptance of spent fuel for disposal. Should
acceptance be delayed, incremental dry storage facilities will be added under
the existing storage license. North Anna Power Station will require an interim
spent fuel storage facility in the late 1990's. The Company submitted a license
application to the NRC in May 1995 for such a facility at North Anna.
 
     For details regarding nuclear insurance and certain related contingent
liabilities as well as a NRC rule that requires proceeds from certain insurance
policies to be used first to pay stabilization and decontamination expenses, see
Note C to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
 
FOSSIL OPERATIONS AND FUEL SUPPLY
 
     The commercial operation of Clover Power Station Unit 1 commenced on
October 7, 1995. The summer capability of Unit 1 has been determined to be 416
Mw.
 
     The Company's fossil fuel mix consists of coal, oil and natural gas. In
1995, Virginia Power consumed approximately 11.0 million tons of coal. As with
nuclear fuel, the Company utilizes both long-term contracts and spot purchases
to support its needs. The Company presently anticipates that sufficient coal
supplies at reasonable prices will be available for the remainder of the 1990s.
Current projections for an adequate supply of oil remain favorable, barring
unusual international events or extreme weather conditions which could affect
both price and supply.
 
     The Company uses natural gas as needed throughout the year for two combined
cycle units and at several combustion turbine units. For winter usage at the
combined cycle sites, gas is purchased and stored during the summer and fall and
consumed during the colder months when gas supplies are not available at
favorable prices. The Company has firm transportation contracts for the delivery
of gas to the combined cycle units. Current projections indicate gas supplies
will be available for the next several years.
 
PURCHASES AND SALES OF POWER
 
     Virginia Power relies on purchases of power to meet a portion of its
capacity requirements. The Company also makes economy purchases of power from
other utility systems when it is available at a cost lower than the Company's
own generation costs.
 
     Under contracts effective January 1, 1985, Virginia Power agreed to
purchase 400 Mw of electricity annually through 1999 from Hoosier Energy Rural
Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Hoosier), and agreed to purchase 500 Mw of
electricity annually during 1987-99 from certain operating units of American
Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP).
 
     On November 26, 1991, the Company and ODEC signed an agreement whereby the
Company will provide 100 Mw of firm capacity and associated energy until the
commercial operation of Clover Unit 2 (currently scheduled for April 1996) or
December 31, 1996, whichever occurs first.
 
     The Company has a diversity exchange agreement with APS under which APS
delivers 200 Mw to Virginia Power in the summer and Virginia Power delivers 200
Mw to APS in the winter.
 

 
<PAGE>
     Virginia Power also has 67 non-utility power purchase contracts with a
combined dependable summer capacity of 3,493 Mw. Of this amount, 3,295 Mw were
operational at the end of 1995 with the balance scheduled to come on-line
through 1998 (see Non-Utility Generation under FUTURE SOURCES OF POWER and Note
Q to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).
 
     Early in 1995, a wholesale power group was formed within the Company. Its
sole focus is the purchase and sale of wholesale electric power in the open
market. The wholesale power group has expanded the Company's trading range
beyond the geographic limits of the Virginia Power service territory, and has
recently developed trading relationships with utilities in Illinois, Missouri,
Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Vermont, Michigan, and Tennessee in addition to most
states in the Mid-Atlantic area.
 
                                INTERCONNECTIONS
 
     The Company maintains major interconnections with Carolina Power and Light
Company, AEP, APS and the utilities in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland
Power Pool. Through this major transmission network, the Company has
arrangements with these utilities for coordinated planning, operation, emergency
assistance and exchanges of capacity and energy.
 
     The Company and Appalachian Power Company (Apco) (an operating unit of AEP)
have each sought approval from the Virginia Commission to construct
interconnecting transmission facilities. Apco proposes to construct 116 miles of
765 Kv line to connect with Virginia Power's proposed 102 miles of 500 Kv line.
Virginia Power does not intend to build its facility unless the Apco facility,
which requires approval in West Virginia as well as Virginia, is also approved
and built. Approval of both facilities has been recommended by a Virginia
Commission Hearing Examiner. On December 13, 1995, the Virginia Commission
issued an Interim Order in the Apco case in which it found that additional
transmission capacity is needed but directed Apco to provide further information
as to routing, mitigation of visual impact, and uses of the line.
 
                            FUTURE SOURCES OF POWER
 
     As reported earlier, both the Hoosier 400 MW long-term purchase and the AEP
500 MW long-term purchase will expire on December 31, 1999. With the scheduled
termination of 900 MW of long-term purchases and continued system load growth,
the Company presently anticipates adding 1,400 MW of short-term (three-year)
purchases through the year 2000. The Company has and will pursue capacity
acquisition plans to provide that capacity and maintain a high degree of service
reliability. This capacity may be owned and operated by others and sold to the
Company or may be built by the Company if it determines it can build capacity at
a lower overall cost. The Company also pursues conservation and demand-side
management (see CONSERVATION AND LOAD MANAGEMENT below and CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
under MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS).
 
     In May 1990, the Company entered into an agreement with ODEC, under which
the Company purchased a 50 percent undivided ownership interest in a 832 Mw
coal-fired power station to be constructed near Clover, Virginia in Halifax
County. Construction of Unit 1 is complete and it achieved commercial operation
on October 7, 1995. The Company's 50 percent share of costs incurred through
December 31, 1995 amounted to $500.7 million. Construction of Unit 2 is on
schedule for completion in April 1996. The Company expects that completion costs
for Unit 2 will total $14 million.
 
     In March 1995, the Virginia Supreme Court upheld the May 1994 approval by
the Virginia Commission for a 75 mile 500 Kv transmission line from the Clover
Power Station to the Carson Substation in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. The
transmission line is now under construction and is scheduled for completion in
April 1996.
 
     The Company's continuing program to meet future capacity requirements is
summarized in the following table:

                     COMPETITION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
 
     In light of existing and potential threats and opportunities brought about
by increased competition in the wholesale and retail markets for electricity,
the Company has undertaken cost-cutting measures to maintain its position as a
low-cost producer of electricity, engaged in re-engineering efforts of its core
business processes, and pursued a strategic planning initiative, called Vision
2000, to encourage innovative approaches to serving traditional markets and to
prepare appropriate methods by which to service future markets. In furtherance
of these initiatives, the Company has established separate business units for
its nuclear operations, fossil and hydroelectric operations, commercial
operations as well as its energy services business. It has gained regulatory
approval of innovative pricing proposals for industrial loads in Virginia and
North Carolina, entered into an energy partnership with a key industrial
customer, executed long term contracts with wholesale customers, increased its
presence in a broader geographic market for wholesale sales of electricity, and
acquired an existing energy services business to enhance its national
participation in that market. (See Note P to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
 
WHOLESALE COMPETITION
 
     The Company has established long-term contractual service arrangements with
all of its major wholesale cooperatives and municipalities. These contracts
contain multi-year notice provisions. To date, the Company has not experienced
any material loss of load revenue or net income due to competition for its
traditional wholesale customers. In 1995 a wholesale power group was formed
within the Company to engage in the purchase and sale of wholesale electric
power. The group has expanded the Company's trading range beyond the geographic
limits of the Company's service territory and has developed trading
relationships with utilities throughout the eastern United States.
 
RETAIL COMPETITION
 
     At present, competition for retail customers is limited. It arises
primarily from the ability of certain business customers to relocate among
utility service territories, to substitute other energy sources for electric
power and to generate their own electricity. While the Energy Policy Act bans
federal orders of transmission service to ultimate customers, broader retail
competition that would allow customers to choose among electric suppliers is the
subject of intense debate in federal and state forums, both legislative and
regulatory.
 
     A Retail Energy Services group was formed in July 1995 and has begun
developing non-traditional products and services to offer to customers both
inside and outside the service territory. These products and services include
fuel procurement and risk management services, electrical equipment maintenance,
power quality control, on-site turnkey industrial power plant construction, and
energy conservation systems. In December 1995, the Company launched the name
EVANTAGESM for the retail energy services division to establish a national brand
identity for the business.
 
     In December 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with a key
industrial customer, Chesapeake Paper Products Company, to facilitate the
design, construction, and financing of a 38 Mw cogeneration plant, in order to
meet Chesapeake's energy requirements for its industrial processes and applied
to the Virginia Commission for the necessary approval of these arrangements. To
expand the offering of a range of energy services, the Company, in January 1996,
acquired two divisions of A&C Enercom of Atlanta, Georgia from Heartland
Development Corporation of Madison, Wisconsin. The Company has formed a
non-regulated subsidiary, A&C Enercom, Inc., which will provide marketing,
program planning and design, customer engineering and energy services consulting
to the utility industry. The new subsidiary has approximately 230 employees in
15 offices located in 13 states.

     In September 1995, the Virginia Commission launched an extensive
investigation into restructuring of and competition in the electric utility
industry. The scope of the investigation includes consideration of reliability,
continuity and stability of rates, fairness to all customers, fairness to
investors, and whether truly competitive markets that are in the public interest
can be developed. The outcome of the investigation could impact the extent to
which retail competition will exist within Virginia. In July 1995, the North
Carolina Utilities Commission declined to conduct an adversarial proceeding into
the question of whether retail competition should be allowed in North Carolina.
Instead, it is conducting an informal proceeding to gather information.
 
     The Company has initiated new programs aimed at meeting retail customers'
needs for increased flexibility and control of their electric costs. The Company
has implemented a real time pricing rate experiment for a five year period. The
voluntary rate is available to industrial customers with loads in excess of 10
Mw and allows a customer to move up to 20% of its existing load, plus any load
growth, to the hourly pricing rate. In 1995 the Company also implemented a
self-generation deferral rate for a North Carolina industrial customer,
Weyerhauser. As a result of the rate being approved, the Company will serve
approximately 25-30 Mw of new load through at least May 1, 1999.
 
     The Virginia Commission entered its Final Order on November 27, 1995 in the
Company's Petition for Declaratory Judgment against the City of Falls Church.
The Petition had been filed in light of Falls Church's municipalization proposal
and request for transmission service under Sections 211 and 213 of the Federal
Power Act. The Commission ruled that it has jurisdiction over the City and that
the City must seek approval from the Commission prior to implementing plans to
condemn Company facilities within the City. No other city has communicated to
the Company any interest in forming a municipal electric system.
 
CORPORATE RE-ENGINEERING
 
     The Vision 2000 strategic planning initiative has generated efforts aimed
at improving shareholder value as competitive threats intensify. Re-engineering
and remissioning efforts have included reducing the number of operating
divisions, consolidating district offices and closing business offices as work
practices have been re-engineered to reduce costs and promote flexibility.
 
     A review of Corporate Center functions has identified several activities
that were not core business functions and which were subsequently outsourced to
service providers. The Fossil and Hydroelectric Business Unit completed a
redesign effort in 1995. Re-engineering and restructuring efforts will continue
in the Corporate Center, Commercial Operations Business Unit, and Nuclear
Business Unit in an effort to improve the Company's competitive capabilities.
 
REGULATORY/LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY
 
     Consistent with implementation of other Vision 2000 efforts, the Company
has developed a regulatory/legislative strategy intended to establish an orderly
transition to a more competitive environment. The regulatory/legislative
proposals are aimed at achieving greater flexibility on the part of the Company
and the Virginia Commission in setting overall rate levels as well as in setting
rates for individual customers.
 
     For additional information, see COMPETITION under MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
                        CONSERVATION AND LOAD MANAGEMENT
 
     The Company is committed to integrated resource planning and has developed
a detailed analysis procedure in which effective demand-side and supply-side
options are both considered in order to determine the least cost method to
satisfy the customers' needs. Demand-side programs are selected annually at
Virginia Power through an integrated resource planning process which directly
compares the stream of costs and benefits from supply-side and demand-side
options. This process ensures the ultimate selection of a demand-side package
which reduces the need for additional capacity while efficiently using the
Company's existing generation facilities.
 
                               ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
     The Company owns its principal properties in fee (except as indicated
below), subject to defects and encumbrances that do not interfere materially
with their use. Substantially all of its property is subject to the lien of a
mortgage securing its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. Right-of-way grants
from the apparent owners of real estate have been obtained for most
 

 
<PAGE>
electric lines, but underlying titles have not been examined except for
transmission lines of 69 Kv or more. Where rights of way have not been obtained,
they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation if necessary. Many
electric lines are on publicly owned property as to which permission for use is
generally revocable. Portions of the Company's transmission lines cross national
parks and forests under permits entitling the federal government to use, at
specified charges, surplus capacity in the line if any exists.
 
     The Company leases certain buildings and equipment. See Note H to
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
 
     See COMPANY GENERATING UNITS under SOURCES OF POWER under Item 1. BUSINESS.
 
                           ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, the Company may be in violation of or in default under
orders, statutes, rules or regulations relating to protection of the
environment, compliance plans imposed upon or agreed to by the Company or
permits issued by various local, state and federal agencies for the construction
or operation of facilities. There may be pending from time to time
administrative proceedings involving violations of state or federal
environmental regulations that the Company believes are not material with
respect to it and for which its aggregate liability for fines or penalties will
not exceed $100,000. There are no material agency enforcement actions or citizen
suits pending or, to the Company's present knowledge, threatened against the
Company.

     Doswell Limited Partnership (Doswell) brought suit against Virginia Power
in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond alleging breach of contract and
actual and constructive fraud and seeking damages of not less than $75 million
arising out of a disagreement on the calculation of a Fixed Fuel Transportation
Charge to be paid to Doswell under a purchased power contract. The issues of
actual and constructive fraud were dismissed with prejudice, and on March 6,
1995, the Court entered its opinion in favor of Virginia Power. Doswell has
appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, and briefs have been filed. Oral
argument was held on January 12, 1996. On March 1, 1996, the Supreme Court of
Virginia affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court. On March 8, 1996, Doswell
filed notice of its intent to seek a re-hearing.

     On December 13, 1995, a civil action was instituted in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, against
the City of Norfolk and Virginia Power by a landowner who alleges that his
property has been contaminated by toxic pollutants originating on an adjacent
property now owned by the city and formerly owned by the Company. The plaintiff
seeks compensatory damages of $10 million and punitive damages of $5 million
from Virginia Power. Virginia Power and prior owners operated a gas
manufacturing plant on the property until 1968, when the plant was closed and
dismantled. Virginia Power sold the property to the city in 1970. The Company
filed its answer denying liability on January 10, 1996.
 
     A dispute over corporate governance issues between Dominion Resources, Inc.
and Virginia Power arose in 1994, and the Virginia Commission instituted a
proceeding concerning the holding company structure and the relationship between
the two companies. This proceeding was continued generally and has been inactive
since August 1994, when a related proceeding of broader scope was initiated by
the Commission. On February 20, 1995, Dominion Resources, Virginia Power and the
Commission Staff consented to an order in this proceeding under which Dominion
Resources must obtain the Commission's approval before taking steps such as
acting in the place of Virginia Power's Board of Directors or officers, removing
Virginia Power's Board members or officers or changing Virginia Power's articles
of incorporation or bylaws. The Order remains effective until July 2, 1996. On
April 12, 1995 the Staff of the Commission and its consultants filed a Final
Report, which contains a summary of the proceedings and numerous recommendations
by the consultants pertaining to the relationship between the two companies,
including recommendations relating to corporate governance issues, operating
relationships, including overhead allocations and financial controls, affiliate
service arrangements and transactions, compensation to Virginia Power for credit
support perceived by the consultants to flow to Dominion Resources and its other
subsidiaries, and possible regulatory tools for the Commission. In September
1995 Dominion Resources and Virginia Power each filed responses to the matters
addressed in the Final Report. The Staff is scheduled to file its final response
by March 15, 1996.
 
     At this time, Virginia Power is unable to predict the ultimate resolution
of these matters or their effect on the Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Cash flow from operating activities has accounted for, on average, 72% of
the Company's cash requirements over the past three years.
 
     With the near completion of the 832 Mw coal-fired power station near
Clover, Virginia, the Company has entered, in 1995, a period in which internal
cash generation will exceed construction expenditures. The internal generation
of cash in 1994 and 1993 provided 88% and 84%, respectively, of the funds
required for the Company's capital requirements.
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $107.1 million in
1995 as compared to 1994, primarily as a result of increased sales, partially
offset by a number of other factors resulting from normal operations.
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $4.6 million in 1994 as
compared to 1993, primarily as a result of a rate refund of $129.2 million in
1994, partially offset by a number of factors resulting from normal operations.
 
     Cash from (to) financing activities was as follows:

     The Company sold $200 million of First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds with an
annual stated interest rate of 8.25% in March 1995. The proceeds were used
primarily to pay a portion of mandatory debt maturities. The Company sold $40
million of Medium-Term Notes with an annual stated interest rate of 6.35% in
June 1995, the proceeds of which were used to meet a portion of the Company's
capital requirements. During the year the Company retired a total of $312.3
million of debt securities through mandatory maturities.

     In 1995 the Company issued $135 million of Preferred Securities of a
subsidiary trust. The proceeds were used to redeem 450,000 shares of the
Company's $7.20 Dividend Preferred Stock, 417,319 shares of the $7.30 Dividend
Preferred Stock, and 400,000 shares of the $7.45 Dividend Preferred Stock (total
principal value of $126.7 million) and for other capital requirements.
 
     In May and June 1995, the Company filed two shelf registration statements
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, one for $500 million of First and
Refunding Mortgage Bonds and the other for $200 million of Medium-Term Notes,
Series F, respectively, which combine to provide the Company with $700 million
in unused capital resources. In addition, the Company has a Preferred Stock
shelf, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for $100 million
in aggregate principal amount, which has not been utilized. The Company intends
to issue securities from time to time to meet its capital requirements.
 
     The Company has an established commercial paper program. Under the program
$300 million of commercial paper may be outstanding at any point in time. This
program is supported by a $300 million revolving credit facility which replaced
the Inter-Company Credit Agreement with Dominion Resources, Inc.. Proceeds from
the sale of commercial paper are primarily used to finance working capital for
operations. As of December 31, 1995, net borrowings under the commercial paper
program were $169 million.

</TABLE>
 
     Investing activities in 1995 resulted in a net cash outflow of $777.1
million primarily due to $519.9 million of construction expenditures and $57.6
million of nuclear fuel expenditures. Of the construction expenditures,
approximately
$42.7 million was spent on new generating facilities, $141.7 million on other
production projects, and $286.8 million on transmission and distribution
projects.
 
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
 
     The Company presently anticipates that kilowatt-hour sales will grow
approximately 2 percent a year through 2010. Capacity needed to support this
growth will be provided through a combination of Company-constructed generating
units, purchases from non-utility generators and other utility generators. Each
of these options plays an important role in the Company's overall plan to meet
capacity needs.
 
     The Company's construction and nuclear fuel expenditures (excluding AFC),
during 1996, 1997 and 1998 are expected to aggregate $569.3 million, $530.3
million and $530.8 million, respectively.
 
     Clover Unit 1 that is part of a two-unit facility jointly owned with ODEC,
began commercial operation in October 1995. The Company's fifty percent
ownership share was completed at a cost of $289.6 million. The Company's annual
depreciation and operations and maintenance expenses, for both units, are
estimated to be $15 million.
 
     Construction continues on Clover Unit 2 with an expected in-service date of
April 1996. The Company's share of the cost of construction is approximately
$225.1 million of which $14 million remains to be spent. After 1996, no new base
load generation is expected to be needed until the end of the next decade. From
2000 until 2009, the Company will need to add peaking or intermediate units to
meet anticipated demand.
 
     The Company will require $259.6 million to meet long-term debt maturities
in 1996. The Company presently estimates that, for 1996, all of its construction
expenditures, including nuclear fuel expenditures, will be met through cash flow
from operations. Other capital requirements will be met through a combination of
sales of securities and short-term borrowings.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The following is a discussion of results of operations for the years ended
1995 as compared to 1994, and 1994 as compared to 1993.
 
1995 COMPARED TO 1994
 
     Balance available for Common Stock decreased as compared to 1994, primarily
as a result of restructuring costs recognized during 1995. Without restructuring
costs, balance available for Common Stock in 1995 would have been higher by
$76.6 million.

</TABLE>
 
     As detailed in the chart above, the increase in revenues is primarily due
to the weather, I.E., increased heating and cooling degree days, experienced in
the last six months of 1995, increased customer growth and increased sales for
resale.
 
     During 1995, the Company had 44,955 new connections to its system compared
to 46,741 and 43,014 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

</TABLE>
 
     The increase in kilowatt-hour sales in 1995 as compared to 1994 reflects
increased customer growth and the weather experienced in the last six months of
1995, partially offset by the milder weather experienced in the first six months
of 1995. The increase in kilowatt-hour sales in 1994 as compared to 1993
reflects the extreme weather experienced in January 1994, partially offset by
lower sales during the second half of 1994 due to milder weather.
 
     The increase in sales for resale in 1995, as compared to 1994, was
primarily due to weather experienced by other utilities in surrounding regions
during the last six months of 1995 and increased marketing efforts by the
Company.

     RESTRUCTURING - as part of the Vision 2000 program (see Note P to
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), the Company recorded $117.9 million of
restructuring charges in 1995. Restructuring charges included severance costs,
purchase power contract cancellation and negotiated settlement costs, capital
project cancellation costs and other costs. As of December 31, 1995, no material
savings have been realized due to recently implemented, 1995 involuntary
staffing reductions. However, the Company estimates that these staffing
reductions will result in annual savings, net of outsourcing costs, in the range
of $50 million to $60 million. The Company will incur additional restructuring
charges in 1996. However, the amount of restructuring charges yet to be incurred
is not known at this time. Furthermore, because the Company's review of its
operations has not been completed, the amount of savings ultimately to be
realized cannot be estimated at this time. When realized, the savings will be
reflected in lower construction expenditures as well as lower operation and
maintenance expenses.
 
     OPERATION - OTHER AND MAINTENANCE decreased as compared to 1994. Expenses
during 1994 included payroll and voluntary separation costs for those employees
who elected to terminate service with the Company under the 1994 Early
Retirement and Voluntary Separation Programs, offset in part by recognition of
insurance policyholder distributions. Expenses in 1995 reflected a decrease in
payroll costs due to reduced staffing levels and weather-related overtime,
offset by 1995 salary increases and the impact of employees being reassigned
from capital to operation and maintenance activities. In addition, 1995 expenses
include expenses associated with the North Branch Power Station, increased
obsolete inventory costs, increased accruals for employee benefits, and
increased nuclear outage costs.
 
     INTEREST CHARGES - INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT increased as compared to 1994
primarily as a result of higher interest rates on First and Refunding Mortgage
Bonds and Pollution Control Notes.
 
     INTEREST CHARGES - OTHER increased in 1995 primarily as a result of a
reduction of $10.6 million in the interest accrued for prior years on certain
tax obligations in 1994.
 
  1994 COMPARED TO 1993
 
     OPERATION EXPENSES-OTHER increased as compared to 1993 primarily as a
result of recognition of costs associated with the Early Retirement and
Voluntary Separation Programs offered by the Company in 1994.
 
     INCOME TAXES-OPERATING decreased as compared to 1993 primarily as a result
of decreased pretax book income.
 
     INTEREST CHARGES-OTHER decreased in 1994 primarily as a result of a
reduction of $10.6 million in the interest accrued for prior years on certain
tax obligations.
 

 
<PAGE>
FUTURE ISSUES
 
UTILITY RATE REGULATION
     Regulatory policy continues to be of fundamental importance to the Company
and to its financial performance.
 
     The cost of purchased capacity constitutes a large category of cost
incurred in the Company's operations. The Virginia Commission has authorized
rates providing for the current recovery of the ongoing level of capacity
payments. Moreover, the Virginia Commission has established and reaffirmed
deferral accounting that is intended to ensure dollar for dollar recovery of
reasonably incurred capacity costs.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
     The Company is subject to rising costs resulting from a steadily increasing
number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect
human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future
planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital,
operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment
and monitoring obligations of the Company. These costs have been historically
recovered through the ratemaking process; however, should material costs be
incurred and not recovered through rates, the Company's results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MONITORING EXPENDITURES
 
     The Company incurred $68.3 million, $67.3 million and $72.2 million
(including depreciation) during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, in connection
with the use of environmental protection facilities and expects these expenses
to be approximately $68.3 million in 1996. In addition, capital expenditures to
limit or monitor hazardous substances were $23.4 million, $47.3 million and
$94.4 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The amount estimated for
1996 for these expenditures is $24.5 million.
 
CLEAN AIR ACT COMPLIANCE
 
     The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires the Company to reduce its
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides. Beginning in 1995, the
SO2 reduction program is based on the issuance of a limited number of SO2
emission allowances, each of which may be used as a permit to emit one ton of
SO2 into the atmosphere or may be sold to someone else. The program is
administered by the EPA.
 
     The Company has installed SO2 control equipment on Unit 3 at Mt. Storm
Power Station. The SO2 control equipment began operation on October 31, 1994.
The cost of this and related equipment was $147 million. The Company has
completed its compliance plan for Phase II of the Clean Air Act, with the
exception of some additional studies concerning Phase II nitrogen oxide NOx
controls. The plan will involve switching to lower sulfur coal, purchase of
emission allowances and additional NOx and SO2 controls. Maximum flexibility and
least-cost compliance will be maintained through annual studies. Capital
expenditures on Clean Air Act compliance over the next 5 years are projected to
be approximately $61 million. Changes in the regulatory environment,
availability of allowances, and emission control technology could substantially
impact the timing and magnitude of compliance expenditures.
 
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
 
     The possibility that exposure to electromagnetic fields emanating from
power lines, household appliances and other electric sources may result in
adverse health effects has been a subject of increased public, governmental and
media attention. A considerable amount of scientific research has been conducted
on this topic without definitive results. Research is continuing to resolve
scientific uncertainties. It is too soon to tell what, if any, impact these
actions may have on the Company's financial condition.
 


<PAGE>
  NUCLEAR OPERATIONS
 
     In 1995, the Company's four nuclear units operated at a combined capacity
factor of 85.4%, reflecting a world record 69 day refueling/steam generator
replacement outage at North Anna Unit 2, a 46 day refueling/10-year in-service
inspection outage at Surry Unit 2 and a 43 day refueling outage at Surry Unit 1.
Nuclear refueling outages typically occur every 18 months and last approximately
48 days. When nuclear units are refueled, the Company replaces the power from
nuclear generation with other more expensive sources. A reduction in the length
of an outage should result in increased availability of low-cost nuclear
generation, thereby lowering generation expenses. Three normal refueling outages
are currently scheduled in 1996. The Company's goal is to reduce future
refueling outages from an average of 48 days to 35 days.
 
     The NRC revised the nuclear power plant license renewal rules issued in
1991. The Company intends to work with industry groups on license renewal
programs, and apply for renewal of the current 40-year licenses by 1999.
 
     In addition to improving nuclear unit productivity and efficiency, the
Company has completed engineering analyses and evaluations to support uprating
the capability of the units. The plant modifications have been completed at both
North Anna and Surry. The upgraded core improvement at North Anna Power Station
has resulted in a 4.2% increase in the gross electrical output for each of the
units. A similar project for uprating Surry Units 1 and 2 was completed in 1995
and resulted in a 4.3% increase in the gross electrical output for each of the
units.
 
     For information on nuclear decommissioning, see Note C to CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
 
COMPETITION

     In light of existing and potential threats and opportunities brought about
by increased competition in the wholesale and retail markets for electricity,
the Company has undertaken cost-cutting measures to maintain its position as a
low-cost producer of electricity, engaged in re-engineering efforts of its core
business processes, and pursued a strategic planning initiative, called Vision
2000, to encourage innovative approaches to serving traditional markets and to
prepare appropriate methods by which to service future markets. In furtherance
of these initiatives, the Company has established separate business units for
its nuclear operations, fossil and hydroelectric operations, commercial
operations as well as its energy services business. It has gained regulatory
approval of innovative pricing proposals for industrial loads in Virginia and
North Carolina, entered into an energy partnership with a key industrial
customer, and in January 1996, acquired two divisions of A&C Enercom of Atlanta,
Georgia from Heartland Development Corporation of Madison, Wisconsin. The
Company has formed a non-regulated subsidiary, A&C Enercom, Inc., which will
provide marketing, program planning and design, customer engineering and energy
consulting services.

     As part of the Company's Vision 2000 initiatives, the Company developed a
regulatory/legislative strategy intended to establish an orderly transition to a
more competitive environment. The Company supported a number of legislative
proposals during the 1996 session of the Virginia General Assembly that are
aimed at achieving greater flexibility for the Virginia Commission and the
Company. All the proposals supported by the Company were passed in amended form
by both houses of the General Assembly. After passage, the Governor recommended
an amendment to one of the proposals, which was then considered and passed by
both houses. The remaining proposals await action by the Governor. The
legislation will:

     (Bullet)  allow the Virginia Commission to approve 1) alternative forms of
               regulation (including, but not limited to, price regulation,
               ranges of authorized returns, categories of services and price
               indexing) that may serve as a transition to a more market-based
               electric utility industry and 2) economic development rates and
               packages of incentive rates and services customized to meet
               individual customer needs;
 
     (Bullet)  facilitate a regulated utility's ability to enter into joint
               ventures and partnerships;
 
     (Bullet)  bring federal customer accounts served in Virginia under limited
               jurisdiction of the Virginia Commission, thus enabling the
               Virginia Commission to address any "stranded investment" issues
               that may arise due to changes in federal policy;
 
     (Bullet)  clarify that a local referendum must be held before
               municipalization of utility services can occur for services
               previously provided by a utility;
 
     (Bullet)  allow the Virginia Commission to establish for use in a
               condemnation proceeding the amount of stranded investment
               payment, if any, that is appropriate when a corporation
               possessing the power of eminent domain seeks permission to
               condemn the property of another corporation possessing the power
               of eminent domain.
 

 
<PAGE>
     The Company will continue to be affected by the developing competitive
market in wholesale power. Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, any participant
in the wholesale market can obtain a FERC order to provide transmission
services, under certain conditions. In 1995 a wholesale power group was formed
within the Company to engage in the purchase and sale of wholesale electric
power. The group has already developed trading relationships beyond the
geographic limits of the Company's retail service territory.
 
     In 1995, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) regarding
open-access transmission service and a NOPR regarding real-time information
networks and standards of conduct. The real-time information network would
provide transmission users data concerning the availability of transmission
service on a same-time basis. The Company filed comments in both proceedings
supporting FERC's objective to promote comparable open-access transmission
service, however, the Company urged FERC to rethink its suggestion of functional
unbundling to insure the continued reliability of the transmission system.
 
     At present, competition for retail customers is limited. It arises
primarily from the ability of certain business customers to relocate among
utility service territories, to substitute other energy sources for electric
power and to generate their own electricity. While the Energy Policy Act bans
federal orders of transmission service to ultimate customers, broader retail
competition that would allow customers to choose among electric suppliers is the
subject of intense debate, both legislative and regulatory. If such competition
were to develop, it would have the potential to shift costs among customer
classes and to create significant transitional costs.
 
     Potential competition also exists for the Company's sales to its wholesale
cooperative and municipal customers. However, nearly all of this service is
under contracts with multi-year notice provisions. To date, the Company has not
experienced any material loss of load, revenues or net income due to competition
for its customers. The Company believes it has a strong capability to meet
future competition.
 
     The City of Falls Church, Virginia, has indicated that it intends to pursue
the establishment of a municipal electric system. In response to a Company
petition, the Commission has ruled that it has jurisdiction over the City and
that the City must seek approval from the Commission prior to implementing plans
to condemn Company facilities within the City. Revenues from retail sales within
the City of Falls Church account for less than .2% of the company's total
revenues. As a result, Virginia Power will not experience a material loss of
revenues or net income should a municipal electric system be created. No other
city has communicated to the Company any interest in forming a municipal
electric system.
 
     In accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation", the Company's financial statements reflect assets and
costs based on current cost-based ratemaking regulations. Continued accounting
under SFAS 71 requires that the following criteria be met:
 
          a) A utility's rates for regulated services provided to its customers
             are established by, or are subject to approval by, an independent
             third-party regulator;
 
          b) The regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of
             providing the regulated services or products; and
 
          c) In view of the demand for the regulated services and the level of
             competition, direct and indirect, it is reasonable to assume that
             rates set at levels that will recover a utility's costs can be
             charged to and collected from customers. This criterion requires
             consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or
             competition during the recovery period for any capitalized costs.
 
     A utility's operations or portion of operations can cease to meet these
criteria for various reasons, including a change in the method of regulation or
a change in the competitive environment for regulated services. A utility whose
operations or portion of operations cease to meet these criteria should
discontinue application of SFAS 71 and write-off any regulatory assets and
liabilities for those operations that no longer meet the requirements of SFAS
71. The Company's operations currently satisfy the SFAS 71 criteria. However, if
events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer
satisfied, management believes that a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations and financial position may result.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, which must be
adopted by the Company by January 1, 1996. This statement requires the Company
to review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable and requires rate-regulated companies to write-off regulatory assets
against earnings whenever those assets no longer meet the criteria for
recognition of a regulatory asset as defined by SFAS 71.
 
     The Company has operated and continues to operate in a regulated
environment. Under regulation, the Company's rates are intended to recover its
cost of providing service, including the opportunity to earn a return on
shareholder's investment.
 

 
<PAGE>
In this regulated environment, the Company's long-lived assets are generally
included in rate base and the depreciation thereof is included in cost of
service. As long as the Company continues to operate within cost-based
regulation and the Company's long-lived assets are provided for in the Company's
regulated rates, the Company would not experience impairment write-downs for
assets held and used in providing electric service.
 
     If, however, the service potential of an asset used in utility operations
is impaired by an adverse event, the Company would evaluate the nature of the
event and whether to seek specific rate recovery for that amount. If specific
rate recovery is permitted by regulators, the Company would recognize a
regulatory asset instead of charging the impairment write-down to operations.
 
     From time to time, the Company may decide to dispose of long-lived utility
assets previously used in operations but no longer needed. Under SFAS No. 121,
the Company will determine the fair value less the cost to sell such assets. To
the extent such amount is less than the carrying amount for that asset, the
Company would recognize a loss. If specific rate recovery is permitted by
regulators, the Company would recognize a regulatory asset instead of charging
the loss to operations.
 
     Based on the Company's current operating environment, adoption of SFAS 121
is not expected to have a material impact. However, as discussed under
COMPETITION, the Virginia Commission has established a proceeding to examine the
issue of competition and the regulatory framework in Virginia. In addition, FERC
has initiated proceedings to address open-access transmission policy. If future
regulatory reform should provide for a departure from cost-based regulation,
regulators, electric utilities and other parties involved in the restructuring
of the electric industry would face significant issues. One such issue is
concerned with potential "stranded investment." Stranded investment represents
costs incurred or commitments made by utilities under traditional cost-based
regulation based on an obligation to serve supported by an implicit promise to
recover prudently incurred costs that may not be reasonably expected to be
recovered. Regulatory assets recognized under SFAS 71, unrecovered investment in
power plants and commitments such as long-term purchased power contracts are
items that may become stranded investment if prices for electric services are
based on market rather than the cost of providing that service.
 
     The Company expects to continue to operate under regulation and to recover
its cost of providing traditional electric service. However, the form of
cost-based rate regulation, under which the Company operates, may evolve in the
future to accommodate changes in the industry and to address issues such as
recovery of potential stranded investment. At this time, Company management can
predict neither the ultimate outcome of the regulatory reform initiatives in the
electric utility industry nor the impact such changes would have on the Company.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
 
     The Company's management is responsible for all information and
representations contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other
sections of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial
Statements, which include amounts based on estimates and judgments of
management, have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Other financial information in the Form 10-K is consistent with that
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that the Company's assets
are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that
transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established
procedures. Management recognizes the inherent limitations of any system of
internal accounting control and, therefore cannot provide absolute assurance
that the objectives of the established internal accounting controls will be met.
This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to
ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and
training of qualified personnel and internal audits. Management believes that
during 1995 the system of internal control was adequate to accomplish the
intended objective.
 
     The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent auditors, who have been engaged by the Board of
Directors. Their audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards and included a review of the Company's accounting systems,
procedures and internal controls, and the performance of tests and other
auditing procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the
Consolidated Financial Statements are not materially misleading and do not
contain material errors.
 
     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed entirely of
directors who are not officers or employees of the Company, meets periodically
with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to discuss
auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters and to
ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. Both the
independent auditors and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the
Audit Committee and have free access to the Committee at any time.

     Management recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical
climate so that the Company's affairs are conducted according to the highest
standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is
characterized and reflected in the Company's Code of Ethics, which is
distributed throughout the Company. The Code of Ethics addresses, among other
things, the importance of ensuring open communication within the Company;
potential conflicts of interest; compliance with all domestic and foreign laws,
including those relating to financial disclosure; the confidentiality of
proprietary information; and full disclosure of public information.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
To the Board of Directors of Virginia Electric and Power Company:
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Virginia
Electric and Power Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources,
Inc.) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of income, earnings reinvested in business, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the companies at December 31,
1995 and 1994 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

                      VIRGINIA ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
 
GENERAL
 
     Virginia Electric and Power Company is a regulated public utility engaged
in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy within
a 30,000 square mile area in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. It sells
electricity to retail customers (including governmental agencies) and to
wholesale customers such as rural electric cooperatives and municipalities. The
Virginia service area comprises about 65 percent of Virginia's total land area,
but accounts for over 80 percent of its population.
 
     The Company's accounting practices are generally prescribed by the Uniform
System of Accounts promulgated by the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction
and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable
to regulated enterprises.
 
     The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries, with all significant intercompany transactions and accounts being
eliminated on consolidation.
 
     The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc., a
Virginia corporation.
 
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
REVENUES
 
     Operating revenues are recorded on the basis of service rendered.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

     Utility plant is recorded at original cost which includes labor, materials,
services, AFC, where permitted by regulators, and other indirect costs. The cost
of maintenance and repairs is charged to the appropriate operating expense and
clearing accounts. The cost of additions and replacements is charged to the
appropriate utility plant account, except that the cost of minor additions and
replacements, as provided in the Uniform System of Accounts, is charged to
maintenance expense.
 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
     Depreciation of utility plant (other than nuclear fuel) is computed on the
straight-line method based on projected useful service lives. The cost of
depreciable utility plant retired and the cost of removal, less salvage, are
charged to accumulated depreciation. The provision for depreciation is based on
weighted average depreciable plant using a rate of 3.2 percent for 1995, 1994
and 1993.
 
     Operating expenses include amortization of nuclear fuel, which is provided
on a unit of production basis sufficient to fully amortize, over the estimated
service life, the cost of the fuel plus permanent storage and disposal costs.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
 
     The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with Dominion
Resources.
 
     Deferred investment tax credits are being amortized over the service lives
of the property giving rise to such credits.
 
ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
 
     The applicable regulatory Uniform System of Accounts defines AFC as the
cost during the construction period of borrowed funds used for construction
purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used.
 
     The pretax AFC rates for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 8.9, 8.9 and 9.4 percent,
respectively. Approximately 83 percent of the Company's construction work in
progress is now included in rate base, and a cash return is collected currently
thereon.
 


<PAGE>
DEFERRED CAPACITY AND FUEL EXPENSE
 
     Approximately 80% of capacity expenses and 90% of fuel expenses are subject
to deferral accounting. The difference between reasonably incurred actual
expenses and the level of expenses included in current rates is deferred and
matched against future revenues.
 
AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS
 
     The Company defers and amortizes any expenses incurred in the issuance of
long-term debt, including premiums and discounts associated with such debt, over
the lives of the respective issues. Any gains or losses resulting from the
refinancing of debt are also deferred and amortized over the lives of the new
issues of long-term debt as permitted by the appropriate regulatory
jurisdictions. Gains or losses resulting from the redemption of debt without
refinancing are amortized over the remaining lives of the redeemed issues.
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
     Current banking arrangements generally do not require checks to be funded
until actually presented for payment. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the
Company's accounts payable included the net effect of checks outstanding but not
yet presented for payment of $62.7 million and $66.8 million, respectively. For
purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers cash
and cash equivalents to include cash on hand and temporary investments purchased
with an initial maturity of three months or less.
 
RECLASSIFICATION
 
     Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1993 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1995 presentation.
 
B. INCOME TAXES:
 
     Details of income tax expense are as follows:

C. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS:
 
DECOMMISSIONING
 
     Nuclear plant decommissioning costs are accrued and recovered through rates
over the expected service lives of the Company's nuclear generating units. The
amounts collected from customers are being placed in trusts, which, with the
accumulated earnings thereon, will be utilized solely to fund future
decommissioning obligations.

<PAGE>
     Approximately every four years, site-specific studies are prepared to
determine the decommissioning cost estimate for the Company's four nuclear
units. DECON assumes the activities associated with decontamination or prompt
removal of radioactive contaminants will begin shortly after cessation of
operations so that the property may be released for unrestricted use.
 
     The accumulated provision for decommissioning of $351.4 million and $260.9
million is included in Utility Plant Accumulated Depreciation at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively. Provisions for decommissioning of $28.5 million,
$24.5 million and $24.4 million applicable to 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
are included in Depreciation and Amortization Expense. The net unrealized gain
of $40.7 million and net unrealized loss of $5.2 million associated with
securities held by the Company's Nuclear Decommissioning trust at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively, are included in the accumulated provision for
decommissioning.
 
     Earnings of the trust funds were $15.9 million, $15.2 million and $16.3
million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and are included in Other Income
in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The accretion of the
accumulated provision for decommissioning, equal to the earnings of the trust
funds, is also recorded in Other Income.
 
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is reviewing the accounting
for nuclear plant decommissioning. If current electric utility industry
practices for such decommissioning are changed, annual provisions for
decommissioning could increase. FASB has tentatively determined that the
estimated cost of decommissioning should be reported as a liability rather than
as accumulated depreciation and that a substantial portion of the
decommissioning obligation should be recognized earlier in the operating life of
the nuclear plant.
 
     During its deliberations, FASB has expanded the scope of this project to
include similar unavoidable obligations to perform closure and post-closure
activities incurred as a condition to operate assets other than nuclear power
plants. Whether this position, if adopted, would impact other assets of the
Company cannot be determined at this time. Furthermore, the FASB has tentatively
determined that it would be inappropriate to account for cost of removal as
negative salvage; thus, any forthcoming standard may also cause changes in
industry plant depreciation practices.
 
INSURANCE
 
     The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability of an owner of a nuclear
power plant to $8.9 billion for a single nuclear incident. The Price-Anderson
Amendments Act of 1988 allows for an inflationary provision adjustment every
five years. The Company has purchased $200 million of coverage from the
commercial insurance pools with the remainder provided through a mandatory
industry risk sharing program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any
licensed nuclear reactor in the United States, the Company could be assessed up
to $81.7 million (including a 3% insurance premium tax for Virginia) for each of
its four licensed reactors not to exceed $10.3 million (including a 3% insurance
premium tax for Virginia) per year per reactor. There is no limit to the number
of incidents for which this retrospective premium can be assessed.
 
     Nuclear liability coverage for claims made by nuclear workers first hired
on or after January 1, 1988, except those arising out of an extraordinary
nuclear occurrence, is provided under the Master Worker insurance program.
(Those first hired into the nuclear industry prior to January 1, 1988, are
covered by the policy discussed above.) The aggregate limit of coverage for the
industry is $400 million ($200 million policy limit with automatic
reinstatements of an additional $200 million). The Company's maximum
retrospective assessment is approximately $12.5 million (including a 3%
insurance premium tax for Virginia).
 
     The Company's current level of property insurance coverage ($2.55 billion
for North Anna and $2.40 billion for Surry) exceeds the NRC's minimum
requirement for nuclear power plant licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site
and includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total loss.
The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first to return
the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and stable condition and second to
decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by
the NRC. The Company's nuclear property insurance is provided by Nuclear Mutual
Limited (NML) and Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), two mutual
insurance companies, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments, in any
policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to these insurance
companies. The maximum assessment at the first incident of the current policy
period is $42.7 million and the maximum assessment related to a second incident
is an additional $15.4 million. Based on the severity of the incident, the
Boards of Directors of the Company's nuclear insurers have the discretion to
lower the maximum retrospective premium assessment or eliminate either or both
completely. For any losses that exceed the limits or for which insurance
proceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and
decontamination, the Company has the financial responsibility for these losses.
 

 
<PAGE>
     The Company purchases insurance from NEIL to cover the cost of replacement
power during the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to direct physical
damage of the unit. Under this program, Virginia Power is subject to a
retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed
funds available to NEIL. The current policy period's maximum assessment is $9
million.
 
     As part owner of the North Anna Power Station, ODEC is responsible for its
proportionate share (11.6 percent) of the insurance premiums applicable to that
station, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not
covered by insurance.
 
D. SALE OF RECEIVABLES:
 
     The Company has an agreement to sell, with limited recourse, certain
accounts receivable including unbilled amounts, up to a maximum of $200 million.
Additional receivables are continually sold, at the Company's discretion, to
replace those collected up to the limit. At December 31, 1995 no amount was
outstanding; however, at December 31, 1994, $160 million of receivables had been

     The co-owners are obligated to pay their share of all future construction
expenditures and operating costs of the jointly owned facilities in the same
proportion as their respective ownership interest. The Company's share of
operating costs is classified in the appropriate operating expense (fuel,
maintenance, depreciation, taxes, etc.) in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

G. REGULATORY ASSETS:
 
     Certain expenses normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance
sheet as regulatory assets and are recognized in income as the related amounts
are included in rates and recovered from customers. The Company's regulatory
assets included the following:
 
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                                                                              AT DECEMBER 31,
                                                                                                               1995      1994
<S>                                                                                                           <C>       <C>
                                                                                                                 (MILLIONS)
Income taxes recoverable through future rates..............................................................   $484.5    $488.2
Cost of decommissioning DOE uranium enrichment facilities..................................................     78.5      83.7
Deferred losses (gains) on reacquired debt, net............................................................     99.3     107.0
North Anna Unit 3 project termination costs................................................................    101.8     128.5
Other......................................................................................................     52.3      63.6
       Total...............................................................................................   $816.4    $871.0
</TABLE>
 
     Income taxes recoverable through future rates represent principally the tax
effect of depreciation differences not normalized. These amounts are amortized
as the related temporary differences reverse.
 
     The costs of decommissioning the Department of Energy's (DOE) uranium
enrichment facilities have been deferred and represent the unamortized portion
of Virginia Power's required contributions to a fund for decommissioning and
decontaminating the DOE's uranium enrichment facilities. Virginia Power is
making such contributions over a fifteen-year period with escalation for
inflation. These costs are being recovered in fuel rates.
 
     Losses or gains on reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the
lives of the new issues of long-term debt. Gains or losses resulting from the
redemption of debt without refinancing are amortized over the remaining lives of
the redeemed issues.
 
     The construction of North Anna Unit 3 was terminated in November 1982. All
retail jurisdictions have permitted recovery of the incurred costs. For Virginia
and FERC jurisdictional customers, the amounts deferred are being amortized from
the date termination costs were first includible in rates.
 
     The incurred costs underlying these regulatory assets may represent
expenditures by the Company or may represent the recognition of liabilities that
ultimately will be settled at some time in the future. For some of those
regulatory assets representing past expenditures that are not included in the
Company's rate base or used to adjust the Company's capital structure, the
Company is not allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered balance. Of the
$816.4 million of regulatory assets at December 31, 1995, approximately $123
million represent past expenditures that are effectively excluded from rate base
by the Virginia State Corporation Commission that has primary jurisdiction over
the Company's rates. However, of that amount $101.8 million represent the
present value of amounts to be recovered through future rates for North Anna
Unit 3 project termination costs, and thus reflect a reduction in the actual
dollars to be recovered through future rates for the time value of money. The
Company does not earn a return on the remaining $21.2 million of regulatory
assets, effectively excluded from rate base, to be recovered over various
recovery periods up to 23 years, depending on the nature of the deferred costs.
 
H. LEASES:
 
     Plant and property under capital leases included the following:

O. RETIREMENT PLAN, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER BENEFITS:
 
RETIREMENT PLAN
     The Company participates in the Dominion Resources, Inc. Retirement Plan
(the Retirement Plan), a defined benefit pension plan. The Retirement Plan
covers virtually all employees of Dominion Resources and its subsidiaries,
including the Company. The benefits are based on years of service and average
base compensation over the consecutive 60-month period in which pay is highest.
 
     Pension plan expenses were $20.3 million, $19.3 million and $15.9 million
for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively and the amounts funded were $42.7 million,
$42.7 million and $16 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     Under the terms of its benefit plans, the Company reserves the right to
change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits
have changed, and some of these changes have reduced benefits.
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     The Company is recovering these costs in rates on an accrual basis in all
material respects, in all jurisdictions. Current and future recoveries of other
postretirement benefits (OPEB) accruals are expected to collect sufficient
amounts to provide
 

 
<PAGE>
for the unfunded accumulated postretirement obligation over time. The funds
being collected for OPEB accruals in rates, in excess of OPEB benefits actually
paid during the year, are contributed to external benefit trusts under the
Company's current funding policy.
 
OTHER BENEFITS
 
     In 1994, the Company offered an early retirement program to employees aged
50 or older and offered a voluntary separation program to all regular full-time
employees. Approximately 1,400 employees accepted offers under these programs.
The costs associated with these programs were $90.1 million. The Company
capitalized $25.9 million based upon regulatory precedent and expensed $64.2
million.
 
P. RESTRUCTURING:
 
     In March 1995, the Company announced the implementation phase of its Vision
2000 program. During this phase, the Company began reviewing operations with the
objective of outsourcing services where economical and appropriate and re-
engineering the remaining functions to streamline operations. The re-engineering
process is resulting in outsourcing, decentralization, reorganization and
downsizing for portions of the Company's operations. As part of this process,
the Company is reevaluating its utilization of capital resources in the
operations of the Company to identify further opportunities for operational
efficiencies through outsourcing or re-engineering of its processes.
 
     Restructuring charges of $117.9 million in 1995, included severance costs,
purchase power contract cancellation and negotiated settlement costs, capital
project cancellation costs, and other costs incurred directly as a result of the
Vision 2000 initiatives. The Vision 2000 review of operations is expected to
continue through 1996. At this time, Company management cannot estimate the
restructuring costs yet to be incurred.
 
     In May 1995, the Company established a comprehensive involuntary severance
package for salaried employees who lose their positions as a result of these
initiatives. The Company is recognizing the cost associated with employee
terminations in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 94-3 as
management identifies the positions to be eliminated. Severance payments will be
made over a period not to exceed twenty months. Through December 31, 1995,
management had decided to eliminate 1,018 positions. The recognition of
severance costs resulted in a charge to operations in 1995 of $51.2 million. At
December 31, 1995, 507 employees have been terminated and severance payments
totaling $8.7 million have been paid. The Company estimates that these staffing
reductions will result in annual savings, net of outsourcing costs, in the range
of $50 million to $60 million. These savings will be reflected in lower
construction expenditures as well as lower operation and maintenance expenses.
 
     In an effort to minimize its exposure to potential stranded investment, the
Company is evaluating its long-term purchased power contracts and negotiating
modifications to their terms, including cancellations, where it is determined to
be economically advantageous to do so. The Company also negotiated settlements
with several other parties to terminate their rights to sell power to the
Company. The cost of contract cancellations and negotiated settlements was $8.1
million in 1995. Based on contract terms and estimated quantities of power that
would have otherwise been delivered, the cancellation of these contracts and
rights to sell power to the Company has the effect of reducing the Company's
future purchased power costs, including energy payments, by up to $214 million
annually. The cost of alternative sources of power that might ultimately be
required as a result of these settlements is expected to be significantly less
than $214 million, on an annual basis.
 
     Restructuring charges reported in 1995 included $37.3 million for the
cancellation of a project to construct a facility to handle low level
radioactive waste at the Company's North Anna Power Station. As a result of
reevaluating the handling of low level radioactive waste, the Company concluded
that the facility should not be completed due to the additional capital
investment required, decreased Company volumes of low level radioactive waste
resulting from improvements in station procedures and the availability of more
economical offsite processing.
 
     As a regulated utility, Virginia Power provides service to its customers at
rates based on its cost of operations and an opportunity to earn a return on its
shareholder's investment. From time to time, the Company reviews its cost of
providing regulated services and files such information with certain regulatory
commissions having jurisdiction. The Company or the regulatory commissions may
initiate proceedings to review rates charged to Company jurisdictional
customers. The incurrence of restructuring charges and the savings resulting
therefrom in subsequent periods are elements of the Company's cost of
operations. Accordingly, Vision 2000 costs and related savings will be
considered in any future review of the Company's overall regulatory cost of
service.
 

 
<PAGE>
Q. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
 
     The Company is involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings before
various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding
matters arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve
substantial amounts. Management is of the opinion that the final disposition of
these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations or the financial position of the Company.
 
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION AUDIT
 
     The FERC has recently conducted a compliance audit of the Company's
financial statements for the years 1990 through 1994. The Company has received a
preliminary draft of the audit report in which certain compliance exceptions
were noted. The Company has supplied information to the FERC staff relating to
these preliminary exceptions, but no final audit report has been issued. Based
on information available at this time, the disposition of these issues is not
expected to have a significant effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.
 
RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUM ASSESSMENTS
 
     Under several of the Company's nuclear insurance policies, the Company is
subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy year in which losses
exceed the funds available to these insurance companies. For additional
information, see Note C to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
 
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
 
     The Company has made substantial commitments in connection with its
construction program and nuclear fuel expenditures. Those expenditures are
estimated to total $569.3 million (excluding AFC) for 1996. Additional financing
is contemplated in connection with this program.
 
PURCHASED POWER CONTRACTS
 
     Since 1984, the Company has entered into contracts for the long-term
purchases of capacity and energy from other utilities, qualifying facilities and
independent power producers. The Company has 67 non-utility purchase contracts
with a combined dependable summer capacity of 3,493 Mw. Of these, 66 projects
(aggregating 3,295 Mw) were operational as of the end of 1995 with the remaining
project to become operational before 1998.
 
     The table below reflects the Company's minimum commitments as of December
31, 1995, for power purchases from utility and non-utility suppliers.

     In addition to the minimum purchase commitments in the table above, under
some of these contracts the Company may purchase, at its option, additional
power as needed. Actual payments for purchased power (including economy,
emergency, limited term, short-term and long-term purchases) for the years 1995,
1994 and 1993 were $1,093 million, $1,025 million and $958 million,
respectively.
 
FUEL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
 
     The Company's estimated fuel purchase commitments for the next five years
for system generation are as follows (millions): 1996  -- $348; 1997  -- $319;
1998  -- $205; 1999  -- $137; and 2000  -- $151.

SALE OF POWER
 
     On November 26, 1991, the Company and ODEC signed an agreement whereby the
Company will provide 100 Mw of firm capacity and associated energy until the
commercial operation of Clover Unit 2 (currently scheduled for April 1996) or
December 31, 1996, whichever occurs first. In addition, the Company has a
diversity exchange agreement with APS under which APS delivers 200 Mw to
Virginia Power in the summer and Virginia Power delivers 200 Mw to APS in the
winter.
 
     The Company has entered into agreements to supply wholesale power under
various terms on a firm basis during certain upcoming winter and summer months.
Under these agreements, the Company has the following commitments:

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
     The Company is subject to rising costs resulting from a steadily increasing
number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect
human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future
planning and existing operations. These laws and regulations can result in
increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance,
remediation, containment and monitoring obligations of the Company. These costs
have been historically recovered through the ratemaking process; however, should
material costs be incurred and not recovered through rates, the Company's
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.
 
SITE REMEDIATION
 
     The EPA has identified the Company and several other entities as
Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at two Superfund sites located in
Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The estimated future remediation costs for the sites
are in the range of $46.5 million to $134.6 million. The Company's proportionate
share of the cost is expected to be in the range of $0.5 million to $6.7
million, based upon allocation formulas and the volume of waste shipped to the
sites. As of December 31, 1995, the Company accrued a reserve of $1.4 million to
meet its obligations at these two sites. Based on a financial assessment of the
PRPs involved at these sites, the Company has determined that it is probable
that the PRPs will fully pay the costs apportioned to them.
 
     The Company and Dominion Resources along with Consolidated Natural Gas have
remedial action responsibilities remaining at two coal tar sites. The Company
accrued a $2 million reserve to meet its estimated liability based on site
studies and investigations performed at these sites. In addition, on December
13, 1995, a civil action was instituted against the City of Norfolk and Virginia
Power by a landowner who alleges that his property has been contaminated by
toxic pollutants originating from one of these sites, which is now owned by the
City of Norfolk. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of $10 million and
punitive damages of $5 million from Virginia Power. The Company filed its answer
denying liability on January 10, 1996.
 
     The Company generally seeks to recover its costs associated with
environmental remediation from third party insurers. At December 31, 1995, any
pending or possible claims were not recognized as an asset or offset against
recorded obligations of the Company.

R. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

     The Company used available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument
for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. These estimates are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a market
exchange. In addition, the use of different market assumptions may have a
material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

cash flows at a rate estimated for each issue. A yield curve rate was estimated
to relate Treasury Bond rates for specific issues to the corresponding
maturities.
 
     Money market municipal pollution control notes: These notes have variable
interest rates which are set so that fair value approximates carrying value.
 
     Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption: The fair value is based on
market quotations or is estimated by discounting the dividend and principal
payments for a representative issue of each series over the average remaining
life of the series.
 
     Preferred securities of subsidiary trust: Fair value is based on market
quotations.

     As part of the Vision 2000 program (see Note P to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS) the Company recorded $117.9 million of restructuring charges in
1995. Restructuring charges included severance costs, purchase power
 

 
<PAGE>
contract cancellation and negotiated settlement costs, capital project
cancellation costs, and other costs incurred directly as a result of the Vision
2000 initiatives. The Company expensed $3.5 million, $1.8 million, $30.6 million
and $82 million during the first, second, third and fourth quarters,
respectively. The impact of the write-off reduced Balance Available for Common
Stock by $2.3 million, $1.1 million, $19.9 million and $53.3 million for the
first, second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively.
 
     In 1994, the Company offered an early retirement program to employees aged
50 or older and offered a voluntary separation program to all regular full-time
employees. Approximately 1,400 employees accepted offers under these programs.
The costs associated with these programs were $90.1 million. The Company
capitalized $25.9 million based upon regulatory precedent and expensed $2.8
million, $10.4 million and $51 million during the second, third and fourth
quarters, respectively. The impact of the write-off reduced Balance Available
for Common Stock by $1.8 million, $6.7 million and $33.1 million for the second,
third and fourth quarters, respectively.

     (1) The performance shares representing Dominion Resources Common Stock to
be awarded at the end of performance period.
 
     (2) Except for James T. Rhodes, payout of awards are tied to achieving
levels of Virginia Power's return on equity (ROE) (50%) and meeting a cost per
kilowatt-hour goal (50%). The threshold award will be earned if 81% of the ROE
goal or 75% of the costs per kilowatt-hour goal is achieved. The target awards
will be earned if the goals are fully achieved. The maximum award will be earned
at 110% or more of the ROE goal and 120% of the cost goal.
 
     The award for James T. Rhodes will be paid out in shares of stock or an
equivalent amount of cash based on the achievement of three specified goals over
a three-year performance period (1995-1997), weighted as follows: a total return
to Dominion Resources Shareholders superior to that of the S&P Utility Index
(50%), utility return on equity equal to the average ROE achieved by a group of
comparable utilities (25%), and restraint of utility costs to a growth rate less
than that of the Consumer Price Index (25%).
 
     The target number of shares will be earned if all goals are fully achieved.
The threshold amount will be earned if at least 71% of the total return goal,
81% of the ROE goal, and 75% of the cost control goal are achieved. The maximum
amount will be earned if at least 114% of the total return goal, 110% of the ROE
goal, and 120% of the cost control goal are achieved. Prorated amounts will be
earned between the threshold and the maximum.

</TABLE>
 
     Benefits under the Retirement Plan are based on (i) average base
compensation over the consecutive 60-month period in which pay is highest, (ii)
years of credited service, (iii) age at retirement, and (iv) the offset of
Social Security Benefits.
 
     Certain officers have entered into retirement agreements that give
additional credited years of service for retirement and retirement life
insurance purposes, contingent upon the officer reaching a specified age and
remaining in the employ of the Company or an affiliate.
 
     For purposes of the above table, based on 1995 compensation, credited years
of service (including any additional years earned in connection with the
retirement agreements) for each of the individuals named in the cash
compensation table would be as follows:
 
     James T. Rhodes: 30; John A. Ahladas: 30; Robert F. Hill: 30; Larry W.
Ellis: 30 and James P. O'Hanlon: 6.
 
     Virginia Power's executive compensation program has placed increased
emphasis on incentive compensation opportunities linked to financial and
operating performance. Base salaries have been held below the mean for
comparable positions at comparable companies. The Retirement Plan benefit
formula recognizes base salary, but not incentive compensation payments.
Therefore, each year the Organization and Compensation Committee approves a
market-based adjustment to executive base salaries for use in calculating the
retirement benefit under the Dominion Resources, Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan
(the Restoration Plan). In 1995, this adjustment was 11 percent. Also, the
Internal Revenue Code limits the annual retirement benefit that may be paid from
a qualified retirement plan and the amount of compensation that may be
recognized by the Retirement Plan. To the extent that benefits determined under
the Retirement Plan's benefit formula exceed the limitations imposed by the
Internal Revenue Code, they will be paid under the Dominion Resources, Inc.
Benefit Restoration Plan.
 
     In 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Ahladas which
allowed him to retire on December 31, 1995 with Retirement Benefits
approximately equal to those he would have received had he remained an employee
through June 21, 1997.
 
     The Company also provides an Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (the
Supplemental Plan) to its elected officers designated to participate by the
Board of Directors. The Supplemental Plan provides an annual retirement benefit
equal to 25 percent of a participant's final compensation (base pay plus annual
incentive plan payments). The normal form of benefit is payable in equal monthly
installments for 120 months to a participant with 60 months of service, who (i)
retires at or after age 55 from the employ of the Company, (ii) has become
permanently disabled, or (iii) dies. If a participant dies while employed, the
normal form of benefit will be paid to a designated beneficiary. If a
participant dies while retired, but before receiving all benefit payments, the
remaining installments will be paid to a designated beneficiary. In order to be
entitled to benefits under the Supplemental Plan, an employee must be employed
as an elected officer of the Company until death, disability or retirement.
 

 
<PAGE>
     Based on 1995 compensation, the estimated annual retirement benefit for
each of the executive officers under the Supplemental Plan would be as follows:
James T. Rhodes: $164,790; John A. Ahladas: $74,650; Robert F. Hill: $80,775;
Larry W. Ellis: $71,800; and James P. O'Hanlon: $84,747.
 
RETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDING PLAN
 
     The Company maintains a Retirement Benefit Funding Plan to provide a means
to secure obligations under the Supplemental Plan, the Restoration Plan, and
retirement agreements. The Retirement Benefit Funding Plan does not provide any
additional benefits; it simply helps secure the funding for these benefit
obligations. The amount payable by Virginia Power under the Supplemental Plan,
the Restoration Plan and retirement agreements is reduced, on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, by the funds available under the Retirement Benefit
Funding Plan.
 
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
 
     The Company has entered into employment continuity agreements (the
Agreements) with its key management executives, including James T. Rhodes, John
A. Ahladas, Robert F. Hill, Larry W. Ellis and James P. O'Hanlon, which provide
benefits in the event of a change in control. Each Agreement has a three-year
term and thereafter is automatically extended on its anniversary date for an
additional year unless notified that the Agreement will not be extended by the
Company. If, following a change in control (as defined in the Agreements) of
Dominion Resources or the Company, an executive's employment is terminated by
the Company without cause, or voluntarily by the executive within sixty days
after a material reduction in the executive's compensation, benefits or
responsibilities, the Company will be obligated to pay to the executive
continued compensation equaling the average base salary and cash incentive
bonuses for the thirty-six full month period of employment preceding the change
in control or employment termination. In addition, the terminated executive will
continue to be entitled to any benefits due under any stock or benefit plans.
The Agreements do not alter the compensation and benefits available to an
executive whose employment with the Company continues for the full term of the
executive's Agreement. The amount of benefits provided under each executive's
Agreement will be reduced by any compensation earned by the executive from
comparable employment by another employer during the thirty-six months following
termination of employment with the Company. An executive shall not be entitled
to the above benefits in the event termination is for cause.
 
     On April 21, 1995, the Company entered into an employment agreement with
Dr. James T. Rhodes. This agreement was amended on September 15, 1995. As
amended, the agreement replaces all previous agreements between the Company and
Dr. Rhodes, except that his Employment Continuity Agreement, and various
retirement, incentive and benefit plans in which Dr. Rhodes participates, remain
in effect.
 
     The amended agreement provides that Dr. Rhodes will continue in the employ
of the Company, as Chief Executive Officer until July 31, 1999. During this
term, Dr. Rhodes' base salary will not be reduced, and he will participate in
the compensation and benefit plans provided for senior management.
 
     If Dr. Rhodes' employment is terminated, for any reason, after July 31,
1996, his retirement benefits will be calculated using his final salary and will
assume 60 years of age and 30 years of service. In addition, any restricted
stock held for Dr. Rhodes will become fully vested, his benefit under the
Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan will be paid for life, he will receive
immediate payment for all outstanding awards under the Performance Achievement
Plan, and he will receive a lump sum payment approximately equal to his 1994
salary plus incentive, and he will receive a cash payment equal to the net
present value of base salary and incentives that he would be projected to
receive between August 1, 1996 and April 21, 1997. Salary and incentive will be
calculated at a rate not less than the maximum rate paid during the prior three
years. These benefits will also be paid if Dr. Rhodes is terminated by the
Company without cause prior to July 31, 1996. Termination as a result of
disability, at any time during the term of employment, will also result in the
above benefits. In the case of termination due to death, the above benefits will
be paid to the designated beneficiary, but payments under the Executive
Supplemental Retirement Plan will be made for ten years.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
 
     The non-employee members of the Board receive an annual retainer of $19,000
and a fee of $900 for each Board or committee meeting attended. Committee
chairmen receive an additional annual retainer of $3,000 and the Chairman of the
Board receives an additional $25,000 annual retainer. These Directors may elect
to defer their annual retainer and/or their meeting fees under the Deferred
Compensation Plan until they retire from the Board or otherwise direct. The
deferred fees are credited, for bookkeeping purposes, with earnings and losses
as if they were invested in either an interest bearing account or Dominion
Resources Common Stock, depending on the Director's election.
 

 
<PAGE>
     In addition, the Company makes payments to non-employee Directors or their
designated beneficiaries upon those Directors' retirement, death or disability.
Payments to a retired Director, including one who becomes disabled after
retirement, are made for a period of four years, or for a period of years equal
to the Director's service on the Board of the Company or one of its
subsidiaries, whichever is longer. If a non-employee Director becomes disabled
prior to retirement, these payments are made for four years. Each year, these
payments equal the annual retainer in effect at the time the payments begin.
Upon the death of a non-employee Director, the unpaid portion of these payments,
up to a maximum of four times the annual amount due, is paid in a lump sum to
the Director's designated beneficiary.
 
DIRECTORS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM
 
     Dominion Resources administers a Directors' Charitable Contribution Program
(the Program) for all its subsidiaries, including the Company, as part of its
overall program of charitable giving. Beginning at the death of a Director a
donation in an aggregate amount of $50,000 per year for 10 years will be made to
one or more qualifying charitable organizations recommended by the individual
Director. Life insurance policies have been purchased on the lives of the
Directors in connection with the Program. These policies are owned by Dominion
Resources, which is also the beneficiary. The Directors derive no financial or
tax benefits from the Program.

hereof,  each Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit loans ("Revolving
Credit Loans") to the Borrower from time to time during the Commitment Period in
an  aggregate  principal  amount at any one time  outstanding  not to exceed the
amount of such Lender's  Commitment.  During the Commitment  Period the Borrower
may use the Commitments by  borrowing, prepaying  the Revolving  Credit Loans in
whole or in  part,  and  reborrowing,  all in  accordance  with  the  terms  and
conditions hereof,  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event may  Revolving  Credit  Loans be borrowed  under this  Section 2 if,

outstanding would exceed the aggregate Commitments then in effect.

             (b) The  Revolving  Credit Loans may from time to time be (i) LIBOR
Loans, (ii) ABR Loans, (iii) CD Rate Loans or (iv) a combination  thereof,  as
determined  by the  Borrower  and  notified  to the  Agent  in  accordance  with
subsections 2.2 and 2.7, provided that no Revolving Credit Loan shall be made as
a LIBOR  Loan or a CD Rate  Loan  after  the day  that is one  month or 30 days,
respectively, prior to the Termination Date.

             2.2  Procedure  for Revolving  Credit  Borrowing.  The Borrower may
borrow under the Commitments  during the Commitment  Period on any Business Day,
provided  that the  Borrower  shall give the  Administrative  Agent  irrevocable
written notice,  which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior

is to be  entirely or partly of LIBOR  Loans or CD Rate  Loans,  the  respective
lengths of the initial  Interest  Periods  therefor.  Each  borrowing  under the
Commitments  shall be in an amount equal to  $10,000,000  or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof.  Each Lender
will make the amount of its pro rata share of each  borrowing  available  to the

Administrative  Agent  specified in subsection  8.2 prior to 2:00 P.M., New York
City time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds  immediately

the Borrower on the books of such office with the  aggregate of the amounts made
available  to the  Administrative  Agent  by the  Lenders  and in like  funds as
received by the Administrative Agent.

             2.3 Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative

of $1,000,000 in excess  thereof and shall reduce  permanently  the  Commitments
then in effect.

             2.5 Repayment of Loans;  Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower  hereby
unconditionally  promises to pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account of
each Lender the then unpaid  principal  amount of each Revolving  Credit Loan of
such Lender on the Termination Date (or such earlier date on which the Revolving
Credit Loans become due and payable  pursuant to Section 6). The Borrower hereby
further agrees to pay interest on the unpaid  principal amount of the Loans from
time to time  outstanding  from the date hereof until payment in full thereof at
the rates per annum, and on the dates, set forth in subsection 2.11.

             (b) Each  Lender  shall  maintain  in  accordance  with  its  usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing  indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time,  including the
amounts of principal  and interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

             (c) The  Administrative  Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant
to subsection  8.6(d),  and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall
be recorded  (i) the amount of each Loan made  hereunder,  the Type  thereof and
each Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest  due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender  hereunder  and  (iii)  both  the  amount  of  any  sum  received  by the
Administrative  Agent  hereunder  from  the  Borrower  and each  Lender's  share
thereof.

             (d) The  entries  made in the  Register  and the  accounts  of each
Lender  maintained  pursuant to subsection 2.5(b) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable  law, be prima facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations  of the  Borrower  therein  recorded:  provided,  however,  that the
failure of any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent to maintain  the Register or
any such  account,  or any error  therein,  shall not in any  manner  affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to
such Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

             (e)  The   Borrower   agrees   that,   upon  the   request  to  the
Administrative  Agent by any Lender,  the  Borrower  will execute and deliver to
such Lender a promissory  note of the Borrower  evidencing the Revolving  Credit
Loans of such Lender,  substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 with appropriate
insertions as to date and principal amount (a "Revolving Credit Note").

Loans  shall  specify  the length of the  initial  Interest  Period or  Interest
Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof. All or any part of outstanding LIBOR Loans,
ABR Loans and CD Rate Loans may be converted as provided  herein,  provided that
(i) no Loan may be converted  into a LIBOR Loan or a CD Rate Loan when any Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing  and the  Administrative  Agent has or
the Majority  Lenders have  determined that such a conversion is not appropriate
and (ii) no Loan may be converted  into a LIBOR Loan or a CD Rate Loan after the
date that is one month or 30 days, respectively, prior to the Termination Date.

             (b) Any LIBOR Loans or CD Rate Loans may be  continued as such upon
the expiration of the then current  Interest  Period with respect thereto by the
Borrower  giving notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  in  accordance  with the
applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in subsection 1.1,
of the  length of the next  Interest  Period  to be  applicable  to such  Loans,
provided  that no LIBOR Loan or CD Rate Loan may be  continued  as such (i) when
any Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing  and the Agent has or the
Majority  Lenders have determined that such a continuation is not appropriate or
(ii)  after the date that is one month or 30 days  prior to,  respectively,  the
Termination Date and provided,  further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give
such  notice  or if such  continuation  is not  permitted  such  Loans  shall be
automatically  converted  to ABR  Loans on the last  day of such  then  expiring
Interest Period.

             2.8 Minimum Amounts and Maximum Number of Tranches. All borrowings,
prepayments, conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections
of Interest  Periods  hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to
such elections so that,  after giving effect  thereto,  the aggregate  principal
amount of the Loans comprising each LIBOR


                                       14

Tranche  or each CD Rate  Tranche  shall  be  equal  to  $10,000,000  or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. In no event shall there be more than 5
LIBOR Tranches or 5 CD Rate Tranches outstanding at any time.

this Agreement,  the Borrower may borrow  Competitive Loans in Dollars from time
to time on any Business  Day during the period from the date hereof  through the
date 14 days  prior to the  Termination  Date;  provided,  that in no event  may
Competitive  Loans be borrowed  hereunder  if, after giving  effect  thereto the
aggregate  principal amount of Loans then outstanding would exceed the aggregate
Commitments then in effect.  Within the limits and on the conditions  herein set
forth with respect to  Competitive  Loans,  the  Borrower  from time to time may
borrow, repay and reborrow Competitive Loans.

     Credit Commitment); and

                (ii) the rate of interest at which such  Competitive Loan Lender

             (e) The Borrower's  acceptance of Competitive  Loans in response to
any Competitive Loan Request shall be subject to the following limitations:

                (i) The amount of  Competitive  Loans accepted for each maturity
     date specified by any Competitive Loan Lender in its Competitive Loan Offer
     shall not exceed the maximum  amount for such  maturity  date  specified in
     such Competitive Loan Offer;

                (ii) the aggregate amount of Competitive  Loans accepted for all
     maturity dates specified by any Competitive  Loan Lender in its Competitive
     Loan Offer shall not exceed the aggregate  maximum amount specified in such
     Competitive Loan Offer for all such maturity dates;

                (iii) the Borrower may not accept offers for  Competitive  Loans
     for any  maturity  date in an aggregate  principal  amount in excess of the
     maximum principal amount requested in the related Competitive Loan Request;
     and

                (iv) if the  Borrower  accepts any of such  offers,  (1) it must
     accept such offers based solely upon the lowest  pricing for such  relevant
     maturity date (including any amounts which shall be payable to the relevant
     Competitive  Loan  Lender in  respect  of the  relevant  Competitive  Loans
     pursuant to subsection 2.17) and upon no other criteria  whatsoever and (2)
     if (x) two or more  Competitive Loan Lenders submit offers for any maturity
     date at identical  pricing and the Borrower  accepts any of such offers but
     does not wish to (or by reason of the  limitations  set forth in subsection
     2.9 or in this subsection 2.10,  cannot) borrow the total amount offered by
     such  Competitive  Loan Lenders with such identical  pricing,  the Borrower
     shall accept  offers from all of such  Competitive  Loan Lenders in amounts
     allocated  among them pro rata  according  to the  amounts  offered by such
     Competitive  Loan  Lenders  (or as nearly pro rata as shall be  practicable
     after giving effect to the  requirement  that  Competitive  Loans made by a
     Competitive Loan Lender on a Borrowing Date for each relevant maturity date
     shall be in a principal  amount of $10,000,000  or an integral  multiple of
     $1,000,000  in excess  thereof) or (y) a  Competitive  Loan Lender  submits
     offers for multiple maturity dates specifying a maximum aggregate principal
     amount for all maturity  dates,  and the Borrower  accepts offers from such
     Competitive  Loan Lender for more than one maturity date, then the Borrower
     shall  instruct the  Administrative  Agent how to apportion the  Borrower's
     acceptances  among such offers for different  maturity dates to the extent,
     if any, necessary to provide for acceptance of offers from such Competitive
     Loan Lender equal to but not exceeding  such  specified  maximum  aggregate
     amount.

             (f)  If the  Borrower  notifies  the  Administrative  Agent  that a
Competitive  Loan Request is cancelled  pursuant to subsection  2.10(d)(i),  the
Administrative   Agent  shall  give  prompt  telephone  notice  thereof  to  the
Competitive Loan Lenders.

             (g) If the Borrower accepts pursuant to subsection 2.10(d)(ii) one
or more of the offers  made by any one or more  Competitive  Loan  Lenders,  the
Administrative  Agent promptly shall notify each  Competitive  Loan Lender which
has made  such a  Competitive  Loan  Offer of (i) the  aggregate  amount of such
Competitive Loans to be made on such Borrowing Date for each


                                       17

<PAGE>


maturity  date,  (ii) the  acceptance  or  rejection  of any offers to make such
Competitive  Loans made by such Competitive Loan Lender and (iii) in the case of
LIBOR Competitive Loans,  LIBOR in respect thereof.  Before 12:30 P.M. (New York
City time) on the Borrowing Date specified in the  applicable  Competitive  Loan
Request,  each  Competitive  Loan Lender whose  Competitive  Loan Offer has been
accepted  shall make  available  to the  Administrative  Agent at its office set
forth in  subsection  8.2 the  amount  of  Competitive  Loans to be made by such
Competitive Loan Lender,  in immediately  available  funds.  The  Administrative
Agent will make such funds  available to the Borrower as soon as  practicable on
such  date  at  the  Administrative   Agent's  aforesaid  address.  As  soon  as
practicable  after each Borrowing  Date, the  Administrative  Agent shall notify
each  Competitive  Loan  Lender of the  aggregate  amount of  Competitive  Loans
advanced on such Borrowing  Date, the respective  maturity dates thereof and the
respective interest rates applicable thereto.

             (h) The  Borrower  hereby  unconditionally  promises  to pay to the
Administrative  Agent for the account of each  Competitive  Loan Lender the then
unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan of such Competitive Loan Lender
on the applicable  Competitive  Loan Maturity Date. The Borrower  hereby further
agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal  amount of the Competitive  Loans
from time to time outstanding from the date hereof until payment in full thereof
at the rates per annum,  and on the dates,  set forth in subsection  2.11. Each
Competitive  Loan Lender shall maintain  accounts and the  Administrative  Agent
shall  maintain the Register  with respect to  Competitive  Loans as provided in
subsections 2.5(b), (c) and (d).

             (i)  The   Borrower   agrees   that,   upon  the   request  to  the
Administrative  Agent by any Competitive Loan Lender,  the Borrower will execute
and deliver to such  Competitive  Loan Lender a promissory  note of the Borrower
evidencing the Competitive Loans of such Competitive Loan Lender,  substantially
in the form of Exhibit A-2 with appropriate  insertions as to date and principal
amount (a "Competitive Loan Note").

             2.11 Interest Rates and Payment  Dates.  (a) Each LIBOR Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate  per  annum  equal  to LIBOR  determined  for such day plus the  Applicable
Margin.

             (b) Each ABR Loan shall bear  interest at a rate per annum equal to
the ABR plus the Applicable Margin.

             (c) Each CD Rate Loan shall bear  interest for each day during each
Interest  Period with  respect  thereto at a rate per annum equal to the CD Rate
determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin.

             (d) Each Competitive Loan shall bear interest for each day from the
applicable  Borrowing Date to (but  excluding) the applicable  Competitive  Loan
Maturity Date at the rate of interest  specified in the  Competitive  Loan Offer
accepted by the Borrower in connection with such Competitive Loan.

             (e) If all or a portion  of (i) the  principal  amount of any Loan,
(ii) any  interest  payable  thereon  or (iii) any fee or other  amount  payable
hereunder shall not be paid when due

                                       18

<PAGE>


(whether at the stated  maturity,  by acceleration  or otherwise),  such overdue
amount shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, bear interest at a rate
per annum  which is (x) in the case of overdue  principal  (except as  otherwise
provided  in clause (y)  below),  the rate that would  otherwise  be  applicable
thereto pursuant to the foregoing  provisions of this subsection 2.11 plus 2% or
(y) in the case of principal of any Competitive  Loan which remains overdue past
the applicable  Competitive Loan Maturity Date, or any overdue interest,  fee or
other amount,  the rate  described in subsection  2.11(b) plus 2%, in each case
from the date of such non-payment until such overdue principal, interest, fee or
other amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment).

             (f) lnterest  shall accrue from and  including  the first day of an
Interest Period to but excluding the last day of such Interest Period.  Interest
shall be payable  in  arrears  on each  Interest  Payment  Date,  provided  that
interest  accruing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subsection shall be payable
from time to time on demand.

             2.12  Computation  of Interest  and Fees.  (a)  Facility  fees and,
whenever it is calculated on the basis of the ABR,  interest shall be calculated
on the  basis of a 365- (or  366-,  as the case may be) day year for the  actual
days elapsed;  and,  otherwise,  interest  shall be calculated on the basis of a
360-day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon
as  practicable  notify the  Borrower and the Lenders of each  determination  of
LIBOR or of a CD Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from
a change in the CD  Assessment  Rate or the CD Reserve  Percentage  shall become
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change  becomes
effective.  The  Administrative  Agent shall as soon as  practicable  notify the
Borrower  and the  Lenders  of the  effective  date and the  amount of each such
change in interest rate.

             (b) Each  determination  of an interest rate by the  Administrative
Agent  pursuant to any  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be  conclusive  and
binding on the  Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest  error.  The
Administrative  Agent  shall,  at the  request of the  Borrower,  deliver to the
Borrower  upon  request  a  statement   showing  the  quotations   used  by  the
Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.1
I(c).

             2.13 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first
day of any Interest Period:

            (a)  the   Administrative   Agent  shall  have   determined   (which
      determination  shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by
      reason of  circumstances  affecting  the  relevant  market,  adequate  and
      reasonable  means do not exist for  ascertaining  LIBOR or the CD Rate for
      such Interest Period, or

            (b) the  Administrative  Agent shall have  received  notice from the
      Majority  Lenders that LIBOR or the CD Rate determined or to be determined
      for such Interest  Period will not  adequately and fairly reflect the cost
      to such Lenders (as  conclusively  certified by such Lenders) of making or
      maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,


                                       19

<PAGE>


the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the
Borrower and the Lenders as soon as  practicable  thereafter.  If such notice is
given (x) any LIBOR Loans, CD Rate Loans or LIBOR Competitive Loans, as the case
may be,  requested to be made on the first day of such Interest  Period shall be
made as ABR Loans,  (y) any Loans that were to have been  converted on the first
day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans or CD Rate Loans, as the case may be,
shall be converted to or  continued as ABR Loans and (z) any  outstanding  LIBOR
Loans or CD Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be converted, on the first day
of such Interest Period,  to ABR Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by
the  Administrative  Agent,  no  further  LIBOR  Loans,  CD Rate  Loans or LIBOR
Competitive  Loans,  as the case may be, shall be made or continued as such, nor
shall the  Borrower  have the right to convert  Loans to LIBOR  Loans or CD Rate
Loans, as the case may be.

             2.14 Pro Rata  Treatment  and Payments.  (a) Each  borrowing by the
Borrower  from the  Lenders of a  Revolving  Credit  Loan,  each  payment by the
Borrower on account of any  facility  fee  hereunder  and any  reduction  of the
Commitments  of the Lenders shall be made pro rata  according to the  respective
Commitment  Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment)
by the  Borrower on account of  principal  of and interest on the Loans shall be
made pro rata according to the respective  outstanding  principal amounts of the
Loans for which such payment is being made. All payments (including prepayments)
to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest,
fees or otherwise,  shall be made without set off or  counterclaim  and shall be
made prior to 2:00  P.M.,  New York City  time,  on the due date  thereof to the
Administrative  Agent,  for the account of the  Lenders,  at the  Administrative
Agent's  office  specified  in  subsection  8.2, in Dollars  and in  immediately
available funds. The Administrative  Agent shall distribute such payments to the
Lenders  promptly  upon  receipt  in like  funds  as  received.  If any  payment
hereunder  becomes  due and  payable on a day other than a  Business  Day,  such
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect
to  payments  of  principal,  interest  thereon  shall  be  payable  at the then
applicable rate during such extension.

             (b) Unless the  Administrative  Agent  shall have been  notified in
writing by any Lender  prior to a  borrowing  that such Lender will not make the
amount  that  would  constitute  its share of such  borrowing  available  to the
Administrative  Agent, the  Administrative  Agent may assume that such Lender is
making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent may, in reliance upon such  assumption,  make  available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative
Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay
to the Administrative  Agent, on demand,  such amount with interest thereon at a
rate equal to the daily  average  Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate for the period
until such Lender makes such amount immediately  available to the Administrative
Agent. A certificate of the  Administrative  Agent  submitted to any Lender with
respect to any amounts  owing under this  subsection  shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest  error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made
available to the Administrative  Agent by such Lender within three Business Days
of such  Borrowing  Date,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall also be entitled to
recover such amount with  interest  thereon at the rate per annum  applicable to
ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower.

             2.15 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the  interpretation or
application  thereof  shall make it unlawful  for any Lender to make or maintain
LIBOR Loans or LIBOR  Competitive  Loans as  contemplated  by this Agreement (a)
such  Lender  shall  promptly  give  notice  thereof  to the  Borrower  and  the
Administrative  Agent, (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make LIBOR
Loans,  continue  LIBOR  Loans as such and convert ABR Loans or CD Rate Loans to
LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be cancelled,  (c) such Lender's  outstanding  LIBOR
Loans, if any, shall be converted  automatically  to ABR Loans on the respective
last days of the then  current  Interest  Periods  with respect to such Loans or
within such earlier period as required by law and (d) the Borrower  shall,  with
respect to any LIBOR  Competitive Loan of such Lender,  take such action as such
Lender may reasonably  request. If any such conversion of a LIBOR Loan occurs on
a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto,  the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts,  if any, as may be
required pursuant to subsection 2.18.

            2.16 Additional Costs. (a) If, as a result of any Regulatory Change:

              (i) the  basis  of  taxation  of  payments  to any  Lender  of the
     principal  of or  interest on any LIBOR  Loans,  any CD Rate Loans or LIBOR
     Competitive  Loans or any other  amounts  payable  under this  Agreement in
     respect thereof (other than  Non-Excluded  Taxes covered by subsection 2.17
     and taxes imposed on the overall net income of any Lender) is changed;

              (ii) any reserve, special deposit, or capital adequacy, or similar
     requirements  relating to any  extensions  of credit or other assets of, or
     any  deposits  with or  other  liabilities  of,  any  Lender  are  imposed,
     modified, or deemed applicable; or

              (iii) any other  condition  affecting  this Agreement or any LIBOR
     Loans,  any CD Rate  Loans or LIBOR  Competitive  Loans is  imposed  on any
     Lender after the date hereof; and

any  Lender  determines  that,  by reason  thereof,  the cost (or in the case of
clause  (i)  above,  the  actually  incurred  cost) to such  Lender of making or
maintaining  its  Commitment  or any of its LIBOR Loans,  CD Rate Loans or LIBOR
Competitive Rate Loans to the Borrower is increased or any amount  receivable by
such Lender  hereunder in respect of any of such Loans is reduced,  in each case
by an amount  reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material (such increases in
cost and  reductions  in amounts  receivable  being  herein  called  "Additional
Costs"),  then the  Borrower  shall  pay to such  Lender  upon its  request  the
additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such Additional
Costs within 15 Business Days after such written  notice is received;  provided,
however, that if all or any such Additional  Costs would not have been payable
or incurred but for such Lender's  voluntary decision to designate a new
Applicable Lending Office, the Borrower shall have no obligation under this
subsection 2.16 to compensate  such Lender for such amount  relating to such
Lender's  decision; provided,  further, that the Borrower shall not be required
to make any payments to such Lender for Additional Costs resulting from capital
adequacy requirements unless (A) such Lender has given at least 60 days' prior
written  notice of its intent to request such payments and (B) such payments are
with respect


                                       21

<PAGE>

to Additional Costs which accrued and were incurred after the expiration of such
60-day   notice   period.   Each  Lender  will  notify  the   Borrower  and  the
Administrative  Agent of any Regulatory  Change occurring after the date of this
Agreement  which will  entitle  such  Lender to  compensation  pursuant  to this
subsection 2.16(a) as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof
and  determines  to  request  such   compensation.   If  such  Lender   requests
compensation under this subsection 2.16(a) in respect of any Regulatory Change,
the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender,  require that such Lender forward to
the  Borrower  a  statement   setting  forth  the  basis  for  requesting   such
compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.

             (b)  Without  limiting  the  effect of the provisions of subsection
2.16(a) (but without duplication  thereof), the Borrower will pay to any Lender,
within 15 Business  Days of receipt by the  Borrower of notice from such Lender,
for each day such Lender is required to maintain reserves against  "Eurocurrency
liabilities"  under  Regulation  D of the Board as in effect on the date of this
Agreement,  an additional  amount determined by such Lender equal to the product
of the following:

              (i) the principal amount of the LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Competitive
     Loan, as the case may be;

              (ii) the  remainder  of (x) a fraction  the  numerator of which is
     LlBOR for such LIBOR Loan or LIBOR  Competitive  Loan,  as the case may be,
     and the  denominator  of which is one minus the rate at which such  reserve
     requirements  are  imposed  on such  Lender  on such  day  minus  (y)  such
     numerator; and

         (iii) 1/360.

Such Lender  shall  request  payment  under this  subsection   2.16(b) by giving
notice to the Borrower as of the last day of each Interest Period for each LIBOR
Loan and  LIBOR  Competitive  Loan,  as the case may be (and,  if such  Interest
Period  exceeds three  months'  duration,  also as of three  months,  or a whole
multiple  thereof,  after the first day of such  Interest  Period).  Such notice
shall  specify the basis for  requesting  such  compensation  and the method for
determining the amount  thereof.  Such Lender shall provide any evidence of such
requirement to maintain reserves as the Borrower may reasonably request.

             (c)  Determinations  by any Lender for purposes of this  subsection
2.16 of the effect of any Regulatory  Change shall be conclusive,  provided that
such  determinations  are made absent  manifest  error.  The  agreements in this
subsection  shall survive the  termination  of this Agreement and the payment of
the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

             2.17  Taxes.  (a) All  payments  made by the  Borrower  under  this
Agreement  and any Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without  deduction
or  withholding  for or on account  of, any present or future  income,  stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
now or  hereafter  imposed,  levied,  collected,  withheld  or  assessed  by any
Governmental Authority,  excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed
in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative  Agent, any Lender or
any


                                       22

<PAGE>



Applicable  Lending Office as a result of a present or former connection between
the  Administrative  Agent,  such Lender or  Applicable  Lending  Office and the
jurisdiction of the  Governmental  Authority  imposing such tax or any political
subdivision  or  taxing  authority  thereof  or  therein  (other  than  any such
connection  arising solely from the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or
enforced,  this Agreement or any Note). If any such non-excluded taxes,  levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes")
are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent
or any  Lender  hereunder  or under any Note,  the  amounts  so  payable  to the
Administrative  Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent  necessary
so that the amount  received by the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender (after
payment of all Non-Excluded  Taxes) shall be equal to  the interest  or any such
other  amounts it would have  received had no such  withholding  been  required,
provided,  however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such
amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United
States of America or a state  thereof if such  Lender  fails to comply  with the
requirements  of paragraph  (b) of this  subsection.  Whenever any  Non-Excluded
Taxes are payable by the Borrower,  as promptly as  practicable  thereafter  the
Borrower shall send to the  Administrative  Agent for its own account or for the
account of such Lender, as the case may be, evidence reasonably  satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of such payment. If
the  Borrower fails to pay any  Non-Excluded  Taxes payable by the Borrower when
due to the appropriate  taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative
Agent the receipts therefor or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower
shall  indemnify the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders for any  incremental
taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this subsection
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

             (b) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof shall:

                (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (A) two
     duly completed  copies of United States Internal  Revenue Service Form 1001
     or 4224,  or  successor  applicable  form,  as the case may be,  and (B) an
     Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or successor  applicable form, as
     the case may be;

                (ii) deliver to the Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent two
     further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that
     any such form or  certification  expires or becomes  obsolete and after the
     occurrence  of any  event  requiring  a  change  in the  most  recent  form
     previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and

                (iii)  obtain such  extensions  of time for filing and  complete
     such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower
     or the Administrative Agent;

unless in any such case an event (including,  without limitation,  any change in
treaty,  law or  regulation)  has  occurred  prior to the date on which any such
delivery would  otherwise be required which renders all such forms  inapplicable
or which would prevent such Lender from


                                       23

<PAGE>

duly  completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender
so advises the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent. Such Lender shall certify
(i) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that it is entitled to receive  payments
under this  Agreement  without  deduction or  withholding  of any United  States
federal  income  taxes  and (ii) in the  case of a Form  W-8 or W-9,  that it is
entitled to an exemption from United States backup  withholding tax. Each Person
that shall become a Lender or a Participant pursuant to subsection 8.6 shall, no
later than the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all
of the forms and statements required pursuant to this subsection,  provided that
in the case of a Participant  such  Participant  shall furnish all such required
forms and  statements to the Lender from which the related  participation  shall
have been purchased.

             (c) Any Lender claiming any amount pursuant to this subsection 2.17
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions)
to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by the Borrower if such
a filing  would avoid the need for or reduce the amount  payable by the Borrower
under this  subsection  2.17 and would not, in the good faith  determination  of
such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

             (d) Refunds.  If a Lender or the Administrative  Agent (as the case
may be) shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund (or a refund in
the form of a credit) (each,  a "Refund")  from a  Governmental  Authority (as a
result  of  any  error  in  the  amount  of  Non-Excluded  Taxes  paid  to  such
Governmental  Authority) of  Non-Excluded  Taxes which the Borrower has paid, or
with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this
subsection  2.17, it shall promptly  notify the Borrower of the  availability of
such  Refund and shall,  within 30 days after  receipt of written  notice by the
Borrower,  make a claim to such  Governmental  Authority  for such Refund at the
Borrower's  expense if, in the  judgment  of such  Lender or the  Administrative
Agent (as the case may be),  the  making  of such  claim  will not be  otherwise
disadvantageous to it; provided that nothing in this subsection 2.17(d) shall be
construed to require any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent to  institute  any
administrative proceeding (other than the filing of a claim for any such Refund)
or judicial  proceeding to obtain such Refund. If a Lender or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) receives a Refund from a Governmental Authority (as a
result  of  any  error  in  the  amount  of  Non-Excluded  Taxes  paid  to  such
Governmental  Authority) of any  Non-Excluded  Taxes which have been paid by the
Borrower,  or with  respect to which the Borrower  has paid  additional  amounts
pursuant to this  subsection  2.17,  it shall  promptly  pay to the Borrower the
amount so  received  (but only to the extent of  payments  made,  or  additional
amounts  paid,  by the  Borrower  under  this  subsection  2.17 with  respect to
Non-Excluded  Taxes  giving  rise  to  such  Refund),   net  of  all  reasonable
out-of-pocket  expenses  (including the net amount of taxes, if any,  imposed on
such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent with  respect to such  Refund) of such
Lender or the  Administrative  Agent,  and without interest (other than interest
paid by the  relevant  Governmental  Authority  with  respect  to such  Refund);
provided,  however,  that the  Borrower,  upon the request of such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent
in the event such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent is required to repay such
Refund to such Governmental Authority.  Nothing contained in this subsection 2.1
7(d) shall require any Lender or the Administrative  Agent to make available any
of its tax returns (or any other information that it deems to be confidential or
proprietary).


                                       24

<PAGE>


             (e) For  purposes  of  this  subsection  2.17,  the  term  "Lender"
includes (i) an "Assignee"  within the meaning of, and after compliance with the
requirements of, subsection 8.6(c), and (ii) a "Participant"  within the meaning
of subsection  8.6(b);  provided that such Participant  shall have complied with
the  requirements of subsection  2.17(c) to the extent  applicable and provided,
further,  that such  Participant  shall not be entitled to  receive  any greater
amount pursuant to this  subsection  2.17 than the transferor  Lender would have
been entitled to receive had no such transfer occurred.

             2.18 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a  consequence  of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing
of LIBOR Loans, CD Rate Loans or Competitive Loans, or in the conversion into or
continuation  of LIBOR Loans or CD Rate Loans,  after the  Borrower  has given a
notice  requesting or accepting the same in  accordance  with the  provisions of
this Agreement,  (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment  after the
Borrower has given a notice  thereof in accordance  with the  provisions of this
Agreement,  or (c) the making of a prepayment  of LIBOR Loans,  CD Rate Loans or
Competitive  Loans on a day which is not the last day of an  Interest  Period or
the applicable  Competitive Loan Maturity Date, as the case may be, with respect
thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid,
or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow,  convert or continue to the last day of
the relevant  Interest Period (or proposed  Interest  Period) or, in the case of
Competitive  Loans,  the applicable  Competitive Loan Maturity Date (or proposed
Competitive Loan Maturity Date), in each case at the applicable rate of interest
for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin or
any positive margin applicable to LIBOR  Competitive Loans included therein,  if
any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably  determined by such Lender)
which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable  period with leading banks in the interbank  eurodollar
market.  The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

             2.19 Change of Lending Office.  Each Lender agrees that if it makes
any demand for payment under  subsection  2.16 or 2.17(a), or if any adoption or
change of the type described in subsection  2.15 shall occur with respect to it,
it will use reasonable  efforts  (consistent  with its internal policy and legal
and  regulatory   restrictions  and  so  long  as  such  efforts  would  not  be
disadvantageous  to it, as  determined  in its sole  discretion)  to designate a
different  Applicable  Lending Office if the making of such a designation  would
reduce or obviate the need for the Borrower to make  payments  under  subsection
2.16 or  2.17(a),  or would  eliminate  or reduce the effect of any  adoption or
change described in subsection 2.15.

             2.20  Replacement  of  Lenders  under  Certain  Circumstances.  The
Borrower   shall  be   permitted  to  replace  any  Lender  which  (a)  requests
reimbursement  for amounts owing pursuant to subsection 2.16 or 2.17 (other than
with  respect  to  LIBOR  Competitive  Loans),  (b) is  affected  in the  manner
described  in  subsection  2.15  (other than with  respect to LIBOR  Competitive
Loans) and as a result thereof any of the actions  described in said  subsection
is required  to be taken or (c)  defaults in its  obligation  to make  Revolving
Credit Loans hereunder, with a


                                       25

<PAGE>


replacement  bank  or  other  financial  institution;  provided  that  (i)  such
replacement  does not conflict  with any  Requirement  of Law,  (ii) no Event of
Default shall have  occurred and be continuing at the time of such  replacement,
(iii) the Borrower shall repay (or the  replacement  bank or  institution  shall
purchase,  at par) all Loans and other  amounts  owing to such  replaced  Lender
prior to the date of  replacement,  (iv) the  Borrower  shall be  liable to such
replaced  Lender under  subsection 2.18 if any LIBOR Loan owing to such replaced
Lender  shall  be  prepaid  (or  purchased)  other  than on the  last day of the
Interest Period relating  thereto or any Competitive Loan owing to such replaced
Lender shall be paid other than on the relevant  Competitive Loan Maturity Date,
(v) the  replacement  bank or  institution,  if not  already a Lender,  shall be
reasonably  satisfactory to the  Administrative  Agent, (vi) the replaced Lender
shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of
subsection  8.6 (provided  that  the  Borrower  shall  be  obligated  to pay the
registration  and processing fee referred to therein),  (vii) until such time as
such  replacement  shall be  consummated,  the Borrower shall pay all additional
amounts (if any) required  pursuant to subsection  2.16 or 2.17, as the case may
be, and (viii)  any such  replacement  shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
rights which the Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent or any other Lender shall
have against the replaced Lender.


                    SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

             To induce the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders to enter into
this  Agreement  and to make the  Loans,  the  Borrower  hereby  represents  and
warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:

             3.1 Financial  Condition.  The balance sheets of the Borrower as at
December 31, 1994 and the related statements of income,  earnings  reinvested in
business,  and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended on such date,  reported
on by Deloitte & Touche LLP,  copies of which have  heretofore been furnished to
each Lender,  present fairly the financial  condition of the Borrower as at such
date,  and the results of its  operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year
then ended. The unaudited balance sheet of the Borrower as at March 31, 1995 and
the related unaudited statements of income, earnings reinvested in business, and
cash  flows  for the  three-month  period  ended on such  date,  certified  by a
Responsible  Officer,  copies of which have  heretofore  been  furnished to each
Lender,  are complete and correct and present fairly the financial  condition of
the  Borrower as at such date,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for the  three-month  period then ended (subject to normal  year-end audit
adjustments) All such financial statements,  including the related schedules and
notes thereto,  have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied  consistently
throughout  the periods  involved  (except as approved  by such  accountants  or
Responsible  Officer, as the case may be, and as disclosed therein).  During the
period from December 31, 1994 to and including the date hereof there has been no
sale,  transfer or other disposition by the Borrower of any material part of its
business or property  and no purchase or other  acquisition  of any  business or
property  (including any capital stock of any other Person) material in relation
to the financial condition of the Borrower at December 31, 1994.



                                       26

<PAGE>


             3.2 No Change. From December 31, 1994 through the date hereof there
has been no development  or event which has had or could  reasonably be expected
to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  financial  position  or  business
operations of the Borrower.

             3.3 Corporate Existence;  Compliance with Law. Each of the Borrower
and its Material Subsidiaries,  if any, (a) is duly organized,  validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b)
has the corporate  power and authority,  and the legal right, to own and operate
its  property,  to lease the  property  it operates as lessee and to conduct the
business in which it is currently  engaged,  (c) is duly  qualified as a foreign
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each  jurisdiction  where its
ownership,  lease or  operation  of  property  or the  conduct  of its  business
requires such qualification  other than in such jurisdictions  where the failure
so to  qualify  would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or business  operations of the Borrower
and (d) is in compliance with all  Requirements of Law except to the extent that
the failure to comply  therewith  could not, in the  aggregate,  have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or business operations of the Borrower.

             3.4 Corporate  Power;  No Legal Bar. The execution,  delivery,  and
performance  by the  Borrower  of this  Agreement  and any Note are  within  its
corporate powers,  have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate action,
and do not violate any provision of law or any  agreement,  indenture,  note, or
other instrument  binding upon or affecting it or its charter or by-laws or give
cause for acceleration of any of its Indebtedness.

             3.5 Authorization;  Enforceability. All authorizations,  approvals,
and  other  actions  by,  and  notices  to and  filings  with  all  Governmental
Authorities  required for the due  execution,  delivery and  performance of this
Agreement  and any Note have  been  obtained  or made and are in full  force and
effect.  Each of this Agreement and each Note executed in connection herewith is
a legal,  valid and binding obligation of the Borrower  enforceable  against the
Borrower in  accordance  with its terms,  subject to the effects of  bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,  reorganization,  moratorium or other similar
laws relating to or affecting  creditors'  rights  generally,  general equitable
principles  (whether  considered  in a  proceeding  in  equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

             3.6 ERISA. No "prohibited  transaction"  (as defined in Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or  "accumulated  funding  deficiency" (as
defined in Section 022 of ERISA) or "reportable event" (herein defined as any of
the events set forth in Section 4043(b) of ERlSA or the regulations  thereunder)
has occurred since July 1, 1974 with respect to any Plan which would  materially
and adversely affect the financial condition of the Borrower.  The present value
of all  benefits  vested  under  all Plans  maintained  by the  Borrower  or any
Commonly  Controlled  Entity (based on those assumptions used to fund the Plans)
did not, as of the last annual valuation date, exceed the value of the assets of
the Plan allocable to such vested benefits.

             3.7 No  Material  Litigation.  As of the  date  hereof,  except  as
heretofore  disclosed  pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended,  there are no legal or arbitral proceedings or any proceedings
by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending or,
to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower


                                       27


<PAGE>


or any of its Material  Subsidiaries,  which the  Borrower  would be required to
disclose  pursuant  to Section 13 of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as
amended.

             3.8 Taxes.  The Borrower (or Dominion  Resources for years in which
the  Borrower  filed a  consolidated  return with  Dominion  Resources)  and its
Material  Subsidiaries  have filed all United States  Federal income tax returns
and all other tax returns  which are  required to be filed by them and have paid
all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by
the Borrower or any such Material Subsidiary. The charges, accruals and reserves
on the books of the Borrower and such Material  Subsidiaries in respect of taxes
and other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate.

             3.9  Purpose of Loans.  The  proceeds of the Loans shall be used by
the Borrower for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper back-up,
and no  part  of the  proceeds  of any  Loans  will  be  used  in  violation  of
Regulations  G, U or X of the  Board as now and from time to time  hereafter  in
effect.


                         SECTION 4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

             4.1   Conditions  to  Initial  Loans.  The  effectiveness  of  this

      Treasurer and the  Secretary or any  Assistant  Secretary of the Borrower,
      and attaching the documents  referred to in  subsections  4.1(c), (d) and
      (e).

      duly authorized committee thereof) authorizing (i) the execution, delivery

            (b) No Default. No Default or Event of Default shall  have  occurred

warranty by the Borrower as of the date thereof that the conditions contained in
this subsection 4.2 have been satisfied.


                              SECTION 5. COVENANTS

             The Borrower hereby agrees that, so long as the Commitments  remain
in effect  or any  amount is owing to any  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder or under any other Loan Document:

             5.1   Financial  Statements.   The  Borrower  shall  furnish to the
Administrative Agent, who shall forward to each Lender:

            (a) as soon as  practicable,  but in any event within 120 days after

the  Borrower  of  obligations  of any of its  Subsidiaries;  and (c)  Guarantee
Obligations  guaranteeing  securities  issued by a  corporation,  partnership or

                          SECTION 6. EVENTS OF DEFAULT

             If any of the following events shall occur and be continuing:

           (a) The Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due
     in accordance with the terms hereof, or to pay any interest on any Loan, or
     any other amount payable  hereunder,  within 5 Business Days after any such
     amount becomes due in accordance with the terms hereof;

     or any  Lender  in  connection  with the  execution  and  delivery  of this
     Agreement or the making of Loans hereunder proves to have been incorrect in
     any  material  respect  when made,  and the future  financial  position  or
     business  operations  of the Borrower  could  reasonably  be expected to be
     materially  and  adversely  affected  from what  would be the case had such
     representation and warranty not been incorrect;

           (c) The Borrower shall default in the  performance of any other term,

     in paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this Section) and such default shall continue
     unremedied for 30 days;

           (d) The Borrower or any of its Material  Subsidiaries shall (i) apply

     relating  to  bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,   winding-up,  or
     composition or readjustment  of debts,  (vi) fail to controvert in a timely
     and  appropriate  manner,  or acquiesce  in writing to, any petition  filed
     against the Borrower or any of its Material  Subsidiaries in an involuntary
     case under such federal laws,  or (vii) take any  corporate  action for the
     purpose of affecting any of the foregoing;

           (e)  A  case  or  other  proceeding  shall  be  commenced  (including
     commencement of such case or proceeding by way of service of process on the
     Borrower or any of its  Material  Subsidiaries),  in any court of competent
     jurisdiction, seeking (i) the liquidation,  reorganization,  dissolution or
     winding-up,  or the composition or readjustment of debts of the Borrower or
     any of its  Material  Subsidiaries,  (ii)  the  appointment  of a  trustee,
     receiver, custodian,  liquidator, or the like of the Borrower or any of its
     Material Subsidiaries or of all or any substantial part of their respective

                                       32

<PAGE>



     in respect of the  Borrower or any of its Material  Subsidiaries  under any
     law  relating to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  winding up, or
     composition  or   readjustment  of  debts,  or  a  warrant  of  attachment,
     execution, or similar process shall be issued against a substantial part of
     the property of the Borrower or any of its Material  Subsidiaries  and such
     case,  proceeding,  warrant,  or  process  shall  continue  undismissed  or
     unstayed and in effect for a period of 45 days, or an order,  judgment,  or
     decree  approving or ordering any of the  foregoing  shall be entered in an
     involuntary case under such federal bankruptcy laws;

           (f) A trustee shall be appointed to administer any Plan under Section
     4042 of ERISA, or the PBGC shall institute proceedings to terminate,  or to
     have a trustee  appointed to administer any Plan and such proceedings shall
     continue undismissed or unstayed and in effect for a period of 30 days, and
     any such event shall result in any liability  which is material in relation
     to  the   consolidated   financial   condition  of  the  Borrower  and  its
     consolidated Subsidiaries, if any;

           (g)  The  Borrower  or any of its  Material  Subsidiaries  shall  (i)
     default in any payment of principal  or interest in an aggregate  amount of
     $25,000,000  or  more  (or in the payment of any guarantee  thereof) beyond
     the  period  of  grace,  if any,  provided in the  instrument  or agreement
     under  which  such  Indebtedness  or guarantee  thereof was created or (ii)
     default  beyond   any  applicable   grace  period  in  the  observance   or
     performance  of  any  other   agreement  or   condition  relating   to  any
     Indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or more or any guarantee
     thereof or contained in any  instrument or agreement  evidencing,  securing
     or relating thereto,  or any  other  event shall occur or condition  exist,
     the effect of which default or other  event or condition is to cause, or to
     permit the holder  or  holders  of  such  Indebtedness  to cause,  with the
     giving of notice if required,  such Indebtedness to become due prior to its
     stated maturity;  provided, however, if such default  shall be cured by the
     Borrower  or  any  Material  Subsidiary  or waived by the  holders  of such
     Indebtedness  and any  acceleration  of maturity  having resulted from such
     default  shall  be  rescinded or annulled, in each case in accordance  with
     the terms of such agreement or instrument, without (i) any  modification of
     the  terms  of  such  Indebtedness  requiring  the  Borrower  or  any  such
     Material  Subsidiary  to  furnish  additional  or  other security therefor,
     reducing the  average  life to maturity thereof or increasing the principal
     amount  thereof  or (ii) any agreement by the Borrower or any such Material
     Subsidiary  to  furnish  additional or other security therefor  or to issue
     in  lieu  thereof Indebtedness secured by additional or other collateral or
     with a  shorter  average life to maturity or in a greater principal amount,
     then any  default  hereunder  by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to
     have been thereupon cured or waived; or

           (h)  There  shall  have  been   entered  by  a  court  of   competent
     jurisdiction  within the United  States  and shall not  have been  vacated,
     discharged or stayed within sixty (60) days from the entry thereof (or such
     longer  period as may be  provided by law) one or more final  judgments  or
     final  decrees  for payment of money  against  the  Borrower  or any of its
     Material Subsidiaries involving in the aggregate a liability (to the extent
     not paid or covered by insurance) in excess of $25,000,000;


                                       33

<PAGE>


then, and in any such event, (A) if such event is an Event of Default  specified
in  paragraph  (d)  or  (e) of  this  Section  with  respect  to  the  Borrower,
automatically  the  Commitments  shall  immediately   terminate  and  the  Loans
hereunder (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this
Agreement shall immediately become due and payable, and (B) if such event is any
other Event of Default,  either or both of the  following  actions may be taken:
(i) with the consent of the Majority Lenders,  the Administrative  Agent may, or
upon the request of the Majority  Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent shall, by
notice to the  Borrower  declare the  Commitments  to be  terminated  forthwith,
whereupon the Commitments shall immediately terminate; and (ii) with the consent
of the Majority Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent may, or upon the request of
the Majority Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower,
declare  the Loans  hereunder  (with  accrued  interest  thereon)  and all other
amounts owing under this  Agreement to be due and payable  forthwith,  whereupon
the same shall immediately become due and payable.  Except as expressly provided
above in this Section, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any
kind are hereby expressly waived.


                       SECTION 7. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

             7.1  Appointment.  Each Lender hereby  irrevocably  designates  and
appoints  the  Administrative  Agent as the  agent  of such  Lender  under  this
Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents,  and each  such  Lender  irrevocably
authorizes the  Administrative  Agent, in such capacity,  to take such action on
its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents;
and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are  expressly  delegated
to the  Administrative  Agent by the terms of this  Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,  the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary  relationship with any Lender,  and
no  implied  covenants,  functions,  responsibilities,  duties,  obligations  or
liabilities  shall be read into this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

             7.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative  Agent may execute any
of its duties under this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents by or through
agents  or  attorneys-in-fact  and  shall  be  entitled  to  advice  of  counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not be  responsible  for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys
in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

             7.3 Exculpatory  Provisions.  Neither the Administrative  Agent nor
any  of  its  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,   attorneys-in-fact  or
Affiliates  shall be (i) liable for any action  lawfully  taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person  under or in  connection  with this  Agreement or any
other Loan  Document  (except for its or such  Person's own gross  negligence or
willful  misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for
any recitals, statements,  representations or warranties made by the Borrower or
any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the  Administrative  Agent under or in connection  with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity,


                                       34

<PAGE>


effectiveness,  genuineness,  enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan  Document  or for any  failure  of the  Borrower  to perform  its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under
any  obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance  of any of the  agreements  contained  in, or  conditions  of,  this
Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  or to inspect the  properties,  books or
records of the Borrower.

             7.4 Reliance by  Administrative  Agent.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall be entitled to rely,  and shall be fully  protected  in relying,  upon any
Note, writing,  resolution,  notice,  consent,  certificate,  affidavit, letter,
telecopy,  telex or  teletype  message,  statement,  order or other  document or
conversation  believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been  signed,
sent or made by the proper  Person or Persons and upon advice and  statements of
legal  counsel  (including,   without  limitation,  counsel  to  the  Borrower),
independent  accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.
The  Administrative  Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes  unless a written notice of assignment,  negotiation or
transfer  thereof  shall  have been  filed with the  Administrative  Agent.  The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action  under this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document  unless it shall first
receive  such  advice  or  concurrence  of  the  Majority  Lenders  as it  deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its  satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all  liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative  Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting,  or in refraining from acting,  under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance  with a request of the
Majority  Lenders,  and such  request  and any  action  taken or  failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of
the Loans.

             7.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the  Administrative  Agent has received notice from a Lender or
the Borrower  referring to this  Agreement,  describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Administrative  Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give notice  thereof to the Lenders.  The  Administrative  Agent shall take such
action with respect to such  Default or Event of Default as shall be  reasonably
directed  by  the  Majority   Lenders;   provided  that  unless  and  until  the
Administrative  Agent shall have received such  directions,  the  Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be  obligated  to) take such  action,  or refrain  from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

             7.6 Non-Reliance on  Administrative  Agent and Other Lenders.  Each
Lender expressly  acknowledges that neither the Administrative  Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents,  attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has
made  any   representations  or  warranties  to  it  and  that  no  act  by  the
Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrower,  shall be deemed to constitute any  representation  or warranty by the
Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative
Agent that it has,  independently  and without reliance upon the  Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own


                                       35

<PAGE>


appraisal  of  and  investigation  into  the  business,  operations,   property,
financial and other condition and  creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its
own decision to make its Loans  hereunder  and enter into this  Agreement.  Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative  Agent or any  other  Lender,  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit  analysis,  appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  and to make such  investigation as
it deems  necessary to inform itself as to the business,  operations,  property,
financial and other condition and  creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for
notices,  reports and other documents  expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Administrative  Agent hereunder,  the Administrative  Agent shall
not have any duty or  responsibility  to provide  any Lender  with any credit or
other  information  concerning  the business,  operations,  property,  condition
(financial or otherwise),  prospects or  creditworthiness  of the Borrower which
may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

             7.7   Indemnification.   The  Lenders   agree  to   indemnify   the
Administrative  Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not  reimbursed  by
the Borrower  and without  limiting  the  obligation  of the Borrower to do so),
ratably  according to their respective  Commitment  Percentages in effect on the
date on which  indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after
the date upon which the  Commitments  shall have  terminated and the Loans shall
have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Commitment  Percentages
immediately  prior to such  date),  from and  against  any and all  liabilities,
obligations,  losses, damages,   penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind  whatsoever  which  may  at  any  time
(including,  without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the  Administrative  Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments,  this Agreement,  any of the
other Loan Documents or any documents  contemplated  by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or any action taken
or omitted by the  Administrative  Agent under or in connection  with any of the
foregoing;  provided  that no Lender  shall be  liable  for the  payment  of any
portion of such liabilities,  obligations,  losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or disbursements  resulting solely from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in
this  subsection  shall  survive the payment of the Loans and all other  amounts
payable hereunder.

             7.8   Administrative   Agent  in  Its  Individual   Capacity.   The
Administrative  Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and  generally  engage in any kind of business  with the  Borrower as though the
Administrative  Agent were not the Administrative  Agent hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents.  With respect to the Loans made by it, the Administrative
Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this  Agreement  and the other
Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative  Agent,  and the terms  "Lender" and "Lenders"  shall include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

             7.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders. If the
Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative  gent under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, then the


                                       36

<PAGE>


Majority  Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the
Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such
successor  agent  shall  succeed  to  the  rights,  powers  and  duties  of  the
Administrative  Agent,  and the term  "Administrative  Agent"  shall  mean  such
successor  agent effective upon such  appointment  and approval,  and the former
Administrative  Agent's rights,  powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be  terminated,  without  any other or  further  act or deed on the part of such
former  Administrative  Agent or any of the  parties  to this  Agreement  or any
holders of the Loans. After any retiring  Administrative  Agent's resignation as
Administrative  Agent,  the  provisions  of this  Section  7 shall  inure to its
benefit  as to any  actions  taken  or  omitted  to be  taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,


                            SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS

              8.1 Amendments and Waivers. The Majority Lenders may, or, with the
written consent of the Majority Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, from time
to  time,  enter  into  with  the  Borrower  written  amendments,   supplements,
modifications  or  waivers  hereto  and to the other  Loan  Documents  provided,
however,  that no such waiver and no such amendment,  supplement or modification
shall (i)  reduce the amount or extend the  scheduled  date of  maturity  of any

right,  remedy,  power or privilege  hereunder or under the other Loan Documents

             8.5  Payment  of  Expenses.  The  Borrower  agrees  (a)  to  pay or
reimburse the Administrative  Agent for all its reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs
and  expenses  incurred in  connection  with the  development,  preparation  and

execution,  delivery,  enforcement,   performance  and  administration  of  this
Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  (all the foregoing in this clause (c),
collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"),  provided, that the Borrower shall
have no  obligation  hereunder  to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender with
respect to indemnified  liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative  Agent or any such Lender or the failure of the
Administrative Agent or any such Lender to comply with this


                                       38


<PAGE>


Agreement.  The agreements  in this  subsection  shall survive repayment of  the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

             8.6 Transfer Provisions. (a) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the
Administrative  Agent and their respective  successors and assigns,  except that
the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or  obligations  under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of each Lender.

             (b)  Participations.  Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
commercial  banking  business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time
sell to one or more  banks  or  other  entities  ("Participants")  participating
interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any
other interest of such Lender  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  In
the  event  of any  such  sale by a  Lender  of a  participating  interest  to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties
to this  Agreement  shall remain  unchanged,  such Lender  shall  remain  solely
responsible for the performance thereof,  such Lender shall remain the holder of
any  such  Loan  for all  purposes  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

             (c)  Assignments.  Any Lender  may, in the  ordinary  course of its
commercial  banking  business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time
and from time to time assign to any Lender or any affiliate thereof or, with the
consent of the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent (which in each case shall
not be unreasonably  withheld),  to an additional bank or financial  institution
("an  Assignee")  all or any  part of its  rights  and  obligations  under  this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance,
substantially  in the  form  of  Exhibit  E,  executed  by such  Assignee,  such
assigning  Lender (and,  in the case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender or
an  affiliate  thereof,  by the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative  Agent)  and
delivered to the  Administrative  Agent for its  acceptance and recording in the
Register, provided that, (i) in the case of any such assignment to an additional
bank or financial institution,  the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the
Commitment  being  assigned shall not be less than  $10,000,000  (or such lesser
amount as may be agreed to by the  Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent) and
(ii) any such  assignment  may, but need not,  include  rights of the  assigning
Lender  in  respect  of  Competitive  Loans.  Upon  such  execution,   delivery,
acceptance and recording,  from and after the effective date determined pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance,  (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent provided in such  Assignment and Acceptance,  have the
rights and  obligations  of a Lender  hereunder  with a Commitment  as set forth
therein,  and (y) the assigning Lender  thereunder shall, to the extent provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance,  be released from its obligations  under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the
remaining  portion of an assigning  Lender's rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement, such assigning Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

             (d)  The Register.   The Administrative  Agent,  on behalf  of  the
Borrower, shall maintain at the address of the Administrative Agent referred  to
in subsection 8.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a
register (the "Register") for the recordation of


                                       39

<PAGE>


the names and  addresses  of the Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and  principal
amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the
Register  shall  be  conclusive,  in the  absence  of  manifest  error,  and the
Borrower,  the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may (and, in the case of any
Loan or other  obligation  hereunder not evidenced by a Note,  shall) treat each
Person  whose name is recorded  in the  Register as the owner of a Loan or other
obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and
the other  Loan  Documents,  notwithstanding  any  notice to the  contrary.  Any
assignment  of any Loan or other  obligation  hereunder  not evidenced by a Note
shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made
in the Register.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

             (e)  Recordation.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee
that is not then a Lender  or an  affiliate  thereof,  by the  Borrower  and the
Administrative Agent) together with payment by the Assignee or the Assignor (or,
in the event of a  replacement  of a Lender  pursuant to  subsection  2.20,  the
replacement Lender) to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing
fee  of  $1,500,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  (i)  promptly  accept  such
Assignment and Acceptance  and (ii) on the effective  date  determined  pursuant
thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice
of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

             (f) Disclosure.  The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to
any  Participant  or  Assignee  (each,  a  "Transferee")   and  any  prospective
Transferee,  any and all  financial  information  in  such  Lender's  possession
concerning the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries,  which has been delivered to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower  pursuant to this  Agreement or which has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with
such Lender's credit  evaluation of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  prior to
becoming a party to this Agreement.

             (g) Pledges.  For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement
acknowledge  that the provisions of this  subsection  concerning  assignments of
Loans and Notes relate only to absolute  assignments and that such provisions do
not  prohibit  assignments  creating  security  interests,   including,  without
limitation,  any  pledge  or  assignment  by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law.

             8.7 Adjustments. If any Lender (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any
time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans,  or interest  thereon,  or
receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
by  set-off,  pursuant  to events or  proceedings  of the nature  referred to in
Section  6(d) or (e),  or  otherwise),  in a  greater  proportion  than any such
payment to or  collateral  received by any other  Lender,  if any, in respect of
such other  Lender's Loans that are then due and payable,  or interest  thereon,
such  benefitted  Lender  shall  purchase  for cash  from the  other  Lenders  a
participating  interest in such portion of each such other  Lender's  Loans,  or
shall  provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such  collateral,  or
the proceeds  thereof,  as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with
each of the Lenders; provided,


                                       40

<PAGE>


however,  that if all or any  portion  of such  excess  payment or  benefits  is
thereafter  recovered  from  such  benefitted  Lender,  such  purchase  shall be
rescinded,  and the purchase price and benefits returned,  to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.

             8.8 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts  (including
by facsimile transmission), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be
deemed to constitute  one and the same  instrument.  A set of the copies of this
Agreement  signed by all the parties  shall be lodged with the  Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

             8.9  Severability.   Any  provision  of  this  Agreement  which  is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof,  and any such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

             8.10  Integration.  This  Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents
represent  the  agreement  of the  Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent and the
Lenders with respect to the subject  matter  hereof,  and there are no promises,
undertakings,  representations or warranties by the Administrative  Agent or any
Lender  relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the other Loan Documents.

             8.11  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE  GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

             8.12 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER,  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
AND THE LENDERS HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY AND  UNCONDITIONALLY  WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL  ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT  AND FOR ANY  COUNTERCLAIM  THEREIN.  THIS  WAIVER  SHALL  APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,  RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

             8.13  Confidentiality.  Each Lender agrees to keep confidential any
written or oral  information  (a) provided to it by or on behalf of the Borrower
pursuant to or in connection  with this Agreement or (b) obtained by such Lender
based on a review  of the books  and  records  of the  Borrower;  provided  that
nothing herein shall prevent any Lender from disclosing any such information (i)
to its affiliates,  the  Administrative  Agent or any other Lender,  (ii) to any
Transferee which agrees to comply with the provisions of this subsection,  (iii)
to  its  employees,   directors,   agents,  attorneys,   accountants  and  other
professional  advisors,  (iv) upon the  request  or  demand of any  Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, (v) in response to


                                       41

<PAGE>

any order of any court or other  Governmental  Authority or as may  otherwise be
required  pursuant  to any  Requirement  of Law,  (vi)  which has been  publicly
disclosed  other than in breach of this  Agreement,  or (vii) in connection with
the exercise of any remedy  hereunder.  In the event that a Lender determines to
disclose information pursuant to clause (v) of this subsection 8.13, such Lender
will, to the extent  permitted by applicable  law,  notify the Borrower prior to
disclosing such information.

 * In the event such ratings fall within different  Levels,  the foregoing will

   except  that in the event  that the lower of such  ratings  is more than one
   Level  below  the  higher of such  ratings,  the  Facility  Fee Rate and the
   Applicable  Margin will be determined based on the Level one Level above the
   lower of such ratings.  In the event that there is no Moody's Bond Rating or
   S&P Bond Rating available (other than due to both Moody's Investor Services,
   Inc.  and  Standard  & Poor's  Ratings  Group  ceasing  to be engaged in the
   business of rating  corporate debt  securities),  then the Facility Fee Rate
   and the Applicable  Margin will be determined based on Level 5. In the event
   that both Moody's  Investor  Services,  Inc.  and Standard & Poor's  Ratings
   Group  cease  to be  engaged  in  the  business  of  rating  corporate  debt
   securities, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to establish
   on an equitable basis new Facility Fee Rates and Applicable Margins.
