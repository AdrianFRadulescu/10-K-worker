PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE COMPANY

     Wendy's International, Inc. was incorporated in 1969 under the laws of the
     State of Ohio. Wendy's International, Inc. and its subsidiaries are
     collectively referred to herein as the "Company."

     The Company is primarily engaged in the business of operating, developing,
     and franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants. At
     January 1, 1995, there were 4,411 Wendy's restaurants in operation in the
     United States and in 33 other countries and territories. Of these
     restaurants, 1,264 were operated by the Company and 3,147 by the Company's
     franchisees.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPERATIONS

     Each Wendy's restaurant offers a relatively standard menu featuring
     hamburgers and filet of chicken breast sandwiches, which are prepared to
     order with the customer's choice of condiments. Wendy's menu also includes
     a salad bar, chili, baked and french fried potatoes, prepared salads,
     desserts, soft drinks and other non-alcoholic beverages, and a child's
     meal. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of promotional products
     on a limited basis.

     The Company strives to maintain quality and uniformity throughout all
     Wendy's restaurants by publishing detailed specifications for food
     products, preparation, and service by continual in-service training of
     employees, and by field visits from Company supervisors. In the case of
     franchisees, field visits are made by Company personnel who review
     operations and make recommendations to assist in compliance with Company
     specifications.

     Generally, the Company does not sell food or supplies to its franchisees.
     However, the Company has arranged for volume purchases of many of these
     products. Under the purchasing arrangements, independent distributors
     purchase certain products directly from approved suppliers, and store and
     sell them to local Company and franchised restaurants. These programs help
     assure availability of products and provide quantity discounts, quality
     control, and efficient distribution. These advantages are available both to
     the Company and to any franchisees who choose to participate in the
     distribution program.

     The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc., (Bakery) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
     Company, is a producer of buns for Wendy's restaurants. At January 1, 1995,
     the Bakery supplied 652 restaurants operated by the Company and 1,136
     restaurants operated by franchisees. At the present time, the Bakery does
     not manufacture or sell any other products.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAW MATERIALS

     The Company and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages
     of food, equipment, fixtures, or other products which are necessary to
     restaurant operations. The Company anticipates no such shortages of
     products and, in any event, alternate suppliers are available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS OF THE COMPANY

     The Company has registered certain trademarks and service marks in the
     United States Patent and Trademark office and in international
     jurisdictions, some of which include "Wendy's", "Wendy", "Old Fashioned
     Hamburgers", and "Quality Is Our Recipe". The Company believes that these
     and other related marks are of material importance to the Company's
     business. Domestic trademarks and service marks expire at various times
     from 1995 to 2009, while international trademarks and service marks have
     various durations of 5 to 20 years. The Company generally intends to renew
     trademarks and service marks which expire.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEASONALITY

     The Company's business is moderately seasonal. Average restaurant sales are
     normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.

                                        2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES

     Cash from operations, cash and short-term investments on hand, and possible
     asset dispositions should enable the Company to meet its financing
     requirements. In addition, the Company has available unused lines of credit
     and has filed a $200 million shelf registration. It is a normal practice
     within the quick-service restaurant industry to maintain a relatively low
     current ratio.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPETITION

     Wendy's is one of the largest food service organizations in the world. Each
     Company and franchised restaurant is in competition with other food service
     operations within the same geographical area. The quick-service restaurant
     industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with other
     organizations primarily through the quality, variety, and value perception
     of food products offered. The number and location of units, quality and
     speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of
     marketing are also important factors. The price charged for each menu item
     may vary from market to market depending on competitive pricing and the
     local cost structure.

     The Company's competitive position is enhanced by its use of fresh ground
     beef, its unique and diverse menu, promotional products, its wide choice of
     condiments, and the atmosphere and decor of its restaurants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     The Company engages in research and development on an ongoing basis,
     testing new products and procedures for possible introduction into the
     Wendy's system. While research and development operations are considered to
     be of prime importance to the Company, amounts expended for these
     activities are not deemed material.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

     A number of states have enacted legislation which, together with rules
     promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, affect companies involved in
     franchising. Much of the legislation and rules adopted have been aimed at
     requiring detailed disclosure to a prospective franchisee and periodic
     registration by the franchisor with state administrative agencies.
     Additionally, some states have enacted, and others have considered,
     legislation which governs the termination or non-renewal of a franchise
     agreement and other aspects of the franchise relationship. The United
     States Congress has also considered legislation of this nature. The Company
     has complied with requirements of this type in all applicable
     jurisdictions. The Company cannot predict the effect on its operations,
     particularly on its relationship with franchisees, of future enactment of
     additional legislation. Various other government initiatives such as
     minimum wage rates and taxes can all have a significant impact on the
     Company's performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY

     Various federal, state, and local regulations have been adopted which
     affect the discharge of materials into the environment or which otherwise
     relate to the protection of the environment. The Company does not believe
     that such regulations will have a material effect on its capital
     expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company cannot predict
     the effect of future environmental legislation or regulations.

     The Company's principal sources of energy for its operations are
     electricity and natural gas. To date, the supply of energy available to the
     Company has been sufficient to maintain normal operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     The Company has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold
     restaurants to franchisees, and it is anticipated that the Company may have
     opportunities for such transactions in the future. The Company generally
     retains a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale of a
     franchisee's interest. The Company will continue to sell and acquire
     restaurants in the future where prudent.

     See Notes 6  and 7 under Item 8 on page 23 of this Form 10-K for further
     information regarding acquisitions and dispositions.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

     Markets in Canada are currently being developed for both company-owned and
     franchised restaurants. In addition to the countries and territories listed
     under Item 2 on page 6 of this Form 10-K, the Company has granted
     development rights for Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, and the
     Yemen Arab Republic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRANCHISED WENDY'S RESTAURANTS

     As of January 1, 1995, the Company's franchisees operated 3,147 Wendy's
     restaurants in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 33 other countries
     and territories.

     The rights and franchises under which most franchised restaurants in the
     United States are operated are set forth in one basic document, the
     Restaurant Franchise Agreement. This document gives the franchisee the
     right to construct, own, and operate a Wendy's restaurant upon a site
     accepted by Wendy's and to use the Wendy's system in connection with the
     operation of the restaurant at that site. The Company will use a revised
     form of agreement, the Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement, for new franchised
     restaurants operated in the United States beginning in 1995.

     Wendy's has in the past franchised under different agreements on a
     multi-unit basis; however, now it is generally the intent of the Company to
     grant new franchises both in the United States and foreign countries on a
     unit-by-unit basis.

     After having submitted to Wendy's the requested application and financial
     materials, if initially approved by Wendy's, an individual becomes an
     approved applicant upon the execution of a Preliminary Letter Agreement.
     This Preliminary Letter Agreement does not guarantee that the applicant
     will be accepted as a Wendy's franchisee but entitles the applicant to
     commence a training program, intended to allow both parties the opportunity
     to more carefully assess a long-term franchise relationship. For existing
     franchisees who in Wendy's opinion are not in need of additional training,
     the Preliminary Letter Agreement may not be necessary. Upon the execution
     of a Preliminary Letter Agreement, the applicant is required to pay a
     non-refundable fee of $5,000 to help defray the cost of the approval
     process and the initial training.

     Both the Restaurant Franchise Agreement and the Wendy's Unit Franchise
     Agreement require that the franchisee pay a royalty of 4% of gross receipts
     from the operation of the restaurant. Both Agreements also typically
     require that the franchisee pay the Company a technical assistance fee. In
     the United States, the technical assistance fee required under newly
     executed Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreements is currently $25,000 for each
     restaurant.

     The technical assistance fee is used to defray the cost to the Company of
     providing to its franchisees site selection assistance, standard
     construction plans, specifications and layouts, review of specific
     restaurant site plans, certain training in the Company's restaurant
     systems, and certain bulletins, brochures, and reports. The Company does
     not select or employ personnel on behalf of the franchisees.

     The rights and franchises currently offered for international development
     are contained in the Franchise Agreement which is issued upon approval of a
     restaurant site. The Franchise Agreement is for an initial term of 20 years
     or the term of the lease for the restaurant site, whichever is shorter. The
     Franchise Agreement licenses the franchisee to use the Company's trademarks
     and know-how in the operation of the restaurant. Upon execution of the
     Franchise Agreement, the franchisee is required to pay a technical
     assistance fee. Generally, the technical assistance fee is $30,000 for each
     restaurant. Currently, the franchisee is required to pay a monthly net
     continuing fee based on the gross sales of the restaurant, usually 4%.

     See Schedule II on page 29 of this Form 10-K, and Management's Discussion
     and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7
     on pages 11 through 14 and Note 8 under Item 8 on page 23  of this Form
     10-K for further information regarding reserves, commitments, and
     contingencies involving franchisees.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS

     Products sold by Wendy's restaurants are advertised through television,
     radio, newspapers, and a variety of promotional campaigns. The Company
     attempts to keep franchisees informed of current advertising techniques and
     effective promotions. The Company's advertising materials are also made
     available to the franchisees. Both the Restaurant Franchise Agreement and
     the Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement provide that franchisees will spend 4%
     of their gross receipts for advertising and promotions. The Restaurant
     Franchise Agreement specifies 2% is to be spent on local and regional
     advertising (including in many cases cooperative advertising), and 2% is
     the required contribution to The Wendy's National Advertising Program, Inc.
     (WNAP). Under the Restaurant Franchise Agreement the

                                        4

<PAGE>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Company has the ability to increase the required local and regional
     expenditures to 3%, for a total of 5% for advertising and promotions,
     subject to certain conditions.

     The Company has the ability under the Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement to
     specify and to change the 4% advertising and promotions allocation subject
     to certain restrictions. Currently, the Company requires franchisees under
     the Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement to allocate 2% to local and regional
     advertising and promotions and 2% to national advertising and promotions.
     In addition, under that Agreement the Company may increase the total
     advertising and promotions contribution to 5% for franchisees operating
     restaurants pursuant to that Agreement, if such increase is approved by an
     affirmative vote representing 75% or more of all domestic Wendy's
     restaurants.

     In 1992, 1993, and 1994 a systemwide vote was taken on a proposal to
     increase national advertising during the following calendar year. This
     voluntary program reallocates the 4% required minimum advertising
     expenditures such that 2 1/2% goes toward national advertising and 1 1/2%
     toward local and regional advertising during 1993, 1994, and 1995. These
     minimum requirements will revert back to 2% for national and 2% for local
     and regional advertising unless a new systemwide vote in 1995 approves
     reallocation for 1996.

     During fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992, approximately $101 million, $86
     million, and $67 million, respectively, were spent on advertising,
     promotions, and related expenses by WNAP. WNAP is a not-for-profit
     corporation which was established to collect and administer the funds
     contributed by the Company and all domestic franchisees. WNAP's Trustees
     are comprised of representatives of both the Company and its franchisees.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERSONNEL

     As of January 1, 1995, the Company employed approximately 44,000 people, of
     whom approximately 43,000 were employed in company-operated restaurants.
     The total number of full-time employees at that date was approximately
     7,000. The Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.
     The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements except
     for (i) an agreement with a labor union which represents certain employees
     of the Bakery, and (ii) an agreement with a union which represents certain
     employees at one of the Company's Canadian restaurants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Wendy's restaurants are built to Company specifications as to exterior
     style and interior decor. The majority are free-standing, one-story brick
     buildings, substantially uniform in design and appearance, constructed on
     sites of approximately 40,000 square feet, with parking for approximately
     45 cars. Some restaurants, located in downtown areas or shopping malls, are
     of a store-front type and vary according to available locations but
     generally retain the standard sign and interior decor. The typical new
     free-standing restaurant contains about 2,800 square feet and has a cooking
     area, a dining room capacity for 90 persons, and a double pick-up window
     for drive-thru service. The restaurants are generally located in urban or
     heavily populated suburban areas, and their success depends upon serving a
     large number of customers. Wendy's also operates restaurants in special
     site locations such as Wal-Mart stores, travel centers, military bases,
     arenas, malls, hospitals, airports, and college campuses.

     At January 1, 1995, the Company and its franchisees operated 4,411 Wendy's
     restaurants in the locations listed under Item 2 on page 6 of this Form
     10-K. Of the 1,264 company-operated Wendy's restaurants, the Company owned
     the land and building for 604 restaurants, owned the building and held
     long-term land leases for 244 restaurants, and held leases covering land
     and building for 416 restaurants. The Company's land and building leases
     are generally written for terms of 20 to 25 years with one or more
     five-year renewal options. In certain lease agreements the Company has the
     option to purchase the real estate. Certain leases require the payment of
     additional rent equal to a percentage (ranging from 1% to 10%) of annual
     sales in excess of specified amounts. Some of the real estate owned by the
     Company is subject to mortgages which mature over various terms. Surplus
     land and buildings are generally held for sale.

     The Company also owns land and buildings for 351 restaurant locations which
     it in turn leases to certain of its franchisees.

     The Company owns approximately 37.6 acres of land in Dublin, Ohio on which
     are located the Company's corporate headquarters. This complex contains
     approximately 200,000 square feet of office space.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On May 26, 1989, Jonathan Raven and Eli Shapiro, individually and
     purportedly on behalf of a putative class of other persons similarly
     situated, filed a complaint against the Company and others in the U.S.
     District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The
     complaint, insofar as it pertains to the Company, alleges violations of
     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, and the common
     law. The plaintiffs claim to be investors in a limited partnership which
     was a franchisee of the Company. The partnership was formed in 1985 to
     purchase from the Company restaurants located in Washington and Oregon. The
     purchase was funded in part by the offering of limited partnership
     interests and revenue sensitive subordinated notes to the investors. The
     offering was concluded in 1986. The complaint seeks compensatory damages in
     the amount of $18 million, attorneys fees and rescission of the purchases
     of limited partnership interests and revenue sensitive subordinated notes
     sold in the offering. The Company obtained releases from 82% of the
     potential plaintiffs. The remaining potential plaintiffs have not been
     certified as a class. The case was transferred upon motion of the
     defendants to the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia. The defendants'
     motion to dismiss the federal claims was granted with prejudice on October
     9, 1991. The defendants' motion to dismiss the state claim was granted
     without prejudice on the same day. The plaintiffs filed a motion for
     reinstatement of their Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and common law claims on
     February 14, 1992. That motion was granted on September 24, 1992. The
     defendants subsequently filed a motion to permit an interlocutory appeal
     and renewed their motion to dismiss the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims
     for reasons the court had not yet considered. The defendants' motion to
     file an interlocutory appeal was granted and the parties have filed briefs
     with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on the question of whether the
     District Court's decision to reinstate the plaintiffs' claims was proper.
     The Company intends to defend the action vigorously and believes that it
     has meritorious defenses to the claims sought to be asserted and that the
     resolution of the action will not materially affect the Company's financial
     condition. This case was last referenced in the Company's Form 10-K for the
     year ended January 2, 1994.

     On April 12, 1994, Richard Johnson and 12 other individuals, individually
     and purportedly on behalf of a putative class of other persons similarly
     situated, filed a complaint against the Company and others in the U.S.
     District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleges
     that the Company has engaged in racial discrimination in violation of Title
     VII and 42 U.S.C. Section 1981. The plaintiffs further allege that the
     Company conspired with certain of its franchisees to deprive the plaintiffs
     and employees of such franchisees of their rights under 42 U.S.C. Section
     1985. The plaintiffs seek judgment in an undetermined amount against the
     Company for punitive and compensatory damages (including benefits) as well
     as injunctive and equitable relief, including reinstatement of the
     plaintiffs to their former positions. Discovery is underway in this case.
     The Company intends to defend the action vigorously, and believes that it
     has meritorious defenses to the claims sought to be asserted and that the
     resolution of the action will not materially affect the Company's financial
     condition. This case was last referenced in the Company's Form 10-Q for the
     quarter ended April 3, 1994.

     On April 29, 1994, Mercy Health Services filed a complaint against the
     Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
     The plaintiff, a shareholder of the Company, alleges that the Company
     wrongfully refused to include a shareholder resolution in the Company's
     notice of proxy and proxy statement for the May 2, 1994 Annual Meeting of
     Shareholders. The shareholder resolution requested the Board of Directors
     to adopt a policy making all company restaurants smoke-free by 1995, and
     requested that the policy include stipulations that, beginning in 1995, all
     new franchisees' facilities be smoke-free and all renewals of franchise
     agreements include smoke-free facilities in the agreements. The plaintiff
     seeks a declaration that the Company's failure to include the shareholder
     resolution in the proxy statement was unlawful, an injunction which would
     enjoin the Company from excluding the plaintiff's shareholder resolution
     from any future proxy statements when the resolution otherwise qualifies
     for inclusion under the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange
     Commission, and an award for costs, expenses and attorneys fees. The
     Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and the plaintiff
     filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Both motions were denied by the
     District Court on November 29, 1994. Discovery is underway in this case.
     The Company intends to defend the action vigorously, and believes that it
     has meritorious defenses to this action and that an unfavorable judgment
     would not have a material impact upon the financial condition of the
     Company. This case was last referenced in the Company's Form 10-Q for the
     quarter ended April 3, 1994.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     1994 OVERVIEW

          Fully diluted earnings per share increased 20% to a record $.91 for
     the year ending January 1, 1995, from $.76 in 1993. The company also
     reported record net income  of $97.2 million for 1994, a 23% increase over
     the $79.3 million recorded for 1993.

          Systemwide restaurant sales, or sales from all company and franchised
     restaurants, reached $4.2 billion in 1994, the company's highest level
     ever. Company and franchised restaurants both attained record average net
     sales per restaurant. Average net sales per domestic company-operated
     restaurant increased to $1,001,000 in 1994, the first time the company
     achieved million dollar average sales per restaurant.

          Wendy's restaurant operating margin continued to show improvement,
     reaching 15.4% for 1994 versus 14.5% for 1993 and 13.8% for 1992. The
     margin has increased each year since 1989. This reflects the continuing
     emphasis on control of restaurant operating costs, expanding average sales
     per restaurant and, in 1994, favorable purchase prices of key food items.

          New restaurants opened systemwide totaled 298 in 1994, an increase of
     47 more restaurants than the number opened in 1993, and the most
     restaurants opened in the last eight years. There were also 65 restaurants
     under construction at year-end. The company typically experiences higher
     average net sales in newly opened restaurants.

     RETAIL SALES
          Total company retail sales were $1.3 billion in 1994 compared with
     $1.2 billion in 1993, a 4.8% increase. This increase reflected a 2.4%
     increase in average domestic net restaurant sales and an additional 26
     average domestic restaurants open.

          The improvement in average domestic net sales was a result of solid
     restaurant operations, effective marketing campaigns featuring both
     existing and new products, and a value menu strategy combined with the
     quality and variety of offerings. This improvement was tempered by the
     intense competition in the quick-service restaurant industry, and to a
     lesser extent adverse weather conditions at the start of the year. The
     average number of transactions increased approximately 1.2% in 1994
     compared with a 4.2% increase in 1993. Domestic selling prices for the
     company remained unchanged for 1994 compared with a decrease of
     approximately .4% in 1993. Selling prices for 1994 remain below 1990 levels
     as the company continued to emphasize its value strategy.

          The following chart reflects average net sales per domestic restaurant
     for the last three years:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                       1994          1993      1992
     <S>            <C>            <C>       <C>

     Company        $1,001,000     $978,000  $924,000
     Franchise      $  982,000     $960,000  $907,000
     Total domestic $  988,000     $966,000  $912,000
</TABLE>

          Average net sales per domestic company restaurant for 1994 increased
     2.4% over 1993 and 8.3% over 1992. As 1992 was a 53-week fiscal year, these
     amounts have been adjusted to a comparable 52-week year basis.

     RESTAURANT OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES
          Cost of sales declined to 58.3% of retail sales in 1994 from 58.9% in
     1993. Domestic food costs as a percent of domestic retail sales decreased
     to 29.3% in 1994 from 30.2% in 1993. This reflects favorable purchase
     prices for key products such as beef, chicken, and produce.

          Domestic restaurant labor costs as a percent of domestic retail sales
     were 24.8% in 1994 compared with 24.5% in 1993. The higher percentage in
     1994 reflects restaurant labor wage rate increases of approximately 4%
     partially offset by the 2.4% increase in average domestic net sales. In
     addition, selected markets increased restaurant management staffing levels
     to provide better customer service. The company controls labor hours by
     adherence to its labor guidelines.

          Total company restaurant operating costs were $330.5 million in 1994
     versus $319.4 million in 1993, or 26.3% and 26.6% of retail sales in 1994
     and 1993, respectively. Improvement as a percent of retail sales was seen
     in advertising, utilities, and insurance expenses.

     ROYALTIES
          Royalty income, before reserves, was $116.4 million for the year 1994
     versus $106.3 million for 1993, a 9.4% increase. Reserves against royalties
     for the current year amounted to $2.8 million compared with $1.7 million
     for 1993.

          Average net sales per domestic franchise restaurant increased to
     $982,000 in 1994 from $960,000 in 1993, an increase of 2.3%. Royalties also
     increased from domestic and international franchise restaurant openings.

          Management reviews reserves on a regular basis and believes the
     company has adequate levels for royalty and other franchise-related
     receivables and contingencies. When the outlook changes for reserve levels
     established in prior years, they are modified accordingly and the impact is
     reflected in general and administrative expenses, as discussed below.

     OTHER REVENUES
          Pretax gains on restaurants sold to franchisees amounted to $11.6
     million for 1994 compared with $8.1 million in 1993. The company sold 49
     restaurants to franchisees during 1994 versus 86 restaurants in 1993.
     Certain dispositions have resulted in land and buildings being retained by
     the company and leased to franchisees. This source of rental income to the
     company increased $1.4 million over 1993 for a total of $11.6 million in
     rental income for 1994. In both years, franchisees exercised

                                       11

<PAGE>

     options to purchase real estate originally retained by the company and
     leased to the franchisee. In 1994, 32 properties were sold pursuant to
     options exercised by franchisees for a $2.4 million gain and in the prior
     year 17 properties were sold for a $780,000 gain.

          The company also has various write-offs and retirements of assets each
     year which reduce other revenues. These result from the continuing program
     of remodeling restaurants, monitoring restaurant performance for potential
     relocations or closings, and disposing of unnecessary assets. Such
     write-offs totaled $4.5 million in 1994 and $3.2 million in 1993, partly
     offsetting gains from franchising restaurants. Also, a reserve of $2.8
     million was provided in 1993 for 12 underperforming restaurants which were
     closed in January 1994. This reflected amounts for lease buy outs, the
     write down of assets to realizable value, and other related expenses.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
          General and administrative expenses were $108.3 million or 7.7% of
     revenues for the year 1994 compared with $102.2 million or 7.7% for 1993.
     Salaries and related benefits, the largest component of general and
     administrative expenses, increased $6.2 million, primarily reflecting
     annual merit-based employee compensation increases and minimal
     administrative staff additions to support new restaurant development.
     Insurance expense declined $3.1 million in 1994 as the prior year included
     an additional $4.0 million accrual to reflect trends in year-end 1993's
     workers' compensation and general liability claims.

          As a result of continuing improvement in the financial strength of the
     franchise community, net reserve reversals reduced expenses by $2.1 million
     in 1994 and $2.2 million in 1993.

     INTEREST
          Net interest expense decreased in 1994 primarily as a result of lower
     interest expense of $18.7 million in 1994 compared with $21.6 million in
     1993. This was due to the early retirement of $30 million of debt in late
     1993. Interest income was lower at $8.8 million for 1994 versus $9.8
     million for 1993 due to reduced earnings on short-term investments.

     INCOME TAXES
          The effective income tax rate for 1994 was 35% compared with 31.4% in
     1993. In 1993, the company generated a Canadian tax benefit of $6.0
     million. This was a result of regionalizing Canadian operations which
     produced overall administrative and operational efficiencies and more
     closely aligned the organization to domestic operations.

     COMPARISON OF 1993 TO 1992
          Net income for the year ended January 2, 1994, was $79.3 million, a
     23% increase over the $64.7 million reported for 1992. Fully diluted
     earnings per share was $.76 in 1993 compared with $.63 for 1992.

          Total company retail sales increased 6.7% in 1993 to $1.2 billion
     compared with $1.1 billion in 1992. This increase reflected a 5.8% increase
     in average domestic net restaurant sales and an additional 32 average
     domestic restaurants open. Total retail sales for 1993 reflected one week's
     fewer sales as 1992 was a 53-week fiscal year.

          The improvement in average domestic net sales was a result of the
     company's emphasis on restaurant operations, highly effective marketing
     campaigns of both existing and new products, and the value menu strategy,
     such as Super Value Menu, Combo Meals, and Kids' Meals. The average number
     of transactions increased approximately 4.2% in 1993. Domestic selling
     prices for the company were down approximately .4% in 1993 following a 1.9%
     decrease in 1992.

          Total company cost of sales as a percent of retail sales decreased
     slightly to 58.9% in 1993 from 59.0% in 1992. Domestic food costs as a
     percent of domestic retail sales increased to 30.2% in 1993 from 29.7% in
     1992. This reflected increases primarily in beef, chicken, and lettuce
     prices coinciding with reductions in selling prices.

          Domestic labor costs as a percent of domestic retail sales were 24.5%
     in 1993 compared with 24.9% in 1992. This improvement reflected efforts to
     adhere to the company's labor guidelines along with the impact from higher
     average domestic net restaurant sales offset by restaurant labor wage rate
     increases of approximately 2% in 1993.

          Total company restaurant operating costs were $319.4 million or 26.6%
     of retail sales for 1993. This compared with costs in 1992 of $306.4
     million or 27.2% of retail sales. A significant portion of this percentage
     improvement resulted from the relatively fixed nature of some of the cost
     components, while average sales levels increased. In addition, group
     insurance and coupon expenses declined as a percent of sales.

          Royalty income, before reserves, was $106.3 million for the year ended
     January 2, 1994, and $97.6 million for the year ended January 3, 1993, or a
     9.0% increase. Royalty reserves amounted to $1.7 million in 1993 compared
     with $1.2 million in 1992. Average net sales per domestic franchise
     restaurant increased to $960,000 in 1993 from $907,000 in 1992, an increase
     of 5.9% on a comparable 52-week year basis. The remainder of the increase
     reflected royalties from additional domestic and international franchise
     restaurants.

          Pretax gains on restaurant dispositions for 1993 amounted to $8.1
     million compared with $7.7 million in 1992. There were 86 company
     restaurants sold to franchisees in 1993 versus 44 restaurants in 1992.
     Certain dispositions resulted in land and buildings being retained by the
     company and leased to franchisees. This provided a source of rental income
     to the company which increased $1.8 million over 1992 to $10.1 million.

          A reserve of $2.8 million was provided in the fourth quarter of 1993
     to reflect lease buy outs, the write down of assets to realizable value,
     and other related expenses to close certain underperforming restaurants.
     Also, $30 million of debt was retired early resulting in $672,000 of
     redemption expenses.

                                       12

<PAGE>

          General and administrative expenses were approximately the same
     percent of revenues in both 1993 and 1992. In recognition of continuing
     improvement in the financial strength of the franchise community, net
     reserve reversals were $2.2 million in 1993 and 1992 reversals were $1.7
     million. Insurance accruals were increased $4.0 million in 1993 to reflect
     trends in workers' compensation and general liability claims. Salaries and
     related benefits rose $7.9 million over 1992, primarily reflecting annual
     employee merit increases and minimal administrative staff additions to
     support new restaurant development.

          Net interest expense decreased in 1993 primarily reflecting lower
     interest expense. Interest income was $9.8 million in 1993 versus $10.1
     million in 1992. Interest expense was $21.6 million in 1993 compared with
     $22.5 million in 1992. This primarily reflected a 52-week fiscal year in
     1993 versus a 53-week fiscal year in 1992, and a reduction of expense on
     capitalized leases.

          The effective income tax rate for 1993 decreased to 31.4% from 36% in
     1992. In 1993, the company regionalized its Canadian operations. This was
     intended to produce overall administrative and operational efficiencies and
     closely align the organization to domestic operations. In connection with
     this restructuring the company was able to generate Canadian tax benefits
     of $6.0 million.

     FINANCIAL POSITION
     OVERVIEW
          Total assets increased $89.6 million or 9.0% over 1993 primarily due
     to additions to property and equipment for restaurant development. Cost in
     excess of net assets acquired, net increased $6.5 million as a result of
     the acquisition of a franchise. Total cash and short-term investments
     amounted to $134.9 million at year-end 1994 compared with $112.3 million at
     year-end 1993. Return on average assets was 16.3% in 1994 compared with
     14.3% in 1993, the fifth consecutive year this ratio increased.

          Long-term debt was reduced in 1994 as $50 million was reclassed to
     current portion debt for the 12 1/8% Notes which are due in April of 1995.
     This caused the long-term debt to equity ratio to drop to 21% for year-end
     1994, compared with 33% at year-end 1993, and 44% at year-end 1992.

          Shareholders' equity per share reached $6.70 at January 1, 1995, an
     increase of 12.4%. At year-end 1994, shareholders' equity was equal to 63%
     of total assets. The company's return on average equity was 15.2% in 1994
     compared with 14.2% in 1993. This is the eighth consecutive year return on
     average equity has increased.

     receivables and other franchise-related receivables and contingencies by

     CASH FLOW
          Cash provided by operating activities was $165.7 million in 1994,
     $146.7 million in 1993, and $120.5 million in 1992. Cash from operations
     exceeded capital expenditures by $24.2 million in 1994 and $30.1 million in
     1993. Additionally in 1994, cash provided by operations exceeded the total
     of long-term obligations.

          Over the last three years, cash provided by operating activities was
     primarily used for capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt
     repayments, and acquisitions of franchised restaurants. During this time,
     the company acquired 88 restaurants and retired early over $31 million of
     higher rate debt and $33 million in convertible subordinated debentures. In
     April of 1995, the company will retire $50 million of 12 1/8% Notes.

          Cash proceeds of $21.1 million were realized in 1994 from the sale of
     company restaurants to franchisees, while $17.2 million was provided in
     1993 and $12.9 million in 1992.

          The company invests excess cash in various short-term investments.
     Instruments with maturities exceeding three months are classified as
     short-term investments on the balance sheet. The company liquidated these
     investments in January 1995 in anticipation of the $50 million debt
     retirement and other potential cash requirements needed in early 1995. The
     company also invests a portion of excess cash in more liquid investments,
     included as cash equivalents on the balance sheet. These include state and
     municipal securities, Euro Time Deposits, and other securities, a portion
     of which are tax-exempt.

          During 1994, capital expenditures amounted to $142 million. New
     restaurant expenditures amounted to $74 million; $38 million was spent for
     improvements to existing restaurants; and $30 million was spent for other
     additions. Current plans are to open or have under construction about 400
     new Wendy's restaurants in 1995, of which approximately 120 will be
     company-operated. Capital expenditures could total as much as $170 million
     in 1995. Cash provided by operating activities, cash and investments on
     hand, existing revolving credit agreements, and possible asset dispositions
     should enable the company to meet its financial requirements through 1995.
     If additional cash is needed for capital expenditures, future acquisitions
     of restaurants from franchisees, or for other corporate purposes, the
     company believes it would be able to obtain additional cash through
     existing revolving credit agreements, new revolving credit agreements which
     the company believes it could execute, or through the issuance of debt
     securities. In December 1994, the company filed a registration statement
     with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for $200 million
     of debt securities which could be issued for the next two years if needed.

     INFLATION
          Financial statements determined on a historical cost basis may not
     accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise.
     Several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for the company.
     Inventories approximate current market prices, there is some ability to
     adjust prices, and liabilities are repaid with dollars of reduced
     purchasing power.

     INTERNATIONAL
          During 1994, the company focused on assessing and strengthening
     current international operations. Also, a strategic plan was developed to
     achieve future growth. For 1995 and beyond, the company will implement
     these strategies for profitable and rapid expansion. Wendy's intends to
     open or have under construction at least 100 international restaurants in
     1995, and anticipates higher levels in succeeding years. Although
     international growth will come primarily through franchising, the company
     may enter into joint venture agreements and possibly open company-operated
     restaurants outside of Canada. On January 1, 1995, there were 413 Wendy's
     restaurants operating outside the United States and in 33 countries and
     territories. Of these, 177 were in Canada, with 96 being operated by the
     company.

          Canada is our largest international market, and like domestic markets,
     the restaurant industry is extremely competitive. The environment includes
     a difficult economy, adverse tax laws, and minimum wage increases.
     Nevertheless, 1994 was a very productive year as average net sales of
     company-operated restaurants increased 5.9% in local currency, following a
     7.8% increase a year ago. Restaurant level profitability likewise improved
     once again. The regionalization of Canadian operations initiated at the end
     of 1993 was beneficial to the company both operationally and
     administratively in 1994. Combination units of Wendy's and Tim Hortons, a
     Canadian chain of bakery and coffee shops, has proved very successful and
     several more units are planned to be added in 1995.

     MANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK
          The quick-service restaurant industry remains extremely competitive.
     The company will continue to adhere to the strategies developed in the past
     few years. The strategies of restaurant expansion and improvement of retail
     sales and restaurant profitability are key components to improved future
     performance. Statistics indicate that Wendy's is an underpenetrated concept
     relative to total market potential. Therefore, responsible system growth
     will accelerate in 1995, focusing on the markets with the best potential
     for sales and return on investment. Each proposed site must undergo an
     extensive operational and financial review before being approved. The
     company plans on opening or having under construction 120 new
     company-operated restaurants and 280 new franchised restaurants in 1995.
     The company's expansion will be accomplished by use of cash and investments
     on hand, cash provided by 1995 operations, existing revolving credit
     agreements, new revolving credit agreements which the company believes it
     could execute, possible asset dispositions, and possible borrowings.

          Retail sales increases along with improved restaurant profitability in
     existing restaurants are essential components to future growth. The company
     will continue to focus on restaurant cost control by use of company
     guidelines for food, labor, and other expenses. Continued emphasis on
     operational execution, new promotional and permanent menu items, local and
     national marketing to increase customer awareness, and restaurant remodels
     are all strategies aimed at growing system sales. Selling prices did not
     change in 1994, and any potential change in 1995 should be very modest.

          In cooperation with vendors, Wendy's closely monitors purchase prices
     while maintaining exacting quality standards for all products in each
     restaurant. To protect the customer, the company is committed to a program
     of ongoing food safety which includes quality suppliers, state-of-the-art
     testing, proper equipment, rigid adherence to operational procedures, and
     emphasis on sanitation and personal hygiene.

          Cost control of administrative overhead is monitored through the use
     of budgets for each corporate and field department. Actual expenses are
     monitored by comparison to the budget and to historical results. All
     additions to staffing must be justified based on the contribution to the
     company or franchise operations support, or to restaurant development.

          Wendy's will continue its strategy of acquiring restaurants from and
     selling restaurants to franchisees where prudent. Acquired restaurants,
     which may be underperforming, can be improved and then operated profitably
     by the company or sold to a qualified franchisee. Other restaurants may be
     acquired due to geographic or operational benefits to existing
     company-operated markets. Selling restaurants generates cash which is used
     for new development, acquisitions, and remodeling programs. During the last
     three years, the company purchased 88 franchised restaurants and sold 179
     company-operated restaurants to franchisees. Underperforming restaurants,
     whether company or franchise operated, are monitored carefully and
     revitalized where economically possible or closed if necessary for the
     financial health of the system.

          The strength and vitality of the franchise community is an essential
     part of the continued success of the Wendy's system. Various strategies
     have been developed to assist individual franchisees and the overall
     franchise system. The aim of these strategies is to encourage responsible
     new restaurant development, increase franchisees' financial health,
     increase royalty income, and improve royalty receivable collection rates.
     The company will continue to maintain appropriate reserves against
     franchise receivables.

          Competition is extremely intense in the quick-service restaurant
     segment, particularly in the areas of marketing and pricing. In addition,
     numerous external factors can have a significant impact on the company's
     performance. Such factors could include product costs, the economy,
     consumer perception of food safety, the weather, changing consumer tastes,
     the labor supply, legal claims,  the company's ability to obtain and
     finance real estate, and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates,
     taxes, and possible franchise legislation.

     WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
          The company's principal business is the operation of quick-service
     restaurants serving high-quality food. At year-end 1994 the company and its
     franchise owners operated 4,411 of these restaurants under the name
     "Wendy's" in 50 states and in 33 other countries and territories.

     FISCAL YEAR
          The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31.
     The 1994 and 1993 fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks and the 1992 fiscal
     year consisted of 53 weeks.

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION
          The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the
     company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

          For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash  Flows, the company
     considers short-term investments with original maturities of three months
     or less as cash equivalents. A substantial portion of these investments are
     tax-exempt instruments.

     INVENTORIES
          Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
     market, and consist primarily of restaurant food items and paper supplies.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
          Depreciation and amortization are recognized on the straight-line
     method in amounts adequate to amortize costs over the  following estimated
     useful lives: buildings, up to 25 years; leasehold improvements, up to 25
     years; restaurant equipment, up to 15 years; other equipment, up to ten
     years; and property under capital leases, the primary lease term. Interest
     cost associated with the construction of new restaurants is capitalized,
     while certain other costs, such as ground rentals and real estate taxes,
     are expensed as incurred.

     COST IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED
          The cost in excess of net assets acquired is amortized on the
     straight-line method over periods ranging from ten to 40 years which, for
     leased restaurants, include the original lease period plus renewal options,
     if applicable. The company periodically reviews goodwill and, based upon
     undiscounted cash flows, impairments will be recognized when a permanent
     decline in value has occurred. Accumulated amortization of cost in excess
     of net assets acquired was $14.8 million and $13.2 million at January 1,
     1995, and January 2, 1994, respectively.

     PRE-OPENING COSTS
          The company capitalizes certain operating costs which are incurred
     prior to the opening of a new restaurant. These costs are amortized over a
     one-year period.

     CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
          The company capitalizes internally developed software costs which are
     amortized over a seven-year period.

     FRANCHISE OPERATIONS
          The company grants franchises to independent operators who in turn pay
     technical assistance fees, royalties, and in some cases, rents for each
     restaurant opened. A technical assistance fee is recorded as income when
     each restaurant commences operations. Royalties, four percent of monthly
     net sales, are recognized as income on the accrual basis. The company has
     established reserves related to the collection of franchise royalties and
     other franchise-related receivables and commitments (see Note 8). Included
     in other assets is the long-term portion of notes receivable amounting to
     $31.0 million and $29.7 million at January 1, 1995, and January 2, 1994,
     respectively. The carrying amount of notes receivable currently
     approximates fair value.

          Franchise owners receive assistance in such areas as real estate site
     selection, construction consulting, purchasing, and marketing from company
     personnel who also furnish these services to company-operated restaurants.
     Franchise expenses are included in general and administrative expenses.

     FOREIGN OPERATIONS
          At January 1, 1995, the company and its franchise owners operated 177
     restaurants in Canada. Additionally, 236 restaurants were operated by
     franchise owners in other foreign countries and territories.

     NET INCOME PER SHARE
          Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
     weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common
     share equivalents during each period. Fully diluted computations assume
     full conversion of the subordinated debentures into common shares, when
     dilutive, and the elimination of related expenses, net of income taxes.

          The industrial development revenue bonds were issued to provide funds
     for the acquisition, construction, and improvement of various restaurants.

          The 12 1/8% notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.

          The 7% convertible debentures are subordinated as to principal,
     premium, if any, and interest to all senior indebtedness as defined in the
     indenture. The conversion price is $12.30 per common share, subject to
     adjustment in certain events. The debentures are redeemable, with limited
     exceptions, at the option of the company on or after April 5, 1996.

          The company purchased $28.6 million and $8.3 million of debt in 1993
     and 1992, respectively. These purchases resulted in losses of $672,000 and
     $23,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

          Based on quoted market prices for the convertible subordinated
     debentures and future cash flows for all other term debt, the fair value of
     total term debt was approximately $185 million at January 1, 1995, and $214
     million at January 2, 1994.

          The combined aggregate amounts of future maturities for all term debt
     are as follows:

     3. LEASES
          The company occupies land and buildings and uses equipment under terms
     of numerous lease agreements expiring on various dates through 2027. Terms
     of land only and land and building leases are generally for 20 to 25 years.
     Many of these leases provide for future rent escalations and renewal
     options. Certain leases require contingent rent, determined as a percentage
     of sales, when annual sales exceed specified levels. Most leases also
     obligate the company to pay the costs of maintenance, insurance, and
     property taxes.

          At each year-end capital leases consisted of the following:

          In connection with the franchising of certain restaurants, the company
     has leased land, buildings, and equipment to the related franchise owners.

          Most leases provide for monthly rentals based on a percentage of
     sales, while others provide for fixed payments with contingent rent when
     sales exceed certain levels. Lease terms are approximately ten to 20 years
     with one or more five-year renewal options. The franchise owners bear the
     cost of maintenance, insurance, and property taxes.

          The company generally accounts for the building and equipment portions
     of the fixed payment leases as direct financing leases. The land portion of
     leases and leases with rents based on a percentage of sales are accounted
     for as operating leases.

          At each year-end the net investment in financing leases receivable,
     included in other assets, consisted of the following:

          In the first quarter of 1993, the company adopted Financial Accounting
     Standard Number 109 (SFAS 109) - "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under SFAS
     No. 109, like Financial Accounting Standard Number 96 (SFAS 96) -
     "Accounting for Income Taxes" which the company adopted in 1989, deferred
     income taxes are recognized by employing the liability method. The company
     elected not to restate prior years' financial statements under the
     provisions of SFAS No. 109 and has determined that the cumulative effect of
     the implementation was not significant.

          The temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and
     liabilities at each year-end consisted of the following:

          A deferred tax asset for foreign operations was established, upon the
     adoption of SFAS 109, for excess capital allowances and net operating loss
     carryovers which are related to a Canadian subsidiary. This deferred tax
     asset was largely offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the
     regionalization and legal entity restructuring of Canadian operations, the
     company reduced the valuation allowance by $279,000 and $6.0 million in
     1994 and 1993, respectively, primarily due to the realization of Canadian
     tax benefits.

          A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 35%
     in 1994 and 1993 and 34% in 1992 to the company's effective tax  rate for
     each year is shown below:

     5. STOCK OPTION AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS
          The company has various stock option plans which provide options for
     certain employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of the
     company. Grants of options to employees and the periods during which such
     options can be exercised are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
     Grants of options to outside directors and the periods during which such
     options can be exercised are specified in the plan applicable to directors
     and do not involve discretionary authority of the Board. All options expire
     at the end of the exercise period. Options are granted at the fair market
     value of the company's common shares on the date of grant and no amounts
     applicable thereto are reflected in net income. The company makes no
     recognition of the options in the financial statements until they are
     exercised.

          On August 2, 1990, the Board of Directors adopted the WeShare Stock
     Option Plan (WeShare Plan), a non-qualified stock option plan to provide
     for grants of options equal to ten percent of each eligible employee's
     earnings, with a minimum of 20 options to be made to each eligible employee
     annually. An aggregate of 4.0 million common shares of the company have
     been reserved pursuant to the WeShare Plan.

                                       22

<PAGE>
          The options have a term of ten years from the grant date and become
     exercisable in installments of 25 percent on each of the first four
     anniversaries of the grant date. On August 9, 1994, August 5, 1993, and
     July 30, 1992, approximately 865,000 options, 860,000 options, and 950,000
     options were granted to eligible employees at an exercise price of $15.38
     per share, $14.38 per share, and $11.69 per share, respectively.

          In addition, the Board of Directors also adopted the 1990 Stock Option
     Plan (1990 Plan) on August 2, 1990, and amended the 1990 Plan on August 1,
     1991, and February 23, 1994. An aggregate of 12.5 million common shares of
     the company have been reserved for issuance to key employees and outside
     directors under the 1990 Plan, as amended. On August 9, 1994, August 5,
     1993, and July 30, 1992, approximately 1.3 million options, 1.1 million
     options, and 1.0 million options were granted to key employees at an
     exercise price of $15.38 per share, $14.38 per share, and $11.69 per share,
     respectively.

          The following is a summary of stock option activity for the last three
     years:

</TABLE>
          Options exercisable to purchase common shares totaled 4.6 million, 3.1
     million, and 2.7 million at January 1, 1995, January 2, 1994, and January
     3, 1993, respectively. Shares reserved under the plans at each year-end
     were 14.1 million in 1994, 10.5 million in 1993, and 12.4 million in 1992.

          The company has a Shareholder Rights Plan which provides for the
     distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (Right), as a dividend
     for each outstanding common share. Each Right entitles a shareholder to buy
     one ten-thousandth of a share of a new series of preferred stock for $25
     upon the occurrence of certain events. Rights would be exercisable once a
     person or group acquires 20 percent or more of the company's common shares,
     or ten days after a tender offer for 20 percent or more of the common
     shares is announced. No certificates will be issued unless the Rights Plan
     is activated.

          Under certain circumstances, all Rights holders, except the person or
     company holding 20 percent or more of the company's common shares, will be
     entitled to purchase common shares at about half the price that such shares
     traded for prior to the announcement of the acquisition. Alternatively, if
     the company is acquired after the Rights plan is activated, the Rights will
     entitle the holder to buy the acquiring company's shares at a similar
     discount. The company can redeem the Rights for one cent per Right under
     certain circumstances. If not redeemed, the Rights will expire on August
     10, 1998.

     6. ACQUISITIONS
          During 1994, the company acquired 29 restaurants in the Kansas City
     market for cash of $10.5 million and the assumption of certain liabilities.
     The company acquired four other domestic restaurants from franchisees for
     $2.3 million during 1994.

          In 1993 and 1992, the company acquired 33 domestic restaurants and 13
     domestic and nine Canadian restaurants for a total of $8.7 million and $7.6
     million, respectively.

     7. DISPOSITIONS
          In 1994, the company franchised 49 domestic restaurants. The company
     franchised 86 domestic restaurants and 42 domestic and two Canadian
     restaurants in 1993 and 1992, respectively. These transactions resulted in
     pretax gains of approximately $11.6 million, $8.1 million, and $7.7 million
     in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively, and are included in other revenues.

          Notes receivable related to dispositions were $25.9 million at January
     1, 1995, and $23.0 million at January 2, 1994, and are included in notes
     receivable and other assets.

     8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
          At January 1, 1995, and January 2, 1994, the company's reserves
     established for doubtful royalty receivables were $4.2 million and $5.3
     million, respectively. Reserves related to possible losses on notes
     receivable, real estate, guarantees, claims, and contingencies involving
     franchisees totaled $3.5 million at January 1, 1995, and $3.0 million at
     January 2, 1994. These reserves are included in accounts receivable, notes
     receivable, other assets, and other accrued expenses.

          The company has guaranteed certain leases and debt payments of
     franchise owners with average annual obligations of $9.2 million over the
     next five years. In the event of default by a franchise owner, the company
     generally retains the right to acquire possession of the related
     restaurants.

          The company is self-insured for most workers' compensation, general
     liability, and automotive liability losses subject to per occurrence and
     aggregate annual liability limitations. The company is also self-insured
     for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to
     certain deductibles and limitations. The company determines its liability
     for claims incurred but not reported on an actuarial basis.

                                       23

<PAGE>

          The company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with some
     of its suppliers.The range of prices and volume of purchases under the
     agreements may vary according to the company's demand for the products and
     fluctuations in market rates.

          The company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal actions
     and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business; many of these
     are covered by insurance. It is the opinion of the company that such
     matters will not materially affect the company's financial condition or
     earnings.

     9. RETIREMENT PLANS
          The company's retirement program covers substantially all full-time
     employees qualified as to age and service. The program includes a
     contributory defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan
     for management and administrative employees. The defined benefit pension
     plan allows for employee contributions and provides a matching benefit from
     the company in addition to a basic benefit which is independent of employee
     contributions. The pension plan also provides for a guaranteed rate of
     return on employee account balances. The defined contribution plan provides
     for an annual discretionary contribution which is determined each year by
     the Board of Directors. In addition, the retirement program includes a
     noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all eligible crew
     employees and shift managers of the company.

          The company also has supplemental retirement plans for certain key
     employees to replace benefits otherwise not available from the pension and
     profit sharing plans due to the limitations imposed under the Internal
     Revenue Code and to assure that projected benefit levels were not decreased
     by the changes to the retirement program which were implemented January 1,
     1989.

          The funded status of the pension plans for each year-end consisted of
     the following:

     Minimum pension adjustment             (5,390)      (4,873)

     Pension liability                    $   (416)    $ (1,698)
                                         ---------    ---------
</TABLE>

          In determining the present value of benefit obligations, discount
     rates of 8.0% and 7.0% were used in 1994 and 1993, respectively. The net
     effect of changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in a $1.0 million
     reduction of pension expense for 1992. The expected long-term rate of
     return on assets used was 8.5% in 1994 and 1993. The assumed rate of
     increase in compensation levels was 8.0% for 1994 and 1993. Plan assets as
     of January 1, 1995, consisted of debt and equity instruments and cash and
     cash equivalents.

          Net periodic pension cost for each year consisted of the following:

                                      -------   -------   -------
</TABLE>

          The company provided for profit sharing and supplemental retirement
     benefits of $2.8 million, $2.3 million, and $1.9 million for 1994, 1993,
     and 1992, respectively.

          A minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated
     benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets and liabilities
     already accrued is reflected in the balance sheet by recording an
     intangible asset and reducing shareholders' equity.

          The company has an agreement with the Chairman of the Board which
     provides for severance pay and commencement of retirement benefits if he
     terminates employment for any reason. Upon termination the agreement
     requires the executive to be available for consultation and prohibits him
     from competing against the company for a two-year period. The agreement
     also provides that the company may require him to return to active
     employment for up to 12 months under certain circumstances. Retirement by
     the executive in 1995 would result in an expense charge of approximately
     $3.1 million.

     10. WENDY'S NATIONAL ADVERTISING PROGRAM
          The Wendy's National Advertising Program, Inc. (WNAP) is a
     not-for-profit corporation which was established to collect and administer
     funds contributed by the company and all domestic franchise owners. These
     contributions total 2% of net sales and are used for advertising programs
     designed to increase sales and enhance the reputation of the company and
     its franchise owners.  For 1995, 1994, and 1993, the domestic system agreed
     to increase national advertising spending from 2% to 2.5% of net sales.
     During 1994, 1993, and 1992, the company contributed $29.0 million, $27.7
     million, and $20.7 million, respectively, to WNAP. These contributions were
     recognized in company restaurant operating costs. At January 1, 1995, and
     January 2, 1994, the company's payable to WNAP amounted to $2.2 million and
     $2.1 million, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC.

     We have audited the consolidated financial statements and financial
     statement schedule of Wendy's International, Inc. and Subsidiaries listed
     in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial
     statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
     the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
     obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
     of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
     evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
     statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
     and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
     overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
     provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
     in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wendy's
     International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of January 1, 1995, and January 2,
     1994, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
     for the years ended January 1, 1995, January 2, 1994, and January 3, 1993,
     in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition,
     in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when
     considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
     presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be
     included therein.

WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
EXHIBIT 10(e)
                                    AGREEMENT


     This Agreement, made and effective this 1st day of March, 1995, by and
     between Wendy's International, Inc., an Ohio Corporation (the
     "Corporation") with its principal place of business in Dublin, Ohio, and
     Gordon F. Teter (the "Executive") residing in Powell, Ohio.

     WHEREAS, the Executive currently serves as Chief Executive Officer,
     President and Chief Operating Officer of the Corporation;

     WHEREAS, the Executive has been employed by the Corporation or its
     subsidiaries since September 8, 1987 and has made significant professional
     and personal contributions to the successful operation and recognized good
     will and reputation of the Corporation; and

     WHEREAS, the Corporation wishes, at the time the Executive ceases to be
     actively employed by the Corporation:

     (a)  to encourage the Executive to provide advice and counsel to the
     Corporation for a reasonable period of time following his active employment
     by the Corporation;

     (b)  to discourage the Executive from entering into business activities
     which are in competition with the Corporation's businesses for a reasonable
     period of time following his active employment by the Corporation, or
     engaging in activities which may constitute a conflict of interest; and

     (c)  to provide the Executive with certain remuneration in consideration
     for the foregoing.

     NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed as follows:

     1.   (a)  If the Executive ceases to be actively employed by the
     Corporation after his attainment of age 62 and prior to his attainment of
     age 65 for any reason other than by reason of his termination of employment
     for Cause (as such term is defined in Section 8 hereof), whether
     voluntarily or involuntarily, the Corporation will pay to him during the
     Transition Period (as defined below) compensation, at the rate of his
     highest annual base salary in effect at any time during the five-year
     period preceding the date of such cessation (the "Transition Date"), such
     compensation to be paid in accordance with the Corporation's normal payroll
     practices in effect at that time.  The "Transition Period" is the period
     beginning on the Transition Date and ending on the earliest of (i) 24
     months after the Transition Date, (ii) his death, or (iii) his attainment
     of age 65.  If the Transition Period terminates by reason of the
     Executive's death, the remaining payments of base salary that would have
     been paid had the Transition Period terminated pursuant to clause (i) or
     (iii), as applicable, shall be paid as soon as practical after the
     Executive's death in a lump sum (without discount) to his wife, if she is
     alive on the date of his death.  If the Executive has no wife that survives
     him, such lump sum shall be paid to the Executive's beneficiary or
     beneficiaries as designated in writing and filed with the Corporation, or
     if no designation has been filed, to the Executive's estate.

     (b)  To the extent permitted by law, the Executive will continue to
     participate during the Transition Period in the Corporation's retirement,
     medical, dental, life, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term and
     long-term disability and any other group insurance plans, if any, in which
     he is a participant immediately preceding the Transition Date, and the
     company-owned vehicle program as in effect on the Transition Date
     (including the reimbursement for the lease and maintenance of a company car
     or the receipt of a car allowance in lieu thereof, the use of the
     Corporation's gasoline credit card and the option to purchase his company
     car at the end of the Transition Period at a price to be determined by the
     Corporation in accordance with the terms of the program as in effect at
     that time), but will not participate in any bonus, incentive compensation
     or stock option or other stock-based compensation plans; provided, however,
     that (i) the Executive shall be entitled to exercise employee stock options
     or other stock-based awards already granted in accordance with the terms of
     the grant letters and the applicable stock option or other stock-based
     compensation plans based on his continued employment with the Corporation
     during the Transition Period, but no new grants of stock options or other
     stock-based compensation awards shall be made to the Executive on or after
     the Transition Date, (ii) the Executive will be entitled to receive a
     pro-rated bonus under the Corporation's Senior Executive Earnings
     Maximization Plan (or the Corporation's then current annual cash bonus
     plan) in respect of the fiscal year in which the Transition Date occurs
     based on the number of complete calendar months that have elapsed in such
     year through the Transition Date and (iii) any benefits the Executive
     receives under the Corporation's short-term or long-term disability plans
     during the Transition Period will reduce the amount payable pursuant to
     Section 1(a) of this Agreement.

     (c)(1)    No amount shall be payable pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of
     this Section 1 if the Executive ceases to be actively employed by the
     Corporation for any reason prior to his attainment of age 62 or after his
     attainment of age 65.  However, in the event the Executive ceases to be
     actively employed by the Corporation prior to his attainment of age 62 for
     any reason other than by reason of his voluntary

                                       32

<PAGE>

     termination of employment, his death or termination of his employment by
     the Corporation for Cause (as such term is defined in Section 8 hereof),
     subject to subparagraph (c)(3) below, the Executive shall be entitled to
     receive the following payments and benefits: (i) the continuation of his
     base salary at the rate in effect at the time of such cessation of active
     employment (the "Cessation Date") for 24 months following such cessation
     (the "Payment Period") to be paid in accordance with the Corporation's
     normal payroll practices in effect at that time; provided, however, that
     the Executive shall be entitled to elect to receive the balance of such
     salary continuation as a lump sum payment, without discount, at any time
     during the payment Period; (ii) to the extent permitted by law, the
     Executive will continue to participate during the Payment Period in the
     Corporations's retirement, medical, dental, life and accidental death and
     dismemberment plans in which he is a participant immediatley preceding the
     Cessation Date, but will not participate in any bonus, incentive
     compensation or stock option or other stock-based compensation plans;
     provided, however, that (a) the Executive shall be entitled to exercise
     employee stock options or other stock-based awards already granted in
     accordance with the terms of the grant letters and the applicable stock
     option or other stock-based compensation plans during the Payment Period,
     but no new grants of stock options or other stock-based compensation
     awards shall be made to the Executive on or after the Cessation Date and
     (b) the Executive will be entitled to receive a pro-rated bonus under the
     Corporations's Senior Executive Earnings Maximization Plan (or the
     Corporation's then current annual cash bonus plan) in respect of the
     fiscal year in which the Cessation Date occurs based on the number of
     complete calendar months that have elapsed in such year through the
     Cessation Date; (iii) the Executive shall also continue to participate in
     the company-owned vehichle program as in effect on the Cessation Date
     (including the reimbursement for the lease and maintenance of a company
     car or the receipt of a car allowance in lieu thereof, the use of the
     Corporation's gasoline credit card and the option to purchase his company
     car at the end of the Payment Period at a price to be determined by the
     Corporation in accordance with the terms of the program in effect at that
     time); and (iv) a payment for any accrued, unused vacation for the year
     in which the Cessation Date occurs.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
     any benefits the Executive receives under the Corporation's short-term or
     long-term disability plans during the Payment Period will reduce the
     amount payable pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 1(c).

     (2)  In the event that the Executive accepts new employment during the
     Payment Period, he hereby agrees to notify the Corporation immediately.  At
     the time he accepts such employment, he will receive a lump sum payment
     representing the balance of the salary continuation for the remainder of
     the Payment Period, without discount.  Upon the Executive's receipt of a
     lump sum payment of his salary continuation during the Payment Period for
     any reason, all of his other benefits provided in subsections (ii) and
     (iii) of the preceding paragraph shall immediately terminate.

     (3)  The Executive's receipt of the benefits provided in this subsection
     (c) are subject to the execution of a general release in favor of the
     Corporation in the form then in use by the Corporation in connection with
     terminations of its employees.

     2.   (a)  The Corporation shall establish a bookkeeping account for the
     Executive which shall be referred to as the "Supplemental SERP Account." As
     of the last day of 1995 and of each subsequent calendar year ending with
     the calendar year in which the Transition Date occurs (but in no event
     beyond the calendar year in which the Executive attains age 65) or, if the
     Executive's employment with the Corporation terminates for any reason prior
     to his attainment of age 62, the calendar year preceding the calendar year
     in which such termination of employment occurs, the Corporation shall
     credit to the Supplemental SERP Account the sum of the following amounts:
     (i) an amount equal to .8% of the Executive's "Compensation" (as defined in
     the Wendy's International, Inc. Pension Plan, as in effect from time to
     time (the "Pension Plan"), but without regard to the dollar limitation
     imposed thereon under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of
     1986, as amended (the "Code") or any successor provision thereto), and (ii)
     an amount equal to the Supplemental SERP Contribution (as defined below).
     As of the end of each calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the
     balance in the Supplemental SERP Account is distributed or commences to be
     distributed and as of the end of the calendar quarter preceding the date
     the Supplemental SERP Account is distributed or commences to be
     distributed, the Supplemental SERP Account shall be credited with interest
     (on the balance of the Supplemental SERP Account as of the end of the
     preceding calendar year) at the rate credited on the "Account Balance
     Benefit" (as defined in the Pension Plan) for such calendar year or portion
     of a calendar year, as applicable( the "Pension Plan Interest Rate"). For
     purposes of this Agreement, the "Supplemental SERP Contribution" for any
     calendar year is the amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount (other
     than interest) that would be credited for the calendar year to the
     Executive's "Supplemental Target Account" (as defined in the Wendy's
     International, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP")) if, in
     computing the contributions for the SERP, (A) the targeted annual benefit
     was based on the Executive's expected "Final Average Compensation" (as
     defined in the SERP) at age 62 (or, if the Executive's employment continues
     after he attains age 62, his attained age at the end of that calendar year)
     rather than age 60, and (B) the offsets provided for under Section
     3.1(a)(2)-(5) of the SERP were projected to the Executive's age 62 (or, if
     the Executive's employment continues after he attains age 62, his attained
     age at the end of that calendar year) rather than the Executive's normal
     retirement date over (ii) the amount (other than interest) actually
     credited to the Executive's Supplemental Target Account under the SERP for
     the calendar year.

                                       33

<PAGE>

     (b)  The Supplemental SERP Account shall be distributed to the Executive in
     a lump sum (i) if the Executive terminates his employment with the
     Corporation prior to  age 62, as soon as practical after the close of the
     calendar year in which such termination occurs, or (ii) if the Executive
     terminates his employment with the Corporation on or after age 62, as soon
     as practical after the close of the calendar year in which the Transition
     Period ends (or if later, the end of the calendar year in which the
     Executive terminates employment); provided, however, that the Compensation
     Committee of the Board of Directors, or any successor committee thereto, in
     its sole discretion may distribute the Supplemental SERP Account prior to
     the end of the calendar year in which the Executive's termination of
     employment occurs or in which the end of the Transition Period occurs, as
     the case may be; provided further, however, that in lieu of a lump sum
     distribution, the Executive may elect, at any time prior to 12 months
     before his scheduled benefit commencement date, to have the Supplemental
     SERP Account distributed over a period not exceeding the joint and last
     survivor life expectancies of the Executive and his spouse (the
     "Installment Election").  Any such election may be changed prior to the
     date 12 months before the Executive's scheduled benefit commencement date,
     at which time the election shall become irrevocable. An Installment
     Election shall specify the period over which the installments shall be made
     and whether the distribution shall be made (A) in substantially equal
     installments, in which case the amount of each installment will be
     determined so that the present value of all installments, discounted for
     interest only at the "Applicable Interest Rate" (within the meaning of
     Section 417(e)(3) of the Code),equals the Supplemental SERP Account balance
     as of the date of determination (the "Equal Installment Method"), or (B) in
     annual installments in amounts determined by dividing the Supplemental SERP
     Account balance as of the date of determination by the number of
     installments remaining to be paid (the "Variable Installment Method").
     In the event the Variable Installment Method is elected, the Supplemental
     SERP Account will be credited with interest at the Pension Plan Interest
     Rate at the end of each calendar year during the period of distribution
     until all amounts are distributed.

     (c)  If the Executive dies prior to the distribution of the entire
     Supplemental SERP Account, the balance of the Supplemental SERP Account as
     of the date of his death shall be paid to the Executive's wife as soon as
     practical after the Executive's death in a lump sum if she is alive on the
     date of his death.  If the Executive has no wife that survives him, such
     payment shall be made to his estate; provided, however, that if the
     Executive dies after the distribution of the Supplemental SERP Account has
     commenced pursuant to the Equal Installment Method, such balance shall be
     deemed to equal the present value of the installments remaining to be paid
     at the time of his death discounted for interest only at the Applicable
     Interest Rate.

     (d)  In the event that either the SERP or the Pension Plan, or both plans,
     are amended or terminated at any time after the date hereof, such amendment
     or termination shall not affect the computation of benefits under this
     Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed as if the SERP and the
     Pension Plan had been continued in accordance with their terms as in effect
     as of the date hereof.

     3.   In the event the Executive elects to receive the distribution of his
     Supplemental SERP Account in installments pursuant to the terms of Section
     2(b), promptly after the expiration of the Transition Period or, if the
     Executive terminates employment prior to the attainment age 62 or after the
     attainment of age 65, promptly after the Executive's termination of
     employment with the Corporation, the Corporation shall establish a "rabbi"
     trust with an independent institutional trustee for the payment of the
     benefits provided under Section 2 of this Agreement, and shall fund such
     trust as soon as practical after it is established with an amount equal to
     the balance then in the Supplemental SERP Account.  Upon a Material Change
     (as such term is defined in the Key Executive Agreement between the
     Executive and the Corporation), the Corporation shall make an irrevocable
     contribution to the trust in an amount equal to the then balance in the
     Supplemental SERP Account.  The trust shall be irrevocable but shall
     provide that its assets will be part of the general assets of the
     Corporation and available for the payment of the debts of the Corporation
     in the event of the Corporation's insolvency or bankruptcy.  In the event
     that the principal of the trust, and any earnings thereon, are not
     sufficient to make the installment payments in accordance with the terms of
     Section 2 of this Agreement, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive
     directly any shortfall as it becomes due.  After all of the obligations
     under Section 2 of this Agreement have been satisfied, any remaining assets
     in the trust shall be returned to the Corporation.

     4.   During the Transition Period, the Executive will make himself
     available to provide advice and counsel upon request by the Corporation at
     reasonable frequencies, times and places mutually agreed upon by the
     Executive and the Corporation.

     5.   The Executive and the Corporation each agree that they will give the
     other party a minimum of six (6) months' notice in writing of the date
     either intends to terminate the Executive's active employment, except in
     the event the Executive is terminated by the Corporation for Cause (as such
     term is defined in Section 8 hereof).

     6.   The Executive agrees that should an emergency occur during the
     Transition Period that in the reasonable judgment of the Corporation's
     Board of Directors (the "Board") constitutes a major threat to the
     successful management of its business (such as the death or incapacity of
     the Chairman of the Board or the President), and the Corporation should
     call upon him to return to full-time active

                                       34

<PAGE>

     employment, he will do so for a reasonable period up to 12 months, under
     conditions of compensation and benefits to be negotiated in good faith at
     that time.

     7.   The Executive agrees that he will not, either directly or indirectly,
     by or for himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person,
     company, partnership, corporation or other entity:

     (a)  During the Transition Period or, if his employment terminates prior to
     the commencement of the Transition Period, during the period of two years
     following the date of his termination of employment, participate as a
     partner, joint venturer, officer, director, employee, or representative, or
     have any direct financial interest in, any business or enterprise
     conducting a quick service restaurant business in the United States, other
     than a business or enterprise engaged in operating restaurants under a
     franchise granted by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; provided,
     however, that the ownership by Executive of securities of a public
     corporation shall not be a violation of this subparagraph so long as (i)
     the Executive does not own, directly or indirectly, more than five percent
     (5%) of any class of the securities of such corporation, and (ii) the value
     of such securities does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the net worth of
     the Executive; and provided further, however, that ownership by the
     Executive of securities of the Corporation, or any successor to the
     Corporation or to substantially all of the business of the Corporation, by
     merger or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall
     not be a violation of this Subsection 7(a).

     (b)  Divulge, disclose, reveal or communicate to any person, firm,
     corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity, directly or
     indirectly, any trade secrets or other information which the Executive may
     have obtained during the course of his employment by the Corporation in
     respect of any matters affecting or relating to the quick service
     restaurant business of the Corporation or its subsidiaries, including,
     without limitation, any of their plans, policies, business practices,
     finances, recipes, methods of operation, franchises or other information
     known to the Executive to be considered by the Corporation to be
     confidential information.

     8.   The Executive agrees that, if (i) the Executive violates any of the
     provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 or 7 of this Agreement, or (ii) the
     Executive's employment is terminated for Cause (as defined below), the
     Corporation's obligation to pay the amounts or provide the benefits
     provided for in Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement shall terminate;
     provided, however, that termination of the Corporation's obligations
     pursuant to clause (i) above shall not occur unless the Corporation shall
     have first provided written notice of the alleged violation to the
     Executive and offered to arbitrate as provided in Section 13 of this
     Agreement and the Executive shall have declined to so arbitrate within a
     reasonable time after the Corporation's offer.  For purposes of this
     Agreement, "Cause" shall mean termination by reason of the Board's good
     faith determination that the Executive (i) willfully and continually failed
     to substantially perform his duties with the Corporation (other than a
     failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental
     illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to
     the Executive by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in
     which the Board believes that the Executive has not substantially performed
     his duties and such failure substantially to perform continues for at
     least fourteen (14) days, or (ii) has willfully engaged in conduct which is
     demonstrably and materially injurious to the Corporation, monetarily or
     otherwise.  No act, nor failure to act, on the Executive's part, shall be
     considered "willful" unless he has acted, or failed to act with an absence
     of good faith and without a reasonable belief that his action or failure
     to act was in the best interest of the Corporation.  Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, the Executive's employment shall not be deemed to have been
     terminated for Cause unless and until (1) there shall have been delivered
     to the Executive a copy of written notice setting forth that the Executive
     was guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i) or (ii) of the first
     sentence of this Section 8 and specifying the particulars thereof in
     detail, and (2) the Executive shall have been provided an opportunity to
     be heard by the Board (with the assistance of Executive's counsel).

     9.   If the Executive's termination of employment occurs after the
     attainment of age 62 (whether before or after the commencement of the
     Transition Period) under circumstances entitling him to receive benefits
     under the Key Executive Agreement between the Executive and the
     Corporation, no payments or further payments shall be made pursuant to
     Section 1 of this Agreement unless the Executive waives all rights to any
     payments or benefits under the Key Executive Agreement by an instrument in
     writing delivered to the Corporation within five days after his termination
     of employment.

     10.  All amounts which are payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
     subject to all applicable withholding and other employment taxes.

     11.  This Agreement may be modified or amended only by an instrument in
     writing signed by both the Corporation and the Executive.

     12.  The validity, interpretation and construction of this Agreement shall
     be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio.

     13.  Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this
     Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in accordance with
     the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  Judgment
     may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.
     The Corporation shall pay on a current basis all expenses (including
     reasonable attorney's fees) incurred by Executive in connection with such
     arbitration and the entering of such award.

     14.  The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
     inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the heirs, executors,
     administrators, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation and Executive have executed this
     Agreement on the day and year above first written.
