PART I

Item 1. Business

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Company

Wendy's International, Inc. was incorporated in 1969 under the laws of the State
of Ohio. Wendy's International, Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively
referred to herein as the "Company."

The Company is primarily engaged in the business of operating, developing, and
franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants. At January 2,
1994, there were 4,168 Wendy's restaurants in operation in the United States and
in 30 other countries and territories. Of these restaurants, 1,224 were operated
by the Company and 2,944 by the Company's franchisees.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operations

Each Wendy's restaurant offers a relatively standard menu featuring hamburgers
and filet of chicken breast sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the
customer's choice of condiments. Wendy's menu also includes a salad bar, chili,
baked and french fried potatoes, prepared salads, desserts, soft drinks and
other non-alcoholic beverages, and a child's meal. In addition, the restaurants
sell a variety of promotional products on a limited basis.

The Company strives to maintain quality and uniformity throughout all Wendy's
restaurants by publishing detailed specifications for food products,
preparation, and service by continual in-service training of employees, and by
field visits from Company supervisors. In the case of franchisees, field visits
are made by Company personnel who review operations and make recommendations to
assist in compliance with Company specifications.

Generally, the Company does not sell food or supplies to its franchisees.
However, the Company has arranged for volume purchases of many of these
products. Under the purchasing arrangements, independent distributors purchase
certain products directly from approved suppliers, and store and sell them to
local company and franchised restaurants. These programs help assure
availability of products and provide quantity discounts, quality control, and
efficient distribution. These advantages are available both to the Company and
to any franchisees who choose to participate in the distribution program.

The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc., (Bakery) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, is a producer of buns for Wendy's restaurants. At January 2, 1994, the
Bakery supplied 662 restaurants operated by the Company and 1,048 restaurants
operated by franchisees. At the present time, the Bakery does not manufacture or
sell any other products.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raw Materials

The Company and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of
food, equipment, fixtures, or other products which are necessary to restaurant
operations. The Company anticipates no such shortages of products and, in any
event, alternate suppliers are available.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trademarks and Service Marks of the Company

The Company has registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United
States Patent and Trademark office and in international jurisdictions, some of
which include "Wendy's", "Wendy", "Old Fashioned Hamburgers", and "Quality Is
Our Recipe". The Company believes that these and other related marks are of
material importance to the Company's business. Domestic trademarks and service
marks expire at various times from 1994 to 2011, while international trademarks
and service marks have various durations of 5 to 20 years. The Company generally
intends to renew trademarks and service marks which expire.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seasonality

The Company's business is moderately seasonal. Average restaurant sales are
normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.

                                       2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working Capital Practices

Cash from operations, along with cash and short-term investments on hand, should
enable the Company to meet its financing requirements. In addition, the Company
has available unused lines of credit. It is a normal practice within the quick-
service restaurant industry to maintain a relatively low current ratio. The
Company's current ratio is somewhat higher than historical levels as a result of
a debt offering in 1991.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Competition

Wendy's is one of the largest food service organizations in the world. Each
Company and franchised restaurant is in competition with other food service
operations within the same geographical area. The quick-service restaurant
industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with other organizations
primarily through the quality, variety, and value perception of food products
offered. The number and location of units, quality and speed of service,
attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of marketing are also important
factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market
depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure.

The Company's competitive position is enhanced by its use of fresh ground beef,
its unique and diverse menu, promotional products, its wide choice of
condiments, and the atmosphere and decor of its restaurants.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research and Development

The Company engages in research and development on an ongoing basis, testing new
products and procedures for possible introduction into the Wendy's system. While
research and development operations are considered to be of prime importance to
the Company, amounts expended for these activities are not deemed material.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Government Regulations

A number of states have enacted legislation which, together with rules
promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, affect companies involved in
franchising. Much of the legislation and rules adopted have been aimed at
requiring detailed disclosure to a prospective franchisee and periodic
registration by the franchisor with state administrative agencies. Additionally,
some states have enacted, and others have considered, legislation which governs
the termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement and other aspects of the
franchise relationship. The United States Congress has also considered
legislation of this nature. The Company has complied with requirements of this
type in all applicable jurisdictions. The Company cannot predict the effect on
its operations, particularly on its relationship with franchisees, of future
enactment of additional legislation. Various other government initiatives such
as health care issues, minimum wage rates, and taxes can all have a significant
impact on the company's performance.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment and Energy

Various federal, state, and local regulations have been adopted which affect the
discharge of materials into the environment or which otherwise relate to the
protection of the environment. The Company does not believe that such
regulations will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings,
or competitive position. The Company cannot predict the effect of future
environmental legislation or regulations.

The Company's principal sources of energy for its operations are electricity and
natural gas. To date, the supply of energy available to the Company has been
sufficient to maintain normal operations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acquisitions and Dispositions

The Company has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold restaurants
to franchisees, and it is anticipated that the Company may have opportunities
for such transactions in the future. The Company generally retains a right of
first refusal in connection with any proposed sale of a franchisee's interest.
The Company will continue to sell and acquire restaurants in the future where
prudent.

See Notes 6  and 7 under Item 8 on pages 22 and 23 of this Form 10-K for further
information regarding acquisitions and dispositions.

                                       3

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
International Operations

Markets in Canada are currently being developed for both company-owned and
franchised restaurants. In addition to the countries and territories listed
under Item 2 on page 6 of this Form 10-K, the Company has granted development
rights for Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Oman, Poland, Qatar, Tunisia, and the Yemen
Arab Republic.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Franchised Wendy's Restaurants

As of January 2, 1994, the Company's franchisees operated 2,944 Wendy's
restaurants in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 30 other countries and
territories.

The rights and franchises currently offered by the Company in the United States
are contained in one basic document, the Restaurant Franchise Agreement. This
document gives the franchisee the right to construct, own, and operate a Wendy's
restaurant upon a site accepted by Wendy's and to use the Wendy's system in
connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site.

Wendy's has in the past franchised under different agreements on a multi-unit
basis; however, now it is generally the intent of the Company to grant new
franchises both in the United States and foreign countries on a unit-by-unit
basis.

After having submitted to Wendy's the requested application and financial
materials, if initially approved by Wendy's, an individual becomes an approved
applicant upon the execution of a Preliminary Letter Agreement. This Preliminary
Letter Agreement does not guarantee that the applicant will be accepted as a
Wendy's franchisee but entitles the applicant to commence a training program,
intended to allow both parties the opportunity to more carefully assess a long-
term franchise relationship. For existing franchisees who in Wendy's opinion are
not in need of additional training, the Preliminary Letter Agreement may not be
necessary. Upon the execution of a Preliminary Letter Agreement, the applicant
is required to pay a non-refundable fee of $5,000 to help defray the cost of the
approval process and the initial training.

The Restaurant Franchise Agreement requires that the franchisee pay a royalty of
4% of gross receipts from the operation of the restaurant. The Agreement also
typically requires that the franchisee pay the Company a technical assistance
fee. In the United States, the technical assistance fee required under newly
executed Restaurant Franchise Agreements is currently $25,000 for each
restaurant.

The technical assistance fee is used to defray the cost to the Company of
providing to its franchisees site selection assistance, standard construction
plans, specifications and layouts, review of specific restaurant site plans,
certain training in the Company's restaurant systems, and certain bulletins,
brochures, and reports. The Company does not select or employ personnel on
behalf of the franchisees.

The rights and franchises currently offered for International development are
contained in the Franchise Agreement which is issued upon approval of a
restaurant site. The Franchise Agreement is for an initial term of 20 years or
the term of the lease for the restaurant site, whichever is shorter. The
Franchise Agreement licenses the franchisee to use the Company's trademarks and
know-how in the operation of the restaurant. Upon execution of the Franchise
Agreement, the franchisee is required to pay a Technical Assistance Fee.
Generally, the Technical Assistance Fee is $30,000 for each restaurant.
Currently, the franchisee is required to pay a monthly continuing fee based on
the gross sales of the restaurant, usually 4%.

See Schedule VII on page 31 of this Form 10-K, and Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 on pages
10 through 13 and Note 8 under Item 8 on page 23 of this Form 10-K for further
information regarding reserves, commitments, and contingencies involving
franchisees.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advertising and Promotions

Products sold by Wendy's restaurants are advertised through television, radio,
newspapers, and a variety of promotional campaigns. The Company attempts to keep
franchisees informed of current advertising techniques and effective promotions.
The Company's advertising materials are also made available to the franchisees.
The Restaurant Franchise Agreement provides that franchisees will spend 4% of
their gross receipts for advertising and promotions. Currently, the Restaurant
Franchise Agreement specifies 2% is to be spent on local and regional
advertising (including in many cases cooperative advertising), and 2% is the
required contribution to The Wendy's National Advertising Program, Inc. (WNAP).
In 1992 and 1993, a systemwide vote was taken on a proposal to increase national
advertising during the following calendar year. This voluntary program
reallocates the 4% required minimum advertising expenditures such that 2 1/2%
goes toward national advertising and 1 1/2% toward local

                                      4
<PAGE>
 
advertising during 1993 and 1994. In 1994, these minimum requirements will
revert back to 2% for national and 2% for local advertising unless a new
systemwide vote approves reallocation for 1995. Wendy's also has the ability to
increase in the future the required local expenditure to 3%, for a total of 5%
under the Restaurant Franchise Agreement, provided Wendy's is spending 5% for
all domestic Company-operated restaurants and provided Wendy's enforces this
requirement on a national basis for all franchisees who have signed that
agreement. During fiscal 1993, 1992, and 1991, approximately $86 million, $67
million, and $57 million, respectively, were spent on advertising, promotions,
and related expenses by WNAP. WNAP is a not-for-profit corporation which was
established to collect and administer the funds contributed by the Company and
all domestic franchisees. WNAP's Trustees are comprised of representatives of
both the Company and its franchisees.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personnel

As of January 2, 1994, the Company employed approximately 43,000 people, of whom
approximately 42,000 were employed in company-operated restaurants. The total
number of full-time employees at that date was approximately 7,000. The Company
believes that its employee relations are satisfactory. The Company is not a
party to any collective bargaining agreements except for (i) an agreement with a
labor union which represents certain employees of the Bakery, and (ii) two
agreements with unions which represent certain employees at two of the Company's
Canadian restaurants.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 2. Properties

Wendy's restaurants are built to Company specifications as to exterior style and
interior decor. The majority are free-standing, one-story brick buildings,
substantially uniform in design and appearance, constructed on sites of
approximately 40,000 square feet, with parking for approximately 45 cars. Some
restaurants, located in downtown areas or shopping malls, are of a store-front
type and vary according to available locations but generally retain the standard
sign and interior decor. The typical new free-standing restaurant contains about
2,800 square feet and has a cooking area, a dining room capacity for 90 persons,
and a double pick-up window for drive-thru service. The restaurants are
generally located in urban or heavily populated suburban areas, and their
success depends upon serving a large number of customers. Wendy's also operates
restaurants in special site locations such as hospitals, an airport, and college
campuses.

At January 2, 1994, the Company and its franchisees operated 4,168 Wendy's
restaurants in the locations listed under Item 2 on page 6 of this Form 10-K. Of
the 1,224 company-operated Wendy's restaurants, the Company owned the land and
building for 567 restaurants, owned the building and held long-term land leases
for 248 restaurants, and held leases covering land and building for 409
restaurants. The Company's land and building leases  are generally written for
terms of 20 to 25 years with one or more five-year renewal options. In certain
lease agreements the Company has the option to purchase the real estate. Certain
leases require the payment of additional rent equal to a percentage (ranging
from 1% to 10%) of annual sales in excess of specified amounts. Some of the real
estate owned by the Company is subject to mortgages which mature over various
terms. Surplus land and buildings are generally held for sale.

The Company also owns land and buildings for 245 restaurant locations which it
in turn leases to certain of its franchisees.

The Company owns approximately 37.6 acres of land in Dublin, Ohio on which are
located the Company's corporate headquarters. This complex contains
approximately 200,000 square feet of office space.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On May 26, 1989, Jonathan Raven and Eli Shapiro, individually and purportedly on
behalf of a putative class of other persons similarly situated, filed a
complaint against the Company and others in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The complaint, insofar as it
pertains to the Company, alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
promulgated thereunder, and the common law. The plaintiffs claim to be investors
in a limited partnership which was a franchisee of the Company. The partnership
was formed in 1985 to purchase from the Company restaurants located in
Washington and Oregon. The purchase was funded in part by the offering of
limited partnership interests and revenue sensitive subordinated notes to the
investors. The offering was concluded in 1986. The complaint seeks compensatory
damages in the amount of $18 million, attorneys fees and rescission of the
purchases of limited partnership interests and revenue sensitive subordinated
notes sold in the offering. The Company obtained releases from 82% of the
potential plaintiffs. The remaining potential plaintiffs have not been certified
as a class. The case was transferred upon motion of the defendants to the U.S.
District Court in Atlanta, Georgia. The defendants' motion to dismiss the
federal claims was granted with prejudice on October 9, 1991. The defendants'
motion to dismiss the state claim was granted without prejudice on the same day.
The plaintiffs filed a motion for reinstatement of their Section 10(b), Rule
10b-5 and common law claims on February 14, 1992. That motion was granted on
September 24, 1992. The defendants subsequently filed a motion to permit an
interlocutory appeal and renewed their motion to dismiss the Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 claims for reasons the court had not yet considered. The motion is
under consideration by the court. The Company intends to defend the action
vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims sought to
be asserted and that the resolution of the action will not materially affect the
Company's financial condition. This case was last referenced in the Company's
Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 1993.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

Results of Operations

1993 Overview

     Wendy's achieved record net income of $79.3 million in 1993, an increase
of 23% over 1992 and 55% over 1991. Fully diluted earnings per share was $.76
in 1993 versus $.63 in 1992. The Wendy's system, both company and franchise
restaurants, also enjoyed its highest ever systemwide sales and average net
sales per restaurant. The sales increases reflect the continuing emphasis on
restaurant operations, strong customer response to our advertising campaigns,
the popularity of the value strategy which incorporates both price and
quality, and the introduction of new products.

     The company's operating margin improved to 14.5% versus 13.8% in 1992. The
margin has improved each year since 1989. The improvement reflects both control
of restaurant operating costs and expanding average sales per restaurant.

     New system restaurant openings totaled 251 in 1993 with another 63 under
construction at year-end, the most ambitious new restaurant development since
1986. These new company and franchised restaurants achieved average net sales
approximately 15% higher than the remaining restaurants. The new company-
operated restaurants also exhibited higher average operating profit per
restaurant than the remaining company-operated restaurants.

     During 1993, Wendy's made several modifications to benefit future
profitability, increase efficiency, and strengthen its financial position.
Selected underperforming company-operated restaurants were identified for
closure. Various restaurant facilities were remodeled and upgraded to keep
abreast of customer requirements and demands for operating efficiency.
Canadian operations were reorganized on an administrative level and
geographically to align themselves with domestic operating regions. The
domestic regional operating structure was also fine-tuned both by transferring
responsibilities between regions and by franchising company-operated markets.
Adjustments were made to reserve and expense accruals to reflect the favorable
resolution of selected franchise problems, trends in workers' compensation and
general liability claims, and tax benefits as a result of the Canadian
reorganization. Additionally, the company retired $30 million of debt early,
resulting in a year-end debt to equity ratio of 33%.

Retail Sales

     Total company retail sales increased 6.7% in 1993 to $1,198.8 million
compared with $1,123.9 million in 1992. This increase reflects a 5.8% increase
in average domestic net restaurant sales and an additional 32 average domestic
restaurants open. Total retail sales for 1993 reflect one week's fewer sales
as 1992 was a 53-week reporting period.

     The improvement in average domestic net sales is a result of the
company's solid restaurant operations, highly effective marketing campaigns of
both existing and new products, and the value menu strategy, such as Super
Value Menu, Combo Meals, and Kids' Meals. These initiatives increased average
transactions by approximately 4.2% in 1993.

     Domestic selling prices for the company were down approximately .4% in
1993 following a 1.9% decrease in 1992. Selling prices for 1993 were actually
lower than in 1990 as the company continued to emphasize its value strategy.

     The following chart reflects average net sales per domestic restaurant
for the last three years:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
 
                    1993      1992      1991
<S>               <C>       <C>       <C>
Company           $978,000  $924,000  $874,000
Franchise         $960,000  $907,000  $843,000
Total domestic    $966,000  $912,000  $852,000
</TABLE>

     The 1992 amounts have been adjusted to a comparable 52-week year basis.
Using this method, 1993 average net sales per domestic company restaurant
increased 5.8% over 1992 and 11.9% over 1991.

Restaurant Operating Costs and Expenses

     Total company cost of sales as a percent of retail sales decreased
slightly to 58.9% in 1993 from 59% in 1992. Domestic food costs as a percent
of domestic retail sales increased to 30.2% in 1993 from 29.7% in 1992. This
reflects increases primarily in beef, chicken, and lettuce prices coinciding
with reductions in selling prices.

     Domestic labor costs as a percent of domestic retail sales were 24.5% in
1993 compared with 24.9% in 1992. This improvement reflects efforts to adhere
to the company's labor guidelines along with the impact from higher domestic
average restaurant sales offset by restaurant labor wage rate increases of
approximately 2% in 1993. In both years, new restaurant openings incurred
extra labor during the initial operating periods.

     Total company restaurant operating costs were $319.4 or 26.6% of retail
sales for 1993. This compares to costs in 1992 of $306.4 million or 27.2% of
retail sales. A significant portion of this percentage improvement resulted
from the relatively fixed nature of some of the cost components, while average
sales levels increased. In addition, group insurance and coupon expense
declined as a percent of sales.

Royalties

     Royalty income, before reserves, was $106.3 million for the year ended
January 2, 1994, and $97.6 million for the year ended January 3, 1993, or a 9%
increase. Royalty reserves amounted to

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
$1.7 million in 1993 compared with $1.2 million in 1992. Average net sales per
domestic franchise restaurant increased to $960,000 in 1993 from $907,000 in
1992, an increase of 5.9% on a comparable 52-week year basis. The remainder of
the increase reflects royalties from additional domestic and international
franchise restaurants.

     Management reviews reserve amounts on a monthly basis and believes the
company has adequate levels for royalty and other franchise-related
receivables and contingencies.

OTHER REVENUES

     Pretax gains on restaurant dispositions for 1993 amounted to $8.1 million
compared with $7.7 million in 1992. There were 86 company restaurants sold to
franchisees in 1993 versus 44 restaurants in 1992. Certain dispositions have
resulted in land and buildings being retained by the company and leased to
franchisees. This has provided a source of rental income to the company which
increased $1.8 million over 1992 to $10.1 million.

     A reserve of $2.8 million was provided in the fourth quarter of 1993 for 12
underperforming restaurants which were closed by the end of January 1994. This
was to reflect lease buy outs, the write down of assets to realizable value, and
other related expenses. Also, $30 million of debt was retired early resulting in
$672,000 of redemption expenses.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     General and administrative expenses were approximately the same percent of
revenues in both 1993 and 1992. In recognition of continuing improvement in the
financial strength of the franchise community, net reserve reversals reduced
expenses in both years. The 1993 total reversal was $2.2 million and the 1992
reversal was $1.7 million. Insurance accruals were increased $4.0 million in the
fourth quarter of 1993 to reflect trends in workers' compensation and general
liability claims. The largest component of general and administrative expense is
salaries and related benefits which rose $7.9 million, primarily reflecting
annual employee merit increases and minimal administrative staff additions to
support new restaurant development.

INTEREST

     Net interest expense decreased in 1993 primarily reflecting lower interest
expense. Interest income was $9.8 million in 1993 versus $10.1 million in 1992.
Interest expense was $21.6 million in 1993 compared with $22.5 million in 1992.
This primarily reflects a 52-week fiscal year in 1993 versus a 53-week fiscal
year in 1992, and a reduction of expense on capitalized leases.

INCOME TAXES

     The effective income tax rate for 1993 decreased to 31.4% from 36% in
1992. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company regionalized its Canadian
operations. This was intended to produce overall administrative and
operational efficiencies and closely align the organization to domestic
operations. In connection with this restructuring the company was able to
generate significant Canadian tax benefits of $6.0 million.

COMPARISON OF 1992 TO 1991

     Net income for the year ended January 3, 1993, was $64.7 million versus
$51.3 million for the year ended December 29, 1991. Net income per share, on a
fully diluted basis, was $.63 for 1992 and $.52 for 1991.

     Total company retail sales were $1,123.9 million in 1992 compared with
$962.8 million in 1991, a 16.7% increase. This improvement was attributable to
an approximate increase of 5.7% in average domestic net sales, an average of
97 more company-operated restaurants open, and a 53-week reporting period in
1992 compared with a 52-week reporting period in 1991.

     The improvement in average domestic sales resulted from the continued
strengthening of restaurant operations and highly effective marketing campaigns.
Domestic selling prices for the company were down 1.9% in 1992 compared with a
.4% increase in 1991. Domestic coupon sales were essentially unchanged in 1992
at 1% of domestic retail sales versus 1.1% of domestic retail sales in 1991.

     The company experienced an increase in cost of sales to 59% of retail sales
for 1992 compared with 58.5% for 1991. Domestic food costs as a percent of
domestic retail sales remained unchanged at 29.7% for 1992 and 1991. While
beef prices declined in 1992, offsetting increases were experienced in most
other product costs. Additionally, selling price reductions increased food
costs as a percent of retail sales. Domestic labor costs as a percent of
domestic retail sales were 24.9% in 1992 compared with 24.8% in 1991.

     Total company restaurant operating costs were $306.4 million in 1992 versus
$274.3 million in 1991, or 27.2% and 28.5% of retail sales in 1992 and 1991,
respectively. A significant portion of this improvement resulted from the
relatively fixed nature of some of the cost components, while retail sales
levels increased.

     Royalty income, before reserves, was $97.6 million for the year ended
January 3, 1993, and $88.2 million for the year ended December 29, 1991, or a
10.7% increase. Royalty reserves amounted to $1.2 million in 1992 compared
with $2.7 million in 1991. Average net sales per domestic franchise restaurant
increased to $907,000 in 1992 from $843,000 in 1991, an increase of 7.6% on a
comparable 52-week year basis. International royalty income increased in 1992
over 1991, primarily as a result of additional international franchise
restaurants.

     Pretax gains on restaurant dispositions for 1992 amounted to $7.7 million
compared with $2.0 million in 1991. There were 44 company restaurants sold to
franchisees in 1992 versus 30 restaurants in 1991. Increases were also seen in
rental income amounting to $1.6 million, and technical assistance fees of $.7
million. Losses due to asset write-offs and retirements were higher in 1992 at
$4.4 million compared with $3.4 million in 1991.

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
     General and administrative expenses increased to $94.1 million for 1992
versus $76.1 million in 1991. Much of the increase was a result of planned
spending for research and development, new product testing, information
services, and other support for new restaurant development. Increases were
primarily seen in the areas of salaries and wages, and employee benefits
amounting to $6.9 million. Net reserve reversals amounted to $1.7 million for
the year ended January 3, 1993, while for the previous year ended December 29,
1991, net reversals were $5.5 million. Disregarding reserve adjustments in
both years, general and administrative expenses were unchanged as a percent of
revenues.

     Total interest expense was $22.5 million for 1992 compared with $23.3
million in 1991, a 3.3% decrease. Interest income declined 7.9% to $10.1
million in 1992 versus $11.0 million in 1991. This was primarily a result of
lower interest rates on investments and lower levels of short-term investments
as capital spending increased.

     The effective income tax rate for 1992 increased to 36% from 34% in 1991.
The increase resulted primarily from a decrease in tax-exempt interest income,
foreign operations, and the utilization in 1991 of acquired federal tax
benefit carryforwards.

FINANCIAL POSITION

OVERVIEW

     The company continued to strengthen its balance sheet in 1993.
Shareholders' equity increased $72.1 million to a total of $600.8 million at
year-end 1993. The company's return on average equity was 14.2% in 1993
compared with 12.9% in 1992. This is the seventh consecutive year return on
equity has increased. Shareholders' equity per share rose 11.4% to $5.96 at
January 2, 1994. Long-term obligations were reduced $33.0 million including
the early retirement of $30 million of 71/4% convertible subordinated
debentures. Consequently, the debt to equity ratio dropped to 33% from 44% at
year-end 1992 and 50% at year-end 1991.

     Total assets increased $76.9 million or 8.4% over 1992 due to additions
to property and equipment for restaurant development and deferred income tax
assets required under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standard Number
109 --"Accounting for Income Taxes". Long-term notes receivable increased $8.6
million in 1993 reflecting notes taken for restaurant dispositions to
franchisees. At January 2, 1994, cash and short-term investments amounted to
$112.3 million. The company's return on average assets was 14.3% in 1993
compared with 13.9% in 1992, the fourth consecutive year this ratio increased.

     The following chart shows year-end reserve balances related to royalty
receivables and other franchise-related receivables and contingencies by balance

</TABLE> 

CASH FLOW

     Cash provided by operating activities was $146.7 million in 1993, $120.5
million in 1992 and $112.7 million in 1991. Cash provided by operations
exceeded capital expenditures by $30.1 million in 1993.

     Cash proceeds of $17.2 million were realized from company restaurant
dispositions in 1993, while $12.9 million was provided in 1992 and $7.8 million
in 1991. In addition to this, $98.5 million of cash was provided by the issuance
of the 7% convertible subordinated debentures in 1991.

     Cash provided by operating activities over the last three years was
primarily used for capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt repayments,
and acquisitions of franchised restaurants. During the last three years, the
company has acquired 152 restaurants, and has retired early over $31 million
of higher rate debt and $33 million in convertible subordinated debentures.

     During 1993, capital expenditures amounted to $117 million. New restaurant
expenditures amounted to $78 million; $27 million was spent for improvements to
existing restaurants; and $12 million was spent for other additions. Current
plans are to open or have under construction about 350 new Wendy's restaurants
in 1994, of which approximately 125 will be company-operated. Capital
expenditures could total as much as $170 million in 1994. Cash provided by
operating activities, cash and investments on hand, and possible asset
dispositions should enable the company to meet its financial requirements
through 1994.

INFLATION

     Financial statements determined on a historical cost basis may not
accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise.
Several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for the company.
Inventories approximate current market prices, there is some ability to adjust
prices, and liabilities are repaid with dollars of reduced purchasing power.

INTERNATIONAL

     During 1993, there were 41 international restaurant openings. On January 2,
1994, there were 377 Wendy's restaurants operating outside the United States in
30 countries and territories. Of these,

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
164 were in Canada, with 92 being operated by the company. Wendy's is
significantly underpenetrated in international markets. Therefore, the long-term
potential is great and Wendy's intends to increase international restaurant
expansion over the next several years. Although, international growth will come
primarily through franchising, joint venture agreements currently exist in Guam,
the United Kingdom, Korea, and New Zealand.

     Canada is our largest international market and competition in the Canadian
restaurant industry is extremely intense. The difficult economy, tax laws, and
minimum wage increases continue to negatively impact results. Nevertheless, 1993
was a year of progress and change. Average sales of company-operated restaurants
increased 7.8% in local currency, and restaurant level profitability improved. A
promising new expansion vehicle was introduced, combining a Wendy's and Tim
Horton's, a large Canadian food service operation. Both Wendy's and Tim Horton's
share the same high quality image and products sold are complementary. Wendy's
hopes to expand this concept in the future. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the
company regionalized operations in an effort to produce overall administrative
and operational efficiencies and closely align the organization with domestic
operations.

MANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK

     The quick-service restaurant industry is extremely competitive and should
remain so in the foreseeable future. Wendy's management believes that the
strategies adhered to in the past few years remain important to future
performance.

     Responsible system growth will continue in 1994, focusing on the markets
with the best potential for sales and return on investment. Each proposed site
must undergo an extensive operational and financial review before it is
approved. The company plans on opening or having under construction 125 new
company-owned restaurants and 225 new franchised restaurants in 1994. The
company's expansion will be accomplished by use of the cash and investments on
hand, cash provided by 1994 operations, and possible asset dispositions.

     Wendy's will also continue efforts to increase sales and profitability in
existing restaurants. Continued emphasis on improving operations, new
promotional and permanent menu items, local and national marketing to increase
customer awareness, and restaurant remodels are all aimed at increasing customer
transactions. Selling prices decreased .4% in 1993, and any potential change in
1994 should be very modest. The company will continue to focus on restaurant
cost control by use of company guidelines for food, labor, and other expenses.
In cooperation with our vendors, Wendy's closely monitors purchase prices while
maintaining exacting quality standards for all products in each restaurant. In
keeping with quality standards the company strictly adheres to food safety and
sanitation guidelines. These guidelines provide detailed information and methods
to apply sanitation procedures to food handling functions, from the point of
purchase through the ultimate service to the customer.

     Cost control of administrative overhead is also extremely important.
Budgets are developed for each corporate and field department and actual
expenses are monitored by comparison to the budget and to historical results.
Any proposed staff additions must be justified based on the contribution to
company or franchise operations support and to restaurant development.

     Additionally for 1994, the company anticipates the effective income tax
rate will more closely approximate historic rates.

     Wendy's will also continue its strategy of acquiring restaurants from and
selling restaurants to franchisees where prudent. Acquired restaurants, which
may be distressed, can be improved and then operated profitably by the company
or sold to a qualified franchisee. Selling restaurants generates cash which is
used for new development, acquisitions, and remodeling programs. During the
last three years, the company purchased 152 franchised restaurants and sold
160 company-operated restaurants to franchisees. Underperforming restaurants,
whether company or franchise operated, are monitored carefully and revitalized
where economically possible or closed if necessary for the financial health of
the system.

     The strength and vitality of the franchise community is an essential part
of the continued success of the Wendy's system. Various strategies have been
developed to assist individual franchisees and the overall franchise system.
The aim of these strategies is to encourage responsible new restaurant
development, increase franchisees' financial health, increase royalty income,
and improve royalty receivable collection rates. The company will continue to
maintain appropriate reserves against franchise receivables.

     The strategies developed have been beneficial and are appropriate for the
future success of the Wendy's system. However, competition is extremely
intense in the quick-service restaurant segment, particularly in the areas of
marketing and pricing. In addition, numerous external factors can have a
significant impact on the company's performance. Such factors could include
product costs, the economy, consumer perception of food safety, the weather,
changing consumer tastes, the labor supply, the company's ability to obtain
and finance real estate, and government initiatives such as health care
issues, minimum wage rates, taxes, and possible franchise legislation.

     The adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Number 112 (SFAS 112) --
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" will not have a significant
impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the company.

WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of business

     The company's principal business is the operation of quick-service
restaurants serving high-quality food. At year-end 1993 the company and its
franchise owners operated 4,168 of these restaurants under the name "Wendy's"
in 50 states and in 30 other countries and territories.

Fiscal year

     The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. The
1993 and 1991 fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks and the 1992 fiscal year
consisted of 53 weeks.

Basis of presentation

     The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

     For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the company
considers short-term investments with original maturities of three months or
less as cash equivalents. A substantial portion of these investments are tax-
exempt instruments.

Inventories

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market, and consist primarily of restaurant food items and paper supplies.

Property and equipment

     Depreciation and amortization are recognized on the straight-line method in
amounts adequate to amortize costs over the  following estimated useful lives:
buildings, up to 25 years; leasehold improvements, up to 25 years; restaurant
equipment, up to 15 years; other equipment, up to ten years; and property under
capital leases, the primary lease term. Interest cost associated with the
construction of new restaurants is capitalized, while certain other costs, such
as ground rentals and real estate taxes, are expensed as incurred.

Cost in excess of net assets acquired

     The cost in excess of net assets acquired is amortized on the straight-
line method over periods ranging from ten to 40 years which, for leased
restaurants, include the original lease period plus renewal options, if
applicable. Accumulated amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired
was $13.2 million and $12.3 million at January 2, 1994, and January 3, 1993,
respectively.

Capitalized software development costs

     The company capitalizes internally developed software costs which are
amortized over a seven year period.

Franchise operations

     The company grants franchises to independent operators who in turn pay
technical assistance fees, royalties, and in some cases, rents for each
restaurant opened. A technical assistance fee is recorded as income when each
restaurant commences operations. Royalties, four percent of monthly net sales,
are recognized as income on the accrual basis. The company has established
reserves related to the collection of franchise royalties and other franchise-
related receivables and commitments (see Note 8). Included in other assets is
the long-term portion of notes receivable amounting to $29.7 million and $21.1
million at January 2, 1994, and January 3, 1993, respectively. The carrying
amount of notes receivable currently approximates fair value.

     Franchise owners receive assistance in such areas as real estate site
selection, construction consulting, purchasing, and marketing from company
personnel who also furnish these services to company-operated restaurants.
Franchise expenses are included in general and administrative expenses.

Foreign operations

     At January 2, 1994, the company and its franchise owners operated 164
restaurants in Canada. Additionally, 213 restaurants were operated by
franchise owners in other foreign countries and territories.

Net income per share

     Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common share
equivalents during each period. Fully diluted computations assume full
conversion of the subordinated debentures into common shares, when dilutive,
and the elimination of related expenses, net of income taxes.

                                               --------   -------- 
</TABLE>
     The industrial development revenue bonds were issued to provide funds for
the acquisition, construction, and improvement of various restaurants.

     The 12 1/8% notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.

     The 7% convertible debentures are subordinated as to principal, premium,
if any, and interest to all senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture.
The conversion price is $12.30 per common share, subject to adjustment in
certain events. The debentures are redeemable, with limited exceptions, at the
option of the company on or after April 5, 1996.

     The company purchased $28.6 million, $8.3 million, and $25.5 million of
debt in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. These purchases resulted in losses
of $672,000, $23,000, and $638,000 in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

     Based on quoted market prices for the convertible subordinated debentures
and future cash flows for all other long-term debt, the fair value of total
long-term debt was approximately $214 million at January 2, 1994, and $223
million at January 3, 1993.

     The combined aggregate amounts of future maturities for all term debt are
as follows:

3. LEASES

     The company occupies land and buildings and uses equipment under terms of
numerous lease agreements expiring on various dates through 2027. Terms of land
only and land and building leases are generally for 20 to 25 years. Many of
these leases provide for future rent escalations and renewal options. Certain
leases require contingent rent, determined as a percentage of sales, when annual
sales exceed specified levels. Most leases also obligate the company to pay the
costs of maintenance, insurance, and property taxes.

     At each year-end capital leases consisted of the following:

     In connection with the franchising of certain restaurants, the company has
leased land, buildings, and equipment to the related franchise owners.

     Most leases provide for monthly rentals based on a percentage of sales,
while others provide for fixed payments with contingent rent when sales exceed
certain levels. Lease terms are approximately ten to 20 years with one or more
five-year renewal options. The franchise owners bear the cost of maintenance,
insurance, and property taxes.

     The company generally accounts for the building and equipment portions of
the fixed payment leases as direct financing leases. The land portion of
leases and leases with rents based on a percentage of sales are accounted for
as operating leases.

    In the first quarter of 1993, the company adopted Financial Accounting
Standard Number 109 (SFAS 109) -- "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under SFAS No.
109, like Financial Accounting Standard Number 96 (SFAS 96) -- "Accounting for
Income Taxes" which the company adopted in 1989, deferred income taxes are
recognized by employing the liability method. The company elected not to restate
prior years' financial statements under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and has
determined that the cumulative effect of the implementation was not significant.
The temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of January 2, 1994, are as follows:

    A deferred tax asset for foreign operations was established during the first
quarter of 1993, upon the adoption of SFAS 109, for excess capital allowances
and net operating loss carryovers which are related to a Canadian subsidiary.
This deferred tax asset was largely offset by a valuation allowance. During the
fourth quarter of 1993, when the Canadian operations were regionalized along
with a legal entity restructuring, the valuation allowance decreased by $6.0
million, predominantly due to the recognition of Canadian tax benefits.

    A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 35% in
1993 and 34% in 1992 and 1991 to the company's effective tax rate for each year

5. Stock Option and Shareholder Rights Plans

    The company has various stock option plans which provide options for certain
employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of the company. Grants
of options to employees and the periods during which such options can be
exercised are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Grants of options to
outside directors and the periods during which such options can be exercised are
specified in the plan applicable to directors and do not involve discretionary
authority of the Board. All options expire at the end of the exercise period.
Options are granted at the fair

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
market value of the company's common shares on the date of grant and no amounts
applicable thereto are reflected in net income. The company makes no recognition
of the options in the financial statements until they are exercised.

    On August 2, 1990, the Board of Directors adopted the WeShare Stock Option
Plan (WeShare Plan), a non-qualified stock option plan to provide for grants of
options equal to ten percent of each eligible employee's earnings, with a
minimum of 20 options to be made to each eligible employee annually. An
aggregate of 4.0 million common shares of the company have been reserved
pursuant to the WeShare Plan.

    The options have a term of ten years from the grant date and become
exercisable in installments of 25 percent on each of the first four
anniversaries of the grant date. On August 5, 1993,  July 30, 1992, and August
1, 1991, approximately 860,000 options, 950,000 options, and 1.1 million options
were granted to eligible employees at an exercise price of $14.38 per share,
$11.69 per share, and $9.87 per share, respectively.

    In addition, the Board of Directors also adopted the 1990 Stock Option Plan
(1990 Plan) on August 2, 1990, and amended the 1990 Plan on August 1, 1991. An
aggregate of 8.0 million common shares of the company have been reserved for
issuance to key employees and outside directors under the 1990 Plan, as amended.
On August 5, 1993, July 30, 1992, and August 1, 1991, approximately 1.1 million
options, 1.0 million options, and 1.0 million options were granted to key
employees at an exercise price of $14.38 per share, $11.69 per share, and $9.87
per share, respectively.

    Options granted under the company's various other stock option plans
generally become exercisable three years from the date of grant, at which time a
maximum of 50 percent is exercisable in the fourth year and the remainder in the
fifth through tenth years.

    The following is a summary of stock option activity for the last three
years:

</TABLE>

    Options exercisable to purchase common shares totaled 3.1 million, 2.7
million, and 2.1 million at January 2, 1994, January 3, 1993, and December 29,
1991, respectively. Shares reserved under the plans at each year-end were 10.5
million in 1993, 12.4 million in 1992, and 13.9 million in 1991.

    The company has a Shareholder Rights Plan which provides for the
distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (Right), as a dividend for
each outstanding common share. Each Right entitles a shareholder to buy one ten-
thousandth of a share of a new series of preferred stock for $25 upon the
occurrence of certain events. Rights would be exercisable once a person or group
acquires 20 percent or more of the company's common shares, or ten days after a
tender offer for 20 percent or more of the common shares is announced. No
certificates will be issued unless the Rights Plan is activated.

    Under certain circumstances, all Rights holders, except the person or
company holding 20 percent or more of the company's common shares, will be
entitled to purchase common shares at about half the price that such shares
traded for prior to the announcement of the acquisition. Alternatively, if the
company is acquired after the Rights plan is activated, the Rights will entitle
the holder to buy the acquiring company's shares at a similar discount. The
company can redeem the Rights for one cent per Right under certain
circumstances. If not redeemed, the Rights will expire on August 10, 1998.

6. ACQUISITIONS

    During 1993, the company acquired 33 domestic restaurants for cash of $8.7
million and the assumption of certain liabilities.

    In 1992, the company acquired 13 domestic and nine Canadian restaurants for
a total of $7.6 million.

    During 1991, the company acquired 55 restaurants in northeast Florida. The
purchase price was $25.9 million and included cash of $5.5 million and the
settlement of certain receivables amounting to $20.4 million. Also during 1991,
the company acquired 24 restaurants in the Miami market for cash of
approximately $7.8 million and the settlement of certain receivables amounting
to approximately $1.0 million. The company acquired 18 other restaurants from
franchisees for $5.6 million during 1991.

7. DISPOSITIONS

    In 1993, the company franchised 86 domestic restaurants. The company
franchised 42 domestic and two Canadian restaurants and 25 domestic and five
Canadian restaurants in 1992 and 1991, respectively. These transactions resulted
in pretax gains of approximately $8.1 million, $7.7 million, and $2.0 million in
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively, and are included in other revenues.

    Notes receivable related to dispositions were $23.0 million at January 2,
1994, and $14.0 million at January 3, 1993, and are included in notes receivable
and other assets.

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    At January 2, 1994, and January 3, 1993, the company's reserves established
for doubtful royalty receivables were $5.3 million and $6.4 million,
respectively. Reserves related to possible losses on notes receivable, real
estate, guarantees, claims, and contingencies involving franchisees totaled $3.0
million at January 2, 1994, and $4.0 million at January 3, 1993. These reserves
are included in accounts receivable, notes receivable, other assets, and other
accrued expenses.

    The company has guaranteed certain leases and debt payments of franchise
owners with average annual obligations of $8.3 million over the next six years.
In the event of default by a franchise owner, the company generally retains the
right to acquire possession of the related restaurants.

    The company is self-insured for most workers' compensation, general
liability, and automotive liability losses subject to per occurrence and
aggregate annual liability limitations. The company is also self-insured for
health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain
deductibles and limitations. The company determines its liability for claims
incurred but not reported on an actuarial basis.

    The company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with some of its
suppliers. The range of prices and volume of purchases under the agreements may
vary according to the company's demand for the products and fluctuations in
market rates. Amounts purchased under these agreements through January 2, 1994,
were not material.

    The company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal actions and
complaints arising in the ordinary course of business; many of these are covered
by insurance. It is the opinion of the company that such matters will not
materially affect the company's financial condition or earnings.

9. Retirement Plans

    The company's retirement program covers substantially all full-time
employees qualified as to age and service. The program includes a contributory
defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan for management and
administrative employees. The defined benefit pension plan allows for employee
contributions and provides a matching benefit from the company in addition to a
basic benefit which is independent of employee contributions. The pension plan
also provides for a guaranteed return on employee account balances. The defined
contribution plan provides for an annual discretionary contribution which is
determined each year by the Board of Directors. In addition, the retirement
program includes a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all eligible
crew employees and shift managers of the company.

    The company also has supplemental retirement plans for certain key employees
to replace benefits otherwise not available from the pension and profit sharing
plans due to the limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code and to
assure that projected benefit levels were not decreased by the changes to the
retirement program which were implemented January 1, 1989.

    The funded status of the pension plans for each year-end consisted of the
following:

                                        --------     -------- 
</TABLE>

    In determining the present value of benefit obligations, discount rates of
7.0% and 7.75% were used in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The net effect of
changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in a $1.0 million reduction of pension
expense for 1992. The expected long-term rate of return on assets used was 8.5%
in 1993 and 1992. The assumed rate of increase in compensation levels was 8.0%
for 1993 and 1992. Plan assets as of January 2, 1994, consisted of debt and
equity instruments and cash and cash equivalents.

                                       23

    Net periodic pension cost for each year consisted of the following:

                              -------   ------   -------            
</TABLE>
 
    The company provided for profit sharing and supplemental retirement benefits
of $2.3 million, $1.9 million, and $1.8 million for 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.

    A minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit
obligation over the fair value of plan assets and liabilities already accrued is
reflected in the balance sheet by recording an intangible asset and reducing
shareholders' equity.

    The company has an agreement with the Chairman of the Board which provides
for severance pay and commencement of retirement benefits if he terminates
employment for any reason. Upon termination the agreement requires the executive
to be available for consultation and prohibits him from competing against the
company for a two-year period. The agreement also provides that the company may
require him to return to active employment for up to 12 months under certain
circumstances. Retirement by the executive in 1994 would result in an expense
charge of approximately $3.9 million.

    Financial Accounting Standard Number 112 (SFAS 112) -- "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" requires accrual basis accounting for
benefits provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement. The adoption of SFAS 112 will not have a
significant impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the
company.

10. WENDY'S NATIONAL ADVERTISING PROGRAM

    The Wendy's National Advertising Program, Inc. (WNAP) is a not-for-profit
corporation which was established to collect and administer funds contributed by
the company and all domestic franchise owners. These contributions total 2% of
net sales and are used for advertising programs designed to increase sales and
enhance the reputation of the company and its franchise owners.  For 1994 and
1993, the domestic system agreed to increase national advertising spending from
2% to 2.5% of net sales. During 1993, 1992, and 1991, the company contributed
$27.7 million, $20.7 million, and $17.5 million, respectively, to WNAP. These
contributions were recognized in company restaurant operating costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To The Shareholders of
Wendy's International, Inc.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules of Wendy's International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of January 2, 1994,
and January 3, 1993 and for each of the three years in the period ended January
2, 1994 listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wendy's
International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of January 2, 1994, and January 3, 1993,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended January 2, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein.

WENDY'S WESHARE STOCK OPTION PLAN

(Reflects amendments through February 23, 1994)
EXHIBIT 10(O)

    Section 1. Purpose. This Wendy's WeShare Stock Option Plan (hereinafter
referred to as the "Plan") is intended as a means whereby employees (hereinafter
referred to as "Employee" or "Employees" and "Optionee" or "Optionees") of
Wendy's International, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") or its
subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the "Subsidiaries") can each enlarge
his proprietary interest in the Company, thereby encouraging the judgment,
initiative and efforts of the Employees for the successful conduct of the
Company's business. The Plan is also intended to create common interests between
the Employees and the other shareholders of the Company, and to assist the
Company in attracting, retaining and motivating Employees.

    Section 2. Administration of the Plan. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall appoint a Compensation Committee (hereinafter referred to as the
"Committee") of not less than three (3) directors to administer the Plan. The
members of the Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board, which shall
have the power at any time, or from time to time, to remove members from the
Committee or to add members thereto. All members of the Committee shall be
qualified to administer the Plan as contemplated by Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 16b-3, as amended or superseded from time to time. The Committee
shall construe and interpret the Plan, establish such operating guidelines and
rules as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan and make
such determinations and take such other action in connection with the Plan as it
deems necessary and advisable. It shall determine the individuals to whom and
the time or times at which Options shall be granted, the number of shares to be
subject to each Option, the Option price and the duration of leaves of absence
which may be granted to participants without constituting a termination of their
employment for purposes of the Plan. Any such construction, interpretation,
rule, determination or other action taken by the Committee pursuant to the Plan
shall be final, binding and conclusive on all interested parties, including the
Company, its subsidiaries and all former, present and future Employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

    Actions by a majority of the Committee at a meeting at which a quorum is
present, or actions approved in writing by all of the members of the Committee,
shall be the valid acts of the Committee. No member of the Board of Directors or
the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith
with respect to the Plan or any Option granted under it.

    The Committee shall have no authority to make any adjustment (other than in
connection with a stock dividend, recapitalization or other transaction where an
adjustment is permitted or required under the terms of this Plan) or amendment
of the exercise price of an option previously granted under this Plan, whether
through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, or other means, unless
the Company's shareholders shall have approved such adjustment or amendment.

    Section 3. Maximum Number of Shares Subject to Plan. Subject to any
adjustment as provided in the Plan, the shares to be offered under the Plan may
be, in whole or in part, authorized but unissued Common Shares of the Company,
or issued Common Shares which shall have been reacquired by the Company and held
by it as treasury shares. The aggregate number of Common Shares to be delivered
upon exercise of all Options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 4,000,000,
plus the amount of any additional Common Shares which may result from any share
distributions effected after the approval of this Plan by the Board of Directors
of the Company. If any Option granted hereunder shall expire or terminate for
any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares with
respect thereto shall again be available for other Options to be granted under
the Plan unless the Plan shall have been terminated.

    Section 4. Selection of Optionees. All those Employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee shall be
eligible to participate in the Plan, provided, however, that no Employee may be
granted Options in the aggregate which would result in that Employee receiving
more than ten percent of the maximum number of shares available for issuance
under the Plan. Any person who has been granted an Option under a prior stock
option plan of the Company may be granted an additional Option or Options under
the Plan if the Committee shall so determine.

    Section 5. Option Price. The purchase price for the shares covered by each
Option granted shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair
market value of the shares on the date of the grant of the Option. Such fair
market value shall be equal to the mean of the high and low prices at which
Common Shares of the Company are traded on the New York Stock Exchange on such
date.

                                       35
<PAGE>
 
    Section 6. Option Requirements. The Options granted pursuant to the Plan
shall be authorized by the Committee and shall be evidenced in writing in a form
approved by the Committee and shall include the following terms and conditions:

(a) Optionee. Each Option shall state the name of the Optionee.
    
(b) Number of Shares. Each Option shall state the number of shares to
    which that Option pertains.
    
(c) Purchase Price. Each Option shall state the Option price, which
    shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value
    of the shares covered by such Option on the date of grant of such Option.
    See Section 5, Option Price, and Section 28, date of grant.
    
(d) Payment. The purchase price for the Options being exercised must
    be paid in full at the time of exercise in a manner acceptable to the
    Committee. In addition, in order to enable the Company to meet any
    applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding
    tax requirements, an Optionee shall also be required to pay the amount of
    tax to be withheld at the time of exercise. No Common Shares will be
    delivered to any Optionee until all such amounts have been paid.
    
(e) Length of Option. Each Option shall be granted for a period to be
    determined by the Committee but in no event to exceed more than ten (10)
    years. However, subject to Sections 9 and 10, each Option shall be
    exercisable only during such portion of its term as the Committee shall
    determine, and only if the Optionee is employed by the Company or a
    Subsidiary of the Company at the time of such exercise.
    
(f) Exercise of Option. With respect to the Options offered pursuant
    to the Plan to an Employee who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 ("Section 16 of the Exchange Act"), no option can be
    exercised for at least six (6) months after the date of grant except in the
    case of death or disability as set forth in Section 10 where the Option is
    otherwise exercisable. Otherwise, each Optionee shall have the right to
    exercise his or her Option in the manner specified in this Plan or in the
    agreement evidencing granting of such Option.

    Section 7. Method of Exercise of Options. Each Option shall be exercised
pursuant to the terms of such Option and pursuant to the terms of the Plan by
giving written notice to the Company at its principal place of business or other
address designated by the Company, accompanied by cash, check, shares, or other
property acceptable to the Committee, in payment of the Option price for the
number of shares specified and paid for. From time to time the Committee may
establish procedures relating to effecting such exercises. No fractional shares
shall be issued as a result of exercising an Option. The Company shall make
delivery of such shares as soon as possible; provided, however, that if any law
or regulation requires the Company to take action with respect to the shares
specified in such notice before issuance thereof, the date of delivery of such
shares shall then be extended for the period necessary to take such action.

    Section 8. Non-Transferability of Options. Except as set forth in Section
10, an Option is exercisable during an Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee.
The Options shall not be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and shall terminate as provided in this Plan.

    Section 9. Earlier Termination of Options. Except as set forth in Section
10, upon the termination of the Optionee's employment for any reason whatsoever,
the Options will terminate as to all shares covered by Options which have not
been exercised as of the date of such termination.

    Section 10.

(a) Exercise Upon Death or Disability. In the event an Optionee dies
    while employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then all Options held by the
    Optionee shall become immediately exercisable as of the date of death and
    the estate of the deceased Optionee shall have the right to exercise any
    rights the Optionee would otherwise have under this Plan for a period of one
    year after the date of the Optionee's death, with exercise to be made as set
    forth in Section 7.

    In the event an Optionee becomes Disabled while employed by the Company or a
    Subsidiary, then all Options held by the Optionee shall become immediately
    exercisable as of the date the Optionee becomes Disabled, and the Optionee
    (or, in the event the Optionee is incapacitated and unable to exercise
    Options, the Optionee's legal guardian or legal representative whom the
    Committee deems appropriate based on applicable facts and circumstances)
    shall have the right to exercise any rights the Optionee would otherwise
    have under this Plan for a period of one year after the date the Optionee
    becomes Disabled, with exercise to be made as set forth in Section 7.

(b) Exercise Upon Retirement. In the event an Optionee's employment with the 
    Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated by reason of the Optionee's
    retirement, the Optionee shall have the right to exercise any rights the
    Optionee would otherwise have under this Plan for a period of 48 months
    after the date the Optionee retires with exercise to be made as set forth in
    Section 7. For purposes of this Section 10(b), "retirement" shall mean
    termination of employment at or after attaining age 55 with at least ten
    (10) years of service (as defined in the Company's qualified retirement
    plans), other than by reason of death or Disability or for cause.

(c) Exercise Upon Termination of Employment in Connection with a Disposition 
    of Restaurants. In the event an Optionee's employment with the Company and
    its Subsidiaries is terminated without cause in connection with a
    disposition of one or more restaurants by the Company or its Subsidiaries,
    the Optionee shall have the right to exercise any rights the Optionee would
    otherwise have under this Plan for a period of one year following the
    Optionee's termination of employment, with exercise to be made as set forth
    in Section 7.

    Section 11. Limitation on Sale of Common Shares Offered Pursuant to Plan.
With respect to the Common Shares offered pursuant to the Plan to an Employee
who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, such Common Shares cannot be
sold for at least six (6) months after acquisition, except in the case of death
or Disability.

    Section 12. Non-Qualified Stock Options. The Options granted under the Plan
shall be non-qualified stock options.

    Section 13. Effect of Change in Common Shares Subject to the Plan. In the
event any dividend upon the Common Shares payable in shares is declared by the
Company, or in case of any subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common
Shares, the aggregate number of Common Shares to be delivered upon exercise of
all Options granted under the Plan shall be increased or decreased
proportionately so that there will be no change in the aggregate purchase price
payable upon the exercise of the Option. In the event of any other
recapitalization or any reorganization, merger, consolidation or any change in
the corporate structure or stock of the Company, the Committee shall make such
adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate to reflect accurately the terms
of the Option as to the number and kind of shares deliverable upon subsequent
exercising of the Option and in the Option prices under the Option.

    Section 14. Listing and Registration of Common Shares. If at any time the
Committee shall determine that listing, registration or qualification of the
Common Shares covered by the Option upon any securities exchange or under any
state or federal law or the consent or the approval of any governmental
regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of or in connection
with the purchase of Common Shares under the Option, the Option may not be
exercised in whole or in part unless and until such listing, registration,
qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of
any conditions not acceptable to the Committee. Any person exercising an Option
shall make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as
the Committee may request to assure compliance with the foregoing or any other
applicable legal requirements.

    Section 15. No Obligation to Exercise Option. The granting of an Option
shall impose no obligation upon the Optionee to exercise such Option.

    Section 16. Misconduct. In the event that an Optionee has (i) used for
profit or disclosed to unauthorized persons, confidential information or trade
secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) breached any contract with
or violated any fiduciary obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or
(iii) engaged in unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or of another company based on information gained as a result of
that Optionee's employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries, then that
Optionee shall forfeit all rights to any unexercised Options granted under the
Plan and all of that Optionee's outstanding Options shall automatically
terminate and lapse, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.

    Section 17. Foreign Employees. Without amending the Plan, the Committee may
grant Options to eligible Employees who are foreign nationals on such terms and
conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may in the judgment of
the Committee be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the
purposes of the Plan, and, in furtherance of such purposes, the Committee may
make such modifications, amendments, procedures, and the like as may be
necessary or advisable to comply with provisions of laws of other countries in
which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate or have employees.

    Section 18. Buy Out of Option Gains. At any time after any Option becomes
exercisable, the Committee shall have the right to elect, in its sole discretion
and without the consent of the holder thereof, to cancel such Option and pay to
the Optionee the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares covered by
such Option over the Option price of such Option at the date the Committee
provides written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of the intention to exercise such
right. Buy outs pursuant to this provision shall be effected by the Company as
promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice. Payments of buy out
amounts may be made in cash, in Common Shares, or partly in cash and partly in
Common Shares, as the Committee deems advisable. To the extent payment is made
in Common Shares, the number of shares shall be determined by dividing the
amount of the payment to be made by the fair market value of a Common Share at
the date of the Buy Out Notice. In no event shall the Company be required to
deliver a fractional Common Share in satisfaction of this buy out provision.
Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of any applicable
foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes. For the
purposes of this Section 18, fair market value shall be equal to the mean of the
high and low prices at which Common Shares of the Company are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange on the relevant date.

    Section 19. No Rights to Options or Employment. No Employee or other person
shall have any claim or right to be granted an Option under the Plan. Having
received an Option under the Plan shall not give an Employee any right to
receive any other grant under the Plan. An Optionee shall have no rights to or
interest in any Option except as set forth herein. Neither the Plan nor any
action taken herein shall be construed as giving any Employee any right to be
retained in the employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

    Section 20. Merger, Consolidation, Etc. In the event that the Company is a
party to a plan or agreement for merger or consolidation or reclassification of
its securities or the exchange of its securities for the securities of another
person which has acquired the Company's assets or which is in control (as
defined in Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of a
person which has acquired the Company's assets, where the terms of such plan or
agreement are binding upon all shareholders of the Company, except to the extent
that dissenting shareholders may be entitled to relief under Section 1701.85 of
the Ohio Revised Code, then Options granted and outstanding pursuant to the Plan
for more than six (6) months, notwithstanding the date of exercise fixed in the
grant of such Options, shall become immediately exercisable and each Optionee
shall be entitled to receive, upon payment of the amount required for exercise
of each Option, securities or cash consideration, or both, equal to those the
Optionee would have been entitled to receive under such plan or agreement if the
Optionee had already exercised such Option.

    Section 21. Amendment or Termination. The Board of Directors may amend or
terminate the Plan at any time, provided that the Board of Directors shall not
(except as provided in Sections 9, 10 and 13 hereof) make any change in the
Options which will impair the rights of the Optionee therein, without the
consent of the Optionee. No option shall be granted hereunder after December 31,
1999.

    Section 22. Other Actions. This Plan shall not restrict the authority of the
Committee, the Board of Directors or of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
proper corporate purposes to grant or assume stock options, other than under the
Plan, to or with respect to any Employee or other person.

    Section 23. Costs and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 6(d) hereof
with respect to taxes, the costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be
borne by the Company, and shall not be charged to any grant nor to any Employee
receiving a grant.

    Section 24. Plan Unfunded. The Plan shall be unfunded. Except for reserving
a sufficient number of authorized shares to the extent required by law to meet
the requirements of the Plan, the Company shall not be required to establish any
special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure
payment of any grant under the Plan.

    Section 25. Laws Governing Plan. This Plan shall be construed under and
governed by the laws of the State of Ohio.

    Section 26. Captions. The captions to the several sections hereof are not a
part of this Plan, but are merely guides or labels to assist in locating and
reading the several sections hereof.

    Section 27. Effective Date. The Plan shall become effective on the date it
is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

    Section 28. Definitions. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
following terms, when used in this Plan, shall have the meaning set forth below:

(a) The "date of grant" or "grant date" of an Option shall be the date on 
    which an Option is granted under the Plan.

(b) "Option" means the right granted under the Plan to an Optionee to purchase 
    a Common Share of the Company at a fixed price for a specified period
    of time.

(c) "Option price" means the price at which a Common Share covered by an Option
    granted hereunder may be purchased.

(d) With regard to any particular Employee, "Disabled" shall have the meaning 
    set forth in the Company's long term disability program applicable to
    such Employee.
