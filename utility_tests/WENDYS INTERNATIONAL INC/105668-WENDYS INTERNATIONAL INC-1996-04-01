PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE COMPANY

                     Wendy's International, Inc. was incorporated in 1969 under
                     the laws of the State of Ohio. Wendy's International, Inc.
                     and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as
                     the "Company."

                     The Company is primarily engaged in the business of
                     operating, developing, and franchising a system of
                     distinctive quick-service restaurants. At December 31,
                     1995, there were 4,667 Wendy's restaurants (Wendy's) in
                     operation in the United States and in 33 other countries
                     and territories. Of these restaurants, 1,311 were operated
                     by the Company and 3,356 by the Company's franchisees.

                     On December 29, 1995, the Company completed its acquisition
                     of the Tim Hortons (Hortons) restaurant chain. The
                     acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and
                     is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                     Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7,
                     pages 10 through 14 of this Form 10-K). The acquisition is
                     also reflected in the financial statements and notes
                     thereto (Item 8, pages 15 through 26 of this Form 10-K). At
                     December 31, 1995, the Company and its franchisees operated
                     1,197 Hortons restaurants in Canada and the United States.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPERATIONS

                     Each Wendy's restaurant offers a relatively standard menu
                     featuring hamburgers and filet of chicken breast
                     sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the customer's
                     choice of condiments. Wendy's menu also includes a salad
                     bar, chili, baked and french fried potatoes, prepared
                     salads, desserts, soft drinks and other non-alcoholic
                     beverages, and a child's meal. In addition, the restaurants
                     sell a variety of promotional products on a limited basis.

                     Each Hortons unit offers coffee, fresh baked goods such as
                     donuts, muffins, croissants, cookies, and in some units
                     sandwiches and soups.

                     The Company strives to maintain quality and uniformity
                     throughout all restaurants by publishing detailed
                     specifications for food products, preparation, and service,
                     by continual in-service training of employees, and by field
                     visits from Company supervisors. In the case of
                     franchisees, field visits are made by Company personnel who
                     review operations and make recommendations to assist in
                     compliance with Company specifications.

                     Generally, the Company does not sell food or supplies to
                     its Wendy's franchisees. However, the Company has arranged
                     for volume purchases of many of these products. Under the
                     purchasing arrangements, independent distributors purchase
                     certain products directly from approved suppliers, and
                     store and sell them to local Company and franchised
                     restaurants. These programs help assure availability of
                     products and provide quantity discounts, quality control,
                     and efficient distribution. These advantages are available
                     both to the Company and to any franchisees who choose to
                     participate in the distribution program.

                     Under the Hortons franchise arrangements the franchisee is
                     required to purchase certain products such as coffee,
                     sugar, flour, and shortening from a Hortons subsidiary.
                     These products are distributed from six warehouses located
                     across Canada. Products are delivered to Hortons
                     restaurants primarily by Hortons fleet of trucks and
                     trailers.

                     The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc., (Bakery) a wholly-owned
                     subsidiary of the Company, is a producer of buns for
                     Wendy's restaurants. At December 31, 1995, the Bakery
                     supplied 713 restaurants operated by the Company and 1,243
                     restaurants operated by franchisees. At the present time,
                     the Bakery does not manufacture or sell any other products.

                     See Note 11 under Item 8 on page 26 of this Form 10-K for
                     information regarding revenues, income before income taxes
                     and identifiable assets attributable to the Company's
                     geographic areas.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAW MATERIALS

                     The Company and its franchisees have not experienced any
                     material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures, or other
                     products which are necessary to restaurant operations. The
                     Company anticipates no such shortages of products and, in
                     any event, alternate suppliers are available.

TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS OF THE COMPANY

                     The Company has registered certain trademarks and service
                     marks in the United States Patent and Trademark office and
                     in international jurisdictions, some of which include
                     "Wendy's", "Wendy", "Old Fashioned Hamburgers", and
                     "Quality Is Our Recipe". The Company, through its
                     acquisition of Hortons, has acquired the rights of certain
                     trademarks and service marks registered in the United
                     States Patent and Trademark office and the Canadian
                     Trademark office, some of which include "Tim Hortons,"
                     "TimBits," and "Your Friend Along the Way." The Company
                     believes that these and other related marks are of material
                     importance to the Company's business. Domestic trademarks
                     and service marks expire at various times from 1995 to
                     2009, while international trademarks and service marks have
                     various durations of 5 to 20 years. The Company generally
                     intends to renew trademarks and service marks which expire.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEASONALITY

                     The Company's business is moderately seasonal. Average
                     restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer
                     months than during the winter months.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES

                     Cash from operations, cash and short-term investments on
                     hand, and possible asset dispositions should enable the
                     Company to meet its financing requirements. In addition,
                     the Company has available unused lines of credit. It is a
                     normal practice within the quick-service restaurant
                     industry to maintain a relatively low current ratio.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPETITION

                     Each Company and franchised restaurant is in competition
                     with other food service operations within the same
                     geographical area. The quick-service restaurant industry is
                     highly competitive. The Company competes with other
                     organizations primarily through the quality, variety, and
                     value perception of food products offered. The number and
                     location of units, quality and speed of service,
                     attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of
                     marketing are also important factors. The price charged for
                     each menu item may vary from market to market depending on
                     competitive pricing and the local cost structure.

                     The Company's competitive position at its Wendy's
                     restaurants is enhanced by its use of fresh ground beef,
                     its unique and diverse menu, promotional products, its wide
                     choice of condiments, and the atmosphere and decor of its
                     restaurants. Hortons is known for the freshness of its wide
                     variety of baked goods and for its excellent coffee.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

                     The Company engages in research and development on an
                     ongoing basis, testing new products and procedures for
                     possible introduction into the Company's systems. While
                     research and development operations are considered to be of
                     prime importance to the Company, amounts expended for these
                     activities are not deemed material.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

                     A number of states have enacted legislation which, together
                     with rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission,
                     affect companies involved in franchising. Much of the
                     legislation and rules adopted have been aimed at requiring
                     detailed disclosure to a prospective franchisee and
                     periodic registration by the franchisor with state
                     administrative agencies. Additionally, some states have
                     enacted, and others have considered, legislation which
                     governs the termination or non-renewal of a franchise
                     agreement and other aspects of the franchise relationship.
                     The United States Congress has also considered legislation
                     of this nature. The Company has complied with requirements
                     of this type in all applicable jurisdictions. The Company
                     cannot predict the effect on its operations, particularly
                     on its relationship with franchisees, of future enactment
                     of additional legislation. Various other government
                     initiatives such as minimum wage rates and taxes can all
                     have a significant impact on the Company's performance.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY

                     Various federal, state, and local regulations have been
                     adopted which affect the discharge of materials into the
                     environment or which otherwise relate to the protection of
                     the environment. The Company does not believe that such
                     regulations will have a material effect on its capital
                     expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The
                     Company cannot predict the effect of future environmental
                     legislation or regulations.


                                        3
<PAGE>   4
                     The Company's principal sources of energy for its
                     operations are electricity and natural gas. To date, the
                     supply of energy available to the Company has been
                     sufficient to maintain normal operations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

                     The Company has from time to time acquired the interests of
                     and sold Wendy's restaurants to franchisees, and it is
                     anticipated that the Company may have opportunities for
                     such transactions in the future. The Company generally
                     retains a right of first refusal in connection with any
                     proposed sale of a franchisee's interest. The Company will
                     continue to sell and acquire Wendy's restaurants in the
                     future where prudent.

                     See Notes 6 and 7 under Item 8 on page 24 of this Form 10-K
                     for further information regarding acquisitions and
                     dispositions.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

                     Markets in Canada are currently being developed for both
                     company owned and franchised restaurants. In addition to
                     the countries and territories listed under Item 2 on page 7
                     of this Form 10-K, the Company has granted development
                     rights for Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, and the
                     Yemen Arab Republic.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRANCHISED WENDY'S RESTAURANTS

                     As of December 31, 1995, the Company's franchisees operated
                     3,356 Wendy's restaurants in 50 states, the District of
                     Columbia, and 33 other countries and territories.

                     The rights and franchises under which most franchised
                     restaurants in the United States are operated are set forth
                     in one basic document, the Restaurant Franchise Agreement.
                     This document gives the franchisee the right to construct,
                     own, and operate a Wendy's restaurant upon a site accepted
                     by Wendy's and to use the Wendy's system in connection with
                     the operation of the restaurant at that site. Since January
                     1995 the Company has used a revised form of agreement, the
                     Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement, for new franchised
                     restaurants operated in the United States.

                     Wendy's has in the past franchised under different
                     agreements on a multi-unit basis; however, now it is
                     generally the intent of the Company to grant new franchises
                     both in the United States and foreign countries on a
                     unit-by-unit basis.

                     After having submitted to Wendy's the requested application
                     and financial materials, if initially approved by Wendy's,
                     an individual becomes an approved applicant upon the
                     execution of a Preliminary Letter Agreement. This
                     Preliminary Letter Agreement does not guarantee that the
                     applicant will be accepted as a Wendy's franchisee but
                     entitles the applicant to commence a training program,
                     intended to allow both parties the opportunity to more
                     carefully assess a long-term franchise relationship. For
                     existing franchisees who in Wendy's opinion are not in need
                     of additional training or part of a special program, the
                     Preliminary Letter Agreement may not be necessary. Upon the
                     execution of a Preliminary Letter Agreement, the applicant
                     is required to pay a non-refundable fee of $5,000 to help
                     defray some of the cost of initial orientation, the
                     processing of the application and background investigation.

                     Both the Restaurant Franchise Agreement and the Wendy's
                     Unit Franchise Agreement require that the franchisee pay a
                     royalty of 4% of gross receipts from the operation of the
                     restaurant. Both Agreements also typically require that the
                     franchisee pay the Company a technical assistance fee. In
                     the United States, the technical assistance fee required
                     under newly executed Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreements is
                     currently $25,000 for each restaurant.

                     The technical assistance fee is used to defray some of the
                     cost to the Company in providing technical assistance in
                     the development of the Wendy's restaurant, initial training
                     of franchisees or their operator, and in providing other
                     assistance associated with the opening of the Wendy's
                     restaurant. In certain limited instances (like the
                     regranting of franchise rights or the relocation of an
                     existing restaurant) Wendy's may charge a reduced technical
                     assistance fee or may waive the technical assistance fee.
                     The Company does not select or employ personnel on behalf
                     of the franchisees.

                     The rights and franchises currently offered for
                     international development are contained in the Franchise
                     Agreement which is issued upon approval of a restaurant
                     site. The Franchise Agreement is for an initial term of 20
                     years or the term of the lease for the restaurant site,
                     whichever is shorter. The Franchise Agreement licenses the
                     franchisee to use the Company's trademarks and know-how in
                     the operation of the restaurant. Upon execution of the
                     Franchise Agreement, the franchisee is required to pay a
                     technical assistance fee. Generally, the technical
                     assistance fee is $30,000 for each restaurant. Currently,
                     the franchisee is required to pay a monthly net continuing
                     fee based on the gross sales of the restaurant, usually 4%.

FRANCHISED HORTONS UNITS

                     Hortons franchisees operate under several types of license
                     agreements. The standard term of a license agreement is ten
                     years plus one renewal period of ten years less one day.
                     The renewal is at the option of the franchisee.

                     For franchisees who lease land, building and/or equipment
                     from Hortons, the license agreement generally requires
                     between 3% and 6% of gross weekly sales for royalties plus
                     a base monthly rental payment and an incremental variable
                     rental payment based on gross monthly sales. For
                     franchisees who do not lease land, building and/or
                     equipment from Hortons, the license agreement generally
                     requires 4.5% to 7.5% of gross weekly sales for royalties.
                     Hortons generally retains the right to re-acquire a
                     franchisee's interest in a restaurant in the event the
                     franchisee wants to sell its interest during the first five
                     years of the term of the license agreement. After such
                     period, Hortons generally retains a right of first refusal
                     with regard to any proposed transfer of the franchisee's
                     interest in the restaurant, together with the right to
                     consent to a transfer to a new franchisee.

                     Franchisees are also required to contribute 4% of gross
                     monthly sales to the Hortons advertising fund, known as the
                     Ad Fund.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS

                     Products sold by Wendy's restaurants are advertised through
                     television, radio, newspapers, and a variety of promotional
                     campaigns. The Company attempts to keep franchisees
                     informed of current advertising techniques and effective
                     promotions. The Company's advertising materials are also
                     made available to the franchisees. Both the Restaurant
                     Franchise Agreement and the Wendy's Unit Franchise
                     Agreement provide that franchisees will spend 4% of their
                     gross receipts for advertising and promotions. The
                     Restaurant Franchise Agreement specifies 2% is to be spent
                     on local and regional advertising (including in many cases
                     cooperative advertising), and 2% is the required
                     contribution to The Wendy's National Advertising Program,
                     Inc. (WNAP). Under the Restaurant Franchise Agreement the
                     Company has the ability to increase the required local and
                     regional expenditures to 3%, for a total of 5% for
                     advertising and promotions, subject to certain conditions.

                     The Company has the ability under the Wendy's Unit
                     Franchise Agreement to specify and to change the 4%
                     advertising and promotions allocation subject to certain
                     restrictions. Currently, the Company requires franchisees
                     under the Wendy's Unit Franchise Agreement to allocate 2%
                     to local and regional advertising and promotions and 2% to
                     national advertising and promotions. In addition, under
                     that Agreement the Company may increase the total
                     advertising and promotions contribution to 5% for
                     franchisees operating restaurants pursuant to that
                     Agreement, if such increase is approved by an affirmative
                     vote representing 75% or more of all domestic Wendy's
                     restaurants.

                     In 1995, 1994, and 1993 a systemwide vote was taken on a
                     proposal to increase national advertising during the
                     following calendar year. This voluntary program reallocates
                     the 4% required minimum advertising expenditures such that
                     21/2% goes toward national advertising and 11/2% toward
                     local and regional advertising during 1996, 1995, and 1994.
                     These minimum requirements will revert back to 2% for
                     national and 2% for local and regional advertising unless a
                     new systemwide vote in 1996 approves reallocation for 1997.

                     During 1995, 1994, and 1993, approximately $105 million,
                     $101 million, and $86 million, respectively, were spent on
                     advertising, promotions, and related expenses by WNAP. WNAP
                     is a not-for-profit corporation which was established to
                     collect and administer the funds contributed by the Company
                     and all domestic franchisees. WNAP's Trustees are comprised
                     of representatives of both the Company and its franchisees.

                     Products sold by Hortons restaurants are advertised through
                     television, radio, newspapers and a variety of promotional
                     campaigns. Hortons provides franchisees with suggested
                     advertising and promotional materials. Hortons currently
                     collects 4% of monthly gross sales from franchisees as a
                     contribution to the Ad Fund. During 1995, 1994 and 1993,
                     approximately $21 million, $17 million and $15 million,
                     respectively, was spent by the Ad Fund.

PERSONNEL

                     As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately
                     47,000 people, of whom approximately 46,000 were employed
                     in company-operated restaurants. The total number of
                     full-time employees at that date was approximately 8,000.
                     The Company believes that its employee relations are
                     satisfactory.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

                     Wendy's restaurants are built to Company specifications as
                     to exterior style and interior decor. The majority are
                     free-standing, one-story brick buildings, substantially
                     uniform in design and appearance, constructed on sites of
                     approximately 40,000 square feet, with parking for
                     approximately 45 cars. Some restaurants, located in
                     downtown areas or shopping malls, are of a store-front type
                     and vary according to available locations but generally
                     retain the standard sign and interior decor. The typical
                     new free-standing restaurant contains about 2,800 square
                     feet and has a preparation area, a dining room capacity for
                     90 persons, and a double pick-up window for drive-through
                     service. The restaurants are generally located in urban or
                     heavily populated suburban areas, and their success depends
                     upon serving a large number of customers. Wendy's also
                     operates restaurants in special site locations such as
                     Wal-Mart stores, travel centers, gas station/convenience
                     stores, military bases, arenas, malls, hospitals, airports,
                     and college campuses.

                     The standard Hortons restaurant currently being built
                     consists of a free-standing producing unit totaling 3,000
                     square feet. Each of these includes a bakery capable of
                     supplying fresh baked goods every 12 hours to several
                     satellite Hortons within a defined area. In addition,
                     Hortons has a prefabricated, 500 square foot,
                     drive-through-only unit. Hortons also has kiosks,
                     full-service carts, and mobile carts which are typically
                     located in high traffic areas.

                     There are also Wendy's and Hortons concepts combined in one
                     free-standing unit which averages about 5,000 square feet.
                     They share a common dining room seating 104, but each has
                     its own food preparation and storage areas and most have a
                     pick-up window for each restaurant.

                     At December 31, 1995, the Company and its franchisees
                     operated 4,667 Wendy's restaurants in the locations listed
                     under Item 2 on page 7 of this Form 10-K. Of the 1,311
                     company-operated Wendy's restaurants, the Company owned the
                     land and building for 625 restaurants, owned the building
                     and held long-term land leases for 266 restaurants, and
                     held leases covering land and building for 420 restaurants.
                     The Company's land and building leases are generally
                     written for terms of 20 to 25 years with one or more
                     five-year renewal options. In certain lease agreements the
                     Company has the option to purchase the real estate. Certain
                     leases require the payment of additional rent equal to a
                     percentage (ranging from 1% to 10%) of annual sales in
                     excess of specified amounts. Some of the real estate owned
                     by the Company is subject to mortgages which mature over
                     various terms. Surplus land and buildings are generally
                     held for sale. At December 31, 1995, there were 1,197
                     Hortons units, of which all but 38 were franchise operated.
                     Of the 1,159 franchised units, 192 were owned by Hortons
                     and leased to franchisees, 623 were leased by Hortons and
                     in turn sub-leased to a franchisee, with the remainder
                     either owned or leased directly by the franchise owner.

                     The Company also owned land and buildings or subleased for
                     404 Wendy's restaurant locations and 815 Hortons locations
                     which were in turn leased to its franchisees.

                     The Company owns approximately 37.6 acres of land in
                     Dublin, Ohio on which are located the Company's corporate
                     headquarters. This complex contains approximately 200,000
                     square feet of office space.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

                     On May 26, 1989, Jonathan Raven and Eli Shapiro,
                     individually and purportedly on behalf of a putative class
                     of other persons similarly situated, filed a complaint
                     against the Company and others in the U.S. District Court
                     for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.
                     The complaint, insofar as it pertained to the Company,
                     alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities
                     Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and
                     Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, and the common
                     law. The plaintiffs claimed to be investors in a limited
                     partnership which was a franchisee of the Company. The
                     partnership was formed in 1985 to purchase from the Company
                     restaurants located in Washington and Oregon. The purchase
                     was funded in part by the offering of limited partnership
                     interests and revenue sensitive subordinated notes to the
                     investors. The offering was concluded in 1986. The
                     complaint sought compensatory damages in the amount of $18
                     million, attorneys fees and rescission of the purchases of
                     limited partnership interests and revenue sensitive
                     subordinated notes sold in the offering. The Company
                     obtained releases from 82% of the potential plaintiffs. The
                     remaining potential plaintiffs have not been certified as a
                     class. The case was transferred upon motion of the
                     defendants to the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia.
                     The defendants' motion to dismiss the federal claims was
                     granted with prejudice on October 9, 1991. The defendants'
                     motion to dismiss the state claim was granted without
                     prejudice on the same day. The plaintiffs filed a motion
                     for reinstatement of their Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and
                     common law claims on February 14, 1992. That motion was
                     granted on September 24, 1992. The defendants subsequently
                     filed a motion to permit an interlocutory appeal and
                     renewed their motion to dismiss the Section 10(b) and Rule
                     10b-5 claims for reasons the court had not yet considered.
                     The defendants' motion to file an interlocutory appeal was
                     granted. In an opinion dated January 22, 1996, the 11th
                     Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the reinstatement of the
                     complaint. The plaintiffs have not filed an appeal or
                     otherwise sought reconsideration. This case was last
                     referenced in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended
                     January 1, 1995.

                     On April 12, 1994, Richard Johnson and 12 other
                     individuals, individually and purportedly on behalf of a
                     putative class of other persons similarly situated, filed a
                     complaint against the Company and others in the U.S.
                     District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The
                     complaint alleged that the Company had engaged in racial
                     discrimination in violation of Title VII and 42 U.S.C.
                     Section 1981. The plaintiffs further alleged that the
                     Company conspired with certain of its franchisees to
                     deprive the plaintiffs and employees of such franchisees of
                     their rights under 42 U.S.C. Section 1985. The plaintiffs
                     sought judgment in an undetermined amount against the
                     Company for punitive and compensatory damages (including
                     benefits) as well as injunctive and equitable relief,
                     including reinstatement of the plaintiffs to their former
                     positions. The complaint was dismissed with prejudice
                     pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties. The
                     final order of settlement was entered by the District Court
                     on January 2, 1996. The settlement was not material to the
                     financial condition of the Company. This case was last
                     referenced in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended
                     January 1, 1995.

                     On April 29, 1994, Mercy Health Services filed a complaint
                     against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
                     Southern District of New York. The plaintiff, a shareholder
                     of the Company, alleges that the Company wrongfully refused
                     to include a shareholder resolution in the Company's notice
                     of proxy and proxy statement for the May 2, 1994 Annual
                     Meeting of Shareholders. The shareholder resolution
                     requested the Board of Directors to adopt a policy making
                     all company restaurants smoke-free by 1995, and requested
                     that the policy include stipulations that, beginning in
                     1995, all new franchisees' facilities be smoke-free and all
                     renewals of franchise agreements include smoke-free
                     facilities in the agreements. The plaintiff seeks a
                     declaration that the Company's failure to include the
                     shareholder resolution in the proxy statement was unlawful,
                     an injunction which would enjoin the Company from excluding
                     the plaintiff's shareholder resolution from any future
                     proxy statements when the resolution otherwise qualifies
                     for inclusion under the applicable rules of the Securities
                     and Exchange Commission, and an award for costs, expenses
                     and attorneys fees. The Company filed a motion for judgment
                     on the pleadings and the plaintiff filed a cross-motion for
                     summary judgment. Both motions were denied by the District
                     Court on November 29, 1994. Discovery is underway in this
                     case. The Company intends to defend the action vigorously,
                     and believes that it has meritorious defenses to this
                     action and that an unfavorable judgment would not have a
                     material impact upon the financial condition of the
                     Company. This case was last referenced in the Company's
                     Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS 
        OF OPERATIONS

                     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                     1995 Overview

                     1995 brought major changes to the composition of Wendy's
                     International, Inc. (company). The company acquired all the
                     stock of the parent of the Tim Hortons restaurant chain
                     (Hortons) on December 29, 1995 (the transaction). (See Note
                     6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Hortons is the
                     second largest restaurant chain in Canada and the largest
                     chain that features coffee and fresh baked goods such as
                     donuts, muffins, croissants, cookies, and fancy desserts.

                     This transaction was accounted for as a pooling of
                     interests and therefore all financial statements were
                     restated to reflect the activity of both Wendy's and
                     Hortons. As a result, the income statement presentation has
                     been modified to accommodate the combined activities of
                     both companies.

                     The net income for prior years has been restated to give
                     effect to the transaction. The following chart shows
                     restated net income and the impact of some related special
                     charges on 1995's net income. The equivalent fully diluted
                     earnings per share (EPS) is also included.

</TABLE>

                     The profit sharing item (the pro forma adjustment on the
                     Consolidated Statement of Income) reflects the add back of
                     compensation expense, net of taxes, to the sole shareholder
                     of Hortons. This expense, included as part of special
                     charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income, occurred
                     while Hortons was a private company and no similar expense
                     applies in 1996 and future years. In addition, in 1995
                     there were significant special charges including legal,
                     accounting, and professional fees related to the Hortons
                     transaction, reserves provided for various contingencies,
                     and costs related to organizing Canadian operations to
                     blend the Wendy's and Hortons concepts.

                     Retail Sales

                     Retail sales, which include sales from company-operated
                     restaurants and bakery and warehouse sales, grew 7.0% in
                     1995 over 1994, from $1.366 billion to $1.462 billion, and
                     grew 6.0% in 1994 compared with 1993. The changes reflect
                     an increase of 1.3% in average company-operated domestic
                     net restaurant sales in 1995, and 2.4% in 1994.
                     Contributing to this were an additional 37, 26, and 32
                     average Wendy's company-operated domestic restaurants open
                     during 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. Bakery and
                     warehouse sales also increased 23% in 1995 and 25% in 1994,
                     in line with an increase in the number of franchised
                     restaurants serviced.

                     The improvement in average Wendy's company domestic net
                     sales was a result of the value menu strategy, such as
                     Combo Meals, Kids' Meals, and Super Value Menu, and solid
                     restaurant operations, and effective marketing campaigns.
                     However, intense competition within the quick-service
                     restaurant industry continued to adversely affect Wendy's
                     domestic retail sales, and harsh weather conditions in the
                     last quarter of 1995 additionally impacted sales. The
                     average number of transactions in domestic Wendy's
                     increased approximately .4% in 1995 compared with a 1.2%
                     increase in 1994, and 4.2% in 1993. Domestic selling prices
                     increased only .2% during the year, while remaining
                     unchanged for 1994, and decreasing .4% in 1993, reflecting
                     the company's continued emphasis on its value strategy.

                     The following chart reflects average net sales per domestic

                     Franchise Revenues

                     Franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties, rental
                     income, franchise fees, and gains from restaurant
                     dispositions. Reserves against collection of these
                     franchise revenues are also provided. The franchise fees
                     primarily include reimbursement for various company costs
                     and expenses related to establishing the franchisees'
                     business, and includes initial equipment packages for
                     Hortons franchisees.

                     Royalties before reserves increased $10.4 million or 8.0%
                     in 1995, and $12.0 million or 10.2% in 1994. This primarily
                     reflects an increase in the number of franchise
                     restaurants. An average of 263 more restaurants were open
                     in 1995 and an average of 231 more in 1994.

                     Management reviews reserves on a regular basis and believes
                     the company has adequate levels for royalty and other
                     franchise-related receivables and contingencies. When the
                     outlook changes for reserve levels established in prior
                     years, they are modified accordingly and the impact is
                     reflected in general and administrative expense, as
                     discussed below.

                     Rental income on restaurants increased $10.7 million in
                     1995 and $7.3 million in 1994. Rental income increases
                     reflect the additional number of restaurants being leased
                     to franchisees. At the end of 1995, 1,257 restaurants were
                     leased to franchisees, versus 1,055 in 1994, and 818 in
                     1993.

                     Franchise fees increased $8.0 million in 1995 and $8.6
                     million in 1994, reflecting additional franchise
                     restaurants.

                     In keeping with the company's continuing strategy of buying
                     and selling Wendy's restaurants, pretax gains related to
                     franchising 120 restaurants amounted to $37.8 million in
                     1995, $11.6 million in 1994 for 49 restaurants, and $8.1
                     million in 1993 for 86 restaurants. Additionally, pretax
                     gains resulting from disposition of properties which were
                     previously leased by franchisees from Wendy's amounted to
                     $3.8 million in 1995, $2.4 million in 1994, and $.8 million
                     in 1993.

                     Cost of Sales and Restaurant Operating Costs

                     Domestic Wendy's cost of sales increased to 58.7% of retail
                     sales in 1995 from 58.0% in 1994, and 58.5% in 1993.
                     Domestic food costs as a percent of domestic retail sales
                     decreased to 29.1% in 1995 from 29.3% in 1994, and 30.2% in
                     1993. This reflects favorable purchase prices for key
                     products such as beef and chicken offset by higher produce
                     prices during 1995. All key products reflected favorable
                     pricing during 1994. Bakery and warehouse cost of sales
                     increased $23.7 million in 1995 and $20.8 million in 1994
                     reflecting new franchise restaurants serviced.

                     Domestic Wendy's restaurant labor costs as a percent of
                     domestic retail sales were 25.6% in 1995 compared with
                     24.8% in 1994, and 24.5% in 1993. The percentages reflect
                     increases in restaurant labor due to inflation in the
                     restaurant labor wage rate, particularly in 1995. The
                     inflation was driven by demand throughout the industry for
                     quality labor to provide quality service to customers.
                     Compounding this problem is the current demographic trend
                     toward a smaller portion of the population in this targeted
                     group. The company continues to control labor costs by
                     adherence to its labor guidelines. Sales per labor hour
                     increased in both 1995 and 1994 in company restaurants.

                     Domestic Wendy's company restaurant operating costs
                     increased $12.6 million in 1995, $11.4 million in 1994, and
                     $12.0 million in 1993. Domestic operating costs were 26.2%,
                     26.3%, and 26.6% of retail sales, respectively. As a
                     percent of sales, costs were consistent in 1995 and 1994.
                     Improvements during 1994 were seen in advertising,
                     utilities, and insurance expense.

                     Domestic Company Operating Margin

                     Competition in the domestic quick-service restaurant
                     industry was very intense during the last three years,
                     particularly focusing on prices. Therefore, while costs of
                     running the restaurant are subject to normal inflation,
                     selling prices have remained virtually unchanged. The
                     average sales increases from domestic Wendy's of 1.3% in
                     1995 and 2.4% in 1994 were not sufficient to provide
                     leverage on costs as a percent of retail sales. This, in
                     conjunction with increasing labor rates resulted in a
                     domestic operating margin of 15.1% in 1995 versus 15.7% in
                     1994, the first margin decline since 1989. In 1994, the
                     margin improved .8% from the prior year with advertising,
                     utilities, and insurance expense a lower percent of sales.
                     The following chart details the domestic company operating
                     margin:

</TABLE>

                     Operating Costs

                     Operating costs include rent expense related to properties
                     leased to franchisees, and cost of equipment sold to
                     Hortons franchisees as part of the initiation of the
                     franchise business. Training and other costs necessary to
                     insure a successful Hortons franchise opening, and costs to
                     operate and maintain the warehouse and bakery operations
                     are also included in operating costs. Costs that can not be
                     directly related to generating revenue are included in
                     general and administrative expenses. Depreciation on
                     properties owned and leased to franchisees is included in
                     depreciation expense on the income statement.

                     The increases in operating costs of $7.8 million, a 14.8%
                     increase in 1995, and $8.3 million, an 18.7% increase in
                     1994 were due to the addition of restaurants leased to
                     franchisees. There were 202 more restaurants under
                     franchise lease arrangements in 1995 than in 1994, and 237
                     more in 1994 than 1993.

                     General and Administrative Expenses

                     General and administrative expenses were $136.4 million or
                     7.8% of revenues for the year 1995 compared with $120.6
                     million or 7.6% for 1994, and $113.0 million or 7.6% for
                     1993. Salaries and related benefits, the largest component
                     of general and administrative expenses, increased $7.7
                     million in 1995 and $8.4 million in 1994. This primarily
                     reflects annual merit-based employee compensation increases
                     and administrative staff additions to support the rapid
                     growth of Hortons in Canada and international and domestic
                     Wendy's growth. Insurance expense declined $3.1 million in
                     1994 as the prior year included an additional $4.0 million
                     accrual to reflect trends in domestic year-end 1993's
                     workers' compensation and general liability claims.

                     As a result of continuing improvement in the financial
                     strength of the Wendy's franchise community, net reserve
                     reversals reduced expenses by $1.2 million in 1995, $2.1
                     million in 1994, and $2.2 million in 1993.

                     Special Charges

                     The Hortons transaction resulted in unusual expenses being
                     realized. Compensation expense was paid to the sole
                     shareholder of Hortons and amounted to $29.6 million in
                     1995, $28.9 million in 1994, and $23.3 million in 1993.
                     Various legal, accounting, and other professional fees of
                     $4.0 million were incurred to effectuate the Hortons
                     transaction. Additionally, reserves of $13.5 million were
                     provided for possible environmental issues and
                     contingencies. Other costs were incurred related to
                     organizing Canadian operations to efficiently blend the
                     Wendy's and Hortons concepts.

                     Interest

                     Net interest expense decreased in 1995 and 1994 primarily
                     as a result of lower interest expense of $20.5 million in
                     1995 compared with $22.2 million in 1994, and $23.6 million
                     in 1993. Interest expense was reduced due to debt
                     retirements of Wendy's related borrowings, partly offset by
                     higher interest expense on loans to support Hortons growth.

                     Income Taxes

                     The effective income tax rate for 1995 was 33.3% compared
                     with 35.2% for 1994, and 31.9% in 1993. In 1993, the
                     company generated a Canadian tax benefit of $6.0 million as
                     a result of regionalizing Canadian operations. A tax
                     benefit of $6.6 million related to Canadian operations was
                     realized in 1995 pursuant to further successful
                     developments related to the 1993 Canadian reorganization.

                     FINANCIAL POSITION

                     Overview

                     Total assets increased $294.4 million or 24.2% over 1994
                     primarily due to additions to property and equipment for
                     restaurant development. Total cash and short-term
                     investments amounted to $213.8 million at year-end 1995
                     compared with $142.9 million at year-end 1994. The increase
                     primarily reflects the issuance of $100 million 6.35%,
                     ten-year Notes and $100 million 7%, 30-year Debentures at
                     the end of 1995 net of $50 million note repayment in early
                     1995. Long-term notes receivable from restaurant
                     dispositions during 1995 were $37 million. Income taxes
                     payable reflects prepayment of income taxes which will be
                     recovered in early 1996. Return on average assets, without
                     special charges previously discussed, was 17.1% in 1995
                     compared with 17.5% in 1994.

                     Long-term debt increased in 1995 reflecting the issuance of
                     the $200 million additional debt, net of $7.0 million
                     representing interest rate hedges and discount. Offsetting
                     this was the repayment of the $50 million note. The
                     long-term debt to equity ratio increased to 41% for
                     year-end 1995 compared to 21% at year-end 1994.

                     The company's return on average equity was 18.3% in 1995
                     compared with 16.7% in 1994. As with the return on average
                     assets, this return is calculated excluding the special
                     charges previously discussed.

                     The following chart shows year-end reserve balances related
                     to royalty receivables and other franchise-related
                     receivables and contingencies by balance sheet category:

                     Cash Flow

                     Cash provided by operating activities was $164.9 million in
                     1995, $168.0 million in 1994, and $151.3 million in 1993.
                     Over the past three years, cash provided by operating
                     activities was primarily used for capital expenditures,
                     dividend payments, debt repayment, and acquisitions of
                     franchised restaurants. During this time, the company
                     acquired 149 Wendy's restaurants and repaid $214.5 million
                     in debt.

                     Cash proceeds of $40.4 million were realized in 1995 from
                     the sale of Wendy's company-operated restaurants to
                     franchisees, while $21.1 million was provided in 1994, and
                     $17.2 million in 1993. The company issued $200 million of
                     additional long-term debt in 1995.

                     During 1995, capital expenditures amounted to $217.5
                     million. New restaurant expenditures amounted to $123.5
                     million; $54.3 million was spent for improvements to
                     existing restaurants; and $39.7 million was spent for other
                     additions. These included Hortons expenditures of $40.3
                     million for new restaurant development, which are leased to
                     franchisees. Current plans are to open or have under
                     construction about 475 new Wendy's restaurants, of which
                     approximately 150 will be company-operated Wendy's sites,
                     and 273 new Hortons in 1996. Capital expenditures could
                     total as much as $345 million in 1996 including
                     approximately $52 million for Hortons. Cash provided by
                     operating activities, cash and investments on hand,
                     existing revolving credit agreements, and possible asset
                     dispositions should enable the company to meet its
                     financial requirements through 1996. If additional cash is
                     needed for capital expenditures, future acquisitions of
                     restaurants from franchisees, or for other corporate
                     purposes, the company believes it would be able to obtain
                     additional cash through existing revolving credit
                     agreements, new revolving credit agreements which the
                     company believes it could execute, or through the issuance
                     of debt securities.

                     Inflation

                     Financial statements determined on a historical cost basis
                     may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing
                     prices on an enterprise. Several factors tend to reduce the
                     impact of inflation for the company. Inventories
                     approximate current market prices, there is some ability to
                     adjust prices, and liabilities are repaid with dollars of
                     reduced purchasing power.

                     International

                     Hortons is the second largest quick-service restaurant
                     chain in Canada and at year end had 1,197 restaurants.
                     These include standard full-size restaurants, satellites,
                     drive-through-only units, and kiosks/Essos sites. In total,
                     273 sites opened in 1995. The average sales at standard
                     restaurants were $641,000 (U.S. dollars) in 1995, an
                     increase of 2.9%. The company believes there are
                     significant opportunities to expand the Hortons concept
                     throughout Canada, and eventually perhaps other
                     international markets. Future expansion should primarily be
                     through franchising, and the company plans to open, or have
                     under construction, 273 Hortons units in 1996.

                     Canada is the largest international market for the Wendy's
                     concept, and like domestic markets, the restaurant industry
                     is extremely competitive. The environment includes a
                     difficult economy, adverse tax laws, and minimum wage
                     increases. It was a productive year in 1995 as average net
                     sales of company-operated restaurants increased 5.9% in
                     local currency, following a 5.9% increase a year ago. In
                     1995, 13 company-operated Wendy's and 15 franchised Wendy's
                     opened in Canada, bringing the total restaurants to 203 at
                     year end. The company plans to have open as many as 50 new
                     restaurants in 1996. Included in these restaurants are
                     combination units of Wendy's and Hortons which have proven
                     successful with 23 units open at the end of 1995, and plans
                     to develop as many as 25 more in 1996. The combination
                     units are also being tested in U.S. markets, with one unit
                     open at year end and seven planned for 1996.

                     The company's expansion of the Wendy's concept outside
                     Canada continued with 42 new restaurants open, including
                     the 54th restaurant in Japan, the company's second largest
                     international market. International growth continues to be
                     primarily through franchising, but joint ventures will also
                     be utilized, and parts of England are being developed as
                     company-operated Wendy's markets. The company anticipates
                     opening or having under construction 100 new Wendy's in
                     international markets outside Canada in 1996. Approximately
                     half of these are planned for Asia.

                     The company intends to accelerate all international
                     development in 1996 and beyond. At year-end 1995 there were
                     470 Wendy's and 1,180 Hortons open outside the U.S. The
                     company anticipates opening or having under construction
                     150 international Wendy's and 273 Hortons in 1996.

                     MANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK

                     The company anticipates 1996 to be even more challenging
                     than 1995 given increased price competition, the difficulty
                     in obtaining quality employees, increased marketing costs
                     and continued efforts to insure food safety.

                     The company continued to adhere to the basic strategies
                     begun seven years ago and consumers have come to expect
                     quality and value from Wendy's and Tim Hortons. The company
                     believes that by focusing on areas which can be controlled
                     and improved, such as quality food, quality service and
                     value pricing, customers will recognize the difference and
                     prefer Wendy's and Tim Hortons over the competition.



                                       13
<PAGE>   14
                     The company is still committed to aggressive but
                     responsible growth. The company plans on opening or having
                     under construction 150 new Wendy's company-owned
                     restaurants and 325 new Wendy's franchise restaurants in
                     1996, along with 273 new Hortons. This expansion will be
                     accomplished by use of cash and investments on hand, cash
                     provided by 1996 operations, existing revolving credit
                     agreements, potential asset dispositions, and possible
                     borrowings.

                     The Hortons concept has been developed primarily by
                     franchising restaurants. The company anticipates that, at
                     least in the near term, development will remain primarily
                     franchised. While Hortons currently operates almost
                     entirely in Canada, future expansion will include domestic
                     and possibly other international markets.

                     The company will continue its strategy of acquiring Wendy's
                     restaurants from and selling Wendy's restaurants to
                     franchisees where prudent. Acquired restaurants, which may
                     be underperforming, can be improved and then operated
                     profitably by the company or sold to a qualified
                     franchisee. Franchised Wendy's restaurants may also be
                     acquired due to geographic or operational benefits to
                     existing company-operated markets. Selling restaurants
                     generates cash which is used for new development,
                     acquisitions, and remodeling programs. During the last
                     three years, the company purchased 149 Wendy's franchised
                     restaurants and sold 255 company-operated Wendy's
                     restaurants to franchisees. Underperforming restaurants,
                     whether company or franchise operated, are monitored
                     carefully and revitalized where economically possible or
                     closed if necessary for the financial health of the system.

                     The strength of the system's franchise community is an
                     essential part of the company's continued success.
                     Strategies already proven successful are aimed at
                     encouraging responsible new restaurant development,
                     increasing franchise financial health, increasing royalty
                     income, and improving royalty receivable collection rates.
                     The company will continue to maintain appropriate reserves
                     against franchise receivables.

                     Competition within the quick-service restaurant industry
                     remains extremely intense, particularly in areas of pricing
                     and advertising. Additionally, however, numerous external
                     factors can have a significant influence on the company's
                     performance. These factors could include the economy,
                     consumer perceptions of food safety, harsh weather,
                     particularly in the first and fourth quarters, changing
                     consumer tastes, the labor supply, legal claims, risks
                     inherent to international development, the company's
                     ability to obtain and finance real estate, and government
                     initiatives such as minimum wage rates, taxes, and possible
                     franchise legislation.

                     Financial Accounting Standard Number 121 (SFAS 121) -
                     "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
                     Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" was issued in March
                     1995. This statement requires that long-lived assets and
                     certain identifiable intangibles being held and used by an
                     entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
                     changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
                     of an asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, the
                     statement requires that long-lived assets and certain
                     identifiable intangibles being disposed of be reported at
                     the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to
                     sell. The company is in the process of evaluating the
                     impact of this statement on the results of operations and
                     financial condition of the company. Also in October 1995,
                     Financial Accounting Standard Number 123 (SFAS 123) -
                     "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" was issued. This
                     pronouncement establishes the accounting and reporting
                     standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. This
                     new standard defines a fair value-based method of
                     accounting for these equity instruments. Companies may
                     elect to adopt this standard or to continue accounting for
                     these types of equity instruments under current guidance,
                     APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
                     Employees," (Opinion 25). Companies which elect to continue
                     using the rules of Opinion 25 must make pro forma
                     disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if this
                     new statement had been applied. The company is in the
                     process of evaluating the impact of this statement on the
                     results of operations and financial condition of the
                     company. Both new standards are required for fiscal years
                     beginning after December 15, 1995.

WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of business

     The company's principal business is the operation of quick-service
restaurants serving high-quality food. At year-end 1995 the company and its
franchise owners operated 4,667 of these restaurants under the name "Wendy's" in
50 states and in 33 other countries and territories.

     Additionally, the company and its franchise owners operated 1,197
restaurants under the name "Tim Hortons" in Canada with 17 units open in the
United States. 

Fiscal year

     The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. 

Basis of presentation

     The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

     Certain reclassifications have been made for prior years to conform with
the 1995 presentation. 

     For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the company
considers short-term investments with original maturities of three months or
less as cash equivalents.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. These affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

     The pro forma adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Income represents
the profit sharing contribution made to the sole shareholder of Hortons prior to
the acquisition discussed in Note 6. This amounted to $29.6 million, or $16.3
million after tax in 1995, $28.9 million, or $16.0 million after tax in 1994,
and $23.3 million, or $12.9 million after tax in 1993. Profit sharing is
included in special charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. In 1995,
there were other costs in special charges which included legal, accounting, and
other professional fees of $4.0 million to effectuate the Hortons transaction.
Also, reserves of $13.5 million for possible environmental issues and
contingencies, and miscellaneous costs to organize Canadian operations to
efficiently blend the Wendy's and Hortons concepts are included.

     Due to officer of $63.2 million and $68.3 million (both current and
long-term portions) as of December 31, 1995, and January 1, 1995, respectively,
primarily represents profit sharing contributions and demand notes payable to
the former sole shareholder of Hortons. 

Inventories

     Inventories, amounting to $15.0 million and $13.8 million at December 31,
1995, and January 1, 1995, respectively, are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market, and consist primarily of restaurant food items,
new equipment and parts, and paper supplies.

Property and equipment

     Depreciation and amortization are recognized on the straight-line method in
amounts adequate to amortize costs over the following estimated useful lives:
buildings, up to 25 years; leasehold improvements, up to 25 years; restaurant
equipment, up to 15 years; other equipment, up to ten years; and property under
capital leases, the primary lease term. Interest cost associated with the
construction of new restaurants is capitalized, while certain other costs, such
as ground rentals and real estate taxes, are expensed as incurred.

Cost in excess of net assets acquired

     The cost in excess of net assets acquired is amortized on the straight-line
method over periods ranging from ten to 40 years which, for leased restaurants,
include the original lease period plus renewal options, if applicable. The
company periodically reviews goodwill and, based upon undiscounted cash flows,
impairments will be recognized when a permanent decline in value has occurred.
Accumulated amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired was $16.6
million and $14.8 million at December 31, 1995, and January 1, 1995,
respectively.

Pre-opening costs

     The company capitalizes certain operating costs which are incurred prior to
the opening of a new restaurant. These costs are amortized over a one-year
period.

Capitalized software development costs

     The company capitalizes internally developed software costs which are
amortized over a seven-year period.

Advertising costs

   The company recognizes advertising costs as incurred.

Franchise operations

     The company grants franchises to independent operators who in turn pay
technical assistance/franchise fees which may include equipment, royalties, and
in some cases, rents for each restaurant opened. A technical
assistance/franchise fee is recorded as income when each restaurant commences
operations. Royalties, based upon a percent of monthly net sales, are recognized
as income on the accrual basis. The company has established reserves related to
the collection


                                       19
<PAGE>   20
of franchise royalties and other franchise-related receivables and commitments
(see Note 8). Included in other assets is the long-term portion of notes
receivable amounting to $72.6 million and $31.0 million at December 31, 1995,
and January 1, 1995, respectively. The carrying amount of notes receivable
currently approximates fair value.

     Franchise owners receive assistance in such areas as real estate site
selection, construction consulting, purchasing, and marketing from company
personnel who also furnish these services to company-operated restaurants.
Franchise expenses are included in general and administrative expenses.

Foreign operations

     At December 31, 1995, the company and its franchise owners operated 203
Wendy's restaurants and 1,180 Tim Hortons restaurants in Canada. Additionally,
267 Wendy's restaurants were operated by franchise owners in other foreign
countries and territories. The functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is
the respective local currency.

Net income per share

     Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common share
equivalents during each period. Fully diluted computations assume full
conversion of the subordinated debentures into common shares, when dilutive, and
the elimination of related expenses, net of income taxes.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement

     Financial Accounting Standard Number 121 (SFAS 121) - "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" was
issued in March 1995. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact of
this statement on the results of operations and financial condition of the
company.

NOTE 2 TERM DEBT

   Term debt at each year-end consisted of the following:

     The industrial development revenue bonds were issued to provide funds for
the acquisition, construction, and improvement of various restaurants.

     The 7% convertible debentures are subordinated as to principal, premium, if
any, and interest to all senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture. The
conversion price is $12.30 per common share, subject to adjustment in certain
events. The debentures are redeemable, with limited exceptions, at the option of
the company on or after April 5, 1996.

     The 6.35% notes and 7% debentures are unsecured and unsubordinated. They
are not redeemable by the company prior to maturity.

     The company entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to
interest rate fluctuations on the 6.35% and 7% securities issued in December
1995. The company reflects realized and unrealized gains and losses on hedging
instruments as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged asset or
liability. Accordingly, losses related to these interest rate swaps amounting to
$3.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively, have been recorded as a reduction
of the carrying value of the notes and debentures and will be amortized to
interest expense over the term of the related debt.

     Based on quoted market prices for the convertible subordinated debentures
and future cash flows for all other term debt, the fair value of total term debt
was approximately $394 million at December 31, 1995, and $185 million at January
1, 1995.

     The combined aggregate amounts of future maturities for all term debt are
as follows:

NOTE 3 LEASES

     The company occupies land and buildings and uses equipment under terms of
numerous lease agreements expiring on various dates through 2027. Terms of land
only and land and building leases are generally for 20 to 25 years. Many of
these leases provide for future rent escalations and renewal options. Certain
leases require contingent rent, determined as a percentage of sales, when annual
sales exceed specified levels. Most leases also obligate the company to pay the
costs of maintenance, insurance, and property taxes.

     At each year-end capital leases consisted of the following:

     In connection with the franchising of certain restaurants, the company has
leased land, buildings, and equipment to the related franchise owners.

     Most leases provide for monthly rentals based on a percentage of sales,
while others provide for fixed payments with contingent rent when sales exceed
certain levels. Lease terms are approximately ten to 20 years with one or more
five-year renewal options. The franchise owners bear the cost of maintenance,
insurance, and property taxes.

     The company generally accounts for the building and equipment portions of
the fixed payment leases as direct financing leases. The land portion of leases
and leases with rents based on a percentage of sales are accounted for as
operating leases.

     At each year-end the net investment in financing leases receivable,
included in other assets, consisted of the following:

     In the first quarter of 1993, the company adopted Financial Accounting
Standard Number 109 (SFAS 109) - "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under SFAS No.
109, like Financial Accounting Standard Number 96 (SFAS 96) - "Accounting for
Income Taxes" which the company adopted in 1989, deferred income taxes are
recognized by employing the liability method. The company elected not to restate
prior years' financial statements under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and has
determined that the cumulative effect of the implementation was not significant.

     The temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities at each year-end consisted of the following:

     A deferred tax asset for foreign operations was established, upon the
adoption of SFAS 109, for excess capital allowances and net operating loss
carryovers which are primarily related to a Canadian subsidiary. This deferred
tax asset was largely offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the
regionalization and legal entity restructuring of Canadian operations and the
acquisition of Tim Hortons, the company reduced the valuation allowance by $7.3
million, $279,000, and $6.0 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
primarily due to the realization of Canadian tax benefits.

NOTE 5 STOCK OPTION AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS

     The company has various stock option plans which provide options for
certain employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of the
company. Grants of options to employees and the periods during which such
options can be exercised are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Grants
of options to outside directors and the periods during which such options can be
exercised are specified in the plan applicable to directors and do not involve
discretionary authority of the Board. All options expire at the end of the
exercise period. Options are granted at the fair market value of the company's
common shares on the date of grant and no amounts applicable thereto are
reflected in net income. The company makes no recognition of the options in the
financial statements until they are exercised.

     On August 2, 1990, the Board of Directors adopted the WeShare Stock Option
Plan (WeShare Plan), a non-qualified stock option plan to provide for grants of
options equal to ten percent of each eligible employee's earnings, with a
minimum of 20 options to be made to each eligible employee annually. An
aggregate of 4.6 million common shares of the company have been reserved
pursuant to the WeShare Plan.

     The options have a term of ten years from the grant date and become
exercisable in installments of 25 percent on each of the first four
anniversaries of the grant date. On August 3, 1995, August 9, 1994, and August
5, 1993, approximately 785,000 options, 865,000 options, and 860,000 options
were granted to eligible employees at an exercise price of $18.31 per share,
$15.38 per share, and $14.38 per share, respectively.

     In addition, the Board of Directors also adopted the 1990 Stock Option Plan
(1990 Plan) on August 2, 1990, and amended the 1990 Plan on August 1, 1991, and
February 23, 1994. An aggregate of 12.5 million common shares of the company
have been reserved for issuance to key employees and outside directors under the
1990 Plan, as amended.

     On August 3, 1995, August 9, 1994, and August 5, 1993, approximately 1.3
million options, 1.3 million options, and 1.1 million options were granted to
key employees at an exercise price of $18.31 per share, $15.38 per share, and
$14.38 per share, respectively.

     The following is a summary of stock option activity for the last three
years:

     Options exercisable to purchase common shares totaled 4.2 million, 4.6
million, and 3.1 million at December 31, 1995, January 1, 1995, and January 2,
1994, respectively. Shares reserved under the plans at each year-end were 12.5
million in 1995, 14.1 million in 1994, and 10.5 million in 1993.

     The company has a Shareholder Rights Plan (Rights Plan) which provides for
the distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (Right), as a dividend
for each outstanding common share. Each Right entitles a shareholder to buy one
ten-thousandth of a share of a new series of preferred stock for $25 upon the
occurrence of certain events. Rights would be exercisable once a person or group
acquires 15 percent or more of the company's common shares, or ten days after a
tender offer for 15 percent or more of the common shares is announced (these
thresholds were 20 percent until the Rights Plan was amended effective December
29, 1995). No certificates will be issued unless the Rights Plan is activated.


                                       23
<PAGE>   24
     Under certain circumstances, all Rights holders, except the person or
company holding 15 percent or more of the company's common shares, will be
entitled to purchase common shares at about half the price that such shares
traded for prior to the announcement of the acquisition. Alternatively, if the
company is acquired after the Rights plan is activated, the Rights will entitle
the holder to buy the acquiring company's shares at a similar discount. The
company can redeem the Rights for one cent per Right under certain
circumstances. If not redeemed, the Rights will expire on August 10, 1998.

     In October 1995, Financial Accounting Standard Number 123 (SFAS 123) -
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" was issued. This pronouncement
establishes the accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee
compensation plans. This new standard defines a fair value-based method of
accounting for these equity instruments. Companies may elect to adopt this
standard or to continue accounting for these types of equity instruments under
current guidance, APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," (Opinion 25). Companies which elect to continue using the rules of
Opinion 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share
as if this new statement had been applied. This new standard is required for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The company is in the process of
evaluating the impact of this statement on the results of operations and
financial condition of the company.

NOTE 6 ACQUISITIONS

     On December 29, 1995, the company acquired all of the stock of 1052106
Ontario Limited (Ontario), formerly 632687 Alberta Ltd., the parent company of
the Tim Hortons donut restaurant chain, for 16.45 million shares of a Canadian
subsidiary of the company exchangeable for 16.45 million common shares of
Wendy's International, Inc. Tim Hortons is the leading franchisor of bakery and
coffee shops in Canada. The transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented have been restated to include the accounts of Tim Hortons.
Certain adjustments were made to Tim Hortons financial statements to conform to
the same accounting practices as the company.

     Revenues and net income of the separate companies for the periods preceding
the acquisition consisted of the following:

     In connection with the acquisition, $4.0 million in professional fees to
effectuate the transaction were incurred and have been charged to expense in the
fourth quarter of 1995.

     Additionally during 1995, the company acquired 33 restaurants in the Little
Rock market for cash of $37.0 million and 47 restaurants in the Pittsburgh
market for $4.0 million cash and notes of $23.0 million. Three other restaurants
were acquired for $1.7 million during 1995.

     During 1994, the company acquired 29 restaurants in the Kansas City market
for cash of $10.5 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. The company
acquired four other domestic restaurants from franchisees for $2.3 million
during 1994, and 33 domestic restaurants for $8.7 million during 1993.

NOTE 7 DISPOSITIONS

     The company franchised 118 domestic and two Canadian restaurants during
1995. Additionally, 49 and 86 domestic restaurants were franchised in 1994 and
1993, respectively. These transactions resulted in pretax gains of approximately
$37.8 million, $11.6 million, and $8.1 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively, and are included in franchise revenues.

     Notes receivable related to dispositions were $63.6 million at December 31,
1995, and $25.9 million at January 1, 1995, and are included in notes receivable
and other assets.

     At December 31, 1995, and January 1, 1995, the company's reserves
established for doubtful royalty receivables were $3.6 million and $4.3 million,
respectively. Reserves related to possible losses on notes receivable, real
estate, guarantees, claims, and contingencies involving franchisees totaled $7.2
million at December 31, 1995, and $6.5 million at January 1, 1995. These
reserves are included in accounts receivable, notes receivable, other assets,
and other accrued expenses.

     The company has guaranteed certain leases and debt payments of franchise
owners with average annual obligations of $16.5 million over the next three
years. In the event of default by a franchise owner, the company generally
retains the right to acquire possession of the related restaurants.

     The company is self-insured for most workers' compensation, general
liability, and automotive liability losses subject to per occurrence and
aggregate annual liability limitations. The company is also self-insured for
health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain
deductibles and limitations. The company determines its liability for claims
incurred but not reported on an actuarial basis.

     The company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with some of its
suppliers. The range of prices and volume of purchases under the agreements may
vary according to the company's demand for the products and fluctuations in
market rates.

     The company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal actions and
complaints arising in the ordinary course of business; many of these are covered
by insurance. It is the opinion of the company that such matters will not
materially affect the company's financial condition or earnings.

     The company has undertaken to complete environmental assessments of its
properties belonging to one of its Canadian subsidiaries. Although the ultimate
amount of reclamation obligations to be incurred is uncertain, the company
estimates such amounts, representing assessment, cleanup, and remediation costs,
at $11.7 million. This amount has been charged to operations in the third
quarter of 1995.

NOTE 9 RETIREMENT PLANS

     The company's retirement program covers substantially all full-time
employees qualified as to age and service. The program includes a contributory
defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan for management and
administrative employees. The defined benefit pension plan allows for employee
contributions and provides a matching benefit from the company in addition to a
basic benefit which is independent of employee contributions. The pension plan
also provides for a guaranteed rate of return on employee account balances. The
defined contribution plan provides for an annual discretionary contribution
which is determined each year by the Board of Directors. Effective April 1,
1995, the defined contribution plan allows for 401(k) contributions, acceptance
of qualified rollovers, a loan feature, and a choice of four investing options,
one of which is common stock of the company. In addition, the retirement program
includes a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all eligible crew
employees and shift supervisors of the company.

     The company also has supplemental retirement plans for certain key
employees to replace benefits otherwise not available from the pension and
profit sharing plans due to the limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue
Code and to assure that projected benefit levels were not decreased by the
changes to the retirement program which were implemented January 1, 1989.

     The funded status of the pension plans for each year-end consisted of the
following:

     In determining the present value of benefit obligations, discount rates of
7.0% and 8.0% were used in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The expected long-term
rate of return on assets used was 8.5% in 1995 and 1994. The assumed rate of
increase in compensation levels was 8.0% for 1995 and 1994. Plan assets as of
December 31, 1995, consisted of debt and equity instruments and cash
equivalents.

     Net periodic pension cost for each year consisted of the following:

     The company provided for profit sharing and supplemental retirement
benefits of $3.6 million, $2.8 million, and $2.3 million for 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.

     A minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit
obligation over the fair value of plan assets and liabilities already accrued is
reflected in the balance sheet by recording an intangible asset and reducing
shareholders' equity.

     The company has an agreement with the Chairman of the Board which provides
for severance pay and commencement of retirement benefits if he terminates
employment for any reason. Upon termination the agreement requires the executive
to be available for consultation and prohibits him from competing against the
company for a two-year period. The agreement also provides that the company may
require him to return to active employment for up to 12 months under certain
circumstances. Retirement by the executive in 1996 would result in an expense
charge of approximately $3.3 million.

NOTE 10 ADVERTISING COSTS

     The Wendy's National Advertising Program, Inc. (WNAP) is a not-for-profit
corporation which was established to collect and administer funds contributed by
the company and all domestic franchise owners. These contributions total 2% of
net sales and are used for advertising programs designed to increase sales and
enhance the reputation of the company and its franchise owners. For 1996, 1995,
and 1994, the domestic system agreed to increase national advertising spending
from 2% to 2.5% of net sales. During 1995, 1994, and 1993, the company
contributed $30.3 million, $29.0 million, and $27.7 million, respectively, to
WNAP. These contributions were recognized in company restaurant operating costs.
At December 31, 1995, and January 1, 1995, the company's payable to WNAP
amounted to $2.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively.


                                       25

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC.

            We have audited the consolidated financial statements and financial
            statement schedule of Wendy's International, Inc. and Subsidiaries
            listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K. These financial statements
            and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
            Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
            these financial statements and the financial statement schedule
            based on our audits.

            We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
            auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
            the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
            statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
            examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
            disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
            assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
            made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
            statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
            reasonable basis for our opinion.

            In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
            fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
            position of Wendy's International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
            December 31, 1995, and January 1, 1995, and the consolidated results
            of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended
            December 31, 1995, January 1, 1995, and January 2, 1994, in
            conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In
            addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred
            to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial
            statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
            respects, the information required to be included therein.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is made the 29th day of December, 1995, by and between THE TDL
GROUP LTD., a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario (the "Company"),
and RONALD VAUGHAN JOYCE (the "Executive") and WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC.
("Wendy's).

WHEREAS, entering into this Agreement is a condition of closing under a Share
Purchase Agreement dated as of the 31st day of October, 1995, as amended (the
"Purchase Agreement"), whereby 1149658 Ontario Inc. ("Newco") purchased from the
Executive all of the shares of 1052106 Ontario Limited (previously 632687
Alberta Ltd. and herein referred to as "Alberta"), the sole shareholder of the
Company;

WHEREAS, it is contemplated that immediately after such purchase Newco and
Alberta will be amalgamated (with the Company, Newco and Alberta, their
successors and their respective subsidiaries being referred to herein as the
"TDL Group"); and

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive wish to set forth the terms and
conditions of the Executive's employment by the Company and Wendy's is a party
hereto solely for the purposes of sections 3(b) and 8;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and
other good and valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.  Employment

    The Company agrees to employ the Executive for the Term specified in
    paragraph 2, and the Executive agrees to accept such employment, upon the
    terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

2.  Term

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
    be for a term commencing on the date hereof and expiring on the close of
    business on December 31, 2000 (the "Term"). If at the expiry of the term the
    Executive's employment is not extended by written agreement all obligations
    of the Company and its affiliates to the Executive will be at an end without
    any requirement of notice to the Executive or pay in lieu of notice.

3.  Duties and Responsibilities

    (a)  During the Term, the Executive shall have the title of Senior Chairman
         of the Company, and shall act in an advisory role and generally promote
         the overall health and best interests of the TDL Group and in
         connection therewith shall perform such executive and managerial duties
         and responsibilities as may be mutually agreed upon from time to time
         with the Chairman, the President or the Board of Directors of the
         Company.

    (b)  Wendy's will use its best efforts to cause the Executive to be
         appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company's parent
         corporation, Wendy's, as soon as there is a vacancy on the board (but
         he shall be permitted to resign such directorship without being
         considered to be in breach of this Agreement). As an employee of a
         subsidiary of Wendy's, the Executive acknowledges that in accordance
         with the policies of Wendy's he will be serving as a director of
         Wendy's without compensation. The Executive will be provided with such
         Director's and officer's liability insurance coverage as is currently
         and from time to time in effect for other members of the Wendy's Board
         of Directors. The Executive further acknowledges that such position
         will impose on him certain fiduciary obligations toward Wendy's, its
         subsidiaries and their shareholders and covenants and agrees that at
         all times during the Term he will fulfil such obligations as a director
         or former director of Wendy's.

    (c)  The Executive will, at all times, use all reasonable efforts to perform
         his duties and responsibilities within the parameters of the then
         current budget of the Company as approved by the Board of Directors of
         the Company (except as otherwise permitted by the Board of Directors)
         and will abide by the policies of the TDL Group and of Wendy's and all
         reasonable requests of the senior management of the Company, Wendy's
         and of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Executive shall
         comply and use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the TDL Group
         complies on a timely basis with all budgetary, approval and reporting
         requirements reasonably requested by the TDL Group or Wendy's. In no
         event will the Executive incur obligations on behalf of the TDL Group
         or enter into any transaction on behalf of the TDL Group except in
         accordance with the policies and internal controls of Wendy's and the
         TDL Group.


                                       36
<PAGE>   2
    (d)  The Executive agrees that he will (i) devote such business time and 
         attention as are required to perform the functions assigned to him (not
         to exceed 6 months in each calendar year); (ii) carry out his duties
         and work with other employees of the Company and, to the extent
         necessary, employees of Wendy's, in a competent and professional
         manner; and (iii) generally use his best efforts, skill and ability to
         promote the best interests of the Company.

    (e)  The Executive's services shall be performed at the Company's offices in
         Calgary, Canada, subject to reasonably necessary travel requirements of
         his position and duties hereunder.

4.  Compensation

    (a)  As compensation for his services hereunder the Company shall pay the 
         Executive, in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices,
         direct salary compensation at an annual rate of C$500,000 through the
         period ending December 31, 2000.

    (b)  Annually during the Term in respect of the 1996 fiscal year and 
         subsequent years, the Company will pay the Executive a bonus in an
         amount which is the Canadian dollar equivalent of the greater of (i)
         the bonus paid to R. David Thomas under the Wendy's Senior Executive
         Earnings Maximization Plan, a copy of which is attached as Schedule "A"
         hereto (the "Plan"), and (ii) 25% of the aggregate payments in respect
         of such year under the Plan. Such bonus shall be paid coincident with
         the bonus payments under the Plan and the Executive shall be recognized
         as an employee with more than ten years of continuous service.

5.  Expenses; Fringe Benefits

    (a)  In addition to the compensation provided for under paragraph 4, the 
         Company agrees to pay or to reimburse the Executive during the Term for
         all reasonable and customary expenses incurred in the performance of
         his services hereunder in accordance with the policies of the Company
         and Wendy's as from time to time in effect. With respect to the use of
         the Executive's personal aircraft, regulatory requirements will limit
         reimbursement of expenses to the actual cost of fuel consumed. The
         Executive shall not transport other employees of the Company or Wendy's
         on the Executive's aircraft except as permitted by the then current
         policies of the Company and Wendy's and as permitted by all applicable
         laws and regulations. Before any other employees of the Company or
         Wendy's are transported the Company and Wendy's shall first, and shall
         from time to time, be permitted to examine the aircraft maintenance
         records and the policies and practices for pilot training and flight
         time. The Company and Wendy's shall also be given appropriate lead time
         to arrange for any additional insurance coverage which they feel to be
         reasonable in the circumstances. In the event all applicable regulatory
         requirements are met to permit the chartering of the Executive's
         aircraft and appropriate insurance is in place, the Company will in
         addition to fuel consumed reimburse the Executive for reasonable
         overhead costs (including pilot salaries and "tie down" fees) in
         respect of use of such aircraft for Company business as agreed to from
         time to time.

    (b)  During the Term the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all 
         insurance, pension and other fringe benefits as hereafter may be
         established by the Company for the benefit of the Company's employees
         generally or the officers of the Company, subject, however, to the
         provisions of the various benefit plans and programs in effect from
         time to time. The Executive acknowledges that his ability to
         participate in or contribute to the Employee Incentive Plan and the
         Retirement Compensation Agreement now in effect at the Company will be
         terminated at closing.

6.  Termination

    The Company shall be entitled to terminate the Term and to discharge the
    Executive for "Cause" without notice, or any payment in lieu of notice, and
    in such event the Executive's right to receive any unearned, non-vested or
    non-accrued compensation hereunder from the Company shall then forthwith
    terminate. The term "Cause" shall mean any grounds at common law whereby an
    employer is entitled to terminate the services of an employee without notice
    and shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following grounds:

    (a)  the Executive's failure or refusal to perform his material duties and 
         responsibilities as set forth in paragraph 3 hereof, if such failure or
         refusal continues after written warning to the Executive;

    (b)  misappropriation of TDL Group funds or property;

    (c)  excessive use of alcohol or illegal drugs which interferes with the 
         performance of the Executive's obligations under this Agreement which
         continues after written warning;

    (d)  the entry of a conviction for a Canadian Criminal Code offence (other 
         than a traffic violation or summary conviction offense) or of any crime
         involving moral turpitude, fraud or misrepresentation;

    (e)  the commission by the Executive of any wilful or intentional act which 
         could reasonably be expected to materially injure the reputation,
         business or business relationships of the TDL Group;


                                       37
<PAGE>   3
    (f)  the Executive's breach of his fiduciary duties to Wendy's, its 
         subsidiaries, or their shareholders or other breach of his obligations
         pursuant to section 8 hereof; and

    (g)  any material breach (other than those specified in any of the clauses 
         (a) through (f) above) of any of the provisions of this Agreement, if
         such breach is not cured within 10 days after written notice thereof to
         the Executive by the Company.

7.  Death

                         Notwithstanding any other provision hereof should the
                         Executive die during the Term this Agreement shall
                         terminate and the Company's only obligation thereafter
                         will be to continue to pay to the Executive's estate
                         his then salary and all accrued benefits hereunder to
                         the end of the month in which such death occurs and to
                         pay the Executive's estate a pro rata share of the
                         bonus contemplated under section 4(b) hereof.

8.  Protection of Confidential Information and Non-Competition

    (a)  As used in this Agreement:

         "Business of the Company" shall include the business of the Company and
         of other members of the TDL Group and means the franchising,
         development, opening, and operating of retail outlets involving the
         production, merchandising, and sale of donuts, muffins, tarts, cakes,
         pies, cookies, coffee, sandwiches, cups or coffee makers and such other
         products as may be offered for sale by Tim Hortons Shops now or
         hereafter during the Term and the sourcing and supply of ingredients,
         supplies, or merchandise for such products or such business.

         "Confidential Information" means:

         (i)   proprietary information of the TDL Group or of the Wendy's Group;

         (ii)  information marked or designated by the TDL Group or the Wendy's
               Group as confidential; 

         (iii) information, whether or not in written form and whether or not
               designated as confidential, which is known to the Executive as
               being treated by the TDL Group or the Wendy's Group as
               confidential;

         (iv)  information provided to the TDL Group or the Wendy's Group by 
               third parties which the TDL Group or the Wendy's Group is
               obligated to keep confidential; and

         (v)   without limitation, know-how, supplier lists, franchisee lists,
               marketing and distribution plans and practices, and financial and
               technical information of the TDL Group or the Wendy's Group.

         "Wendy's Group" means Wendy's and its subsidiaries other than the TDL
         Group.

    (b)  The Executive acknowledges that he now has and in the course of 
         performing his duties for the Company he will have access to
         Confidential Information, the ownership and confidential status of
         which are highly important to the TDL Group and the Wendy's Group, and
         the Executive agrees, in addition to the specific covenants contained
         herein, to comply with all reasonable policies and procedures of the
         TDL Group and the Wendy's Group as may be established from time to time
         for the protection of such Confidential Information.

    (c)  The Executive acknowledges that all Confidential Information is and 
         shall continue to be the exclusive property of the TDL Group or the
         Wendy's Group as applicable, whether or not prepared in whole or in
         part by him and whether or not disclosed to or entrusted to him in
         connection with his employment by the Company or in his capacity as a
         director of Wendy's.

    (d)  The Executive agrees not to use Confidential Information for his 
         benefit or for the benefit of any third party and agrees not to
         disclose Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, under any
         circumstances or by any means, to any third person. In the event that
         the Executive becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the
         Confidential Information, he agrees to provide the Company and Wendy's
         with prompt notice so that they may seek a protective order or other
         appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the applicable
         provisions of this Agreement. In the event that either such protective
         order or other remedy is obtained or the Company and Wendy's waive
         compliance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, the
         Executive agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential
         Information which is legally required and will exercise his best
         efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
         be accorded the Confidential Information. The Company and Wendy's agree
         to reimburse the Executive for his reasonable fees and expenses of
         counsel in connection therewith. The Executive agrees that he will not
         copy, transmit, reproduce, summarize, quote or make any commercial or
         other use whatsoever of Confidential Information, except as may be
         necessary to perform work done by him for the TDL Group or in his
         capacity as a director of Wendy's.

    (e)  The Executive agrees to exercise the highest degree of care in 
         safeguarding Confidential Information against loss, theft, or other
         inadvertent disclosure and agrees generally to take all steps necessary
         or requested by the TDL Group or the Wendy's Group to ensure that
         confidentiality is maintained at all times.


                                       38

         (i)   information now or hereafter voluntarily disseminated by the TDL 
               Group or the Wendy's Group to the public or which otherwise
               becomes part of the public domain through lawful means;

         (ii)  information subsequently and rightfully received from third 
               parties and not subject to any obligation of confidentiality; and

         (iii) information independently developed by the Executive after 
               termination of his employment hereunder.

    (g)  The Executive agrees that all creative work prepared or originated by 
         him for the TDL Group or during or within the scope of his employment
         by the Company is owned by the applicable member of the TDL Group; and,
         in any event, the Executive assigns to such entity all intellectual
         property rights in such work whether by right of copyright, trade
         secret or otherwise and whether or not subject to protection by
         copyright laws.

    (h)  The Executive agrees that during the Term of this Agreement and for one
         year thereafter, he will not, without the prior written consent of the
         Company, directly or indirectly, whether as employee, officer,
         director, independent contractor, consultant, licensor, licensee,
         stockholder, partner, or otherwise, engage or assist others to engage
         in or have any interest in any business which competes with the
         Business of the Company: (a) in the areas which now comprise the
         provinces and territories of Canada; (b) in the states of New York,
         Florida, Minnesota, Michigan and Washington; or (c) within 100 miles of
         any operating Tim Hortons Shop in such states of the United States of
         America or such other foreign jurisdictions where the TDL Group then
         operates or licenses parties to carry on the Business; provided,
         however, that Executive may own directly or indirectly, solely as an
         investment, securities of any person which engages in such a business
         which are traded on any national securities exchange if he (y) is not a
         controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such
         person or (z) does not, directly or indirectly, own 1% or more of any
         class of securities of such person.

    (i)  During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one year 
         thereafter, the Executive agrees that he will not: (i) solicit, induce,
         or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of the TDL Group to
         leave the employ of the TDL Group or to engage in any business that
         competes with the Business of the Company; or (ii) hire or assist in
         the hiring of any person who is an employee of the TDL Group to work
         for any business that competes with the Business of the Company.

    (j)  For a period of one year after termination of his employment by the 
         Company, the Executive agrees to notify the Company in writing of any
         involvement by him with any business that competes with the Business of
         the Company. The Executive shall disclose the existence and contents of
         this Agreement to any business with which the Executive proposes to
         become involved within such time period.

    (k)  Upon termination of this Agreement and any extension hereof, the 
         Executive shall deliver to the Company all materials, including without
         limitation supplier lists, lists of current or prospective franchisees,
         documents, records, drawings, prototypes, models and schematic
         diagrams, which describe, depict, contain, constitute, reflect, record
         or in any way relate to Confidential Information (including all copies
         and extracts therefrom), which are in the Executive's possession or
         under his control, whether or not the materials were prepared by the
         Executive.

    (l)  If the Executive is served with any subpoena or other compulsory 
         judicial or administrative process calling for production of
         Confidential Information or if the Executive is otherwise required by
         law or regulation to disclose Confidential Information, the Executive
         will immediately, and prior to production or disclosure, notify the
         Company in writing and provide it with such information as may be
         necessary in order that the Company may take such action as it deems
         necessary to protect its interests.

    (m)  If the Executive commits a breach of any of the provisions of this 
         paragraph 8, the Company shall have the right to have the provisions of
         this Agreement specifically enforced by any court having equity
         jurisdiction without being required to post bond or other security and
         without having to prove the inadequacy of any other available remedies,
         it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach will cause
         irreparable harm to the Company and that monetary damages will not
         provide an adequate remedy to the Company. In addition, the Company may
         take all such other actions and remedies available to it in law or in
         equity and shall be entitled to such damages as it can show it has
         sustained by reason of such breach or attempted breach.

    (n)  The Executive acknowledges that in his capacity as a director of 
         Wendy's he will have certain fiduciary obligations towards Wendy's and
         the Wendy's Group. In consideration of Wendy's causing Newco to
         purchase Alberta and agreeing to appoint the Executive to the Wendy's
         board the Executive hereby agrees that he will continue to be bound by
         such fiduciary obligations for the longer of (i) a one year period
         after he ceases to be a director of Wendy's, and (ii) the period for
         which he would otherwise be bound by such fiduciary obligations.

    (o)  The parties acknowledge that the nature, extent and periods of 
         restriction imposed in the provisions of this paragraph 8 are fair and
         reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the
         Company, and the goodwill and the Business of the Company in the
         context of the acquisition by Newco of Alberta, including its
         wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company; and that the time, scope,
         geographic area and other provisions of this paragraph 8 have been
         specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and are
         given as an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the
         Purchase Agreement. If any of the covenants in this paragraph 8, or any
         part thereof, is hereafter construed to be invalid or unenforceable, it
         is the intention of the parties that the same shall not affect the
         remainder of the covenant or covenants, which shall be given full
         effect, without regard to the invalid portions. If any of the covenants
         contained in this paragraph 8, or any part thereof, is held to be
         unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area
         covered thereby, the parties agree that the court making such
         determination should reduce the duration and/or areas of such provision
         such that, in its reduced form, said provision shall then be
         enforceable.

9.  Release of Prior Claims

    The Executive is a long term employee of the Company who has over a number
    of years received bonuses from the Company in addition to his salary.
    Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and as a condition to the entering into
    of this Agreement, the Executive hereby releases any and all claims for
    compensation from the Company in his capacity as an employee, officer or
    director including notice of termination or pay in lieu of notice except
    pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and acknowledges that he has been
    paid all sums of money to which he is entitled to the date hereof under the
    Employment Standards Act of Ontario or any other applicable legislation. As
    at the date of execution of this Agreement the Executive has also provided a
    written release of similar claims against Alberta and its subsidiaries and
    the subsidiaries of the Company.

10. Enforceability

    The failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other
    party of any provision hereunder shall in no way affect the right of that
    party thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall it affect any other party's
    right to enforce the same, or to enforce any of the other provisions in this
    Agreement; nor shall the waiver by either party of the breach of any
    provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of
    such provision or as a waiver of the provision itself.

11. Assignment

    This Agreement is a personal contract and the Executive's rights and
    obligations hereunder may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or
    hypothecated by the Executive. The rights and obligations of the Company
    hereunder shall be binding upon and run in favour of the Company; provided,
    however, the Company may not assign its rights and obligations under this
    Agreement except in connection with the sale or transfer of all or
    substantially all of the Company's business (whether by way of sale of
    assets, amalgamation or otherwise).

12. Modification

    This Agreement may not be orally cancelled, changed, modified or amended,
    and no cancellation, change, modification or amendment shall be effective or
    binding, unless in writing and signed by both parties to this Agreement, and
    approved in writing by the Chief Executive Officer of Wendy's.

13. Severability

    In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be void and
    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions
    of this Agreement shall nevertheless be binding upon the parties with the
    same effect as though the void or unenforceable provision had been severed
    and deleted. The provisions of paragraphs 8 and 13 shall survive termination
    of this Agreement.

14. Notice

    All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall
    be deemed given if delivered by hand, sent by facsimile transmission with
    confirmation of receipt requested, or sent via a reputable international
    courier service with confirmation of receipt requested, to the parties at
    the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be

                           WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC.
                   SENIOR EXECUTIVE EARNINGS MAXIMIZATION PLAN


1.  Purpose. The purpose of the Senior Executive Earnings Maximization Plan (the
    "Plan") is to enhance Wendy's International, Inc.'s (the "Company") ability
    to attract, motivate, reward, and retain key employees, to strengthen their
    commitment to the success of the Company and to align their interests with
    those of the Company's shareholders by providing additional compensation to
    designated key employees of the Company based on the achievement of
    performance objectives. To this end, the Plan provides a means of rewarding
    participants based on the performance of the Company.

2.  Committee. The Plan shall be administered by a committee of the Board of
    Directors of the Company (the "Committee"). Each member of the Committee
    must be an "outside director" within the meaning of the Regulations proposed
    under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

3.  Eligible Employees. Eligible employees shall include the individuals
    holding the positions of Senior Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the
    Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer or Chief
    Financial Officer; provided, however, that no more than three persons will
    participate in the Plan for any particular fiscal year of the Company (those
    Eligible Employees who are participants in respect of any fiscal year are
    hereinafter referred to as "Participants"). The Eligible Employees who will
    participate in the Plan for any fiscal year will be designated by the
    Committee in its sole discretion prior to commencement of that fiscal year.

4.  Creation of a Bonus Pool. The Committee shall establish Net Income targets 
    at three levels for each fiscal year. A bonus pool (the "Bonus Pool") will
    be created in respect of any fiscal year in which Net Income exceeds one of
    those target levels. The amount of the Bonus Pool in any such fiscal year
    shall be a percentage of the Net Income of the Company for such year, such
    percentage to be based on which target level of Net Income was achieved. The
    Committee may establish such targets and percentages for a period of years,
    but in all circumstances prior to the commencement of the year to which the
    targets and percentages relate (except in the case of 1994, in which case
    the targets and percentages must be established before April 1, 1994). "Net
    Income" as used in this Plan shall mean net income of the Company as
    reflected in the Company's consolidated audited financial statements for the
    applicable fiscal year.

    The Net Income target for each fiscal year is based on an assumed Federal
    Statutory Tax Rate applicable to the Company of 34%. If the Federal
    Statutory Tax Rate applicable to the Company for any fiscal year is other
    than 34%, then the Net Income targets for such fiscal year shall be adjusted
    based on the same pre-federal tax income amount which could be calculated
    using the stated Net Income targets for such fiscal year (at the assumed 34%
    Federal Statutory Tax Rate) multiplied by the actual Federal Statutory Tax
    Rate for such fiscal year, provided that no adjustment will be made for any
    fiscal year unless the Company's Effective Federal Tax Rate for the fiscal
    year is more than the Company's actual Federal Statutory Tax Rate for such
    fiscal year. If the Federal Statutory Tax Rate applicable to the Company
    changes during a fiscal year, the Net Income target for such year shall be
    adjusted pro-rata for such portion of the fiscal year that each Federal
    Statutory Tax Rate was in effect. "Federal Statutory Tax Rate" as used in
    this Plan shall mean the highest federal marginal tax rate applicable to the
    Company for a stated fiscal year (or portion thereof). "Effective Federal
    Tax Rate" as used in this Plan shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing
    the Company's federal income taxes for a given year by its income before
    federal income taxes for the same year, multiplied by 100.

5.  Allocation. The Bonus Pool created in respect of any fiscal year shall be
    allocated among the Participants in the manner established by the Committee
    prior to the beginning of such fiscal year; provided, however, that the
    Committee in its sole discretion may reduce at any time, including during or
    following the fiscal year, the amount of the bonus payable to any or all
    participants in respect of such fiscal year. No bonus shall be payable to
    any Participant unless he is employed by the Company on the last day of the
    fiscal year, unless the Participant's employment was terminated because of
    his death, disability or retirement after attaining age 55 and the
    completion of 10 years of continuous service with the Company, in which
    event the Participant will be entitled to a pro-rata portion of the bonus
    otherwise payable in respect of that fiscal year, subject to the Committee's
    discretion as set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Any
    portion of the Bonus Pool that is not paid to a Participant in respect of
    any fiscal year shall not be paid to any Eligible Employee.

6.  Certification. Prior to payment of a bonus in respect of a fiscal year, the 
    Committee must certify in writing as to the satisfaction of and compliance
    with the performance goals and other material terms of the Plan for that
    fiscal year.

7.  Amendment or Termination. The Committee may amend or terminate the Plan at 
    any time in its discretion; provided, however, that no amendment or
    termination of the Plan may affect any award made under the Plan prior to
    that time.

8.  Shareholder Approval. The adoption of this Plan is subject to the approval 
    of the shareholders of the Company.

                                 DESCRIPTION OF
                            MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN

    The Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") was adopted by the Executive
Committee of the Company to provide incentive cash compensation to key officers
and other employees of the Company. The Plan applies only to regular full-time
management and administrative employees of the Company at or above a specified
grade level. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is not
eligible to participate in the Plan.

    The Plan establishes a year-end cash payout opportunity, based on the
financial success of the Company and each individual participant's performance.
The payout for each fiscal year is determined based on the Company's final
actual earnings per share and return on assets compared to the budgeted earnings
per share and return on assets. No bonus payment is made if the Company does not
achieve the minimum performance levels in a given fiscal year.

    Each participant in the plan has a targeted bonus percentage based on such
participant's grade level. The targeted bonus percentages range from 12% - 25%
of the participant's base salary for the fiscal year.

    The Company's earnings per share and return on assets performance
establishes a "bonus factor" of between 0% and 225%. For each fiscal year, the
same bonus factor percentage applies to all participants. The actual bonus
amount paid to each participant is calculated by multiplying such participant's
base salary times the targeted bonus percentage times the bonus factor
percentage. Each participant is only eligible to receive a payout under the Plan
if the participant's most recent performance appraisal rating was one of the
three highest categories.

                           WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL, INC.
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN

WHEREAS, Wendy's International, Inc. (the "Company") maintains the Wendy's
International, Inc. Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") and the Wendy's
International, Inc. Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the "Profit Sharing and
Savings Plan") for the benefit of its noncrew employees; and

WHEREAS, the Company provided supplemental excess benefits to certain employees
pursuant to a nonqualified plan known as the Wendy's International, Inc.
Supplemental Retirement Agreement (the "Nonqualified Plan"); and

WHEREAS, as a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Pension Plan and the
Profit Sharing Plan were redesigned and restated, including the restatement of
the Pension Plan as an account balance pension plan (the "Account Balance
Plan"), effective as of January 1, 1989; and

WHEREAS, as a result of the changes, the Nonqualified Plan did not provide
executives at the Company with the benefits that were available under the prior
plans, and the Company adopted the Wendy's International, Inc. Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 1989 (the
"Effective Date"); and

WHEREAS, the Company has decided to further amend and to restate the plan in its
entirety;

NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts the Wendy's International, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 1989
except as otherwise stated herein, as follows:

                     SECTION 1 - DEFINITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

1.1   In General

      The words and phrases, when used herein with initial capital letters,
      except where specifically defined in this Section 1, shall have the
      meanings given to them in the Account Balance Plan or the Profit Sharing
      and Savings Plan, as appropriate, unless the context clearly requires
      otherwise.

1.15  Active Participant

      Active Participant means a Covered Employee who becomes a Participant and
      is not an Inactive Participant.

1.2   Actuarial Assumptions

      The actuarial assumptions used in the determination of a Participant's
      Accrued Benefit under the Account Balance Plan are hereby specifically
      incorporated by reference in this Agreement. The actuarial assumptions
      used to determine the targeted benefit in this Plan shall be interest at
      the rate of seven and one-half percent (71/2%) compounded annually and
      mortality pursuant to the UP 1984 Mortality Table with no setbacks.

1.3   Beneficiary

      Beneficiary shall mean the person or persons designated by the Participant
      in accordance with Section 4.3 to receive any benefits payable under the
      Plan after his death.

1.4   Final Average Compensation

      Final Average Compensation means a Participant's average annual
      Compensation over the five (5) consecutive calendar years while a Covered
      Employee (or the total number of completed calendar years while a Covered
      Employee if less than five (5) out of the last ten (10) completed calendar
      years while a Covered Employee preceding the Participant's attainment of
      age sixty (60) which will provide him with the highest annual average
      Compensation. The continuity of a period used to determine a Participant's
      Final Average Compensation shall be deemed to be uninterrupted by an
      absence during which the Participant is not a Covered Employee which does
      not result in a Break in Service. For purposes of this Section 1.4,
      Compensation shall mean Compensation as defined in the Account Balance
      Plan, except that Compensation in excess of two hundred thousand dollars
      ($200,000) (or such other amount as may be established by the Secretary of
      Treasury from time to time) shall not be disregarded. Also for purposes of
      this Section 1.4 effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1,

      ($150,000) (or such other amount as may be adjusted by the Commissioner
      from time to time) shall not be disregarded.

                                       46
<PAGE>   3
      (a)  An amount which will provide each Participant with a targeted annual 
           benefit payable as a life annuity at his Normal Retirement Date equal
           to the amount obtained, if any, when the sum of (2), (3), (4) and (5)
           below is subtracted from (1) below:

          (1)  Fifty percent (50%) of the Participant's expected Final Average 
               Compensation at age 60 (determined without salary projection)
               multiplied by a fraction, not exceeding one (1), the numerator of
               which is the number of the Participant's expected Years of
               Service at his Normal Retirement Date and the denominator of
               which is fifteen (15).

          (2)  The Participant's expected Accrued Benefit Derived from Company 
               Contributions at his Normal Retirement Date under the Account
               Balance Plan, assuming the Participant elects to make Participant
               Contributions to the Plan until Normal Retirement and that
               interest credited to the Cash Balance Benefit for future years
               will be at the rate of 71/2%, including the Prior Plan Benefit
               and the Minimum Benefit.

          (3)  The Participant's Profit Sharing and Savings Plan Company Matched
               Contribution Account and Company Contribution Account plus any
               prior distributions from such Accounts plus future expected
               Profit Sharing and Savings Plan contributions equal to the
               Participant's Profit Sharing and Savings Plan contribution for
               the Plan Year, when projected for the number of years from the
               earlier of the distribution of such Accounts to the Participant
               or the date of this calculation to the Participant's Normal
               Retirement Age at an interest rate of seven and one-half percent
               (71/2%) compounded annually. In the event that such Profit
               Sharing and Savings Plan Accounts are distributed to the
               Participant on different dates, then this projection shall be
               applied separately to each distribution based upon the specific
               dates of distribution. The total projected value shall be
               converted to a life annuity payable at Normal Retirement Date,
               using the interest rate published by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
               Corporation for use in calculating immediate annuities which is
               in effect on the first day of the Plan Year.

          (4)  The Participant's Supplemental Profit Sharing Account projected 
               and converted to a life annuity payable at his Normal Retirement
               Date in the same manner as the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
               Accounts in (3) above.

          (5)  The amount of the retirement income the Participant is entitled 
               to receive pursuant to the Supplemental Retirement Agreement
               under the Nonqualified Plan.

      (b)  An amount equal to the interest rate applied to the Cash Balance 
           Benefit for the Plan Year in the Account Balance Plan applied to the
           amount in the Participant's Supplemental Target Account as of the
           first day of the Plan Year.

3.2   Credits and Charges to Supplemental Profit Sharing Account

      The Company shall credit or charge, as applicable, to each Participant's 
      Supplemental Profit Sharing Accounts the following amounts:

      (a)  For each Plan Year during which the Participant is an Active 
           Participant in the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, the amount by
           which: 

           (1)  The amount of Employer Contributions which the Company would 
                have allocated to the Active Participant's Accounts under the
                Profit Sharing and Savings Plan without regard to the maximum
                annual limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Code or the
                limitation on compensation imposed by Section 401(a) (17) of the
                Code; exceeds

           (2)  The actual amount of Employer Contributions which the Company 
                allocates to the Active Participant's Accounts under the Profit
                Sharing and Savings Plan.

      (b)  For each Plan Year during which the Participant is an Active 
           Participant, an Inactive Participant or a Former Participant in the
           Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, an amount equal to the net gain (or
           net loss) that would have been credited (or charged) had the amounts
           allocated to the Participant's Supplemental Plan Accounts been
           invested in a manner similar to the investment of his dollars under
           the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan during a similar time frame.

           For any period of time that a Participant has no current account
           balance under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, his Supplemental
           Plan Accounts shall be treated as though they had been invested in
           the default fund (as referenced in Section 16.01 of the Profit
           Sharing and Savings Plan document, or any successor section thereto)
           under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan for such period of time.

3.3   Cash Election

      Each Active Participant who is projected to have five (5) or more Years of
      Service by the end of the Plan Year may elect, prior to notification of
      the Target Credit (as determined under Section 3.1(a) above), for such
      Plan Year to receive in cash the amount that would otherwise be credited
      to his Supplemental Target Account on the last day of such Plan Year.
      Payment of the vested Target Credits, which were elected to be taken as
      cash, shall be paid by the end of the month following the last day of the
      Plan Year for which the dollars are credited.

3.4   Termination Benefit

      If a Participant's employment is terminated for any reason on or after his
      Normal Retirement Age, after incurring a Total and Permanent Disability,
      as a result of death or after completing five (5) Years of Service, such
      Participant (or his Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death)
      shall be entitled to receive a benefit, payable in accordance with Section
      4, equal to the balance of his Supplemental Target Account and
      Supplemental Profit Sharing Accounts. If a Participant's employment is
      terminated for any reason prior to the earliest of attaining his Normal
      Retirement Age, incurring a Total and Permanent Disability the date of his
      death or completing five (5) years of Service, then notwithstanding any
      contrary provision in this Plan, neither the Participant nor his
      Beneficiary shall be entitled to any benefits under this Plan.

                         SECTION 4 - PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

4.1   Form of Payment

      Payment of benefits under this Plan shall be made to the Participant (or
      his Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death after the
      commencement of the payment of benefits but prior to the full payment of
      his benefits) in substantially equal annual installments over a period, to
      be determined by the Committee, not exceeding the joint and last survivor
      life expectancies of the Participant and his spouse; provided, however,
      that if a Participant dies prior to the commencement of payment, his
      benefits shall be paid to his Beneficiary in one (1) lump sum.

4.2   Time of Payment

      Participants shall not be entitled to receive payments of benefits under
      the Plan prior to termination of employment, except as otherwise set forth
      in this Section 4.2. Payment of benefits under this Plan shall commence as
      of the first day of the calendar year coincident with or immediately
      following an Inactive Participant's attainment of age sixty-five (65) or
      at an earlier date, as determined by the Committee; provided, however,
      that if a Participant dies or incurs a Total and Permanent Disability
      prior to the commencement of payment, his benefits shall be paid as soon
      as practicable following the date of death or disability.

4.3   Designation of Beneficiary

      Each Participant shall designate, by giving a written designation in
      approved form to the Plan Administrator, a Beneficiary to receive any
      benefits which may become or continue to be payable upon or after his
      death under this Plan. Successive designations may be made, and the last
      designation determined to not be illegal or ineffective received by the
      Plan Administrator prior to the death of the Participant shall be
      effective and shall revoke all prior designations.

      If no Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of the death of the
      Participant, or if no Beneficiary so designated survives the Participant,
      then his benefits shall be paid to the surviving members of the following
      classes of persons, in the order listed, in equal shares among members of
      a class:

      (a)  The Participant's surviving spouse;

      (b)  The lineal descendants of the Participant, including legally adopted
           children and stepchildren;

      (c)  The Participant's surviving parents; or

      (d)  The Participant's estate.

      If a Participant designates a child as his Beneficiary or if benefits will
      be payable to a Participant's child under Section 4.3(b) above, all
      payments shall be made to the child's legal guardian unless the child has
      reached the age of majority.

4.4   Participants' Rights to Payment

      All benefits under this Plan will be paid from the general assets of the
      Company. The Company is not obligated to set aside specific assets for
      payment of sums due under this Plan but may reserve on its books such sums
      as it deems necessary to provide the benefits hereunder. Since no separate
      fund will be established, such sums will remain the sole property of the
      Company and will continue to be subject to the claims of the Company's
      creditors. The Participant shall not have the power to direct the Company
      with respect to the investment of any amounts accrued on his behalf. The
      right of the Participant to receive distributions hereunder shall be an
      unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company and the
      Participant shall not have any rights in or against any security or other
      asset acquired by the Company with any amount accrued on his behalf.

                           SECTION 5 - ADMINISTRATION

      The Company shall appoint one (1) or more individuals to serve as a
      Committee to act as its agent or delegate in carrying out its
      administrative duties under the Plan. The Committee shall act by a
      majority of its members. Any and all determinations, actions or decisions
      of the Company and Committee with respect to the administration of the
      Plan, including without limitation the determination of benefit
      eligibility and interpretation of Plan provisions, shall be final and
      conclusive and binding upon all parties having an interest in the Plan.
      All costs of administering the Plan will be paid by the Company.

                        SECTION 6 - PARTICIPANTS' RIGHTS

      Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of
      employment between the Company and any Participant or as a right of any
      Participant to be continued in the employment of the Company or as a
      limitation of the rights of the Company to discharge any Participant with
      or without cause.

                           SECTION 7 - INALIENABILITY

      No benefit payable under this Plan shall be subject in any manner to
      anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance
      or charge prior to actual receipt thereof by the payee, and any attempt so
      to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or
      charge prior to such receipt shall be void; nor shall the Company be in
      any manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities,
      engagements or torts of any Participant or Beneficiary, except as may be
      required by the tax withholding provision of the Internal Revenue Code or
      any state's income tax act.

                      SECTION 8 - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

      The Company may amend or terminate the Plan at any time by action of its
      Board of Directors or a committee thereof without the consent of any
      Participant. However, in the event of the amendment or termination of the
      Plan, any benefit accrued to such date shall not be reduced or forfeited.

                           SECTION 9 - APPLICABLE LAW

      To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the provisions of this Plan
      shall be construed and applied in accordance with the laws of the State of
      Ohio.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed
      by its duly authorized officer this 27th day of December 1995.

                        WENDY'S WESHARE STOCK OPTION PLAN
                  (REFLECTS AMENDMENTS THROUGH AUGUST 3, 1995)

SECTION 1. PURPOSE. This Wendy's WeShare Stock Option Plan (hereinafter referred
to as the "Plan") is intended as a means whereby employees (hereinafter referred
to as "Employee" or "Employees" and "Optionee" or "Optionees") of Wendy's
International, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") or its
subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the "Subsidiaries") can each enlarge
his proprietary interest in the Company, thereby encouraging the judgment,
initiative and efforts of the Employees for the successful conduct of the
Company's business. The Plan is also intended to create common interests between
the Employees and the other shareholders of the Company, and to assist the
Company in attracting, retaining and motivating Employees.

SECTION 2. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall appoint a Compensation Committee (hereinafter referred to as the
"Committee") of not less than three (3) directors to administer the Plan. The
members of the Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board, which shall
have the power at any time, or from time to time, to remove members from the
Committee or to add members thereto. All members of the Committee shall be
qualified to administer the Plan as contemplated by Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 16b-3, as amended or superseded from time to time. The Committee
shall construe and interpret the Plan, establish such operating guidelines and
rules as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan and make
such determinations and take such other action in connection with the Plan as it
deems necessary and advisable. It shall determine the individuals to whom and
the time or times at which Options shall be granted, the number of shares to be
subject to each Option, the Option price and the duration of leaves of absence
which may be granted to participants without constituting a termination of their
employment for purposes of the Plan. Any such construction, interpretation,
rule, determination or other action taken by the Committee pursuant to the Plan
shall be final, binding and conclusive on all interested parties, including the
Company, its Subsidiaries and all former, present and future Employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

Actions by a majority of the Committee at a meeting at which a quorum is
present, or actions approved in writing by all of the members of the Committee,
shall be the valid acts of the Committee. No member of the Board of Directors or
the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith
with respect to the Plan or any Option granted under it.

The Committee shall have no authority to make any adjustment (other than in
connection with a stock dividend, recapitalization or other transaction where an
adjustment is permitted or required under the terms of this Plan) or amendment
of the exercise price of an option previously granted under this Plan, whether
through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, or other means, unless
the Company's shareholders shall have approved such adjustment or amendment.

SECTION 3. MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN. Subject to any adjustment
as provided in the Plan, the shares to be offered under the Plan may be, in
whole or in part, authorized but unissued Common Shares of the Company, or
issued Common Shares which shall have been reacquired by the Company and held by
it as treasury shares. The aggregate number of Common Shares to be delivered
upon exercise of all Options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 4,600,000,
plus the amount of any additional Common Shares which may result from any share
distributions effected after the approval of this Plan by the Board of Directors
of the Company. If any Option granted hereunder shall expire or terminate for
any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares with
respect thereto shall again be available for other Options to be granted under
the Plan unless the Plan shall have been terminated.

SECTION 4. SELECTION OF OPTIONEES. All those Employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee shall be
eligible to participate in the Plan, provided, however, that no Employee may be
granted Options in the aggregate which would result in that Employee receiving
more than ten percent of the maximum number of shares available for issuance
under the Plan. Any person who has been granted an Option under a prior stock
option plan of the Company may be granted an additional Option or Options under
the Plan if the Committee shall so determine.

SECTION 5. OPTION PRICE. The purchase price for the shares covered by each
Option granted shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair
market value of the shares on the date of the grant of the Option. Such fair
market value shall be equal to the mean of the high and low prices at which
Common Shares of the Company are traded on the New York Stock Exchange on such
date.

SECTION 6. OPTION REQUIREMENTS. The Options granted pursuant to the Plan shall
be authorized by the Committee and shall be evidenced in writing in a form
approved by the Committee and shall include the following terms and conditions:

      (a)   Optionee. Each Option shall state the name of the Optionee.


                                       50
<PAGE>   2
       (b)  Number of Shares. Each Option shall state the number of shares to
            which that Option pertains.

       (c)  Purchase Price. Each Option shall state the Option price, which 
            shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market
            value of the shares covered by such Option on the date of grant of
            such Option. See Section 5, Option Price, and Section 28, date of
            grant.

       (d)  Payment. The purchase price for the Options being exercised must be
            paid in full at the time of exercise in a manner acceptable to the
            Committee. In addition, in order to enable the Company to meet any
            applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local
            withholding tax requirements, an Optionee shall also be required to
            pay the amount of tax to be withheld at the time of exercise. No
            Common Shares will be delivered to any Optionee until all such
            amounts have been paid.

       (e)  Length of Option. Each Option shall be granted for a period to be
            determined by the Committee but in no event to exceed more than ten
            (10) years. However, subject to Sections 9 and 10, each Option shall
            be exercisable only during such portion of its term as the Committee
            shall determine, and only if the Optionee is employed by the Company
            or a Subsidiary of the Company at the time of such exercise.

       (f)  EXercise of Option. With respect to the Options offered pursuant to
            the Plan to an Employee who is subject to Section 16 of the
            Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Section 16 of the Exchange Act"),
            no option can be exercised for at least six (6) months after the
            date of grant except in the case of death or disability as set forth
            in Section 10 where the Option is otherwise exercisable. Otherwise,
            each Optionee shall have the right to exercise his or her Option in
            the manner specified in this Plan or in the agreement evidencing
            granting of such Option.

SECTION 7. METHOD OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS. Each Option shall be exercised
pursuant to the terms of such Option and pursuant to the terms of the Plan by
giving written notice to the Company at its principal place of business or other
address designated by the Company, accompanied by cash, check, shares, or other
property acceptable to the Committee, in payment of the Option price for the
number of shares specified and paid for. From time to time the Committee may
establish procedures relating to effecting such exercises. No fractional shares
shall be issued as a result of exercising an Option. The Company shall make
delivery of such shares as soon as possible; provided, however, that if any law
or regulation requires the Company to take action with respect to the shares
specified in such notice before issuance thereof, the date of delivery of such
shares shall then be extended for the period necessary to take such action.

SECTION 8. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS. Except as set forth in Section 10, an
Option is exercisable during an Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee. The
Options shall not be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and shall terminate as provided in this Plan.

SECTION 9. EARLIER TERMINATION OF OPTIONS. Except as set forth in Section 10,
upon the termination of the Optionee's employment for any reason whatsoever, the
Options will terminate as to all shares covered by Options which have not been
exercised as of the date of such termination.

SECTION 10.

       (a)  EXERCISE UPON DEATH OR DISABILITY. In the event an Optionee dies
            while employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then all Options held
            by the Optionee shall become immediately exercisable as of the date
            of death and the estate of the deceased Optionee shall have the
            right to exercise any rights the Optionee would otherwise have under
            this Plan for a period of one year after the date of the Optionee's
            death, with exercise to be made as set forth in Section 7.

            In the event an Optionee becomes Disabled while employed by the
            Company or a Subsidiary, then all Options held by the Optionee shall
            become immediately exercisable as of the date the Optionee becomes
            Disabled, and the Optionee (or, in the event the Optionee is
            incapacitated and unable to exercise Options, the Optionee's legal
            guardian or legal representative whom the Committee deems
            appropriate based on applicable facts and circumstances) shall have
            the right to exercise any rights the Optionee would otherwise have
            under this Plan for a period of one year after the date the Optionee
            becomes Disabled, with exercise to be made as set forth in Section
            7.

       (b)  EXERCISE UPON RETIREMENT. In the event an Optionee's employment with
            the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated by reason of the
            Optionee's retirement, the Optionee shall have the right to exercise
            any rights the Optionee would otherwise have under this Plan for a
            period of 48 months after the date the Optionee retires with
            exercise to be made as set forth in Section 7. For purposes of this
            Section 10(b), "retirement" shall mean termination of employment at
            or after attaining age 55 with at least ten (10) years of service
            (as defined in the Company's qualified retirement plans), other than
            by reason of death or Disability or for cause.


                                       51
<PAGE>   3
    (c)  EXERCISE UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IN CONNECTION WITH A 
         DISPOSITION OF RESTAURANTS. In the event an Optionee's employment with
         the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated without cause in
         connection with a disposition of one or more restaurants by the Company
         or its Subsidiaries, the Optionee shall have the right to exercise any
         rights the Optionee would otherwise have under this Plan for a period
         of one year following the Optionee's termination of employment, with
         exercise to be made as set forth in Section 7.

SECTION 11. LIMITATION ON SALE OF COMMON SHARES OFFERED PURSUANT TO PLAN. With
respect to the Common Shares offered pursuant to the Plan to an Employee who is
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, such Common Shares cannot be sold for
at least six (6) months after acquisition, except in the case of death or
Disability.

SECTION 12. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. The Options granted under the Plan
shall be non-qualified stock options.

SECTION 13. EFFECT OF CHANGE IN COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. In the event
any dividend upon the Common Shares payable in shares is declared by the
Company, or in case of any subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common
Shares, the aggregate number of Common Shares to be delivered upon exercise of
all Options granted under the Plan shall be increased or decreased
proportionately so that there will be no change in the aggregate purchase price
payable upon the exercise of the Option. In the event of any other
recapitalization or any reorganization, merger, consolidation or any change in
the corporate structure or stock of the Company, the Committee shall make such
adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate to reflect accurately the terms
of the Option as to the number and kind of shares deliverable upon subsequent
exercising of the Option and in the Option prices under the Option.

SECTION 14. LISTING AND REGISTRATION OF COMMON SHARES. If at any time the
Committee shall determine that listing, registration or qualification of the
Common Shares covered by the Option upon any securities exchange or under any
state or federal law or the consent or the approval of any governmental
regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of or in connection
with the purchase of Common Shares under the Option, the Option may not be
exercised in whole or in part unless and until such listing, registration,
qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of
any conditions not acceptable to the Committee. Any person exercising an Option
shall make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as
the Committee may request to assure compliance with the foregoing or any other
applicable legal requirements.

SECTION 15. NO OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE OPTION. The granting of an Option shall
impose no obligation upon the Optionee to exercise such Option.

SECTION 16. MISCONDUCT. In the event that an Optionee has (i) used for profit or
disclosed to unauthorized persons, confidential information or trade secrets of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) breached any contract with or violated
any fiduciary obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) engaged in
unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of
another company based on information gained as a result of that Optionee's
employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries, then that Optionee shall
forfeit all rights to any unexercised Options granted under the Plan and all of
that Optionee's outstanding Options shall automatically terminate and lapse,
unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.

SECTION 17. FOREIGN EMPLOYEES. Without amending the Plan, the Committee may
grant Options to eligible Employees who are foreign nationals on such terms and
conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may in the judgment of
the Committee be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the
purposes of the Plan, and, in furtherance of such purposes, the Committee may
make such modifications, amendments, procedures, and the like as may be
necessary or advisable to comply with provisions of laws of other countries in
which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate or have employees.

SECTION 18. BUY OUT OF OPTION GAINS. At any time after any Option becomes
exercisable, the Committee shall have the right to elect, in its sole discretion
and without the consent of the holder thereof, to cancel such Option and pay to
the Optionee the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares covered by
such Option over the Option price of such Option at the date the Committee
provides written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of the intention to exercise such
right. Buy outs pursuant to this provision shall be effected by the Company as
promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice. Payments of buy out
amounts may be made in cash, in Common Shares, or partly in cash and partly in
Common Shares, as the Committee deems advisable. To the extent payment is made
in Common Shares, the number of shares shall be determined by dividing the
amount of the payment to be made by the fair market value of a Common Share at
the date of the Buy Out Notice. In no event shall the Company be required to
deliver a fractional Common Share in satisfaction of this buy out provision.
Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of any applicable
foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes. For the
purposes of this Section 18, fair market value shall be equal to the mean of the
high and low prices at which Common Shares of the Company are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange on the relevant date.


                                       52
<PAGE>   4
SECTION 19. NO RIGHTS TO OPTIONS OR EMPLOYMENT. No Employee or other person
shall have any claim or right to be granted an Option under the Plan. Having
received an Option under the Plan shall not give an Employee any right to
receive any other grant under the Plan. An Optionee shall have no rights to or
interest in any Option except as set forth herein. Neither the Plan nor any
action taken herein shall be construed as giving any Employee any right to be
retained in the employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 20. MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, ETC. In the event that the Company is a party
to a plan or agreement for merger or consolidation or reclassification of its
securities or the exchange of its securities for the securities of another
person which has acquired the Company's assets or which is in control (as
defined in Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of a
person which has acquired the Company's assets, where the terms of such plan or
agreement are binding upon all shareholders of the Company, except to the extent
that dissenting shareholders may be entitled to relief under Section 1701.85 of
the Ohio Revised Code, then Options granted and outstanding pursuant to the Plan
for more than six (6) months, notwithstanding the date of exercise fixed in the
grant of such Options, shall become immediately exercisable and each Optionee
shall be entitled to receive, upon payment of the amount required for exercise
of each Option, securities or cash consideration, or both, equal to those the
Optionee would have been entitled to receive under such plan or agreement if the
Optionee had already exercised such Option.

SECTION 21. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. The Board of Directors may amend or
terminate the Plan at any time, provided that the Board of Directors shall not
(except as provided in Sections 9, 10 and 13 hereof) make any change in the
Options which will impair the rights of the Optionee therein, without the
consent of the Optionee. No option shall be granted hereunder after December 31,
1999.

SECTION 22. OTHER ACTIONS. This Plan shall not restrict the authority of the
Committee, the Board of Directors or of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
proper corporate purposes to grant or assume stock options, other than under the
Plan, to or with respect to any Employee or other person.

SECTION 23. COSTS AND EXPENSES. Except as provided in Section 6(d) hereof with
respect to taxes, the costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be
borne by the Company, and shall not be charged to any grant nor to any Employee
receiving a grant.

SECTION 24. PLAN UNFUNDED. The Plan shall be unfunded. Except for reserving a
sufficient number of authorized shares to the extent required by law to meet the
requirements of the Plan, the Company shall not be required to establish any
special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure
payment of any grant under the Plan.

SECTION 25. LAWS GOVERNING PLAN. This Plan shall be construed under and governed
by the laws of the State of Ohio.

SECTION 26. CAPTIONS. The captions to the several sections hereof are not a part
of this Plan, but are merely guides or labels to assist in locating and reading
the several sections hereof.

SECTION 27. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Plan shall become effective on the date it is
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

SECTION 28. DEFINITIONS. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
following terms, when used in this Plan, shall have the meaning set forth below:

    (a)  The "date of grant" or "grant date" of an Option shall be the date on 
         which an Option is granted under the Plan.

    (b)  "Option" means the right granted under the Plan to an Optionee to 
         purchase a Common Share of the Company at a fixed price for a specified
         period of time.

    (c)  "Option price" means the price at which a Common Share covered by an 
         Option granted hereunder may be purchased.

    (d)  With regard to any particular Employee, "Disabled" shall have the 
         meaning set forth in the Company's long term disability program
         applicable to such Employee.

                                   EXHIBIT 99
     SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (he "Act") provides a "safe
harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide
prospective information about their companies, so long as those statements are
identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary
statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those discussed in the statement. The Company desires to
take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Act. Certain information,
particularly information regarding future economic performance and finances and
plans and objectives of management, contained, or incorporated by reference, in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 1995 is
forward-looking. In some cases, information regarding certain important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from any such
forward-looking statement appear together with such statement. Also, the
following factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could 
affect the Company's actual results and cause such results to differ materially
from those expressed in forward-looking statements:

Competition. The quick-service restaurant industry is intensely competitive with
respect to price, service, location, personnel, and type and quality of food.
The Company and its franchisees compete with international, regional and local
organizations primarily through the quality, variety and value perception of
food products offered. The number and location of units, quality and speed of
service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and
marketing programs are also important factors. The Company anticipates that
intense competition will continue to focus on pricing, and certain of the
Company's competitors have substantially larger marketing budgets.

Economic, Market and Other Conditions. The quick-service restaurant industry is
affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions,
consumer preferences and spending patterns, demographic trends, consumer
perceptions of food safety, weather, traffic patterns and the type, number and
location of competing restaurants. Factors such as inflation, food costs, labor
and benefit costs, legal claims, and the availability of management and hourly
employees also affect restaurant operations and administrative expenses. The
ability of the Company and its franchisees to finance new restaurant
development, improvements and additions to existing restaurants and the
acquisition of restaurants from, and sale of restaurants to, franchisees, is
affected by economic conditions, including interest rates and other government
policies impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of
borrowed funds.

Importance of Locations. The success of Company and franchised restaurants is
dependent in substantial part on location. There can be no assurance that
current locations will continue to be attractive, as demographic patterns
change. It is possible the neighborhood or economic conditions where restaurants
are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced
sales in those locations.

Government Regulation. The Company and its franchisees are subject to various
federal, state and local laws affecting their business. The development and
operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and
acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use,
environmental, traffic and other regulations. Restaurant operations are also
subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to
health, sanitation and safety standards, federal and state labor laws (including
applicable minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions,
and citizenship requirements), federal and state laws which prohibit
discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities,
such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The operation of the
Company's franchisee system is also subject to regulation enacted by a number of
states and rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. The Company cannot
predict the effect on its operations, particularly on its relationship with
franchisees, of the future enactment of additional legislation regulating the
franchise relationship.

Growth Plans. The Company plans to significantly increase the number of
systemwide Wendy's and Tim Hortons restaurants open or under construction. There
can be no assurance that the Company or its franchisees will be able to achieve
growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable.
The opening and success of restaurants depends on various factors, including the
identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations,
sales levels at existing restaurants, the negotiation of acceptable lease or
purchase terms for new locations, permitting and regulatory compliance, the
ability to meet construction schedules, the financial and other development
capabilities of franchisees, the ability of the Company to hire and train
qualified management personnel, and general economic and business conditions.

International Operations. The Company's business outside of the United States is
subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and
political conditions, differing cultures and consumer preferences, currency
regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems,
the availability and cost of land and construction costs, and the availability
of experienced management and appropriate franchisees and joint venture
partners. Although the Company believes it has developed the support structure
required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will
occur or that international operations will be profitable.
