                                  PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

   Willamette Industries, Inc. ("Willamette" or the "Company"), was founded
in 1906 as the Willamette Valley Lumber Co. in Dallas, Oregon.  In 1967,
Willamette Valley Lumber Co. and several related firms merged to form
Willamette.  The Company's stock has been publicly traded since 1968.

   Willamette is a diversified, integrated forest products company with 89
plants and mills manufacturing containerboard, bag paper, fine paper,
bleached hardwood market pulp, specialty printing papers, corrugated
containers, business forms, cut sheet paper, paper bags, inks, lumber,
plywood, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, laminated beams and
other value-added wood products.  It owns or controls 1,206,000 acres of
forests.
  
   Willamette is a medium-sized firm in a very competitive industry
consisting of thousands of companies, some larger and more diversified;
others much smaller, producing only one or two products.  Very competitive
conditions exist in every industry segment in which Willamette operates. 
The Company competes in its markets primarily through price, quality and
service.

   The Company believes its strengths are its vertical integration; its
geographically diverse, modern, fiber- and energy-efficient facilities; its
concentration on a focused, related product range; its balance among
building materials, white paper and brown paper manufacturing and an
organizational structure that encourages teamwork as well as individual
initiative.

Business Segment Information

   The Company has two business segments.  The Paper Group segment
manufactures and sells pulp and paper products.  The Building Materials
Group segment manufactures and sells wood products.  Sales and operating
data for the Paper Group and Building Materials Group segments for the past
five years is set forth in the five year comparison captioned
"Supplementary Business Segment Information" below.  The Company has no
foreign operations and is not dependent on any one significant customer or
group of customers.  Approximately 96% of the Company's total output is
sold domestically.

Pulp and Paper

Bleached pulp and fine paper.
   The Company manufactures bleached hardwood market pulp, which is sold to
outside customers, at Hawesville, Kentucky; and fine paper at Hawesville;
Marlboro County, South Carolina; and Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania.  In 1993,
the Company made 4.9% of the nation's bleached hardwood market pulp and
accounted for 4.9% of the nation's fine paper production.

   Chips from nearby sawmills and plywood plants serve as the primary fiber
source for the bleached pulp manufacturing facility.  Willamette's 
timberlands in Tennessee and the Carolinas also serve as a source of fiber
for the facility.

                                   - 1 -<PAGE>
Containerboard and bag paper.
   The Company's four paper mills manufactured 4.2% of the nation's 1993
production of linerboard, corrugating medium and bag paper.  All of the
production was used or traded for the needs of Willamette's box and bag
manufacturing plants.

   In Louisiana, the Company's sawmills, plywood plants and timberlands can
provide 100% of the chips needed by its linerboard mill; in Oregon,
approximately 80% of the Company's chip requirements could be provided from
those sources.

   Recycled fiber, in the form of used corrugated containers, provided
53.5% of the Company's 1993 fiber needs.


Converted Paper Products

Office papers.
   The Company's six business forms plants manufactured 4.4% of the
nation's 1993 production of forms.  These forms, mostly long-run continuous
computer forms, along with Willcopy(R), Willamette's photocopy and cut
sheet printer paper produced at its three cut sheet facilities, are
marketed by 47 Willamette sales and distribution centers.  The Company's
cut sheets represented 5.2% of the nation's 1993 production.

Corrugated containers.
   Corrugated containers manufactured by the Company's 31 corrugated
container plants accounted for 5.5% of the nation's 1993 corrugated box
production.  Products range from colorful store displays to eye-catching
preprinted boxes; from sturdy wax coated shipping containers to the plain
brown box.  Corrugated containers are marketed by Willamette's own sales
force to a variety of industrial and agricultural customers.

Bags.
   In 1993, the Company's five bag plants made 12.0% of the nation's paper
bags. Bags are marketed to grocery, department, drug and hardware stores in
the West and South by the Company's sales force.

Building Materials

Plywood and lumber.
   Plywood products, totaling 7.3% of the nation's 1993 production, are
manufactured at the Company's 11 plants in Arkansas, the Carolinas,
Louisiana and Oregon.

   Six Company sawmills manufactured 1.3% of the nation's 1993 lumber
production.  

   Lumber and plywood products are marketed through independent wholesalers
and distributors throughout the U.S.

Composite board.
   Five Company particleboard plants in Louisiana and Oregon manufactured
14.4% of the nation's particleboard production in 1993.  The Company's two
medium density fiberboard plants in Arkansas and South Carolina made 18.9%
of the nation's MDF in 1993.  These plants produce value-added products
including color-coated, woodgrain-printed, fire-rated and moisture-
resistant boards.

                                   - 2 -<PAGE>
   Composite board products are sold nationwide through distributors, as
well as directly to cabinet and furniture manufacturers.

Laminated beams.
   The Company's two laminated beam plants in Oregon accounted for 26.4% of
the nation's 1993 production.  Laminated beams, both stock and custom made,
are sold nationwide and internationally.

Timberlands

   Willamette's 1,206,000 acres of timberland enable the Company to supply
approximately 40% of its long-term log needs.  The remainder is purchased
through government and private timber sales and open market purchases.

   In Oregon, the Company is able to provide approximately 60% of its
current log needs from its own timberlands.  The Company's Oregon plywood
plant and sawmills have operated at reduced levels because of the scarcity
of logs resulting from preservationist pressures that virtually halted
federal timber sales in the state.  Unless the federal timber supply crisis
is resolved in a meaningful way, further curtailment of Oregon operations
will be necessary to improve the Company's self sufficiency.

   The Company now owns or controls cutting rights on 564,000 acres in
Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas; 328,000 acres in Oregon; 188,000 acres in
Tennessee; and 126,000 acres in the Carolinas.  Willamette  continually
looks for opportunities to expand its fee timber base and make purchases
when it is profitable to do so.

Energy

   Through cogeneration, the burning of waste materials and the recycling
of spent pulping liquors, Willamette's manufacturing facilities are able to
generate 62% of their total energy needs.

Employees

  The Company employed approximately 12,040 people on December 31, 1993, of
whom about 52% are represented by unions with which the Company has
collective bargaining agreements.  Contracts covering approximately
2,000 hourly employees were negotiated in 1993.  Contracts involving about
1,335 hourly employees are subject to renewal in 1994.  In excess of 45% of
all salaried employees have been with the Company for more than 12 years.

Environmental Matters

   See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations--Other Matters" for a discussion of the effect on the
Company of laws relating to environmental matters.

Timberlands." 

Item 3.  Legal proceedings

     In August 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") issued
a notice of violation to the Company, claiming that the particulate
emissions from the Company's hog fuel boiler at its Marlboro County, South
Carolina, pulp and paper mill were excessive.  The EPA has initially
proposed that the Company pay a civil penalty of $1,231,000 for the alleged
violations and requested the Company to respond to this proposal.  The
Company's capital expenditure budget includes funds for upgraded pollution
control equipment designed to reduce the emissions from the boiler to the
permitted level.  The EPA has agreed that the Company may continue
operating the boiler with existing controls until the new equipment is
installed.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

   Paper products markets tend to follow general economic conditions.  The
sales and earnings of the building materials business are closely related to
new housing starts, remodeling activity and to the availability and terms of
financing for construction.  The cost of wood fiber, the basic raw material for
both industry segments, is sensitive to various supply and demand factors,
including environmental issues affecting log supply.

Results of Operations 1993 vs. 1992

   Net sales increased 10.5% in 1993 compared to 1992.  Paper product sales
increased 7.6%.  Volume increases were experienced in all paper product lines
with the exception of bleached market pulp.  The acquisition of eleven
corrugated container facilities in June 1992 and the resulting full year's
sales in 1993 accounted for nearly all of the increase in paper product sales. 
Excess industry production capacity and weak foreign markets more than offset
improvements in the domestic economy resulting in continued price declines in
all paper product lines with the exception of small increases for fine paper
and cut sheets. 

   Building materials sales increased 15.4% compared with 1992 as average sales
price realizations increased for all building materials product lines and, most
significantly, for lumber products whose average sales price realizations
increased approximately 34.0%.  Sales volumes increased in composite board
panels but decreased in lumber and plywood products 7.0% and 3.5%,
respectively, because of reduced operating levels resulting from the lack of
logs.  As the federal government owns nearly 60% of the commercial timberland
in Oregon, preservationist pressures that have stopped federal timber sales
have caused a significant reduction in available timber supply.  State and
private timber supply is inadequate to fill the shortfall.  This in turn has
resulted in many mill closures at a time when product demand is increasing,
creating supply-related pressures on lumber and plywood prices.

   Currently the Company is able to provide about 60% of its Oregon log needs
from its own timberlands.  Further curtailment of Oregon operations will be
necessary to improve Willamette's self-sufficiency if there is no meaningful
resolution to the federal timber supply crisis.

   Gross profit margins increased to 16.4% in 1993 from 15.4% of sales in 1992. 
Gross profit margins for paper have decreased to 11.6% from 14.8% in 1992
reflecting continued poor pricing for paper products.  Building materials gross
profit margins increased to 23.9% from 16.3% in 1992 primarily due to increased
average sales price realizations in all building materials product lines.  At
the same time, however, costs for open market logs continue to increase due to
supply factors.   

   Selling and administrative expenses declined to 6.7% of sales in 1993
compared to 7.0% in 1992.  The decrease is primarily due to additional sales
volume.

   Interest expense has declined 4.7% to $63.3 million in 1993 from $66.4
million in 1992.  Gross interest expense increased $5.4 million in 1993 over
the comparable amount in 1992 as the Company's average outstanding debt 
increased $129.5 million.  However, capitalized interest increased to $15.9
million in 1993 compared to $7.4 million in 1992 which more than offset the
increase in gross interest expense.  In addition, the impact of increased debt 

                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>
has been minimized by an overall reduction of effective interest rates.  The
weighted average interest rate was 7.31% at December 31, 1993 compared with
8.56% at December 31, 1992.
   
Results of Operations 1992 vs. 1991

   Net sales increased 18.4% in 1992 compared to 1991.  Paper product sales
increased 9.5% from 1991 as unit volume shipped increased for all paper product
lines with the exception of grocery bags and specialty papers.  Eleven
corrugated facilities acquired on June 30, 1992 accounted for 61.5% of the
increase in paper product sales.  A slowly recovering national economy and
excess industry capacity resulted in low price levels for all paper product
lines throughout 1992.

   Building materials sales increased 36.6% from 1991 with a number of factors
accounting for the significant increase.  The acquisition of Bohemia Inc. in
September, 1991 contributed a full year's sales in 1992 versus only three
months' in 1991.  In addition, lumber and plywood markets were relatively
strong throughout 1992 with significant price increases occurring in the last
half of the year.  Overall average sales price realizations for lumber and
plywood increased 23.4% in 1992 over 1991. 

   Gross profit margins increased to 15.4% of sales in 1992 as compared with
14.4% in 1991.  Gross profit margins for paper products have decreased to 14.8%
from 16.7% in 1991, reflecting poor pricing conditions for paper products,
especially bleached paper products.  Poor market conditions resulted in a
nearly two-week closure of the uncoated free sheet specialty mill in
Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania ending January 4, 1993.  Building materials gross
profit margins increased to 16.3% from 9.6% in 1991, primarily due to strong
markets for lumber and plywood in 1992.  Costs for open market logs in Oregon
increased significantly in 1992 due to the reduced supply of federal timber
available.

   Selling and administrative costs were 7.0% of net sales in 1992 compared
with 7.2% in 1991, primarily due to increased sales volume.  Overall selling
and administrative costs have increased 15.0% largely as a result of new
facilities added in 1992.

   Other income (expense) declined to an expense of $1.7 million in 1992 versus
$7.1 million in 1991, primarily because 1991 included a charge of $3.0 million
for the closure of an Oregon plywood plant.

   Interest expense increased 5.0% to $66.4 million in 1992 from $63.3 million
in 1991.  The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $150 million, 9.0%
thirty-year debentures in October 1991 and $100 million, 7.75% ten-year notes
in July 1992.  Partially offsetting this increase, capitalized interest
increased to $7.4 million in 1992 as compared with $.7 million in 1991.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Willamette generates funds internally via net earnings and non-cash charges
against earnings such as depreciation, cost of fee timber harvested and
deferred income taxes.  Funds generated externally have generally been through
debt financing.

   In 1993, cash flow from operating activities was $298.6 million and
represents an increase of 14.6% over comparable cash flows in 1992 primarily
due to additional net earnings, depreciation and deferred income taxes.  

                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>
   A number of long-term debt financings occurred in 1993.  In January 1993,
the Company issued $100 million of 7% five-year notes.  The net proceeds were
used to prepay, without penalty, $75 million of 9 7/8% notes due in 1996.  The
remaining net proceeds were utilized for capital expenditures.  Beginning in
April 1993, the Company issued $150 million of medium-term notes with interest
rates ranging from 5.66% to 7.3% and maturities ranging from 5 to 20 years. 
The proceeds were used to pay a $100 million 9.3% note that matured on June 30,
1993 and for capital expenditures.  In October of 1993, the Company obtained a
$75 million term loan at market interest rates from a bank.  The proceeds were
used to prepay, without penalty, a $75 million, 8.5% note due in 1996.  As a
result of the above investing and financing activities, the long-term debt-to-
capital ratio is 42.8% at December 31, 1993 compared with 42.0% at December 31,
1992.  Working capital was nearly unchanged at $157.6 million.

   The Company is continually making capital expenditures at its manufacturing
facilities to improve fiber utilization, labor efficiency and to expand
operations.  In 1993, the Company made such capital expenditures of $361.5
million.

   During 1993, the following major capital projects were completed:

   - Installation and construction of a boiler and cogeneration facility and a
     new lime kiln and recausticizing plant at Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania.

   - Expansion of the secondary fiber facilities at the Albany, Oregon paper
     mill.

   - Construction of a new preprinted linerboard facility at Richwood,
     Kentucky.

   Major capital projects underway at December 31, 1993 include the following:

   - The construction of a second linerboard machine at the paper mill in
     Campti, Louisiana.

   - Construction of a new fiberline and paper machine in Johnsonburg,
     Pennsylvania.

   - Modernization of the plywood plant at Moncure, North Carolina.

   - The addition of pulp drying capacity and the expansion of the fiberline at
     the Marlboro County, South Carolina papermill.

   The total cost of all capital projects in progress at December 31, 1993 is
estimated to be approximately $521 million of which $309 million has already
been spent.  These projects will be funded with internally generated cash flows
and with external borrowings as needed.  The Company believes it has the
resources available to meet its liquidity requirements through internally
generated cash flows, short-term borrowings and revolving credit agreements
which could be arranged with a number of banks.

Other Matters

   The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with federal, state and
local laws regarding environmental quality.  The Environmental Protection 
                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>
Agency (EPA) has issued proposed rules regarding air and water quality referred
to as the "cluster rules".  These rules are currently undergoing public review
and are extremely restrictive with a potential financial impact to the paper
industry estimated at $10 billion in capital spending to comply with the
proposed rules.  This level of regulation does not appear to be justified on
either an environmental impact or cost benefit basis and it is hoped compromise
can be reached lessening the severity of the rules.  In addition to the cluster
rules, the EPA is scheduled to issue revised rules for all boilers in the fall
of 1994 which may impact the Company's operations.  Even if the above proposed
rules go into effect, the Company estimates that over the next five years
required pollution control capital expenditures will be less than $125 million. 
Although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any
certainty because of continuing changes in laws, we believe that compliance
with pollution control requirements will not have a material effect upon
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

   Much attention has been given to the controversy concerning
preservationists' efforts to stop the harvest of timber from Federal
timberlands in the Northwest.  Concurrent with these efforts have come
increased regulations, limitations, and restrictions on the harvest of timber
from privately owned timberlands.  Current rules and regulations do not
significantly impact the Company's ability to manage its Oregon timberland on a
sustained yield basis.  If restrictions similar to regulations on Federal
timberlands were imposed on private timberland ownership, it could have a
significant impact on the sustainable harvest level of the Company's 328,000
acres of Oregon timberlands.

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) #106 "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and SFAS #109 "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  The total cumulative impact of these two changes was a credit
to net earnings in the first quarter of 1993 of $26.4 million or $.48 per
share.  In August 1993, the federal corporate tax rate increased to 35%
retroactive to January 1, 1993 impacting both the current year's provision for
income taxes and the deferred tax liability.  Accounting standards required
that the cumulative impact of the increase in the rate ($5.9 million or $.11
per share) be charged to income in the third quarter of 1993 with a
corresponding increase in the deferred tax liability.
  
   Over the years, inflation has resulted in replacement costs higher than
those originally needed to purchase existing plants and equipment.  Advancing
technology and environmental concerns also contribute to higher costs. 
Productivity gains, because of technological improvements, may partially offset
these increased costs.  Our use of LIFO to value inventories allows us to
include inflationary costs in the cost of sales.

   and Stockholders
Willamette Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Willamette
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. 
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedules on pages 34, 35, 36 and 37. 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Willamette
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth herein.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement
of Financial Standards #106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards #109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," in 1993.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 (dollar amounts, except per share amounts, in
thousands)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   (a) Principles of Consolidation
       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
majority owned subsidiaries.  All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

   (b) Inventories
       Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is
determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for all major classes of
inventory.  All other inventories are valued at average cost.

   (c) Property, Plant and Equipment
       Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost and includes
expenditures for new facilities and those which substantially increase the
useful lives of existing plants and equipment.  Maintenance, repairs and minor
renewals are expensed as incurred.  When properties are retired or otherwise
disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is credited or
charged to income.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the useful lives of the respective assets.  Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the terms of the respective leases.

   (d) Timber, Timberlands and Related Facilities
       These accounts are stated at their cost less the cost of fee timber
harvested and the amortization of logging roads.  Amortization of logging roads
is charged to expense as timber is harvested.  Both the cost of fee timber
harvested and amortization rates are determined with reference to costs and the
related existing volume of timber estimated to be recoverable.
       The Company obtains a portion of its timber requirements from various
public and private sources under timber harvesting contracts.  The Company does
not incur a direct liability for, or ownership of, this timber until it has
been harvested; therefore, the timber is not recorded until cut.

   (e) Income Taxes
       Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax effect of
temporary differences in reporting income and deductions for tax purposes.  
       Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
#109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" which requires deferred taxes payable in the
future to be reflected at current statutory tax rates.  This change resulted in
a credit to net earnings and a reduction in the deferred tax liability by a
corresponding amount of $40,000 or $.73 per share.

   (f) Capitalized Interest
       Interest is capitalized on funds borrowed during the construction period
on certain assets.  Capitalized interest in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $15,904,
$7,354 and $723, respectively, and is netted against interest expense in the
consolidated statement of earnings.  Such capitalized interest will be
amortized over the depreciable life of the related assets.

</TABLE>

  If current cost rather than LIFO cost had been used by the Company, inven-
tories would have been approximately $59,910 and $56,551 higher in 1993 and
1992, respectively.

3. Income Taxes

   The provision for income taxes includes the following:

</TABLE>

   The Company has no foreign pretax income.  The Company's deferred income tax
liability is mainly due to depreciation.  Differences between the effective tax
rate and the Federal statutory rate are shown in the following table as a
percentage of pretax income:

</TABLE>

   The Company's consolidated Federal income tax returns for 1974 through 1989
have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service and while final settlement
has not been made, management believes that the Company has provided for all
deficiencies that ultimately might be assessed.            

   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 expanded the corporate alternative minimum tax
(AMT).  Under this Act, the Company's tax liability is the greater of its
regular tax or the AMT.  To the extent the Company's AMT liability exceeds its
regular tax liability, the AMT liability may be applied against future regular
tax liabilities.  The Company expects to utilize future AMT credits as taxable
income increases and current temporary differences reverse.  At December 31,
1993, the Company had AMT credits of $51,000 which have been offset against
deferred income taxes related to depreciation.  No valuation allowance is
required for these credits.

   In August 1993, the Federal corporate tax rate increased to 35% retroactive
to January 1, 1993 impacting both the current year's provision for income taxes
and the deferred tax liability.  Accounting standards required that the
cumulative impact of the increase in rate ($5,864 or $.11 per share) be charged
to income in the third quarter of 1993 with a corresponding increase in the
deferred tax liability.  


4.  Long-term Debt

   Long-term debt consists of the following:

</TABLE>                                                        

   Principal payment requirements on the above debt for the four years subse-
quent to 1994 are:  1995, $100,956; 1996, $78,543; 1997, $713; 1998, $152,733.
   
  The Company utilized short-term borrowings with a number of banks at various
times during 1993 and 1992 with $96,000 being outstanding at December 31, 1993. 
Such borrowings were backed by a line of credit which carried fees at market
rates.  Other uncommitted lines of credit are available.  At various times
throughout the year, a portion of the short-term borrowings were classified as
long-term as they were supported by long-term borrowing arrangements, although
none were classified as such at December 31, 1993.  Interest is based upon
prevailing short-term rates in effect at the time of the transaction. 
Information on short-term debt during 1993 and 1992 is as follows:

<TABLE>

Weighted average interest rate..............        3.29%        4.18%        
</TABLE>

   The fair value of the Corporation's long-term debt is estimated to be
approximately $1,040,000 based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the
same remaining maturities.

5.  Pension and Retirement Plans

   The Company contributes to multiemployer retirement plans at fixed payments
per hour for certain hourly employees.

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

  Substantially all other employees of the Company are covered by
noncontributory defined benefit plans.  Under the salaried plan, retirement
benefits are based on both years of service and the highest five consecutive
years of compensation prior to retirement.  Plans covering hourly employees
provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.  Total pension
expense in 1993, 1992, and 1991 for all such plans was $6,429, $6,227 and
$6,158, respectively.  

  The Company makes annual contributions to the plans that are between the
minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the
maximum amounts deductible under current tax regulations.  Such contributions
are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date,
but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

   The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 7% and 5% in 1993 and 8% and 6% in 1992,
respectively.  The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9%.
Substantially all plan assets are invested in stocks, bonds and cash
equivalents.

CONTRIBUTORY PLANS

   The Company covers all salaried employees and some hourly employees under
stock purchase plans.  The salaried stock purchase plan allows employees to
contribute up to 6% of their salary (which the Company matches).  Total stock
purchase plan expense was $8,417, $7,268 and $6,578 in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

    Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS #106
"Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" which
resulted in a change in accounting for such benefits from the "pay-as-you-go"
basis to the accrual basis.  

   The Company has a contributory postretirement health plan primarily covering
its salaried employees.  Employees become eligible for these benefits if they
meet minimum age and service requirements.  The accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO) as of January 1, 1993 was $21,995 and was recorded as
a charge, net of tax, against income on a cumulative basis in the amount of
$13,600 or $.25 per share.  The APBO as of December 31, 1993 was:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

   A weighted average discount rate of 7% was used in determining the APBO at
December 31, 1993 and 8% as the interest cost component of the 1993 net
periodic expense.

<PAGE>
     For the year 1993, an 11% increase in the medical cost trend rate was
assumed.  This rate decreases to an annual rate of 5% after 12 years.  A 1%
increase in the medical trend rate would increase the APBO by $2,900 and
increase the net periodic postretirement expense by $314.  

6. Stockholders' Equity

   The Company has a Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the
Plan).  The Plan provides that options be granted at exercise prices equal to
market value on the date the option is granted.  Options granted generally
become exercisable after one year in 33-1/3% increments per year and expire ten
years from the date of grant.  The Company has reserved 3,000,000 shares for
distribution under the Plan.  A summary of stock option activity related to the
Plan is as follows:

$26.25 were available for exercise at December 31, 1993.  SARs permit the
optionee to surrender an exercisable option for a cash amount equal to the
difference between the market price and option price of the common stock when
the right is exercised.

  Under the Plan, a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company is
authorized to issue up to 500,000 restricted shares of common stock to eligible
employees.  These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions including
the passage of time, and vesting may be dependent upon continued employment,
the attainment of performance goals, or both.  The Company has awarded 31,146
restricted shares of common stock to certain officers, without cost.  These 
                                     - 31 -
<PAGE>
shares will vest in one-third annual increments beginning after three years of
continuous employment.  At December 31, 1993, 4,372 restricted shares have
vested.  Unearned compensation, representing the fair market value of the
shares at the date of issuance, is charged to income over the vesting period.

   The Company has a shareholder rights plan providing for the distribution of
rights to shareholders ten days after a person or group (an "acquiring person")
becomes the owner of 20% or more of the Company's common stock or makes a
tender offer or exchange offer which would result in the ownership of 30% or
more of the common stock.  Once the rights are distributed, each right becomes
exercisable to purchase, for $175, 1/100th of a share of new series of Company
preferred stock, which 1/100th share is intended to equal one common share in
market value.  Ten days after an acquiring person becomes the owner of 20% or
more of the Company's common stock, each right (other than rights held by the
acquiring person) becomes exercisable to purchase for $175, common shares with
a market value of $350.  The rights will expire in 2000 and may be redeemed at
$.01 per right any time prior to the tenth day after an acquiring person
becomes the owner of 20% or more of the common stock.

   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued an exposure draft on
accounting for stock-based compensation.  If implemented, the proposed standard
will require compensation expense to be recognized in the financial statements
for all stock based compensation plans.  The Company anticipates that the
impact of the proposed accounting standard will not be material to its
financial statements if implemented as drafted.

7. Business Segments

   The Company operates in two principal business segments:  Paper Products and
Building Materials.  Timber, timberlands and related facilities have not been
allocated to the two segments because they are managed to supply raw materials
to both segments.  Information with respect to the sales, operating income and
identifiable assets of these segments is included in the five-year comparison
on page 23.  Information with respect to depreciation, cost of fee timber
harvested and amortization and capital expenditures for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 is shown below:

               (a)  Division into Series.  The Board of Directors shall
        have authority to divide the Preferred Stock into as many series
        as the Board of Directors shall from time to time determine, and
        to issue the Preferred Stock in such series.  The Board of
        Directors shall determine the number of shares comprising each

        Directors in creating such series, be increased or decreased from

               (b)  Authority of Board of Directors to Determine
        Preferences, Limitations and Relative Rights.  The Board of

        prescribed in this Article III or by law, the preferences,
        limitations and relative rights of the shares of Preferred Stock
        before the issuance of any shares of such class or the
        preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of any
        series of Preferred Stock before the issuance of any shares of
        such series.  All shares of any such series shall have
        preferences, limitations and relative rights identical with those
        of other shares of the same series and, except to the extent
        otherwise provided in the description of such series, of those of
        other series of the Preferred Stock.

          (2)  Common Stock.  Subject to the preferences, limitations and
relative rights of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, the holders
of Common Stock shall have all rights of shareholders, including, without
limitation, (i) unlimited voting rights on all corporate matters on the

or required to be shared with another class or series as provided by law
or by any preferences, limitations and relative rights established in
respect of Preferred Stock or any series thereof and (ii) the right to
receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution, subject to any
prior right or right to receive such net assets together with Preferred
Stock pursuant to any preference, limitation or relative right established
in respect of Preferred Stock, or any series thereof.

          C.  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.  The
designation and amount of a series of the Preferred Stock created by the
Board of Directors and the preferences, limitations and relative rights
thereof shall be as follows:

          (1)  Designation and Amount.  There shall be a series of
Preferred Stock of the corporation which shall be designated as "Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $.50 par value" (the "Series A
Preferred Stock"), and the number of shares constituting such series shall
be 500,000.  Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by
Articles of Amendment adopted by the Board of Directors without
shareholder action; provided, however, that no decrease shall reduce the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the
shares outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise of
outstanding rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of outstanding
securities issued by the corporation.

          (2)  Dividends and Distributions.

               (a)  Amount.  Subject to the prior and superior
        rights of the holders of any shares of any series of
        Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the Series A
        Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of
        shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the
        holders of shares of Common Stock of the corporation and
        of any other junior stock which may be outstanding, shall 

                                   - 3 -
<PAGE>
        be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
        Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, (i)
        quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March,
        June, September and December in each year (each such date being
        referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"),
        commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the
        first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A
        Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest
        cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 per share ($.01 per one
        one-hundredth of a share), or (b) subject to the provision for
        adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per
        share amount of all cash dividends declared on the Common Stock
        since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
        or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,
        since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of
        Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) subject to the provision for
        adjustment hereinafter set forth, quarterly distributions (payable
        in kind) on each Quarterly Dividend Payment Date in an amount per
        share equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all
        noncash dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend
        payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the
        outstanding shares of Common Stock, by reclassification or
        otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately
        preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or with respect to the
        first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date since the first issuance of
        any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock.  In
        the event the corporation shall at any time after February 26,
        1990 (the "Rights Declaration Date"), declare or pay any dividend
        on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a
        subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding
        shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
        greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each
        such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A
        Preferred Stock are entitled under clauses (i)(b) or (ii) of the
        preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by
        a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of
        Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
        denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that
        were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               (b)  Mandatory Declaration.  The corporation shall
        declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A
        Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2(a) immediately
        after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common
        Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common
        Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or
        distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock
        during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment
        Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment
        Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share ($.01 per one
        one-hundredth of a share) on the Series A Preferred Stock
        shall nevertheless be payable, out of funds legally
        available for such purpose, on such subsequent Quarterly
        Dividend Payment Date.

<PAGE>
               (c)  Accrual and Accumulation; Record Date. 
        Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on
        outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the
        Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of
        issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless
        the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record
        date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in
        which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue
        and be cumulative from the date of issue of such shares,
        or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend
        Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the
        determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before
        such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which
        events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be
        cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. 
        Accrued but unpaid dividends shall cumulate but shall not
        bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series A
        Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of
        such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such
        shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share
        basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The
        Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
        determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
        distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be
        not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the
        payment thereof.

          (3)  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (a)  Number of Votes Per Share; Adjustment. 
        Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set
        forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
        entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes (and each one
        one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
        entitle the holder thereof to one vote) on all matters
        submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the
        corporation.  In the event the corporation shall at any
        time after the Rights Declaration Date declare or pay any
        dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common
        Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
        consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
        (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or
        lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such
        case the number of votes per share to which holders of
        shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled
        immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by
        multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of
        which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
        immediately after such event and the denominator of which
        is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
        outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                                   - 5 -
<PAGE>
               (b)  Voting With Common Stock as One Class.  Except
        as otherwise provided in these articles of incorporation
        or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote
        together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote
        of the shareholders of the corporation.

               (c)  No Special Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise
        provided in these articles of incorporation or by law,
        holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special
        voting rights and their consent shall not be required for
        taking any corporate action.

          (4)  Certain Restrictions.

               (a)  Dividend Arrearage.  Whenever quarterly
        dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on
        the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section (2)
        are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and
        unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not
        declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock
        outstanding shall have been paid in full, the corporation
        shall not:

                    (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any
          other distributions on any shares of stock ranking
          junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
          dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred
          Stock;

                    (ii)  declare or pay dividends on or make
          any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking
          on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
          liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the
          Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid
          ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such
          parity stock on which dividends are payable or in
          arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which
          the holders of all such shares are then entitled;

                    (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise
          acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking
          junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
          dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred
          Stock, provided that the corporation may at any time
          redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any
          such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock
          of the corporation ranking junior (either as to
          dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding
          up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or

                    (iv)  purchase or otherwise acquire for
          consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
          or any share of stock ranking on a parity with the
          Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a 
                                   - 6 -
<PAGE>
        purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by
        the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such
        terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the
        respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and
        preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine
        in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among
        the respective series or classes.

               (b)  Purchases of Corporation Stock by Subsidiary. 
        The corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the
        corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for
        consideration any shares of stock of the corporation
        unless the corporation could, under Section 4(a), purchase
        or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such
        manner.

          (5)  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner
whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition
thereof.  The corporation shall take all such action as is necessary so
that all such shares shall after their cancellation become authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, and
may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created
by Articles of Amendment adopted by the Board of Directors without
shareholder action, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance
set forth herein.

          (6)  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, no distribution
shall be made (A) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either
as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall have received the higher of (i) $1.00 per
share ($.01 per one one-hundredth of a share), plus an amount equal to
accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not
declared, to the date of such payment, or (ii) an aggregate amount per
share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,
equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to
holders of Common Stock; nor shall any distribution be made (B) to the
holders of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock,
except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all
other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the
holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution
or winding up.  In the event the corporation shall at any time after the
Rights Declaration Date declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination
or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares
of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled under clause
(A)(ii) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator 

                                   - 7 -
<PAGE>
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to such event.

          (7)  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the corporation shall
enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in
which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other
stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, or otherwise changed,
then in any such case the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the
same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share
(subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to
100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other
property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which
each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the
corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date declare or
pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or
effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater
or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the
amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or
change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by
multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

          (8)  No Redemption.  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall not be redeemable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation
may acquire shares of Series A Preferred Stock in any other manner
permitted by law or the articles of incorporation.

          (9)  Rank.  Unless otherwise provided in the articles of
incorporation or an amendment thereof relating to a subsequent series of
Preferred Stock of the corporation, the Series A Preferred Stock shall
rank junior to all other series of the corporation's Preferred Stock as to
the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up, and senior to the Common Stock of the
corporation.

          (10)  Amendment.  The articles of incorporation shall not be
amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,
preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to
affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
voting separately as a class.

          (11)  Fractional Shares.  Series A Preferred Stock may be issued
in one-hundredths of a share or other fractions of a share which shall
entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to
exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions
and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A
Preferred Stock.

                                ARTICLE IV

          A.  Preemptive Rights.  No shareholder of the corporation shall,
by reason of his holding shares of any class, have any preemptive or
preferential rights to purchase or subscribe to any shares of the
corporation now or hereafter to be authorized or any notes, debentures,
bonds or other securities convertible into or carrying options or warrants
to purchase shares of any class now or hereafter to be authorized (whether
or not the issuance of any such shares or such notes, debentures, bonds or
other securities would adversely affect the dividend or voting rights of
such shareholder) other than such rights, if any, as the Board of
Directors in its discretion from time to time may grant and at such price
as the Board of Directors may fix; and the Board of Directors may issue
shares of the corporation or any notes, debentures, bonds or other
securities convertible into or carrying options or warrants to purchase
shares without offering any such shares, either in whole or in part, to
the existing shareholders.

          B.  Purchase of Shares.  The corporation may purchase its own
shares of Common Stock out of unreserved and unrestricted capital surplus
without a vote of the shareholders of the corporation upon such terms and
conditions as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.


                                 ARTICLE V

          A.  Statutory Indemnification.  Each person (an "Indemnified
Person") who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the
corporation or, while serving as a director or officer of the corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, shall, subject to Section F of this
Article, be indemnified by the corporation to the full extent authorized
under ORS 57.255 and ORS 57.260 as now in effect or as hereafter amended
against all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlements actually and reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Person, provided the Indemnified Person has met the applicable
standard of conduct required under ORS 57.255.

          B.  Standard of Conduct.  The determination as to whether or not
an Indemnified Person has met the applicable standard of conduct required
under ORS 57.255 shall be made as promptly as practicable.  Such
determination shall be made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote
of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the Proceeding
or, in case either such a quorum is not obtainable or the Indemnified
Person so requests, such determination shall be made by independent legal
counsel (who may be the outside counsel regularly employed by the
corporation) in a written opinion.  Such independent legal counsel shall
be selected jointly by the corporation and the Indemnified Person.  In the
event the parties are unable to agree on such independent legal counsel,
such independent legal counsel shall be selected by lot by the outside 

                                   - 9 -
<PAGE>
counsel regularly employed by the corporation from among the Portland, 
Oregon, law firms (other than the outside counsel's firm or any other firm
regularly employed by the corporation or by the Indemnified Person) having
more than 50 attorneys and having a rating of "av" in the then current
Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory.  The selection by lot shall be made in
the presence of the Indemnified Person or his counsel.  The outside
counsel regularly employed by the corporation and the Indemnified Person
or his counsel shall contact, in the order of their selection by lot, such
law firms requesting each such firm to accept engagement to make the
determination hereunder until one of such firms accepts the engagement. 
The fees and expenses of such independent legal counsel shall be paid by
the corporation and, if requested by such independent legal counsel, the
corporation shall give such counsel an appropriate written agreement with
respect to the payment of such counsel's fees and expenses and such other
matters as may be reasonably requested by such counsel.  An Indemnified
Person shall be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct
unless the Board of Directors or independent legal counsel, as the case
may be, determines on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that the
Indemnified Person did not meet such standard.  Nothing in this Article
shall limit or prejudice an Indemnified Person in applying to a court
pursuant to ORS 57.260(l)(d) for a determination that indemnification is
proper.

          C.  Expenses. The expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in
defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding subject to the determination that the
Indemnified Person has met the applicable standard of conduct, if required
under ORS 57.260(2), made pursuant to Section B, and subject to the
delivery of the undertaking referred to in Section H, of this Article. 
The determination of whether such expenses shall be paid in advance shall
be made promptly and in any event within 30 days after the Indemnified
Person submits to the corporation a written request to authorize such
advance payments and shall be made without regard to the Indemnified
Person's ability to repay such advance payments.  The corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such Proceeding.

          D.  Nonstatutory Indemnification.  Pursuant to ORS 57.260(3),
the corporation, in addition to its obligations under Section A of this
Article (but subject to Sections F and H of this Article), shall indemnify
an Indemnified Person against any and all claims, liability and expense
whatsoever by reason of or arising from the fact that the Indemnified
Person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, or by reason of or arising from any action taken or not
taken in his or her capacity as such director, officer, partner, trustee,
employee or agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
payments which the corporation shall be obligated to make under this
Section D shall include damages, judgments, fines, settlements and costs,
costs of investigation, legal fees and other costs of defense of legal
actions, claims or proceedings and appeals therefrom, and costs of
attachment or similar bonds.

          E.  Notice of Claim for Nonstatutory Indemnification.  An
Indemnified Person, upon service upon him of a summons or other initial 
                                  - 10 -
<PAGE>
legal process in any Proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be
sought under Section D of this Article, shall promptly give written notice
(herein called the "Notice") of such service to the corporation.  No
indemnification provided for in Section D of this Article shall be
available if the Indemnified Person fails to give the Notice and if the 
corporation was unaware of the Proceeding to which the Notice would have
related and was prejudiced by the failure to give the Notice.  The
corporation shall be entitled, if it so elects within a reasonable time
after receipt of the Notice by giving written notice (herein called the
"Notice of a Defense") to the Indemnified Person, to assume the defense of
the Proceeding, in which event such defense shall be conducted, at the
expense of the corporation, by counsel chosen by the corporation and
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; provided, however, that:

               (1)  If the Indemnified Person shall reasonably conclude
        that there may be a conflict between the positions of the
        Indemnified Person and of the corporation (or of any other party
        to the Proceeding who is indemnified by the corporation) in
        conducting the defense of such Proceeding, or that there may be
        legal defenses available to the Indemnified Person different from
        or in addition to those available to the corporation (or to any
        other party to the Proceeding who is indemnified by the
        corporation), then counsel chosen by the Indemnified Person shall
        be entitled to conduct the defense of the Indemnified Person at
        the expense of the corporation to the extent determined by such
        counsel to be necessary or desirable to protect the interest of
        the Indemnified Person, and

               (2)  In any event, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled
        at his or her expense to have counsel chosen by him participate
        in, but not conduct, the defense.

If, within a reasonable time after receipt of the Notice, the corporation
gives a Notice of Defense and the counsel chosen by it is satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person, the corporation will not be liable for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in
connection with the defense of the Proceeding except that (i) the
corporation shall bear the reasonable legal and other expenses incurred in
connection with the conduct of the defense referred to in clause (1) of
the proviso to the preceding sentence and (ii) the corporation shall bear
such other expenses as it has authorized the Indemnified Person to incur. 
If, within a reasonable time after receipt of the Notice, no Notice of
Defense has been given, the corporation shall bear any reasonable legal or
other expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the
defense of the Proceeding.  The corporation shall pay the legal and other
expenses for which it is responsible hereunder currently upon receipt of a
statement therefor.

          F.  Limitations on Indemnification.  An Indemnified Person shall
not be entitled to any indemnification under this Article:

          (1)  Certain Conduct.  To the extent liability or expense is
incurred by the Indemnified Person which is attributable to:

                                  - 11 -
<PAGE>
               (a)  Willful Misconduct, Etc.  Conduct of the Indemnified
        Person which is finally adjudged to have constituted willful
        misconduct of a culpable nature, deliberate dishonesty or
        fraudulent conduct.

               (b)  Approval of Unlawful Distributions, Etc.  The
        Indemnified Person having voted for or assented to any of the
        following in violation of ORS 57.231 (i) the declaration of a
        dividend or other distribution to the shareholders of the
        corporation contrary to the provisions of ORS Chapter 57 or these
        articles of incorporation, (ii) the purchase by the corporation of
        its own shares contrary to the provisions of ORS Chapter 57, (iii)
        the distribution of assets of the corporation to its shareholders
        during its liquidation without the payment and discharge of, or
        making adequate provision for, all known debts, obligations and
        liabilities of the corporation or (iv) the making of a loan to a
        director of the corporation without first obtaining approval of
        the shareholders if required by ORS 57.226.

               (c)  Liability for Short-Swing Profits.  Any purchase and
        sale of securities of the corporation giving rise to liability
        under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
        amended.

          (2)  Final Adjudication of Unlawfulness.  If a final decision by
a court having jurisdiction in the matter (including an appellate court)
shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful.

          (3)  Certain Settlements.  For amounts paid in settlement of any
Proceeding effected without the corporation's written consent provided the
corporation does not unreasonably withhold such consent.

          (4)  Other Indemnification.  For any liability or expense for
which the Indemnified Person is indemnified under any provision of law,
other article of these articles of incorporation, bylaw of the
corporation, policy of insurance, other agreement or otherwise, except to
the extent payment is not made thereunder.

          (5)  Proceedings Instituted by Indemnified Person.  For any
liability or expense in connection with a Proceeding instituted by the
Indemnified Person whether attributable to a counterclaim or otherwise
unless the Board of Directors approved the institution of the Proceeding.

          G.  Contractual Right to Indemnification; Binding Effect.  The
provisions of this Article are for the benefit of any person who serves as
a director or officer of the corporation, the rights to indemnification
provided in this Article shall be contract rights and such rights shall be
enforceable by or on behalf of any such person.  Such rights shall inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the heirs and personal
representatives of any such person and the provisions of this Article
shall be binding upon the corporation and its successors and assigns.  In
the event the corporation consolidates with or merges into any other
corporation or liquidates, dissolves or transfers substantially all its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in any such case, proper 

                                  - 12 -
<PAGE>
provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the
corporation assume the obligations of the corporation under this Article
to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.

          H.  Undertaking to Repay Expenses.  The obligation of the
corporation to pay expenses of an Indemnified Person in advance of the
final disposition of a Proceeding shall be subject to the delivery to the
corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to
repay the corporation the amount of all expenses paid by the corporation
in defending the Proceeding in the event and only to the extent it shall
be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the corporation for such expenses.

          I.  Limitation of Actions; Waiver.  No legal action shall be
brought and no cause of action shall be asserted (other than legal actions
or causes of action with respect to matters described in Section F of this
Article) by or on behalf of the corporation or any of its affiliates (as
that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) against an officer or director of the corporation after the
expiration of two years from the date the officer or director ceases to
serve in such capacity or to serve at the corporation's request as a
director, officer, partner or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise; and any cause of action of the
corporation or any of its affiliates against an officer or director (other
than a cause of action with respect to a matter described in Section F of
this Article) shall be extinguished and deemed waived and released unless
asserted by the filing of a legal action within such two-year period.

          J.  Attorneys' Fees; Burden of Proof.  In the event any action
is instituted to enforce any of the provisions of this Article, the party
prevailing in the action and any appeal therefrom shall be entitled to
recover from the other party reasonable attorneys' fees which shall be
fixed by the court in which the action shall be pending.  The corporation
shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
indemnification (including advance payments) under this Article is
improper.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including the Board of
Directors or independent legal counsel where applicable) to have made a
determination as to whether indemnification (including advance payments)
under this Article is proper nor an actual determination by the
corporation (by the Board of Directors or by independent legal counsel
where applicable) that such indemnification is not proper shall be a
defense to any action by an Indemnified Person to enforce the provisions
of this Article or create any presumption that such indemnification is not
proper.

          K.  Indemnification of Other Employees and Agents; Cooperation;
Severability.  The corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors,
provide indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation who are
not directors or officers with the same scope and effect as the
indemnification provided in this Article to directors and officers.  The
corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any Proceeding other than a
Proceeding by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor.  Each of the provisions of this Article is separate and
distinct and is independent of the other provisions, so that if any 

                                  - 13 -
<PAGE>
provision hereof shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any 
reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

          L.  Insurance; Other Indemnification.  Nothing in this Article
shall limit the corporation's power to purchase and maintain insurance as
provided in ORS 57.260(4) or to otherwise indemnify its directors,
officers, employees and agents.  This Article shall not be exclusive of
any other right of indemnification to which an Indemnified Person or any
other employee or agent of the corporation may be entitled under any
provision of law, other article of these articles of incorporation, bylaw
of the corporation, policy of insurance, other agreement or otherwise.

          M.  Statutory References.  References in this Article to a
section of the Oregon Business Corporation Act shall include such section
as subsequently amended and, if such section is repealed and a successor
section with respect to the same subject matter is adopted, shall include
such successor section.

          Section 1.  Principal Office.  The principal office of
the corporation in the State of Oregon shall be located in the

business of the corporation may require from time to time.
          Section 2.  Registered Office.  The registered office
of the corporation required by the Oregon Business Corporation
Act ("Act") to be maintained in the State of Oregon may be, but
need not be, the same as any of its places of business in the
State of Oregon, and the location of the registered office may
be changed from time to time by the board of directors or the
registered agent of the corporation.

                           ARTICLE II

                          Shareholders

          Section 1.  Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of the
shareholders shall be held on the fourth Thursday in April at
10 a.m., for the purpose of electing directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may come before the
meeting.
          Section 2.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the
shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the
chairman of the board or by the board of directors, and shall be
called by the chairman of the board if one or more written
demands for a meeting describing the purpose or purposes for
which it is to be held are signed, dated and delivered to the
secretary of the corporation by the holders of at least
10 percent of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue
proposed to be considered at the meeting.
          Section 3.  Place of Meeting.  The board of directors
shall determine the place of meeting for all annual and special
meetings of the shareholders.  In the absence of any such
determination, all meetings of shareholders shall be held at the
principal office of the corporation in the State of Oregon.
          Section 4.  Notice of Meeting.  Written or printed
notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in
case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called, shall be given not earlier than 60 nor less
than ten days before the date of the meeting, either personally 

                              - 1 -
<PAGE>
or by mail, by or at the direction of the chairman of the board,
or the secretary, or the persons calling the meeting, to each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  If
mailed, such notice shall be effective when deposited in the
United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address
as shown in the corporation's current record of shareholders,
with postage thereon prepaid.  If a meeting is adjourned to a
different date, time or place announced at the meeting before
adjournment, notice need not be given of the new date, time or
place unless a new record date is or must be fixed for the
adjourned meeting.
          Section 5.  Quorum; Manner of Acting.  Shares entitled
to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter
only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to the
matter.  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter by voting group, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that
matter.  If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the
election of directors, shall be approved by a voting group if
the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action
exceed the votes cast opposing the action unless the Act
requires a greater number of affirmative votes.  Directors shall
be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares
entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum
is present.  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a
meeting, it shall be deemed present for quorum purposes for the
remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting
unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned
meeting.
          Section 6.  Proxies.  At all meetings of shareholders,
a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the
shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact.  Such
proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation
before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid
after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless
otherwise provided in the proxy.
          Section 7.  Voting of Shares.  Each outstanding share
of the corporation's common stock shall be entitled to one vote
upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of the
shareholders except that shares owned, directly or indirectly,
by another corporation in which the corporation owns, directly
or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the
election of directors of such other corporation shall not be
voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number
of outstanding shares at any given time.
          Section 8.  Acceptance of Votes.  If the name signed
on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to
the name of a shareholder, the corporation shall be entitled to
accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give
it effect as the act of the shareholder.
          If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy
appointment does not correspond to the name of its shareholder,
the corporation shall nevertheless be entitled to accept the 

                              - 2 -
<PAGE>
vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as
the act of the shareholder if:
          a.  The shareholder is an entity and the name
     signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of
     the entity.
          b.  The name signed purports to be that of an
     administrator, executor, guardian or conservator
     representing the shareholder.
          c.  The name signed purports to be that of a
     receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder.
          d.  The name signed purports to be that of a
     pledgee, beneficial owner or attorney-in-fact of the
     shareholder.
          e.  Two or more persons are the shareholder as
     cotenants or fiduciaries, the name signed purports to
     be the name of at least one of the co-owners, and the

number of directors shall be ten, divided into three classes,
three directors to be designated as Class A directors, three
directors to be designated as Class B directors and four
directors to be designated as Class C directors.  At each annual
meeting, directors to replace those whose terms expire at such
annual meeting shall be elected, each such director to hold
office until the third annual meeting next succeeding his
election and until his successor is elected or until his death,
resignation, retirement or removal.
          Section 3.  Regular Meetings.  A regular meeting of
the board of directors shall be held without other notice than
this bylaw immediately after, and at the same place as, the

regular meetings without other notice than such resolution.
          Section 4.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the
board of directors may be called by or at the request of the

days previously thereto, orally or by written notice delivered
personally or given by telegraph, teletype or other form of wire
communication, or by mail or private carrier, to each director 
at his business address.  Oral notice shall be effective when
communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner and 

written notice shall be effective at the earliest of the

the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on

participation in, a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice
of such meeting, except where a director at the beginning of the
meeting, or promptly upon the director's arrival, objects to
holding of the meeting or the transacting of business at the
meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action
taken at the meeting.  A written waiver of notice of a meeting
signed by the director or directors entitled to such notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, which specifies
the meeting for which notice is waived and which is filed with
the minutes or corporate records shall be equivalent to the
giving of such notice.  Neither the business to be transacted
at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
board of directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of
notice of such meeting.
          Section 6.  Quorum.  A majority of the number of
directors fixed by Section 2 of this Article III shall

meeting of the board of directors, but, if less than such
majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors
present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
further notice.

a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors.

board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an
increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the board
of directors or, if the remaining directors constitute fewer
than a quorum, by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the
remaining directors.  The term of a director elected to fill a
vacancy shall expire at the next shareholders' meeting at which
directors are elected.
          Section 9.  Presumption of Assent. A director who is
present at a meeting of the board of directors at which
corporate action is taken shall be deemed to have assented to
the action taken, unless (a) the director objects at the
beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon the director's
arrival, to holding the meeting or transacting business at the
meeting; (b) the director's dissent or abstention from the
action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or 
                              - 4 -
<PAGE>
(c) the director delivers written notice of dissent or
abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its
adjournment or to the corporation immediately after adjournment
of the meeting.  Such right to dissent or abstain shall not
apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.
          Section 10.  Removal of Directors.  All or any number
of the directors of the corporation may be removed, with or 
without cause, at a meeting called expressly for that purpose,

corporation.

of directors, each director may be paid an annual fee as
director and, in addition thereto, a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the board of directors and executive committee

any such meeting.  No such payment shall preclude any director
from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.

from the board of directors on the date of the regular quarterly
meeting of directors next following the date on which he attains

reelection.
          Section 13.  Emeritus Director.  The board of
directors may elect one or more emeritus directors to serve at
the pleasure of the board of directors.  Persons eligible to
serve as emeritus directors shall be former directors of this
corporation or of a predecessor corporation; an emeritus
director shall be entitled to attend meetings of the board of
directors but shall not be entitled to vote on any matter
submitted to the board of directors.  The board of directors

quorum of the board of directors.

describing the action so taken shall be signed by all the
directors and included in the minutes or filed with the
corporate records reflecting the action taken.

board of directors, or of any committee designated by the board
of directors, may be held by means of conference telephone or
any other means of communication by which all directors
participating in the meeting can hear each other simultaneously

for the election of directors may be made by the board of
directors or a proxy committee appointed by the board of
directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote in the election

an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders,

other directors.  The chairman of the committee shall be a

operate to relieve the board of directors, or any member
thereof, of any responsibility imposed by law.

                          PURPOSE; EFFECTIVE DATE

          The purpose of this Deferred Compensation Plan is to provide
current tax planning opportunities as well as supplemental funds for
retirement or death for certain employees of Employer.  It is intended that
the Plan will aid in attracting and retaining employees of exceptional
ability by providing them with these benefits.  The Plan shall be effective
as of January 1, 1994.

                                ARTICLE II

Compensation.  Income from the exercise of stock options or the vesting of

items that the Committee determines should be excluded for administrative
convenience, shall be excluded from Compensation.

          2.7  Deferral Period.  "Deferral Period" means the 12-month
period ending December 31.

          2.8  Determination Date.  "Determination Date" means the last day

                                   - 1 -<PAGE>
          2.9  Earnings.  "Earnings" for each Subaccount means the rate of

the Account.

          2.10  Employer.  "Employer" means the Company and any subsidiary

          (a)  The amount deferred by the Participant under the Plan
     for the calendar year;

          (b)  Six percent (6%) of the Participant's "statutory"
     Compensation, reduced by the amount of matching contribution
     actually made for the Participant to the Stock Purchase Plan for
     the calendar year; for this purpose, "statutory" Compensation
     means Compensation as defined in Section 2.6 but limited to
     $235,840 plus cost of living adjustments that would have been

     Revenue Code as it existed prior to its amendment by The Revenue
     Reconciliation Act of 1993; or

          (c)  Thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) (plus cost of living
     adjustments allowed for qualified plan purposes), reduced by

          employee after-tax contributions that could have been
          made by or for the Participant to the Stock Purchase
          Plan for the calendar year if the Section 401(a)(17)
          limit had been the higher "statutory" Compensation
          described above, and assuming the amount of such
          contributions would have been limited to an amount
          which would allow the highest possible amount of
          matching contribution, and

               (ii)  the amount of matching contribution actually
          made for the Participant to the Stock Purchase Plan for
          the calendar year.

          2.12  Mirror Investment Fund.  "Mirror Investment Fund" means
each fund selected by a Participant pursuant to Article III.  Each Mirror

1994, there are three (3) Mirror Investment Funds whose deemed earnings
will track the earnings of the following Stock Purchase Plan investment
funds:

to measure and determine the amount of deferrals and matching contributions
allocated to each Mirror Investment Fund selected by the participant, and
the Earnings allocated therein.




                                ARTICLE III

                        PARTICIPATION AND DEFERRALS

          3.1  Eligibility and Participation.

          (a)  Eligibility.  Eligibility to participate in the Plan
     shall be limited to:

               (i)  Officers of Employer, and

               (ii)  Any other employee designated, from time to
          time, by the Board.

          (b)  Participation.  An eligible individual may elect to
     participate in the Plan with respect to any Deferral Period by
     submitting a Participation Agreement to the Committee by the
     December 31 immediately preceding the beginning of the Deferral
     Period.

          (c)  Part-Year Participation.  When an individual first
     becomes eligible to participate during a Deferral Period, a
     Participation Agreement may be submitted to the Committee no 

                                   - 3 -
<PAGE>
     later than thirty (30) days after the Committee notifies the
     individual of eligibility to participate.  Such Participation
     Agreement will be effective only with regard to Compensation earned
     following submission to the Committee.

          3.2  Form of Deferral.  A Participant may elect a deferral in the
Participation Agreement as follows:  A deferral shall be a portion of the
Compensation payable by Employer to the Participant during the Deferral
Period.  The amount to be deferred shall be stated as a flat percentage or
as a flat dollar amount not to exceed the maximums and not to be less than
the minimums described in Section 3.3.

          3.3  Limitations on Deferrals.  The following limitations shall
apply to deferrals:

          (a)   Maximum.  The maximum percentage of Compensation
     deferred shall be fifty percent (50%) for executive officers and
     thirty percent (30%) for other officers or other employees.

          (b)  Minimum.  The minimum deferral amount shall be two
     hundred dollars ($200) for each month in the Deferral Period.

          (c)  Changes in Minimum or Maximum.  The Committee may
     change the minimum or maximum deferral amounts from time to time
     by giving written notice to all Participants.  No such change may
     affect the amount of deferral specified in a Participation
     Agreement made prior to the Committee's action.

          3.4  Selection of Mirror Investment Fund.

          (a)  At the time a Participant elects a deferral for a
     Deferral Period, the Participant shall also select the Mirror
     Investment Fund(s) in which the Participant wishes to have the
     combined amount of both deferrals and Matching Contributions
     deemed invested.  The Participant may select any combination of
     one (1) or more of the Mirror Investment Funds as long as at
     least 25% is credited to each of the Mirror Investment Funds
     selected.

          (b)  At the time the Participant selects Mirror Investment
     Fund(s) for new deferrals and Matching Contributions, a different
     allocation may be selected among Mirror Investment Funds for
     current account balances, which may be different than the
     allocation for new deferrals and Matching Contributions.

          3.5  Termination of Employment.  If a Participant terminates
employment with Employer prior to the end of the Deferral Period, the
Deferral Period shall end at the date of termination.

          3.6  Continuation of Deferral Amount.  Once a Participant has
made a Participation Agreement, the elected deferral amount shall remain in
effect for the applicable Deferral Period.  The election shall be
irrevocable except as provided in Section 5.1(b) relating to unforeseen
emergency.

                                   - 4 -
<PAGE>
          3.7  Change in Employment Status.  If the Board determines that a
Participant's performance is no longer at a level that deserves reward
through participation in the Plan, but does not terminate the Participant's
employment with Employer, no new Participation Agreements may be made by
such Participant after notice of such determination is given by the Board.


                                ARTICLE IV

Plan, any matching contributions, and Earnings shall be credited to the
Participant's Account.  Separate Subaccounts will be maintained to reflect
Mirror Investment Fund selections.  The Account and Subaccounts shall be
bookkeeping devices utilized for the sole purpose of determining the
benefits payable under the Plan and shall not constitute a separate fund of
assets.

          4.2  Timing of Credits; Withholding.  A Participant's deferred
Compensation shall be credited to the Account and Subaccounts at the time
it would have been payable to the Participant.  Any withholding of taxes or
other amounts with respect to deferred Compensation (and Matching
Contributions) that is required by state, federal, or local law shall be
withheld from the Participant's corresponding nondeferred Compensation.

          4.3  Matching Contributions.  Employer shall make Matching
Contributions to a Participant's Account.  Matching Contributions shall be
credited as of the last day of each calendar month.

          4.4  Determination of Accounts and Subaccounts.  Each
Participant's Account and Subaccount(s) as of each Determination Date shall
consist of the balance of the Account and Subaccount(s) as of the
immediately preceding Determination Date, adjusted as follows:

          (a)  New Deferrals.  The Account and Subaccount(s) shall be
     increased by any deferred Compensation credited since such
     Determination Date.

          (b)  Employer Contributions.  The Account and Subaccount(s)
     shall be increased by Matching Contributions credited since such
     Determination Date.

          (c)  Distributions.  The Account and Subaccount(s) shall be
     reduced by any benefits distributed to the Participant since such
     Determination Date.

          (d)  Earnings.  The Account and Subaccount(s) shall be
     increased by the Earnings credited on the average daily balance
     in the Account and each Subaccount since such Determination Date.

          (e)  Other Adjustments.  The Account and Subaccount(s) shall
     be increased or reduced, as the case may be, since such
     Determination Date by such adjustments as the Committee may 

                                   - 5 -
<PAGE>
     determine are necessary and appropriate, including but not limited to
     a reduction caused by Employer's payment of the Participant's share of
     any payroll taxes attributable to the amount of Earnings.

          4.5  Vesting of Accounts.  Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.4, each Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested at
all times in the amounts credited to such Participant's Account,
Subaccount, and Earnings thereon, regardless whether attributable to
deferrals or matching contributions.

          4.6  Statement of Accounts.  The Committee shall give to each
Participant a statement showing the balances in the Participant's Account
and Subaccount(s) on a semiannual basis and at such other times as may be
determined by the Committee.

          4.7  Pension Make-Up.  Employer shall restore an amount equal to
any reduction in a Participant's defined benefit pension plan benefits
because of deferrals under this Plan to the extent that the defined benefit
plan benefits are not restored by any other Employer-provided plan or
agreement.

                                 ARTICLE V

                               PLAN BENEFITS

          5.1  Early Withdrawals.  A Participant's Account may be
distributed to the Participant before termination of employment as follows:

          (a)  Election For Early Withdrawal.  A Participant may elect
     in a Participation Agreement to withdraw all or any portion of
     the amount deferred by that Participation Agreement as of a date
     specified in the election.  Such date shall not be sooner than
     five (5) years after the date the Deferral Period commences.

          (b)  Unforeseeable Emergency.  Upon a finding that a
     Participant or Beneficiary has suffered an unforeseeable
     emergency, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make
     distributions from the Participant's Account.  "Unforeseeable
     emergency" means an unanticipated emergency that is caused by an
     event beyond the control of the Participant or Beneficiary and
     that would result in severe financial hardship to the individual
     if early withdrawal were not permitted.  Any early withdrawal
     approved by the Committee shall be limited to the amount
     necessary to meet the emergency.  If a Participant receives an
     early withdrawal, no additional deferrals shall be made for the
     Participant for the remainder of the calendar year in which
     withdrawal is made or for the immediately succeeding calendar
     year.

          (c)  Form of Payment.  Withdrawals shall be paid in a lump
     sum and shall be charged to the Participant's Account as a
     distribution.

          5.2  Termination of Employment.  If a Participant terminates
employment with Employer for any reason, including death, Employer shall
                                   - 6 -
<PAGE>
pay to the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary, in case of death)
benefits equal to the balance in the Account.


          5.3  Form of Benefits.  Except as provided below, benefits as a
result of death or other termination of employment shall be paid in the
form elected by the Participant prior to the beginning of the Deferral
Period.  Forms of benefit payment shall be:

          (a)  A lump sum amount which is equal to the applicable
     Account balance.

          (b)  Equal monthly installments of the Account amortized
     over a period of sixty (60), one hundred twenty (120), or one
     hundred eighty (180) months.  Earnings on the unpaid balance
     shall continue to be credited to Subaccounts at the appropriate
     Mirror Investment Fund rate.

          Notwithstanding an installment election, if the Participant's
Account is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less on the valuation date
referred to in Section 5.6, the benefit shall be paid in a lump sum.

          A Participant who elects payment in installments may also elect
prior to the beginning of the Deferral Period whether, in the event of the
Participant's death prior to complete distribution of the Participant's
Account:

          (a)  The remaining amount of the Participant's Account is to
     be paid in a lump sum to the Beneficiary (in which case payment
     shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of death),
     or

          (b)  Installment payments are to be made to the Beneficiary
     over the elected installment period (or over the remainder of the
     period).

          5.4  Accelerated Distribution.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Plan, a Participant at any time shall be entitled to
receive, upon written request to the Committee, a lump sum distribution
equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Account balance as of the
Determination Date immediately preceding the date on which the Committee
receives the written request.  The remaining balance shall be forfeited by
the Participant and the Participant shall no longer be eligible to
participate in the Plan from that date forward.  The amount payable under
this section shall be paid in a lump sum within sixty-five (65) days
following the receipt of the notice by the Committee from the Participant.

          5.5  Withholding; Payroll Taxes.  Employer shall withhold from
payments hereunder any taxes required to be withheld from such payments
under federal, state, or local law.  A Beneficiary, however, may elect not
to have withholding of federal income tax pursuant to Section 3405 of the
Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision thereto.

          5.6  Valuation Date.  Unless a delayed valuation date is elected
by the Participant, the last day of the month following the month of 
                                   - 7 -
<PAGE>
termination shall be the valuation date.  The Participant may elect prior
to the beginning of the Deferral Period that the valuation date be delayed
to the last day of the month in which occurs the first, second, or third
anniversary of the date of termination; provided, however, that payment
must be made or begun no later than January of the calendar year in which
the Participant attains age 70.

          The amount of a lump sum payment shall be based on the value of
the Participant's Account on the valuation date.  Except as provided in
Section 5.7, payments shall be made or commence within thirty (30) days
after the valuation date.

          5.7  Covered Employee.  Notwithstanding Section 5.6, if any
portion of a payment in a calendar year would be disallowed as a deduction
to Employer because the Participant is a "covered employee" for that
calendar year under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, that
portion shall instead be paid in the immediately following calendar year,
by January 30.  This section does not apply to early withdrawals under
Section 5.1 or accelerated distribution under Section 5.4.

          5.8  Payment to Guardian.  If a distribution is payable to a
minor or a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling
the disposition of property, the Committee may direct payment to the
guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of
such minor, incompetent, or person.  The Committee may require proof of
incompetency, minority, incapacity, or guardianship as it may deem
appropriate prior to distribution.  Such distribution shall completely
discharge the Committee from all liability with respect to such benefit.


                                ARTICLE VI

                          BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

          6.1  Beneficiary Designation.  Each Participant shall have the
right, at any time, to designate one (1) or more persons or an entity as
Beneficiary (both primary as well as secondary) to whom benefits under this
Plan shall be paid in the event of a Participant's death prior to complete
distribution of the Participant's Account.  Each Beneficiary designation
shall be in a written form prescribed by the Committee and will be
effective only when filed with the Committee during the Participant's
lifetime.  Designation by a married Participant of a Beneficiary other than
the Participant's spouse shall not be effective unless the spouse executes
a written consent that acknowledges the effect of the designation and is
witnessed by a notary public, or the consent cannot be obtained because the
spouse cannot be located.

          6.2  Amendments.  Except as provided below, any nonspousal
designation of Beneficiary may be changed by a Participant without the
consent of such Beneficiary by the filing of a new designation with the
Committee.  The filing of a new designation shall cancel all designations
previously filed.



                                  - 8 - 
<PAGE>
          6.3  Change in Marital Status.  If the Participant's marital
status changes after the Participant has designated a Beneficiary, the
following shall apply:

          (a)  If the participant is married at death but was
     unmarried when the designation was made, the designation shall be
     void unless the spouse has consented to it in the manner
     prescribed above.

          (b)  If the Participant is unmarried at death but was
     married when the designation was made:

               (i)  The designation shall be void if the spouse
          was named as Beneficiary.

               (ii)  The designation shall remain valid if a
          nonspouse Beneficiary was named.

          (c)  If the Participant was married when the designation was
     made and is married to a different spouse at death, the
     designation shall be void unless the new spouse has consented to
     it in the manner prescribed above.

          6.4  No Beneficiary Designation.  If any Participant fails to
designate a Beneficiary in the manner provided above, or if the Beneficiary
designated by a deceased Participant dies before the Participant or before
complete distribution of the Participant's benefits, the Participant's
Beneficiary shall be the person in the first of the following classes in
which there is a survivor:

          (a)  The Participant's surviving spouse;

          (b)  The Participant's children in equal shares, except that
     if any of the children predeceases the Participant but leaves
     issue surviving, then such issue shall take by right of
     representation the share the parent would have taken if living;

          (c)  The Participant's estate.


                                ARTICLE VII

                              ADMINISTRATION

          7.1  Committee; Duties.  This Plan shall be administered by the
Committee, which shall be the Compensation Committee of the Board or such
other Committee as the Board may designate.  The Committee shall have the
authority to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and
regulations for the administration of the Plan and decide or resolve any
and all questions, including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in
such administration.  A majority vote of the Committee members shall
control any decision.  Members of the Committee may be Participants under
this Plan.


                                   - 9 -

          7.2  Agents.  The Committee may, from time to time, employ agents
and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, and may

          7.3  Binding Effect of Decisions.  The decision or action of the
Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with

          7.4  Indemnity of Committee.  The Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless the members of the Committee against any and all claims,
loss, damage, expense, or liability arising from any action or failure to
act with respect to this Plan on account of such person's service on the
Committee, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.


                               ARTICLE VIII

                             CLAIMS PROCEDURE

          8.1  Claim.  Any person claiming a benefit, requesting an

written notice of denial shall state:

          (a)  The reasons for denial, with specific reference to the
     Plan provisions on which the denial is based.

          (b)  A description of any additional material or information
     required and an explanation of why it is necessary.

          (c)  An explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.

          8.3  Review of Claim.  Any person whose claim or request is
denied or who has not received a response within thirty (30) days may

          8.4  Final Decision.  The decision on review shall normally be
made within sixty (60) days.  If an extension of time is required for a
hearing or other special circumstances, the claimant shall be notified and

                     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

          9.1  Amendment.  The Board may at any time amend the Plan by
written instrument, notice of which shall be given to all Participants and
to Beneficiaries receiving installment payments, subject to the following:

          (a)  Preservation of Account Balance.  No amendment shall
     reduce the amount accrued in any Account to the date such notice
     of the amendment is given.

          (b)  Changes in Mirror Investment Funds.  Amendments may
     change the Mirror Investment Funds available to Participants for
     any date subsequent to the date of amendment.

          9.2  Employer's Right to Terminate.  The Board may at any time
partially or completely terminate the Plan if, in its judgment, the tax,
accounting, or other effects of the continuance of the Plan or potential
payments thereunder would not be in the best interests of Employer.

          (a)  Partial Termination.  The Board may partially terminate
     the Plan by instructing the Committee not to accept any
     additional Participation Agreements.  If such a partial
     termination occurs, the Plan shall continue to operate and be
     effective with regard to Participation Agreements entered into
     prior to the effective date of such partial termination.

          (b)  Complete Termination.  The Board may completely
     terminate the Plan by instructing the Committee not to accept any
     additional Participation Agreements, and by terminating all
     ongoing deferrals.  If such a complete termination occurs, the
     Plan shall cease to operate and Employer shall pay out each
     Account.  Payment shall be made as a lump sum or in equal monthly
     installments over the following period, based on the Account
     balance:

                                 ARTICLE X

                               MISCELLANEOUS

          10.1  Unfunded Plan.  This plan is an unfunded plan maintained
primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of
"management or highly-compensated employees" within the meaning of
Sections 201, 301, and 401 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and therefore is exempt from the provisions
of Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA.  Accordingly, the Board may
terminate the Plan and make no further benefit payments or remove certain
employees as Participants if it is determined by the United States
Department of Labor, a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opinion of
counsel that the Plan constitutes an employee pension benefit plan within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (as currently in effect or hereafter
amended) which is not so exempt.

          10.2  Unsecured General Creditor.  Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no secured legal
or equitable rights, interest, or claims in any property or assets of
Employer, nor shall they be Beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims,
or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts, or the
proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by Employer.  Except as
provided in Section 10.3, such policies, annuity contracts, or other assets
of Employer shall not be held under any trust for the benefit of
Participants, their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, or assigns, or held
in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of
Employer under this Plan.  Any and all of Employer's assets and policies
shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of
Employer.  Employer's obligation under the Plan shall be that of an
unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.

          10.3  Trust Fund.  At its discretion, Employer may establish one
(1) or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board may approve, for the
purpose of providing for the payment of benefits owed under the Plan. 
Although such a trust shall be irrevocable, its assets shall be held for
payment of all Employer's general creditors in the event of insolvency.  To
the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are paid from any such
trust, Employer shall have no further obligation to pay them.  If not paid
from the trust, such benefits shall remain the obligation of Employer. 
Notwithstanding the existence of such a trust, it is intended that the Plan
be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.

          10.4  Nonassignability.  Neither a Participant nor any other
person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge,
anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, or
convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder,
or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are, expressly
declared to be unassignable and nontransferable.  No part of the amounts
payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or
sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate
maintenance owed by a participant or any other person, nor be transferable
by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's
bankruptcy or insolvency.

                                  - 12 -
<PAGE>
          10.5  Not a Contract of Employment.  This Plan shall not
constitute a contract of employment between Employer and the Participant. 
Nothing in this Plan shall give a Participant the right to be retained in
the service of Employer or to interfere with the right of Employer to
discipline or discharge a participant at any time.

          10.6  Protective Provisions.  A Participant will cooperate with
Employer by furnishing any and all information requested by Employer in
order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder and by taking such
physical examinations as Employer may deem necessary and taking such other
action as may be requested by Employer.

          10.7  Governing Law.  The provisions of this Plan shall be
construed and interpreted according to the laws of the state of Oregon,
except as preempted by federal law.

          10.8  Validity.  In case any provision of this Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and
enforced as if such illegal and invalid provision had never been inserted
herein.

          10.9  Notice.  Any notice required or permitted under the Plan
shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered or sent by registered
or certified mail.  Such notice shall be deemed as given as of the date of
delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the
postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.  Mailed notice
to the Committee shall be directed to the Company's address.  Mailed notice
to a Participant or Beneficiary shall be directed to the individual's last
known address in Employer's records.

          10.10  Successors.  The provisions of this Plan shall bind and
inure to the benefit of Employer and its successors and assigns.  The term
successors as used herein shall include any corporate or other business
entity which shall, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase, or
otherwise, acquire all or substantially all of the business and assets of
Employer, and successors of any such corporation or other business entity.
