                                   PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a)  General Development of Business
- ------------------------------------
X-Rite, Incorporated ("X-Rite" or the "Company") was organized as a
Michigan corporation in 1958.  The business currently conducted by the
Company is largely an outgrowth of the Company's x-ray marking and
identification system introduced in 1961.  The Company's silver recovery
equipment, introduced in 1968, and its first quality control instruments,
introduced in 1975, were developed to meet the needs of film processors; a
customer class known to the Company from its sales of radio-opaque x-ray
marking tape.

The Company has expanded its product offerings by concentrating on its
instrument technologies and developing expertise in the fields of light and
color measurement.  Pursuant to that strategy, X-Rite has successfully
developed and marketed numerous quality control instruments and
accessories.

The Company made its initial public offering of common stock during 1986. 
Proceeds from that public offering were used to finance the construction of
a new building for office, manufacturing and warehouse needs, purchase new
production and laboratory equipment, retire debt and provide working
capital.

X-Rite has grown through internal expansion and through acquisitions.  In
1993 the Company established two foreign sales and service subsidiaries;
X-Rite GmbH, Cologne, Germany and X-Rite Asia-Pacific Limited, Hong Kong. 
In 1994 the Company purchased a foreign sales and service subsidiary,
X-Rite Limited, Congleton, Cheshire, England, and acquired certain assets
of Colorgen, Inc. ("Colorgen"), a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of
retail point-of-purchase paint matching systems.  In 1995 the Company
acquired all of the outstanding stock of Labsphere, Inc. ("Labsphere") of
North Sutton, New Hampshire.  Labsphere was founded in 1981 and is a
leading manufacturer of light measurement and light source integrating
systems and instrumentation.


(b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments
- --------------------------------------------------
For purposes of the consolidated financial statements included as part of
this report, all operations of the Company are classified in one industry
segment: quality control instruments and accessories.
 

(c)  Narrative Description of Business
- --------------------------------------

Principal Products
The Company primarily manufactures and sells proprietary quality control
instruments which utilize advanced electronics and optics technologies. 
The principal types of products produced include:

                                     -2-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>  3


Densitometers
X-Rite's first densitometer was introduced in 1975.  A densitometer is an
instrument that measures optical or photographic density, compares that
measurement to a reference standard, and signals the result to the operator
of the instrument.  There are two types of densitometers; transmission
densitometer and reflection densitometer.

A transmission densitometer measures the amount of light that is
transmitted through film.  Some models are designed for use in controlling
variables in the processing of x-ray film in medical and non-destructive
testing applications.  Other models are designed to be used to control
process variables in the production of photo-transparencies, such as
photographic film and microfilm.  Reflection densitometers measure the
amount of incident light that is reflected from a surface, such as ink on
paper.

X-Rite introduced its spectrodensitometer in 1990 which combines the
function of a densitometer with the functions of a colorimeter and a
spectrophotometer (see following paragraphs) to provide measurements for
monitoring and controlling color reproduction.  Also introduced in 1990 was
the scanning densitometer, which is used for controlling the color of
printed inks in graphic arts applications.

In 1994 the Company began delivering densitometer-based products for
digital imaging applications.  Products which calibrate image setters,
raster image processors and digital printers were the initial entrants into
the market for use in desktop publishing and computer-based printing
activities.

Sensitometers
Sensitometers have been manufactured by X-Rite since 1975.  This instrument
is used to expose various types of photographic film in a very precise
manner for comparison to a reference standard.  The exposed film is
processed and then "read" with a densitometer to determine the extent of
variation from the standard.

Colorimeters
In 1989 the Company introduced its first colorimeter. Colorimeters measure
light much like the human eye using red, green and blue receptors and are
used to measure printed colors on packages, labels, textiles and other
materials where a product's appearance is critical for buyer acceptance. 
In 1990 X-Rite added the spectrocolorimeter which is a combination
instrument that performs colorimeter functions by applying
spectrophotometric techniques and principles (see next paragraph), thereby
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of the instrument.

Spectrophotometers and Accessories
The spectrophotometer, introduced in 1990, is related to the colorimeter;
however, it measures light at many points over the entire visible spectrum,
generally with the high degree of accuracy required in laboratory
measurements.  Spectrophotometers are used in color formulation for
materials such as plastics, paints, inks, ceramics and metals.



                                     -3-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>  4


In 1991 the Company introduced a multi-angle spectrophotometer which is
used to measure the color of metallic finishes.  This instrument is useful
for controlling the color consistency of automotive paints and other
metallic and pearlescent coatings.  In 1992 the Company introduced a
spherical spectrophotometer which measures the color of textured surfaces
and is used in the textile, paint and plastics industries.

During 1993 and 1994, X-Rite introduced a group of color formulation and
quality control software packages designed for use with its
spectrophotometer products.  This software is sold separately or is
combined with a computer and an instrument and sold as a turn-key system. 
Marketing efforts with respect to this family of related products are being
directed at packaging material printers, textile, plastic, paint, ink and
coatings manufacturers.

In 1994 and 1995, X-Rite introduced products developed for desktop graphics
professionals.  One of the instruments in this product category is a hand-
held spectrophotometer which captures color from almost any item and sends
it to a personal computer.  Once there, the color can be used in a variety
of graphic design applications, previewed and prepared for output, and
organized into a custom electronic color library; colors can also be
transmitted to other personal computers anywhere in the world using
X-Rite's ColorMail software.

Another 1995 introduction was the auto-tracking spectrophotometer.  This
instrument is used in the graphic arts industry to help control hard to
match colors such as pastels, reflex blue, dark reds and colors used in
corporate logo standards.

The 1995 acquisition of Labsphere expanded the Company's product lines to
include standard accessories which are compatible with a majority of
commercially available spectrophotometers worldwide.  These accessories
extend a spectrophotometer's capabilities and enhance its performance.

Point-of-Purchase Paint Matching Systems
In 1993 the Company introduced computerized point-of-purchase paint
matching systems for use by paint stores, hardware stores, mass merchants
and home improvement centers.  After successfully establishing its own line
of products, the Company acquired certain assets of Colorgen in 1994. 
Colorgen had a significant share of the U.S. point-of-purchase paint
matching market.  With that acquisition, X-Rite has established itself as a
market leader in the retail point-of-purchase architectural paint matching
business.

Integrating Spheres and Integrating Sphere Systems
With the acquisition of Labsphere, X-Rite added integrating spheres and
integrating sphere systems to its product lines.  Applications for these
instruments include testing incandescent and fluorescent lamp output,
calibration of remote sensors, laser power measurement, and reflectance and
transmittance light measurement.

Reflectance Materials and Coatings
Labsphere is also an OEM supplier of proprietary reflectance materials and
coating services. These materials and services are used in such products as
photographic processing equipment, check scanning systems, x-ray film
analysis, backlight illuminators and surface profiling equipment.

Other Products
For many years, X-Rite has also manufactured silver recovery equipment,
heat shrink packaging equipment, and radio-opaque marking tape. 
Collectively, these other products represent less than five percent of the
Company's consolidated net sales.

X-Rite categorizes the sales of its products into six major categories;
medical, photographic, graphic arts, digital imaging, and color and
appearance. 

Sales of the Company's products are made by its own sales personnel and
through independent manufacturer's representatives.  Certain products not
sold directly to end users are distributed in the U.S. through a network of
fifteen hundred independent dealers and outside the U.S. through four
hundred independent dealers in fifty countries.  Independent dealers are
managed and serviced by the Company's sales staff and by independent sales
representatives.


Raw Materials
Raw materials and components necessary for manufacturing products and
providing services are generally available from several sources.  The
Company does not foresee any unavailability of materials or components
which would have a material adverse effect on its overall business in the
near term.


Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns nineteen U.S. patents which are significant for products
which it currently manufactures; sixteen relating to light and color
measuring instruments, one relating to silver recovery equipment, one
relating to shrink packaging equipment, and one for reflectance materials
and coatings.

The Company currently has nine patent applications on file in the U.S. and
in several other countries.  While the Company follows a policy of
obtaining patent protection for its products, it does not believe that the
loss of any existing patent, or failure to obtain any new patents, would
have a material adverse impact on its competitive position.


Seasonality
The Company's business is generally not subject to seasonal variations that
would impact sales, production or net income.





                                     -5-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>  6


Significant Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales in 1995,
1994 or 1993.  The Company does not believe that the loss of any single
customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.


Backlog
The Company's backlog of scheduled but unshipped orders was $5.2 million at
March 1, 1996 and $2.8 million at December 31, 1995.  The March 1, 1996
backlog is expected to be filled during the current fiscal year.


Competition
The Company's market share in the medical and photographic instrument
markets is substantial with few competitors.

There are eight firms producing competing products in the graphic
arts/digital imaging categories; MacBeth, a division of Kollmorgen
Corporation, Gretag Color Control Systems, Tobias Associates, Graphics
Microsystems, Inc., Light Source, Inc., Ihara Electronic Industries Co.,
Ltd., Viptronic GmbH, and Techkon Elektronik GmbH.

There are five major manufacturers of competing products in the color and
appearance market; Datacolor, Int., Minolta Corporation, the MacBeth
division of Kollmorgen Corporation, Hunter Associates Laboratory, Inc. and
Byk-Gardner.

The primary basis of competition for all the Company's products is quality,
design and service.  The Company believes that superior quality and
features are competitive advantages for its products.


Research and Development
During 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, the Company spent $5,952,000,
$3,759,000 and $3,098,000 on research and development.  X-Rite has no
customer-sponsored research and development activities.


Human Resources
As of March 1, 1996, the Company employed 517 persons; 493 in its U.S.
operations and 24 in its foreign subsidiaries.  The Company believes that
its relations with employees are excellent.

                                ======     ======     ======


Net Sales

Net sales increased 22.2%, 51.8% and 8.3% during 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The increase in sales in 1995 was mainly due to the
inclusion of $7.9 million in sales from Labsphere, Inc. ("Labsphere"), a
company acquired by X-Rite in the first quarter of 1995.  Excluding the
Labsphere sales, X-Rite's sales in 1995 increased 8.8% compared to 1994. 
All other increases in net sales from year to year are a result of unit
volume increases; price increases have had a nominal effect on sales
levels.


Gross Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined in 1995 compared to 1994 and
1993 due to higher labor costs and a change in product mix.  The inclusion
of Labsphere sales in 1995 also contributed to the margin decline; gross
profit earned on the sales of those products is typically less than gross
profit earned on sales of X-Rite products.

Selling and Marketing Expenses

As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses increased slightly
in 1995 when compared with 1994.  The increase was due to higher trade show
costs and increased marketing expenditures for new product introductions. 
Spending levels in 1993 reflected an increased investment that year in
sales and marketing staffing and additional advertising and promotion costs
associated with new product introductions.  The Company will continue to
invest in its sales and marketing efforts in order to position itself for
continued long-term growth in new and existing markets.


Engineering, General and Administrative

Engineering, general and administrative ("EG&A") expenses increased as a
percentage of sales in 1995 compared to 1994 due to several factors.  The
Company continued to increase its investment commitment to its foreign
subsidiary operations, where management believes the greatest long-term
sales growth opportunities exist.  Costs to fully absorb the Colorgen
assets acquired in 1994 were higher than expected in 1995 as the Company
made investments to ramp up that product line for future growth, in
addition to incurring costs to reorganize and streamline those operations. 
EG&A expenses in 1995 also included amortization of Labsphere costs in
excess of net assets acquired and amortization of Colorgen databases; those
expenses were not comparable to 1994 costs.  Additional salaries and other
costs were also incurred in 1995 in anticipation of sales growth that was
greater than actual results.  EG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were
comparable in 1994 and 1993.


Research and Development

As a result of the Company's ongoing commitment to future product
developments, research and development ("R&D") expenditures have increased
in each of the last three years.  As a percentage of sales, R&D spending
increased in 1995 compared to 1994 due to a conscious effort by the Company
to invest more resources in this important activity.  The decline in R&D
spending, as a percentage of sales, from 1993 to 1994 was a result of
spending not keeping pace with the significant sales growth that year.

In addition to the R&D costs reported as operating expenses, there were
costs incurred to develop new software products in each of the last three
years that were not included with R&D expenses.  Those costs were
capitalized and the related amortization expense was included in cost of
sales (see Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements). Software
development costs capitalized were $833,000, $658,000 and $350,000 in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company will continue increasing its
investment in leading edge technology in order to advance efforts in
strategic product development.

Other Income

Interest income earned in 1995 was less than 1994 and 1993 due to a
reduction in funds available for investment.  Substantially all of the
Company's short-term investments were used in February of 1995 to acquire
Labsphere and to retire Labsphere's long-term debt.  Interest income earned
in 1994 and 1993 was indicative of the funds available to invest and of the
tax-exempt investment yields during those years.


Income Taxes

The effective tax rate in 1995 was 32.8% compared to 31.2% in 1994.  The
increase was due mainly to nondeductible amortization of costs in excess of
net assets acquired in 1995 and higher foreign income taxes.  The increase
in the 1994 effective tax rate over the 1993 rate of 27.9% was primarily
due to the statutory federal tax rate being increased to thirty-five
percent from thirty-four percent, in addition to a onetime benefit
recognized in 1993 due to the adoption of new income tax accounting rules.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

X-Rite has maintained a strong financial position with excellent liquidity. 
Cash provided by operating activities in 1995 was a record $12 million. 
Working capital on December 31, 1995 was $28.3 million, representing a
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 8.8:1.

The most significant investment transaction in 1995 was the purchase of
100% of the outstanding stock of Labsphere for $11.5 million.  Shortly
after the acquisition, the Company retired $1.8 million of Labsphere's
long-term debt.  Cash from the liquidation of short-term investments was
used to fund the acquisition and subsequent retirement of long-term debt. 
Capital expenditures in 1995 included $2.4 million to purchase equipment
and $4 million to purchase a building and land adjacent to X-Rite's
existing headquarters; those expenditures were financed with cash flow from
operations.  The Company expects capital expenditures in 1996 to total $2.5
million and will consist mainly of machinery and equipment. 

Management expects that X-Rite's current liquidity, combined with cash flow
from future operations and the Company's $20 million revolving credit
agreement, will be sufficient to finance the Company's operations, capital
expenditures and dividends in 1996.

Inflation

The Company has experienced the effects of inflation on its business
through increases in the cost of services, employee compensation and fringe
benefits.  Although modest adjustments to selling prices have mitigated the
effects of inflation, the Company continues to explore ways to improve
productivity and reduce operating costs.  The Company does not anticipate
any significant adverse impact from inflation in the coming year.

Substantially all of the Company's foreign transactions are invoiced and
paid in U.S. dollars.

                  Report of Independent Public Accountants




To the Shareholders of X-Rite, Incorporated:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of X-Rite,
Incorporated (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of X-Rite, Incorporated
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

Short-Term Investments:
Short-term investments consist primarily of municipal bonds and tax-exempt
industrial revenue bonds.  All of the Company's short-term investments are
stated at the amortized cost, which approximates market, and are classified
as available for sale.  Short-term investments at December 31, 1995 include
securities with original maturities of greater than three months and
remaining maturities of less than one year.

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in
first-out basis, or market.  Components of inventories at December 31 are
summarized as follows:
                                        1995          1994
                                     -----------   -----------
       Raw materials                 $ 4,399,000   $ 3,294,000
       Work in process                 3,523,000     5,044,000
       Finished goods                  4,913,000     4,520,000
                                     -----------   -----------
                                     $12,835,000   $12,858,000
                                     ===========   ===========

Plant, Equipment and Depreciation:
Plant and equipment are stated at cost and include expenditures for major
renewals and betterments.  Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the
lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. 
Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets.  Estimated depreciable lives
are as follows: buildings and improvements 5 to 32 years; machinery and
equipment, 3 to 10 years; and furniture and office equipment, 3 to 7 years. 

Computer Software Development Costs:
The Company capitalized $833,000, $658,000 and $350,000 of software
development costs during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Amortization of software development costs is computed using the straight-
line method over a three-year period.  Amortization expense was $462,000,
$172,000 and $58,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The net
capitalized software development costs included in other assets are
$1,163,000 and $778,000 as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Amounts expended to achieve technological feasibility are included in
research and development expenses.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

Costs in Excess of Net Assets Acquired:
Substantially all of X-Rite's costs in excess of net assets acquired result
from the 1995 acquisition of Labsphere, Inc. (see Note 6).  These costs are
being amortized using the straight-line method over twenty years.  At each
balance sheet date, the recoverability of these costs is evaluated by
determining whether the unamortized balance can be recovered through
undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired businesses. 
Accumulated amortization of excess acquisition costs was $511,000 and
$20,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Income Taxes:
The provision for income taxes is based on earnings reported in the
financial statements.  Deferred income taxes are recognized for all
temporary differences between tax and financial reporting.

Revenue Recognition:
Revenue is recognized when a product is shipped or a service is performed. 

Advertising Costs:
Advertising costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and
totaled $2,172,000, $1,773,000 and $1,623,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Stock Split:
On November 15, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-
one stock split, paid December 27, 1994, in the form of a 100% stock
dividend to shareholders of record on December 15, 1994.  All references to
the number of common shares and per share amounts in the financial
statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive
basis.

Per Share Data:
Earnings per share were computed based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding.  For 1995,
1994 and 1993, these weighted averages were 21,172,436, 21,078,054 and
20,978,136 shares, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation:
Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are translated into United States
dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year end.  Income statement
accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during
the year.  The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate
component of shareholders' investment.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates;
however, management believes that any subsequent revisions to estimates
used would not have a material effect on the financial condition or results
of operations of the Company.

Reclassifications:
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' consolidated
financial statements to conform with the 1995 presentation.


NOTE 3--REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT

The Company maintains a revolving line of credit agreement with a bank
which provides for maximum borrowings of $20,000,000 with interest at 1.5%
over the "Effective Federal Funds Rate" (6.23% at December 31, 1995).  The
borrowings are unsecured and no compensating balances are required by the
agreement.  There were no significant borrowings under this agreement
during 1995, 1994 or 1993.


NOTE 4--INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes at December 31 consisted of the following:

                                    1995         1994         1993

NOTE 6--ACQUISITIONS

In February of 1995 the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of
Labsphere, Inc. ("Labsphere") for $11,500,000 in cash.  The acquisition was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was funded by
short-term investments.  Labsphere is a leading manufacturer of light
measurement and light source integrating sphere systems and
instrumentation.  Had the acquisition of Labsphere occurred on January 1,
1994, net sales, net income and earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 1994 would have been $66,419,999, $12,076,000 and $.57,
respectively (unaudited).  

In July of 1994, the Company acquired from the First National Bank of
Boston substantially all of the assets of Colorgen, Inc. ("Colorgen") for
$4,500,000 in cash, funded by short-term investments.  The Company has
discontinued the product lines previously marketed by Colorgen.  The
primary objective of the acquisition was to obtain paint formulation
databases. These databases are costly and time-consuming to develop, and
are currently being used in connection with certain of the Company s
existing products.
