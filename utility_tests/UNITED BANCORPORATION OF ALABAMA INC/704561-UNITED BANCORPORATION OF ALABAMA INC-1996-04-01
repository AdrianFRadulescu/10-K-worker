                                   PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

United Bancorporation of Alabama, Inc. (the "Corporation") is a one-bank
holding company with headquarters in Atmore, Alabama.  The Corporation was
incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 8, 1982 for the purpose of
acquiring all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of The Bank of
Atmore, Atmore, Alabama ("Atmore") and Peoples Bank, Frisco City, Alabama
("Peoples").  Atmore was merged into United Bank of Atmore, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Corporation, and Peoples was merged into United Bank of
Frisco City ("Frisco City"), also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation,
later in 1982.  Effective March 30, 1984, Frisco City merged into United Bank
of Atmore, which had previously changed its name to simply "United Bank."

The Corporation and its subsidiary, United Bank (herein "United Bank" or the
"Bank"), are in one business segment, commercial banking.  United Bank
contributes substantially all of the total operating revenues and consolidated
assets of the Corporation.  The Bank serves its customers from four banking
offices located in Atmore, Frisco City, Monroeville and Flomaton, Alabama.

United Bank offers a broad range of banking services.  Services to business
customers include providing checking and time deposit accounts and various
types of lending services.  Services provided to individual customers include
checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts, statement
savings accounts, and various other time deposit savings programs and loans,
including business, personal, automobile and home improvement loans.  United
Bank offers securities brokerage services, Visa and Master Card, multi-purpose,
nationally recognized credit card services, and trust service through Bank
South of Atlanta, Georgia.

Competition - The commercial banking business is highly competitive and United
Bank competes actively with state and national banks, savings and loan
associations and credit unions in its market areas for deposits and loans.  In
addition, United Bank competes with  other financial institutions, including
personal loan companies, leasing companies, finance companies and certain
governmental agencies, all of which engage in marketing various types of loans
and other services.  The regulatory environment affects competition  in the
bank business as well.

Employees - The Corporation and its subsidiary had approximately 83 full-time
officers and employees at December 31, 1995.  All of the employees are engaged
in the operations of United Bank.  The Corporation considers its employee
relations good, and has not experienced and does not anticipate any work
stoppage attributable to labor disputes.





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
Supervision, Regulation and Government Policy - Bank holding companies, banks
and many of their nonbank affiliates are extensively regulated under both
federal and state law.  The following brief summary of certain statutes, rules
and regulations affecting the Corporation and the Bank is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions
referred to below, and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the
statutes or regulations applicable to the Corporation's business.  Any change
in applicable law or regulations could have a material effect on the business
of the Corporation and its subsidiary.  Supervision, regulation and examination
of banks by bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection
of depositors rather than holders of Corporation common stock.

         The Corporation is registered as a bank holding company with the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act").  As such, the
Corporation is subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting
requirements in the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.  The
BHC Act prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company from
engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the
voting stock of any company engaged in non-banking activities.  Activities
expressly found by the Board of Governors, by order or regulation, to be so
closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper
incident thereto, such as acting as fiduciary or investment or financial
advisor, selling or underwriting insurance coverage directly related to
extensions of credit, and the leasing of real and personal property, are
excepted from this prohibition.

         The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve before it may acquire substantially all of the
assets of any bank or control of any voting shares of any bank, if, after such
acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of
the voting shares of such bank.  The BHC Act requires the Federal Reserve to
consider, among other things, anticompetitive effects, financial and managerial
resources and community needs in reviewing such a transaction.  Under the
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, enacted in
September 1994, bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks located
in any state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under any
state law (except that states may establish a minimum age of not more than five
years for local banks subject to interstate acquisitions by out-of-state bank
holding companies), and interstate branching will be permitted beginning in
1997.

         The Alabama Banking Code generally prohibits branching across county
lines within the state, but also provides that with the prior approval of the
Superintendent of the Alabama State Department of Banking ("Superintendent"),
state banks are entitled to all privileges granted to federally chartered or
regulated





                                       4
<PAGE>   5
banks.  As a result of action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
to permit branching across county lines in 1990, the Superintendent authorized
branching by Alabama-chartered banks without geographic restriction.
Accordingly, if United Bank desired, it could expand by branching within
Alabama subject to the required approvals described herein.

         The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank.
Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying
funds to the Corporation, generally limiting such transactions to 10% of the
Bank's capital and surplus.  Such transactions, including extensions of credit,
sales of securities or assets and provision of services, also must be on terms
and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, including
credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to
the Bank as prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated
companies.  Also, as a subsidiary of a bank holding company, the Bank is
generally prohibited from conditioning the extension of credit or other
services, or conditioning the lease or sale of property, on the customer's
agreement to obtain or furnish some additional credit, property or service from
or to such subsidiary or an affiliate.

         The Bank is a state bank, subject to state banking laws and
regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Alabama State Department
of Banking (the "Department"), and as a member of the Bank Insurance Fund
("BIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), is also
subject to FDIC regulation and examination.  Areas subject to federal and state
regulation include dividend payments, reserves, investments, loans, interest
rates, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of securities, borrowings,
establishment of branches and other aspects of operation, including compliance
with truth-in-lending and usury laws, and regulators have the right to prevent
the development or continuance of unsound banking practices or other violations
of law.

         Dividends from United Bank constitute the major source of funds for
dividends to be paid by the Corporation.  United Bank is subject to state law
restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, including the general
restrictions that dividends in excess of 90% of United Bank's net earnings may
not be declared or paid unless United Bank's surplus is at least equal to 20%
of its capital, and that the prior written approval of the Superintendent of
the Department is required if the total of all dividends declared in any
calendar year exceeds the total of United Bank's net earnings of that year
combined with its retained net earnings of the preceding two years, less any
required transfers to surplus.  United Bank is subject to restrictions under
Alabama law which also prohibit any dividends from being made from surplus
without the Superintendent's prior written approval.  Federal bank regulatory
agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured
banks and bank holding companies if such payment is deemed to constitute an
unsafe and unsound practice.  United Bank's ability to make funds available to
the Corporation also is subject





                                       5
<PAGE>   6
to restrictions imposed by federal law on the ability of a bank to extend
credit to its parent company, to purchase the assets thereof, to issue a
guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf thereof or to invest in the
stock or securities thereof or to take such stock or securities as collateral
for loans to any borrower.

         The Bank is also subject to the requirements of the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA").  The CRA and the regulations implementing the
CRA are intended to encourage regulated financial institutions to help meet the
credit needs of their local community, including low and moderate income
neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of financial
institutions.  The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's records is made
available to the public.

         The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA") recapitalized the BIF and included numerous substantially revised
statutory provisions.  FDICIA established five capital tiers for insured
depository institutions: "well capitalized", "adequately capitalized",
"undercapitalized", "significantly undercapitalized", and "critically
undercapitalized", as defined by regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve,
the FDIC and other federal depository institution regulatory agencies.  At
December 31, 1995, the Bank was "well capitalized", and was not subject to
restrictions imposed for failure to satisfy applicable capital requirements.
BIF premiums for each member financial institution depend upon the risk
assessment classification assigned to the institution by the FDIC.  The total
current assessment for the first six months of 1996 for United Bank was $1,000.

         Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials.  In
general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and
other borrowings and the interest rate received by the bank on its loans and
securities holdings constitutes the major portion of the bank's earnings.  As a
result, the earnings and business of the Corporation are and will be affected
by economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also by the
policies of various regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the
Corporation and the Bank, especially the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve,
among other functions, regulates the supply of credit and deals with general
economic conditions within the United States.  The instruments of monetary
policy employed by the Federal Reserve for those purposes influence in various
ways the overall level of investments, loans and other extensions of credit and
deposits and the interest rates paid on liabilities and received on assets.
The Congress continues to consider a number of wide- ranging proposals for
altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of the
nation's financial institutions.  It cannot be predicted whether or in what
form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which the business
of the Corporation may be effected thereby.

Investments - The investment policy of United Bank provides that funds that are
not otherwise needed to meet the loan demand of United Bank's market area can
best be invested to earn maximum return for the Bank, yet still maintain
sufficient liquidity to meet fluctuations in the Bank's loan demand and deposit
structure.  Approximately 43% of the Bank's assets are in investment securities
held to maturity and securities available for sale.  The Bank's loan policy
establishes a desirable range for its loan to deposit ratio as being between
50% and 70%.  This ratio as of December 31, 1995, was above the low end of this
range at 55.23%.  Growth in the loan portfolio is driven by general economic
conditions and the availability  of loans meeting the Bank's credit quality
standards.  Current Bank strategy is to expand the loan portfolio.  Management
intends that funding for this growth will come from small deposit growth and
reallocation of maturing investments.


Securities Portfolio - The Bank's investment policy as approved by the Board of
Directors dictates approved types of securities and the conditions under which
they may be held.  Attention is paid to the maturity and risks associated with
each investment.  The distribution reflected in the tables below could vary
with conditions and maturities.  The Corporation believes the level of risks
inherent in the securities portfolio is low.

Due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("FAS 115")
by the Corporation as of January 1, 1994, the categorization of the
Corporation's investment securities changed dramatically.  As noted in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the Corporation included under Item 8
below, the Bank transferred $31,145,694 in securities from held to maturity to
available for sale in accordance with FAS 115 on January 1, 1994.  In addition,
the Corporation transferred, effective November 30, 1995, investment securities
totaling $7,851,246 from held to maturity to available for sale in conjunction
with the FASB Special Report "A Guide to Implementation of Statement No. 115 on
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities - Questions
and Answers" issued in November 1995.  For additional information regarding
adoption of FAS 115 see footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8 below.

(1)  Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a full federal
tax-equivalent basis using an income tax rate of 34% for 1995 and 1994.

Relative Lending Risk - United Bank is located in a rural market composed of
lower to middle income families.  The primary economic influence in the area is
timber and agricultural production, and the Bank's loan portfolio is reflective
of this market.  The Bank's ratio of loans to assets or deposits is at or above
the average of banks serving this market.

The risks associated with the Bank's lending are primarily interest rate risk
and risks from concentrations or types of loans.

Interest rate risk is a function of the maturity of the loan and method of
pricing.  The Bank's loan maturity distribution reflects 28.04% of the
portfolio maturing in one year or less.  In addition, 31.08% of all loans float
with an interest rate index.  The maturity distribution and floating rate loans
help protect the Bank from unexpected interest rate changes.

Loan concentrations present different risk profiles depending on the type of
loan.  The majority of all types of loans offered by the Bank are
collateralized.  Regardless of the type of loan, collateralized lending is
based upon an evaluation of the collateral and repayment ability of the
borrower.  Independent evaluations are utilized to determine appropriate loan
amounts.  Loan policy, as approved by the Board of Directors of the bank
subsidiary, establishes collateral guidelines for each type of loan.

Small banks located in one community experience a much higher risk due to the
dependence on the economic viability of that single community.  United Bank is
more geographically diverse than its local competitors.  With offices in four
communities, the Bank is somewhat insulated from the effects of major economic
disruptions in one community.  This geographic diversity affects all types of
loans and plays a part in the Bank's risk management.

Each type of loan exhibits unique profiles of risk that could threaten
repayment.

Commercial loans, which comprised 27.42% of the portfolio, require an
understanding of the customers' business and financial performance.  This
Bank's commercial customers are primarily small to middle market enterprises.
The larger commercial accounts are managed by the Senior Loan Officer.  Risks
in this category are primarily economic.  Shifts in local and regional
conditions could have an effect on individual borrowers;  but, as previously
mentioned, the Bank spreads this risk by serving multiple communities.  As with
the other categories, these loans are typically collateralized by assets of the
borrower.  In most situations, the personal assets of the business owners also
collateralize the credit.

Agricultural lending is a specialized type of lending for the Bank.  Due to the
unique characteristics in this type of loan, the Bank has a loan officer
dedicated to this market.  Collateral valuation and the experience of the
borrower play heavily into the approval process.  This loan category would
include financing of equipment, crop production, timber, dairy operations and
others.  Given the broad range of loans offered, it is difficult to generalize
risks in agricultural lending.  The area of greatest attention and risk would
be crop production loans.  Risks associated with catastrophic crop losses are
mitigated by crop insurance, government support programs, experience of the
borrower, collateral other than the crop and the borrower's financial
resources.  Routine visitations and contact with the borrower help inform the
Bank about crop conditions.

Real estate loans, whether they are construction or mortgage, have a very low
delinquency rate.  The Bank does not make long term, fixed rate mortgages;
however, it does offer loans with repayment terms based on amortization of up
to 15 years, but with balloons of shorter durations.

Installment loans comprised 31.02% of the portfolio and are generally
collateralized.  Given the small dollar exposure on each loan, risk of a
significant loss is minimized.  Pricing and closely monitoring past dues
enhance the Bank's returns from this type of loan and minimize risks.

An average loan in the loan portfolio is approximately $12,127.

Non-performing Assets:  The following table sets forth the Corporation's
non-performing assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994.  Under the Corporation's
nonaccrual policy, a loan is placed on nonaccrual status when collectibility of
principal and interest is in doubt or when principal and interest is 90 days or
more past due.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan, as amended by SFAS 118, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan--Income


                                       20

Recognition and Disclosures on January 1, 1995.  Under the provisions of SFAS
114 and 118, management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable
that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement.  When a loan is considered impaired,
the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the note's effective interest rate.  If the
loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to
determine the amount of impairment.  Impairment losses are included in the
reserve for possible loan losses through a charge to the provision for possible
loan lossess.  Subsequent recoveries are added to the reserve.  At December 31,
1995, pursuant to the definition within SFAS 114, the Corporation had $186,932
of impaired loans, with a related valuation allowance of $69,560.

         past due ninety days or more
         as to interest or principal
         payments (excluding balances

         been renegotiated to provide
         a reduction or deferral of
         interest or principal because
         of a deterioration in the
         financial position of the
         borrower.                                      13                 0

</TABLE>


If the loans in (A) above had been current throughout their term, interest
income would have been increased by approximately $9,363 and $5,234 for 1995
and 1994, respectively.  Of the assets in (D) above, $81,072 in 1995 was other
real estate owned (OREO), and $26,367 was repossessed collateral, and in 1994
$14,000 was OREO.

As of December 31, 1995, all loans which management had determined were
uncollectible were charged to the allowance for possible loan losses.

At December 31, 1995, approximately 121 loans at $1,915,471 were considered
potential problem loans.  Potential problem loans consist of those loans for
which management has serious doubts as to the borrower's ability to comply with
present loan repayment terms.

There may be additional loans in the Corporation's portfolio that may become
classified as conditions dictate.  However, management is not aware of any such
loans that are material in amount at December 31, 1995.  Regulatory examiners
may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.

Loan Concentrations:  On December 31, 1995, the Corporation had  $8,261,708 of
agriculture-related loans.  Agriculture loans accounted for $147,661 and
$20,244 of nonaccrual loans in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Allowance for Possible Loan Losses:  The allowance for possible loan losses is
maintained at a level which, in management's opinion, is adequate to absorb
potential losses in the portfolio.  Factors considered in determining the
adequacy of the allowance include historical loan loss experience, the amount
of past due loans, loans classified from the most recent regulatory
examinations and internal reviews, general economic conditions and the current
portfolio mix.  The amount charged to operating expenses is that amount
necessary to maintain the allowance for possible loan losses at a level
indicative of the associated risk, as determined by management, of the current
loan portfolio.

The table below reflects an allocation of the allowance for the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994.  The allocation represents an estimate of each
category of loans based upon historical experience and management's judgement.
Management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses,
and no assurances can be made that future charges to the loan loss allowance
will not be significant in relation to the amount provided during a particular
period, or that future evaluations of the loan portfolio based on conditions
then prevailing will not require sizable additions to the allowance, thus
necessitating similarly sizable charges to income.  Management does consider,
however, the allowance for loan losses to be adequate for the reported periods.

Delinquent Loan Policy:  Installment loans are placed on nonaccrual when the
loan is three payments past due, and any single-date maturity notes are placed
on nonaccrual when such notes are delinquent for ninety days.  Exceptions may
be made where there are extenuating circumstances, but any exception is subject
to review by the Board of Directors of the Bank.  Delinquent commercial loans
are placed on nonaccrual when the loan is 90 days past due.





                                       23
<PAGE>   24
Loans are considered delinquent if payments of principal or interest have not
been made by the end of periods ranging from one to ten days after the due
date, depending upon the type of loan involved.  Installment loans are
considered delinquent if payments of principal and interest are past due for a
period of ten days and commercial loans are considered delinquent if payments
of principal and interest are past due for a period of one day.  Single-date
maturity loans are considered delinquent if payments relating to such loans are
not made for a period of one day following the due date of such loans.

Loans are charged off quarterly in March, June, September, and December.  If
necessary, loans can be charged of at any time with the approval of the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO). The loan officer responsible for the particular loan
initiates the charge off request which then must be approved by the Bank's
senior loan officer and CEO.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Corporation's bank subsidiary occupies four offices which the subsidiary
owns.  The offices are located in Escambia County (cities of Atmore and
Flomaton) and Monroe County (cities of Monroeville and Frisco City), Alabama,
with the principal office located in Atmore, Alabama.  The office in Atmore is
a modern, three story, brick building while the other offices are similar,
modern, one story, brick buildings.  The subsidiary bank also leases land near
the Atmore office on which a drive through teller facility is located.  The

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

All material pending legal proceedings described under Item 3 in the
Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December
31, 1994 have been terminated as described therein or in the Corporation's
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 1995 and
September 30, 1995.  There are presently no pending legal proceedings to which
the Corporation or its subsidiary, United Bank, is a party or of which any of
their property is subject, which management of the Corporation, based upon
consultation with legal counsel, believes are likely to have a material adverse
effect upon the financial position of the Corporation.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.

                                    PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS


The Corporation's authorized common shares consist of the following:

(1)      975,000 shares of Class A common stock, $.01 par value per share, of
         which 516,385 shares were issued and outstanding and held by
         approximately 479 shareholders of record, as of March 21, 1996.

(2)      250,000 shares of Class B common stock, $.01 par value per share, none
         of which were issued, as of March 21, 1996.


There is no established public trading market for the shares of common stock of
the Corporation and there can be no assurance that any market will develop.

The Corporation paid total cash dividends of $.50 per share in 1995 and $.50
per share in 1994.  The Corporation expects to continue to pay cash dividends,
subject to the earnings and financial condition of the Corporation and other
relevant factors;  however, dividends on the Corporation's common stock are
declared and paid based on a variety of considerations by the Corporation's
Board of Directors and there can be no assurance that the Corporation will
continue to pay regular dividends or as to the amount of any such dividends.
Payment of future dividends will depend upon business conditions, operating
results, capital and reserve requirements and the Board's consideration of
other relevant factors.  In addition, the ability of the Corporation to pay
dividends is totally dependent on dividends received from its banking
subsidiary (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) and is
subject to statutory restrictions on dividends applicable to Delaware
corporations, including the restrictions that dividends generally may be paid
only from a corporation's surplus or from its net profits for the fiscal year
in which the dividend is declared and the preceding year.  The Corporation is
subject to state law restrictions on its ability to pay dividends.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following financial review is presented to provide an analysis of the
consolidated results of operations of the Corporation and its subsidiary.  This
review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
included under Item 8.



                             SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

The Corporation's 1995 net income was $1,230,362, as compared to a net income
in 1994 of $824,549.  Average net interest spread declined by .35% from 4.54%
in 1994 to 4.19% in 1995.  The decline in average net interest spread, offset
by an increase in average interest earning assets from $118,919,000 in 1994 to
$123,133,000 in 1995, produced a $29,909 increase in net interest income in
1995.  Noninterest income decreased by $71,611 from $1,228,297 in 1994 to
$1,156,686 in 1995.  Most of this decrease is attributed to the decrease in
other noninterest income from $245,614 in 1994 to $127,830 in 1995.  The
provision for loan losses in 1995 was $204,000 as compared to $330,000 in 1994.
Noninterest expenses for 1995 decreased $500,515 from $5,655,541 in 1994 to
$5,155,026 in 1995.  This decrease is due to the settlement of the Barnett
Litigation in 1994 which was described under "Item 3. Legal Proceedings, in the
Corporation's Annual Report Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 1994," and
the reduction in the FDIC premiums.

The Corporation's 1994 net income was $824,549, as compared to a net income in
1993 of $1,369,748.  Average net interest spread declined by .35% from 4.89% in
1993 to 4.54% in 1994.  The decline in average net interest spread, offset by
an increase in average interest earning assets from $116,754,000 in 1993 to
$118,919,000 in 1994, produced a $259,195 decrease in net interest income in
1994.  Noninterest income decreased by $710,723 from $1,939,020 in 1993 to
$1,228,297 in 1994.  Most of this decrease is attributed to the gain on the
sale of investments which decreased $867,445.  The provision for loan losses in
1994 was $330,000 as compared to $600,000 in 1993.  Noninterest expenses for
1994 were well in line with 1993, with the exception of legal expenses which
decreased by $672,823.  This decrease was offset by the settlement of the
Barnett Litigation which was described under "Item 3. Legal Proceedings, in
1994 10-K."

(1) Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a full federal
tax-equivalent (FTE) basis using an income tax rate of 34% for 1995, 1994, and
1993.

Total interest income (on a full Federal tax equivalent basis) increased to
$10,745,000 in 1995, from $9,651,000 in 1994, an increase of $1,094,000, or
11.34%.  This increase is primarily due to the average earning assets
increasing $4,214,000.  Average loans increased $6,880,000 while the average
rate paid increased .70%.  The average interest rate (FTE) earned in 1995 rose
to 8.68% from 8.08% in 1994.  The interest rate spread decreased from 4.54% in
1994 to 4.19% in 1995, as interest rates increased more rapidly on interest
bearing liabilities than interest earning assets.  Average taxable investment
securities for 1995 were $48,928,000, as compared to $53,903,000 for 1994, a
decrease of $4,975,000, or 9.23%.  The shift from investments to loans was due
to an increase in the Bank's loan demand.  Average tax-exempt investment
securities increased $682,000, or 11.68%, to $6,517,000 in 1995 from $5,835,000
in 1994.  The average volume of federal funds sold increased to $5,197,000 in
1995 from $3,508,000 in 1994, an increase of $1,689,000 or 48.15%.  Average
interest earning deposits with other financial institutions decreased to
$105,000 in 1995, from $167,000 in 1994.

Total interest expense increased $1,042,000, or 29.62% to $4,560,000 in 1995,
from $3,518,000 in 1994.  This increase was primarily due to rising interest
rates during 1995.  The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in
1995 was 4.49% as compared to 3.54% in 1994.  Average interest-bearing
liabilities increased to $101,593,000 in 1995, from $99,498,000 in 1994, an
increase of $2,095,000, or 2.11%.  Average savings and interest-bearing demand
deposits decreased $3,795,000 or 10.29% to $33,070,000 in 1995, from
$36,865,000 in 1994.  Average time

deposits increased to $62,121,000 in 1995, from $57,904,000 in 1994, an
increase of $4,217,000, or 7.28%.  The average rate paid on time deposits
increased to 5.37% in 1995 from 4.00% in 1994.  The reason for the increase in
time deposits during 1995 was that the interest rate on savings became less
attractive than the interest paid on time deposits as interest rates rose;
therefore, customers chose the higher interest rate investment available.

Total interest income (on a full Federal tax equivalent basis) decreased to
$9,651,000 in 1994, from $9,793,000 in 1993, a decrease of $142,000, or 1.45%.
This decrease was primarily due to the earning asset mix for the first half of
the year.  When loan demand picked up, interest income began to improve.  The
average interest rate (FTE) earned in 1994 fell to 8.09% from 8.39% in 1993.
The interest rate spread decreased from 4.89% in 1993 to 4.54% in 1994, as
interest rates increased more rapidly on interest bearing liabilities than
interest earning assets.  Average interest earning assets increased by
$2,165,000, or 1.85%, to $118,919,000 in 1994 from $116,754,000 in 1993.
Average taxable investment securities for 1994 were $53,903,000, as compared to
$55,025,000 for 1993, a decrease of $1,122,000, or 2.03%.  The shift from
investments to loans was due to an increase in the Bank's loan demand.  Average
tax-exempt investment securities decreased $364,000, or 5.87%, to $5,835,000 in
1994 from $6,199,000 in 1993.  Average loans increased during 1994 to
$55,506,000, from $51,157,000 in 1993, an increase of $4,349,000, or 8.5%.  The
average volume of federal funds sold decreased to $3,508,000 in 1994 from
$4,167,000 in 1993, a decrease of $659,000 or 15.81%.  Certificates of deposit
with other financial institutions decreased to $167,000 in 1994, from $206,000
in 1993.

Total interest expense increased $87,000, or 2.54% to $3,518,000 in 1994, from
$3,431,000 in 1993.  This increase was primarily due to rising interest rates
during 1994.  The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in 1994 was
3.54% as compared to 3.50% in 1993.  Average interest-bearing liabilities
increased to $99,498,000 in 1994, from $98,151,000 in 1993, an increase of
$1,347,000, or 1.37%.  Average savings and interest-bearing demand deposits
decreased $43,000 or .12% to $36,865,000 in 1994, from $36,908,000 in 1993.
Average time deposits increased to $57,904,000 in 1994, from $56,637,000 in
1993, an increase of $1,267,000, or 2.24%.  The average rate paid on time
deposits increased to 4.00% in 1994 from 3.99% in 1993.  The reason for the
increase in time deposits during 1994 was that the interest rate on savings
became less attractive than the interest paid on time deposits;  therefore,
customers chose the higher interest rate investment available.


                           PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

The provision for possible loan losses for the year ended December 31, 1995 was
$204,000, as compared to $330,000 in 1994, a decrease of $126,000, or 38.18%.
This decrease in provision reflects improved trends and maintains the allowance
that is adequate by





                                       32

management, and approved by the Board of Directors of the subsidiary bank.

Loans charged-off in 1995 decreased to $150,896, from $338,666 in 1994, a
decrease of $187,770.  Recoveries of charged- off loans in 1995 were $38,983, a
decrease of $47,239 as compared to $86,222 in 1994.  Net charged-off loans for
1995 were $111,913, as compared to $252,444 for 1994, a decrease of $140,531.
This decrease is a result of improved asset quality in the bank.  The allowance
for possible loans losses at December 31, 1995 represents 2.07% of gross loans,
excluding bankers acceptances and commercial paper, as compared to 2.04% at
year end 1994.  Loans on which the accrual of interest had been discontinued or
reduced amounted to $333,002 on December 31, 1995, as compared to $162,844 at
year end 1994.

The provision for possible loan losses on December 31, 1994 was $330,000, as
compared to $600,000 in 1993, a decrease of $270,000, or 45.00%.  This reserve
amount was determined to be adequate by management, and approved by the Board
of Directors of the subsidiary bank.

Loans charged-off in 1994 decreased to $338,000, from $388,000 in 1993, a
decrease of $50,000.  Recoveries of charged-off loans in 1994 were $86,000, an
increase of $12,000 as compared to $75,000 in 1993.  Net charged-off loans for
1994 were $252,000, as compared to $313,000 for 1993, a decrease of $62,000.
The allowance for possible loans losses at December 31, 1994 represented 2.04%
of gross loans, excluding bankers acceptances and commercial paper, as compared
to 2.21% at year end 1993.  Loans on which the accrual of interest had been
discontinued or reduced amounted to $162,844 on December 31, 1994, as compared
to $350,908 at year end 1993.

The provision for loan losses is based upon management's continuing evaluation
of current economic conditions, changes in the character and size of the loan
portfolio, past loan loss experience, underlying collateral value securing
loans and other factors which deserve recognition in providing a reasonable
allowance for potential credit losses inherent in the portfolio.

While it is the Corporation's policy to charge-off loans on which a loss is
considered probable, there also exists the risk of future losses which cannot
be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans.
Because this risk is continually changing in response to factors beyond the
control of the Corporation, such as the state of the economy, management's
judgment as to the adequacy of the provision is necessarily approximate and
imprecise.  Adjustments to the provision for loan losses and the allowance for
loan losses may also be required by the FDIC or the Alabama Superintendent of
Banks in the course of their examinations of the Corporation's banking
subsidiary where the regulators make credit evaluations  different from those
of management.  Accordingly, no assurances can be given that continued
evaluations of the loan portfolio in light of economic conditions then
prevailing, results of upcoming regulatory examinations and other factors will
not require significant future additions to the allowance, thus necessitating
similarly sizable charges to income.

Total noninterest income decreased $71,611 or 5.83%, to $1,156,686 in 1995, as
compared to $1,228,297 in 1994.  Net gains on sale of investment securities
during 1995 totalled $31,867, as compared to a gain of $14,150 in 1994.  In
1995, the Corporation sold some available for sale investment securities in
order to fund growing loan demand.  These securities were mostly mortgage
backed securities which had paid down significantly and which were no longer
cost effective to carry in the portfolio.

Service charge income increased to $908,838 in 1995, from $872,299 in 1994, an
increase of $36,539, or 4.19%.  This slight increase is due to a change in the
calculation of analysis charges on certain checking accounts.  Commissions on
credit life insurance decreased $8,083, or 8.40%, to $88,151 in 1995, from
$96,234 in 1994.  Other income decreased to $127,830 in 1995, from $245,614 in
1994, a decrease of $117,784, or 47.95%.  The decrease in other income in 1995
was similarly attributable to a dividend from Risk Associates of approximately
$60,000, and the recognition of deferred income on the sale of other real
estate owned of $66,000, each of which occurred in 1994 and not in 1995.

Total noninterest income decreased $710,723 or 36.65%, to $1,228,297 in 1994,
as compared to $1,939,020 in 1993.  Net gains on sale of investment securities
during 1994 totalled $14,150, as compared to a gain of $881,595 in 1993.  In
1994, the Corporation sold some investment securities in order to fund growing
loan demand.  A gain of $865,209 was realized in 1993 through the sale of GIC
bonds (Executive Life) which had been written down in previous years.  The
bonds regained a significant amount of their market value and were sold in
February and March of 1993.  This transaction accounted for 98.14% of net gains
in 1993.

Service charge income increased to $872,299 in 1994, from $864,587 in 1993, an
increase of $7,712, or .89%.  Commissions on credit life insurance increased
$21,578, or 28.90%, to $96,234 in 1994, from $74,656 in 1993.  Other income
increased to $245,614 in 1994, from $118,182 in 1993, an increase of $127,432,
or 107.83%.  The majority of the increased income in 1994 resulted from a
dividend from Risk Associates of approximately $60,000, and the recognition of
deferred income on the sale of other real estate owned of $66,000.

agriculture loans decreased to $26,082,499 at year end 1995, from $29,236,390
at December 31, 1994.  Most of the decrease of $3,153,891 can be attributed to
repayments on two major loans in the last half of the year.  Installment loans
to individuals increased to $20,185,236 at December 31, 1995, from $17,061,301
at year end 1994, an increase of $3,123,935, or 18.31%.  This increase is the
result of more emphasis being placed on consumer loans bankwide, including
hiring of new personnel and expansion of banking hours more accessible for
customers.  The ratio of loans, excluding bankers acceptances and commercial
paper, to deposits on December 31, 1995, was 55.26%, as compared to 53.79% in
1994.

agriculture loans increased to $29,236,390 at year end 1994, from $27,647,903
at December 31, 1993.  Most of the increase of $1,588,487 wa attributable to an

from $12,748,063 at year end 1993, an increase of $4,313,238, or 33.83%.  Some
of that increase was due to loans secured by non-farm and non-residential
properties, which increased $1,607,934.  The ratio of loans, excluding bankers
acceptances and commercial paper, to deposits on December 31, 1994, was 53.79%,

                                   LIQUIDITY

"Liquidity" refers to the Corporation's ability to meet its cash flow
requirements and to fund its commitments.  The Corporation and its subsidiary
actively manage the levels, types and maturities of earning assets in relation
to the sources available to fund current and future needs in an effort to
ensure the availability of adequate funding at all times.  The goal of
liquidity management is to ensure the availability of an adequate level of
funds to meet loan demand and the deposit withdrawal needs of the Corporation's
customers.

As of December 31, 1995, the Corporation's liquidity was adequate.  In addition
to $7,550,000 in federal funds sold, the Bank's cash and due from banks also
had a balance of $6,225,385.  At December 31, 1995 the loan to deposit ratio
was 55.26%, excluding bankers acceptances and commercial paper.  The Bank does
not foresee any future problems with liquidity, but if needed, they have a
federal funds line of credit that totals $8,000,000.  The Corporation's bank
subsidiary has an Asset and Liability Committee which has as its primary
objective the maintenance of specific funding and investment strategies to
achieve short-term and long-term financial goals.

As revealed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Corporation
generates the majority of its cash flows from financing activities.  Financing
activities produced $6,296,136 in cash in 1995, with the majority of this
coming from a net increase in deposits and repurchase agreements.  The
investing activities of the Corporation used $7,429,673 of the cash flows of
the Bank.  Of this use of cash, $11,806,339 was the net outflow into the loan
portfolio.  Investments maturing and proceeds from sales helped to fund these
additional loans.  Operations provided $2,137,335 in cash flows for the year
end December 31, 1995.

The Corporation's sensitivity to changes in interest rates in conjunction with
the structure of interest rate spreads determines the impact of interest rates
on the Corporation's performance.  Therefore, interest rate shock scenarios are
performed.  In a rising interest rate scenario, the Corporation's prime rate
increases 300 basis points over the next twelve months.  In the falling
interest rate case, the Corporation's prime rate drops 275 basis points over
the next twelve months.  The projected net interest margin in a stable interest
rate environment is 4.92%, as compared to 4.97% in a rising rate scenario and
4.33% in a falling rate scenario.  Management considers these interest rate
movements to be worst case scenarios.  Any business or strategic plans the
Corporation may implement in a rising or falling rate environment are not taken
into account in developing interest rate scenarios.


                               CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Corporation relies primarily on internally generated capital growth to
maintain capital adequacy.  The average assets to average equity ratio during
1995 was 8.73% as compared to 8.69% in 1994.  Total stockholders equity on
December 31, 1995 was $12,397,538, an increase of $1,726,869, or 16.18%, from
$10,670,669 at year end 1994.  The Corporation's net operating profit during
1995, less dividends of $258,192 declared to stockholders, plus the FAS 115
adjustment of $754,699, accounted for this increase.  The Corporation's bank
subsidiary, United Bank, had risk based capital of $13,297,000, or 15.66%, at
December 31, 1995, well above the minimum risk based capital requirement of
$6,790,000 or 8.0%.  Based on management's projections, internally generated
capital should be sufficient to satisfy capital requirements in the foreseeable
future.

</TABLE>

(1)      Includes $7,638 contributed on behalf of Mr. Jones as a supplemental
         benefit pursuant to an Executive Compensation Agreement; $476 premium
         reimbursed by United Bank on a long-term disability insurance policy
         for Mr. Jones; $1,273 contributed by United Bank for the account of
         Mr. Jones pursuant to United Bank's 401(k) Employee Incentive Savings
         Plan (the "401(k) Plan"); $4,060 in fees for attendance at meetings of
         United Bank's Board of Directors; and $5,212 in profit-sharing
         payments made in 1995 for services in 1994.

         No fees are paid to directors of the Corporation for their services as
such.  Since all of the Corportion's directors also serve as directors of
United Bank, they are compensated for their services to United Bank.

         During 1995 all current directors of the Corporation also served as
directors of United Bank.  Each director of United Bank received a standard fee
for such service of $3,500, plus $40 (for directors who were members of the
Atmore Loan Committee) or $50 (for directors who were members of the Monroe
County Loan Committee) for each Board meeeting attended.  In 1995, United
Bank's Board of Directors held a total of 60 meetings:  12 monthly, two
quarterly, and two special.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Officers of the Corporation, and directors of the corporation who are also
directors of United Bank, are remunerated by United Bank, not by the
Corporation.  The Corporation's Board of Directors does not have a compensation
committee or a committee performing similar functions.  United Bank's Board of
Directors does have a compensation committee, which makes recommendations to
United Bank's Board of Directors regarding compensation to, among others,
persons who serve as executive officers of the Corporation.  Such compensation
committee is composed of five directors, all of whom


                                       44
<PAGE>   45
are outside directors who are not, and never have been, officers or employees
of the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof.  United Bank's Board of Directors
determines the compensation of officers, including those persons who serve as
executive officers of the Corporation.


ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

As of February 26, 1996, no single person or entity owned of record or, to the
knowledge of the Corporation, was deemed to own beneficially, more than 5% of
the outstanding shares of such Stock.

The table below sets forth, as of March 12, 1996, the number of shares of Class
A Stock owned by each director and by all executive officers and directors as a

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

Some Corporation and United Bank directors, officers, and principal
stockholders, and their associates and immediate families were customers of, or
had transactions with, subsidiaries of the Corporation in the ordinary course
of business during 1995.  Hammer, Inc., a construction company owned by Bobby
W. Sawyer, was paid $539,448, the majority of which was for construction work
performed to repair the main branch of United Bank in Atmore which sustained
extensive damage from Hurricane Erin in August 1995.  This expense was
reimbursable by the bank's insurance carrier.  In addition, some Corporation
and United Bank directors are directors, officers, trustees, or principal
security holders of corporations or other organizations that were customers of,
or had transactions with, the Corporation or its subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business during 1995.

United Bank has issued loans outstanding on behalf of directors, officers, and
principal shareholders, and their associates and immediate families, in the
aggregate amount of $1,919,380, representing approximately 15.5% of the
Corporation's shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1995.  All outstanding
loans and other transactions with the Corporation's, and its subsidiaries',
directors, officers, and principal shareholders, and their associates and
immediate families, were made in the ordinary course of business on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and when
made did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present
other unfavorable features.  In addition to banking and financial transactions,
the Corporation and its subsidiaries may have had additional transactions with,
or may have used products or services of, various organizations of which
directors of the Corporation or its subsidiaries are directors, officers, or
principal shareholders.  The amounts involved in such noncredit transactions
have in no case been material in relation to the business of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries or to such other organizations.

                        INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
United Bancorporation of Alabama, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of United
Bancorporation of Alabama, Inc. and subsidiary as listed in Item 8.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United
Bancorporation of Alabama, Inc. and subsidiary at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1993 to adopt the
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  Also as discussed
in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
its method of accounting for investment securities in 1994 to adopt the
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                       December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993


(1)      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         (a)     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

                 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
                 financial statements of United Bancorporation of Alabama, Inc.
                 (the Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, United Bank
                 (the Bank), collectively as the Company.  Significant
                 intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
                 consolidation.

         (b)     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

                 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
                 conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In
                 preparing the financial statements, management is required to
                 make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
                 amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
                 balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period.
                 Actual results could differ significantly from those
                 estimates.

                 Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to
                 significant change in a time period of less than one year
                 relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses
                 and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with
                 foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans.  In connection with
                 the determination of the allowances for loan losses and real
                 estate owned, management obtains independent appraisals for
                 significant properties.

                 Management believes the allowances for losses on loans and
                 real estate owned are adequate.  While management uses
                 available information to recognize losses on loans and real
                 estate owned, future additions to the allowances may be
                 necessary based on changes in economic conditions,
                 particularly in Alabama.  In addition, various regulatory
                 agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,
                 periodically review the Company's allowances for losses on
                 loans and real estate owned.  Such agencies may require the
                 Company to recognize additions to the allowances based on
                 their judgments about information available to them at the
                 time of their examination.


                                                                     (Continued)

(1)      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

         (c)     CASH EQUIVALENTS

                 For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company
                 considers due from banks and federal funds sold to be cash
                 equivalents.

         (d)     INVESTMENT SECURITIES

                 On January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
                 Accounting Standards (SFAS) 115, Accounting for Certain
                 Investments in Debt and Equity Securities which requires that
                 investment securities be held in one of three portfolios: (i)
                 trading account securities, (ii) held to maturity securities,
                 and (iii) securities available for sale.  Trading account
                 securities are to be stated at fair value.  The Company does
                 not have trading account securities.  Investment securities
                 held to maturity are stated at cost adjusted for amortization
                 of premiums and accretion of discounts.  With regard to
                 investment securities held to maturity, management has the
                 intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity.
                 Investment securities available for sale are to be stated at
                 fair value with any unrealized gains and losses reported in a
                 separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax effect,
                 until realized.  Once realized, gains and losses on investment
                 securities available for sale are reflected as adjustments to
                 current period earnings.

                 Upon the adoption of SFAS 115, the Company transferred
                 securities, totaling approximately $31,000,000, to the
                 available for sale portfolio at January 1, 1994 with a net
                 unrealized gain of approximately $491,000 included in
                 stockholders' equity, net of taxes of $285,000.

                 In November 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
                 (FASB) issued FASB Special Report, A Guide to Implementation
                 of Statement No. 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in
                 Debt and Equity Securities - Questions and Answers.
                 Concurrent with the initial adoption of this implementation
                 guidance, an entity may reassess the appropriateness of the
                 classifications of all securities held at that time and
                 account for any resulting reclassifications at fair value.
                 This one-time reclassification should occur as of a single
                 date between November 15, 1995 and December 31, 1995, not over
                 a number of days throughout that period.  Reclassifications
                 from the held-to-maturity category that result from this
                 one-time reassessment will not call into question the intent
                 of any entity to hold other

                 debt securities to maturity in the future.  In conjunction
                 with this special report, the Company transferred, effective
                 November 30, 1995, investment securities held to maturity,
                 including U.S.  Treasury notes, U.S. government agencies, and
                 state and political subdivisions with a total amortized cost
                 of $5,072,080, $1,004,117, and $1,775,049, respectively, and
                 fair value of $5,017,031, $980,919, and $1,962,576,
                 respectively, to the available-for-sale category.  The
                 unrealized net holding gains on these securities at November
                 30, 1995, totaled approximately $109,000 and were included as
                 a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of deferred
                 taxes of approximately $44,000.

                 Interest earned on investment securities held to maturity and
                 investment securities available for sale is included in
                 interest income.  Net gains and losses on the sale of
                 investment securities available for sale, computed principally
                 on the specific identification method, are shown separately in
                 noninterest income in the consolidated statements of
                 operations.  Accretion of discounts and amortization of
                 premiums are calculated on the effective interest method over
                 the anticipated life of the security.

                 A decline in the market value of any security below cost that
                 is deemed other than temporary is charged to income resulting
                 in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security.


         (e)     LOANS

                 Loans are stated at principal amounts outstanding less
                 unearned income and the allowance for loan losses.  Interest
                 income on loans is credited to earnings based on the principal
                 amount outstanding at the respective rate of interest except
                 for add on installment loans for which interest is recognized
                 on a method which is not materially different from a
                 level-yield basis over the terms of the loans.  Interest
                 income on other loans is recognized on a level-yield basis.

         (e)     LOANS, CONTINUED

                 Accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when a loan
                 becomes contractually past due by 90 days or more with respect
                 to interest or principal.  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual
                 status, all interest previously accrued, but not collected, is
                 reversed against current period interest income.  Income on
                 such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is
                 received and where the future collection or principal is
                 probable.  Interest accruals are recorded on such loans only
                 when they are brought fully current with respect to interest
                 and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the
                 loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both
                 principal and interest.

                 The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 114, Accounting by
                 Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended by SFAS 118,
                 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan--Income
                 Recognition and Disclosures, on January 1, 1995.  Under the
                 provisions of SFAS 114 and 118, management considers a loan to
                 be impaired when it is probable that the Company will be
                 unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual
                 terms of the loan agreement.  When a loan is considered
                 impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the
                 present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
                 note's effective interest rate.  If the loan is
                 collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used
                 to determine the amount of impairment.  Impairment losses are
                 included in the reserve for possible loan losses through a
                 charge to the provision for possible loan losses.  Subsequent
                 recoveries are added to the reserve.

                 When a loan is considered impaired, cash receipts are applied
                 under the contractual terms of the loan agreement, first to
                 principal and then to interest income.  Once the recorded
                 principal balance has been reduced to zero, future cash
                 receipts are applied to interest income, to the extent that
                 any interest has not been recognized.  Future cash receipts
                 are recorded as recoveries of any amount previously charged
                 off.

                 A loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified
                 in a troubled debt restructuring after January 1, 1995.  For
                 those accruing impaired loans, cash receipts are typically
                 applied to principal and interest receivable in accordance
                 with the terms of the restructured loan agreement.  Interest
                 income is recognized on these loans using the accrual method
                 of accounting.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(1)      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

         (f)     ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

                 Additions to the allowance for loan losses are based on
                 management's evaluation of the loan portfolio under current
                 economic conditions, past loan loss experience and such other
                 factors which, in management's judgment, deserve recognition
                 in estimating loan losses.  The board of directors of the Bank
                 makes a formal review of the adequacy of the allowance for
                 loan losses prior to the end of each calendar quarter and
                 makes appropriate changes to the allowance.  Loans are
                 charged-off when, in the opinion of management, such loans are
                 deemed to be uncollectible.  Regulatory examiners may require
                 the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based upon
                 their judgments about information available to them at the
                 time of their examination.  Recognized losses, net of
                 recoveries, are charged to the allowance for loan losses.

         (g)     PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

                 Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
                 depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using both the
                 declining-balance method and the straight-line method over the
                 estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three
                 to thirty years.

         (h)     OTHER REAL ESTATE

                 Other real estate represents property acquired through
                 foreclosure or deeded to the Company in lieu of foreclosure on
                 real estate mortgage loans on which borrowers have defaulted.
                 Other real estate is carried at the lower of acquisition cost
                 or fair value, adjusted for estimated selling costs.
                 Reductions in the balance of other real estate at the date of
                 foreclosure are charged to the allowance for losses.
                 Subsequent changes in fair value, up to the value established
                 at foreclosure, are recognized as charges or credits to
                 noninterest expense with an offset to the allowance for losses
                 on other real estate.

         (i)     INCOME TAX EXPENSE

                 As of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
                 Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, Accounting for
                 Income Taxes.  SFAS 109 required a change from the deferred
                 method of accounting for income taxes of Accounting Principles
                 Board Opinion No. 11, Accounting for Income Taxes (APB Opinion
                 11) to the asset and liability method of accounting for income
                 taxes.  Under the


                                                                     (Continued)

         (i)     INCOME TAX EXPENSE, CONTINUED

                 asset and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets
                 and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
                 attributable to differences between the financial statement
                 carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
                 respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit
                 carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
                 measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
                 income in the years in which those temporary differences are
                 expected to be recovered or settled.  Under SFAS 109, the
                 effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
                 tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
                 the enactment date.

                 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 109
                 without restating prior years' financial statements.  The
                 change in accounting method had no material effect on 1993
                 earnings.

                 The Company files its federal income tax returns on a
                 consolidated basis.
 
         (j)     RECLASSIFICATIONS

                 Certain reclassifications have been made in the 1994 and 1993
                 consolidated financial statements to conform with the
                 classifications in the 1995 consolidated financial statements.

         (k)     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

                 In May 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 122, Accounting for
                 Mortgage Servicing Rights an amendment of SFAS Statement No.
                 65 (SFAS 122).  SFAS 122 amends SFAS 65 and requires that a
                 mortgage banking enterprise recognize as separate assets,
                 rights to service mortgage loans for others, however those
                 servicing rights are acquired.  SFAS 122 also requires that a
                 mortgage banking enterprise assess its capitalized mortgage
                 servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of
                 those rights.  SFAS 122 is effective for financial statements
                 issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.
                 The Company does not believe the provisions of SFAS 122 will
                 have a material impact on the financial statements.

(2)      CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

         The Corporation's subsidiary bank is required to maintain daily cash
         balances with the Federal Reserve.  These balances were $801,000 and
         $640,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.


(3)      INVESTMENT SECURITIES

         In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for
         Impairment of a Loan. In October 1994, the FASB issued SFAS 118,
         Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition
         and Disclosures, which amends the requirements of SFAS 114 regarding
         interest income recognition and related disclosure requirements.
         Initial adoption of SFAS 114 and SFAS 118 must be reflected
         prospectively.  The Company adopted SFAS 114 and SFAS 118 on January
         1, 1995 and the impact to the consolidated financial statements was
         not material.  At December 31, 1995, pursuant to the definition within
         SFAS 114, the Company had $186,932 of impaired loans, with a related
         valuation allowance of $69,560.

         Loans on which the accrual of interest had been discontinued or
         reduced amounted to $333,002 and $162,844 as of December 31, 1995 and
         1994, respectively.  If these loans had been current throughout their
         terms, interest income would have been increased by $9,363, $5,234,
         and $85,076 for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.


                                                                     (Continued)

(4)   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, CONTINUED

      The Company had $8,261,708 and $6,959,260 of agriculture-related loans at
      December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Agriculture loans accounted for
      $147,661 and $20,244 of nonaccrual loans in 1995 and 1994, respectively.
      In assessing the credit risk and related terms of this specialized type of
      lending, the Company utilizes the experience of specific personnel in
      evaluating collateral and the resources of the borrower.  As the Company's
      loans, including agriculture loans, are reflective of its geographic
      market, the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan
      portfolio and the recovery of real estate owned are susceptible to changes
      in market conditions in the geographic area served by the Company.

      During 1995 and 1994, certain executive officers and directors of the
      Corporation and its subsidiary, including their immediate families and
      companies with which they are associated, were loan customers of the
      subsidiary bank.  Total loans outstanding to these related parties at
      December 31, 1995 and 1994, amounted to $1,919,380 and $3,196,104,
      respectively.  The change from December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995
      reflects advances amounting to $1,030,591 and payments of $2,307,315 made
      during the year.  Such loans are made in the ordinary course of business
      at normal credit terms, including interest rate and collateral
      requirements, and do not represent more than a normal credit risk.

(5)      PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, CONTINUED

         During the year ended December 31, 1995, certain premises and
         equipment with a net book value of $43,456 were disposed of due to
         damage sustained from Hurricane Erin.  Premises and equipment lost due
         to storm damage were covered by insurance so that proceeds received
         were adequate to replace lost assets.  In addition, the Company
         incurred certain expenses relating to damage from the storm including
         disposal costs, costs of temporary office and storage space, and other
         related items.  However, the net effect of such expenses, proceeds,
         and disposals did not have a significant impact on the consolidated
         financial statements.

         In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
         considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
         of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate
         realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
         future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
         differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled
         reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
         and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  Based upon the
         level of historical taxable income and projection for future taxable

         income over the periods which the temporary differences resulting in
         the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more
         likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these
         deductible differences, giving consideration to the valuation
         allowance recorded.

         The Company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of
         approximately $117,000 which is available to reduce future federal
         regular income taxes, if any, over an indefinite period.


(10)     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         The Company adopted a 401(k) Employee Incentive Savings Plan effective
         January 1, 1988.  Employees become eligible after completing six
         months of service and attaining age 201/2.  They can contribute a
         minimum of one percent up to ten percent of salary to the plan.  The
         Company contributes twenty-five cents for each dollar the employee
         contributes, up to four percent of the employee's salary.  Total
         Company contributions to the plan during 1995, 1994, and 1993 were
         $17,334, $21,569, and $28,027, respectively.

         The Company also maintains a profit-sharing plan for eligible
         employees.  Eligibility requirements for this plan are the same as the
         401(k) Employee Incentive Savings Plan.  An annual profit sharing
         contribution of $60,000 was made in 1995, 1994, and 1993.


(11)     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         SFAS 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,
         requires disclosure of fair value information about financial
         instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance
         sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value.  The
         assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of the Company's
         financial instruments are explained below.  Where quoted market prices
         are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted
         cash flow and other valuation techniques.  Discounted cash flows can
         be significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the
         discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  The following fair
         value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
         markets and should not be considered representative of the liquidation
         value of the Company's financial instruments, but rather a good-faith
         estimate of the fair value of financial instruments held by the
         Company.  SFAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all
         non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(11)     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED

         The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
         estimating the fair value of its financial instruments:

         (A)   CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INTEREST EARNING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER
               FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

               Fair value equals the carrying value of such assets.

         (B)   INVESTMENT SECURITIES

               The fair value of investment securities is based on quoted 
               market prices.

         (C)   LOANS

               The fair value of loans is calculated using discounted cash
               flows and excludes lease financing arrangements.  The discount
               rate used to determine the present value of the loan portfolio
               is an estimated market discount rate that reflects the credit
               and interest rate risk inherent in the loan portfolio.  The
               estimated maturity is based on the Company's historical
               experience with repayments adjusted to estimate the effect of
               current market conditions.  The carrying amount of accrued
               interest approximates its fair value.

         (D)   DEPOSITS

               As required by SFAS 107, the fair value of deposits with no
               stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits,
               NOW accounts, savings and money market deposit accounts, is
               equal to the carrying value.  Certificates of deposit have been
               valued using discounted cash flows.  The discount rate used is
               based on estimated market rates for deposits of similar
               remaining maturities.

               The fair value estimates in the table below do not include the
               benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the
               deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in
               the market.

         (E)   SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE

               Due to their short-term nature, the fair value of securities
               sold under agreements to repurchase approximates their carrying
               value.


                                                                     (Continued)

(11)     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED

         (F)   OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

               Due to their short-term nature, the fair value of the Company's
               other borrowed funds equals the carrying value of such
               liabilities.

         The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company's financial
         instruments are as follows (in thousands):

(12)     DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY

         Dividends paid by the subsidiary bank are the primary source of funds
         available to the Corporation for payment of dividends to its
         stockholders and for other needs.  Applicable federal and state
         statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the amounts of
         dividends that may be declared by the subsidiary bank.  In addition,
         the subsidiary bank is also required to maintain minimum amounts of
         capital to total "risk-weighted" assets, as defined by banking
         regulators.  Capital adequacy considerations could further limit the
         availability of dividends from the subsidiary bank.

(13)     LITIGATION

         The Corporation's subsidiary, United Bank, and certain of its former
         officers had been named defendants or were otherwise affected by
         proceedings related to the failure of the W. M. Brown Feedyard, a
         cattle feedlot in Atmore, Alabama (the "Feedlot").  The majority of
         these cases were settled in 1995, one case was settled in February
         1996, and one case remains outstanding.

         The Corporation and its subsidiary bank are involved in various legal
         proceedings, other than those discussed above, arising in connection
         with their business.  In the opinion of management, based upon
         consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate resolution of these
         other proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the
         financial position of the Company.


(14)     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         The Corporation's subsidiary bank leases certain equipment for use in
         its business.  These leases have lease terms generally not in excess
         of five years.  Future minimum rental payments required under
         operating leases which have initial or remaining noncancelable lease
         terms total $94,832 for 1996 and 1997 and $31,611 for 1998.  Rental
         expense for all operating leases charged to earnings aggregated
         approximately $94,832, $32,493, and $17,155 for the years ended
         December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

         The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
         risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of
         its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to
         extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees.
         Such instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of the
         amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

         The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
         by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
         extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees
         written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments.
         The Company uses the same credit policies in making conditional
         obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

         The financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk
         as of December 31, 1995 are as follows:

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(14)     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, CONTINUED

         Standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the Company to
         guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Those
         guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
         borrowing arrangements.  The credit risk involved in issuing letters
         of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
         facilities to customers.  The Company holds various assets as
         collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed
         necessary.

         Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
         long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
         contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
         termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since many of
         the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the
         total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
         requirements.

         Components of other noninterest expense exceeding 1 percent of total
         revenues include the following for the years ended December 31, 1995,

         The Company declared a 1:15 stock dividend as of November 15, 1994 to
         stockholders of record as of December 31, 1994 payable on January 13,
         1995.  The stock dividend is to be paid out of treasury shares.  The
         number of shares outstanding and per share amounts have been

(17)     REGULATORY MATTERS

         The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
         (FDICIA) established 5 capital categories for banks and bank holding
         companies.  The bank regulators adopted regulations defining these 5
         capital categories in September 1992.  Under the new regulations, each
         bank will be classified into 1 of the 5 categories (well capitalized,
         adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
         undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) based on its level
         of risk-based capital as measured by Tier 1 capital, total risk-based
         capital, Tier 1 leverage ratios, and its supervisory ratings.  The new
         regulations became effective December 1992.  FDICIA defines "well
         capitalized" banks as entities having a total risk-based capital ratio
         of 10 percent or higher, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6
         percent or higher, and a leverage ratio of 5 percent or higher.  At
         December 31, 1995, the Bank is classified as a well-capitalized
         institution under the FDICIA regulations.
