       The   preparation   of   the  financial  statements   of   U-Haul
International, Inc. (the "Registrant") will not be completed by June 29,
1995, the last day for a timely filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for  the  year ended March 31, 1995, pursuant to Rule 0-2 of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      During  the year ended March 31, 1995, the Registrant  made  major
management  and accounting system changes.  As a result,  it  has  taken
longer  to  gather the necessary information to prepare the consolidated
financial statements.
