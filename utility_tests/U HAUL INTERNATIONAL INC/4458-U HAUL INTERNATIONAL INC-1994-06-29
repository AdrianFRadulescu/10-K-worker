                          ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                            THE COMPANY
           
          AMERCO, a Nevada corporation ("AMERCO" or the "Company"),
is the holding company for U-Haul International, Inc. ("U-Haul"),
Ponderosa Holdings, Inc. ("Ponderosa"), and AMERCO Real Estate
Company ("AREC").  Throughout this Form 10-K, unless the context
otherwise requires, the term "Company" includes all of the
Company's subsidiaries.  The Company's principal executive offices
are located at 1325 Airmotive Way, Suite 100, Reno, Nevada 89502-
3239, and the telephone number of the Company is (702) 688-6300.
As used in this Form 10-K, all references to a fiscal year refer to
the Company's fiscal year ended March 31 of that year.

          U-Haul is primarily engaged, through subsidiaries, in the
rental of trucks, automobile-type trailers, and support rental
items to the do-it-yourself moving customer, all under the
registered tradename U-Haul(REGISTERED TRADEMARK).  Additionally, U-Haul sells 
related products and services and rents self-storage facilities and various
kinds of equipment.  AREC manages the real estate used in
connection with the foregoing businesses.

          Ponderosa serves as the holding company for the Company's
insurance businesses.  Ponderosa's two principal subsidiaries are
Oxford Life Insurance Company ("Oxford") and Republic Western
Insurance Company ("RWIC").  Oxford primarily reinsures life,
health, and annuity type insurance products and administers the
Company's self-insured employee health plan.  RWIC originates and
reinsures property and casualty type insurance products for various
market participants, including independent third parties, the
Company's customers, and the Company.

          See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for financial information regarding the Company's three
primary industry segments, which are represented by U-Haul, Oxford
and RWIC.

                            HISTORY

          The Company was founded in 1945 under the name "U-Haul
Trailer Rental Company".  From 1945 to 1975, the Company rented
trailers and trucks on a one-way and local round-trip basis through
independent dealers (at that time principally independent gasoline
service stations).  Since 1974, the Company has developed a network
of Company-owned rental centers ("U-Haul Centers") (through which U-
Haul rents its trucks and trailers and provides a number of other
related products and services) and has expanded the number and
geographic diversity of its independent dealers.  At March 31,
1994, the Company's distribution network included approximately
1,100 U-Haul Centers and approximately 11,500 independent dealers.

          In March 1974, in conjunction with the acquisition and
construction of U-Haul Centers, the Company entered the self-
<PAGE> 4
storage business.  As of March 31, 1994, such self-storage
facilities were located at or near approximately 59% of the
Company's U-Haul Centers.  Beginning in 1974, the Company
introduced the sale and installation of hitches and towing systems,
as well as the sale of support items such as packing and moving
aids.  During 1983, the Company expanded its range of do-it-
yourself rental products to include tools and equipment for the
homeowner and small contractor and other general rental items.

          In 1969, the Company acquired Oxford to provide employee
health and life insurance for the Company in a cost-effective
manner.  In 1973, the Company formed RWIC to provide automobile
liability insurance for the U-Haul truck and trailer rental
customers.

          Commencing in 1987, the Company began the implementation
of a strategic plan designed to emphasize reinvestment in its core
do-it-yourself rental, moving, and storage business.  The plan
included a fleet renewal program (see "Business - U-Haul Operations
- - - Rental Equipment Fleet"), and provided for the discontinuation of
certain unprofitable and unrelated operations.  As part of its
plan, the Company discontinued the operation of its full-service
moving van lines, initiated the phase out of its recreational
vehicle rental operations, and began the disposition of its
recreational vehicle rental fleet.  The disposition of the moving
van lines' assets and the recreational vehicle rental fleet were
completed in 1988 and 1992, respectively.  The Company also
eliminated various types of rental equipment and closed certain
warehouses and repair facilities.  The Company believes that its
refocused business strategy enabled U-Haul to generate higher
revenues and to achieve significant cost savings.

          Since 1987, the Company has sold surplus real estate
assets with a book value of approximately $38.1 million for total
proceeds of approximately $76.4 million.  At March 31, 1994, the
book value of the Company's real estate assets deemed to be surplus
was approximately $18.4 million.

          In 1990, the Company reorganized its operations into
separate legal entities, each with its own operating, financial,
and investment strategies.  The reorganization separated the
Company into three parts:  U-Haul rental operations, insurance, and
real estate.  The purpose of the reorganization was to increase
management accountability and to allow the allocation of capital
based on defined performance measurements.

                        BUSINESS STRATEGY

U-HAUL OPERATIONS

          The Company's present business strategy remains focused
on the do-it-yourself moving customer.  The objective of this
strategy is to offer, in an integrated manner over a diverse
geographical area, a wide range of products and services to the do-
it-yourself moving customer.
<PAGE>  5
          Through its "Moving Made Easier" (REGISTERED TRADEMARK) program, the 
 Company strives to offer its customers a high quality, reliable, and
convenient fleet of trucks and trailers at reasonable prices while
simultaneously offering other related products and services,
including moving accessories, self-storage facilities, and other
items often desired by the do-it-yourself mover.  The rental trucks
purchased in the fleet renewal program have been designed with the
do-it-yourself customer in mind to include features such as low
decks, air conditioning, power steering, automatic transmissions,
soft suspensions, AM/FM cassette stereo systems, and over-the-cab
storage.  The Company has introduced certain insurance products,
including "Safemove"(REGISTERED TRADEMARK) and "Safestor"(REGISTERED TRADEMARK),
to provide the do-it-yourself mover with certain moving-related insurance
coverage.  In addition, the Company provides rental customers the option of 
storing their possessions at either their points of departure or destination.

          The Company believes that customer access, in terms of
truck or trailer availability and proximity of rental location, is
critical to its success.  Since 1987, the Company has more than
doubled the number of U-Haul rental locations, with a net addition
of approximately 6,000 independent dealers.

          To effectively service the U-Haul customer at these
additional rental locations with equipment commensurate with the
Company's commitment to product excellence, the Company, as part of
the fleet renewal program, purchased approximately 63,000 new
trucks between March 1987 and March 1994 and reduced the overall
average age of its truck fleet from approximately 11 years at March
1987 to approximately 5 years at March 1994.  During this period,
approximately 60,000 trucks were retired or sold.

          Since 1990, U-Haul has replaced approximately 48% of its
trailer fleet with new, more aerodynamically designed trailers
better suited to the low height profile of many newly manufactured
automobiles.  Given the mechanical simplicity of a trailer relative
to a truck and a trailer's longer useful life, the Company expects
to replace trailers only as necessary.

          Beginning in 1983, the Company implemented a point-of-
sale computer system for all of its Company-owned locations.  The
system was designed primarily to handle the Company's reservations,
traffic, and reporting of rental transactions.  The Company
believes that the implementation of the system has been a
significant factor in allowing the Company to increase its fleet
utilization.  Since the initial implementation, the Company has
added several additional enhancements to the system, including full
budgeting and financial reporting systems.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

          Oxford's business strategy emphasizes long-term capital
growth funded through earnings from reinsurance and investment
activities.  In the past, Oxford has selectively reinsured life,
health, and annuity-type insurance products.  Oxford anticipates
<PAGE>  6
pursuing its growth strategy by providing reinsurance facilities to
well-managed insurance or reinsurance companies offering similar
type products who are desirous of additional capital either as a
result of rapid growth or regulatory demands or who are divesting
non-core business lines.

          RWIC's principal business strategy is to capitalize on
its knowledge of insurance products aimed at the moving and rental
markets.  RWIC believes that providing U-Haul and U-Haul customers
with property and casualty insurance coverage has enabled it to
develop expertise in the areas of rental vehicle lessee insurance,
self-storage property coverage, motorhome insurance coverage, and
general rental equipment coverage.  RWIC has used and plans to
continue to use this knowledge to expand its customer base by
offering similar products to customers other than U-Haul.  In
addition, RWIC plans to expand its involvement in specialized areas
by offering commercial multi-peril and surety coverage and by
assuming reinsurance business.

                      U-HAUL OPERATIONS

GENERAL

          The Company's do-it-yourself moving business operates
under the U-Haul name through an extensive and geographically
diverse distribution network of Company-owned U-Haul Centers and
independent dealers throughout the United States and Canada.

          Substantially all of the Company's rental revenue is
derived from do-it-yourself moving customers.  The remaining
business comes from commercial/industrial customers.  Moving
rentals include: (i) local (round-trip) rentals, where the
equipment is returned to the originating U-Haul Center or
independent dealer and (ii) one-way rentals, where the equipment is
returned to a U-Haul Center or independent dealer in another city.
Typically, the number of local rental transactions in any given
year is substantially greater than the number of one-way rental
transactions.  However, total revenues generated by one-way
transactions in any given year typically exceed total revenues from
local rental transactions.

          As part of the Company's integrated approach to the do-it-
yourself moving market, U-Haul has a variety of product offerings.
U-Haul's "Moving Made Easier"(REGISTERED TRADEMARK) program is designed to 
offer safe, well-equipped rental trucks and trailers at a reasonable price and
to provide support items such as furniture pads, hand trucks,
appliance and utility dollies, mirrors, tow bars, tow dollies, and
bumper hitches.  The Company also sells boxes, tape, and packaging
materials and rents additional items such as floor polishers and
carpet cleaning equipment at its U-Haul Center locations.  U-Haul
Centers also install hitches and sell propane, and some of them
sell gasoline.  U-Haul sells insurance packages such as (i)
"Safemove"(REGISTERED TRADEMARK), which provides moving customers with a damage 
waiver, cargo protection, and medical and life coverage, and (ii) "Safestor", 
(REGISTERED TRADEMARK) which provides self-storage rental customers with
various insurance coverages.
<PAGE> 7
          The U-Haul truck and trailer rental business tends to be
seasonal with more transactions and revenues generated in the
spring and summer months than during the balance of the year.  The
Company attributes this seasonality to the preference of do-it-
yourself movers to move during this time.  Also, consistent with do-
it-yourself mover preferences, the number of rental transactions
tends to be higher on weekends than on weekdays.

RENTAL EQUIPMENT FLEET

          As of March 31, 1994, U-Haul's rental equipment fleet
consisted of approximately 72,000 trucks and approximately 90,000
trailers.  Rental trucks are offered in five sizes and range in
size from the ten-foot "Mini-Mover"(REGISTERED TRADEMARK) to the 
twenty-six-foot "Super-Mover"(REGISTERED TRADEMARK).  In addition, 
U-Haul offers pick-up trucks and cargo vans at many of its locations.  
Trailers range between six feet and twelve feet in length and are 
offered in both open and closed box configurations.

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK

          The Company's U-Haul products and services are marketed
across the United States and Canada through, as of March 31, 1994,
approximately 1,100 Company-owned U-Haul Centers and approximately
11,500 independent dealers.  The independent dealers, which include
gasoline station operators, general equipment rental operators, and
others, rent U-Haul trucks and trailers in addition to carrying on
their principal lines of business.  U-Haul Centers, however, are
dedicated to the U-Haul line of products and services and offer
those and related products and services.  Independent dealers are
commonly located in suburban and rural markets, while U-Haul
Centers are concentrated in urban and suburban markets.

          Independent dealers receive U-Haul equipment on a
consignment basis and are paid a commission on gross revenues
generated from their rentals.  Independent dealers also may earn
referral commissions on U-Haul products and services provided at
other U-Haul locations.  The Company maintains contracts with its
independent dealers that can be cancelled upon thirty days' written
notice by either party.

          In addition, the Company has sought to improve the
productivity of its rental locations by installing computerized
reservations and network management systems in each U-Haul Center
and a limited number of independent dealers.  The Company believes
that these systems have been a major factor in enabling the Company
to deploy equipment more effectively throughout its network of
locations and anticipates expanding these systems to cover
additional independent dealers.

          The Company's U-Haul Center and independent dealer
network in the United States and Canada is divided into 12
districts, each supervised by an area district vice president.
Within the districts, the Company has established local marketing
companies, each of which, guided by a marketing company president,
is responsible for retail marketing at all U-Haul Centers and
independent dealers within its respective geographic area.
<PAGE> 8          
          Although rental dealers are independent, U-Haul area
field managers oversee the dealer network by inspecting each
independent dealer's facilities and auditing their activities on a
regular basis.  In addition, the area field managers recruit new
independent dealers for expansion or replacement purposes.  U-Haul
has instituted performance compensation programs that focus on
accomplishment and reward strong performers.

SELF-STORAGE BUSINESS

          U-Haul entered the self-storage business in 1974 and
since that time has increased the rentable square footage of its
storage locations through the acquisition of existing facilities
and new construction.  In addition, the Company has entered into
management agreements to manage self-storage properties owned by
other companies and is exploring the possibility of expanding this
type of operation as well as expanding its ownership of self-
storage facilities.  The Company also provides financing and 
management services for independent self-storage businesses.

          Through approximately 650 Company-owned locations in the
United States and Canada, the Company offers for rent more than
13.0 million square feet of self-storage space.  The Company's self-
storage facility locations have an average of 20,000 square feet of
storage space, with individual storage spaces ranging in size from
16 square feet to 200 square feet.

          Units are rented to individuals and businesses for
temporary storage on a monthly basis.  In fiscal 1994, occupancy
rates increased to approximately 91% from approximately 85% in the
prior year.  During fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993, delinquent rentals
as a percentage of total storage rentals were approximately 5% in
each year, which rate the Company considers to be satisfactory.

EQUIPMENT DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND MAINTENANCE

          The Company designs and manufactures its truck van boxes,
trailers, and various other support rental equipment items.  With
the needs of the do-it-yourself moving customer in mind, the
Company's equipment is designed to achieve high safety standards,
simplicity of operation, reliability, convenience, durability, and
fuel economy.  Truck chassis are manufactured to Company
specifications by both foreign and domestic truck manufacturers.
These chassis receive certain post-delivery modifications and are
joined with van boxes at 7 Company-owned manufacturing and assembly
facilities in the United States.

          The Company services and maintains its trucks and
trailers through a periodic maintenance program.  Regular vehicle
maintenance is generally performed at Company-owned facilities
located throughout the United States and Canada.  Major repairs are
performed either by the chassis manufacturers' dealers or by
Company-owned repair shops.  To the extent available, the Company
takes advantage of manufacturers' warranties.
<PAGE>  9
          Since the fleet renewal program began in fiscal 1987, the
number of repair locations has been reduced significantly.
Maintenance costs declined from a high of $163.0 million in fiscal
1987 to a low of $80.5 million in fiscal 1989.  However, due to a
reduction both in new truck purchases and older truck retirements
in fiscal 1992 and fiscal 1993, maintenance expense increased to
$150.3 million in fiscal 1993 and $177.7 million in fiscal 1994.
During fiscal 1994, the Company, as part of its fleet renewal
program, resumed the purchase and manufacture of new trucks with
the objective of increasing the size of the truck fleet.

COMPETITION

          The do-it-yourself moving truck and trailer rental market
is highly competitive and dominated by national operators in both
the local and one-way markets.  These competitors include the truck
rental divisions of Ryder System, Penske Truck Leasing, and Budget
Rent-A-Car.  Management believes that there are two distinct users
of rental trucks:  commercial users and do-it-yourself users.  As
noted above, the Company focuses on the do-it-yourself mover.  The
Company believes that the principal competitive factors are price,
convenience of rental locations, and availability of quality rental
equipment.

          The self-storage industry is also highly competitive.  In
addition to the Company, there are two other national firms, Public
Storage and Shurgard, and numerous regional and local operators.
Efficient management of occupancy and delinquency rates, as well as
price and convenience, are key competitive factors.

EMPLOYEES

          For the period ending March 31, 1994, the Company's non-seasonal
workforce consisted of approximately 11,300 employees comprised of
approximately 46% part-time and 54% full-time employees.  During
the summer months, the Company increases its workforce by
approximately 2,300 employees and the percentage of part-time
employees increases to approximately 54% of the total workforce.
The Company's employees are non-unionized, and management believes
that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

OXFORD - LIFE INSURANCE

          Oxford underwrites life, health and annuity insurance,
both as a direct writer and as an assuming reinsurer.  Oxford's
direct lines are primarily related to group life and disability
coverage issued to employees of AMERCO and its subsidiaries.  For
the year ended December 31, 1993, approximately 6.3% of Oxford's
premium revenues resulted from business with AMERCO and its
subsidiaries.  Oxford's other direct writings include individual
life insurance acquired from other insurers and a small volume of
individual annuity products written through independent agents,
which together accounted for approximately 5.0% of Oxford's premium
<PAGE> 10
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993.  Oxford administers
AMERCO's self-insured group health and dental plans.

          Oxford's reinsurance assumed lines, which accounted for
approximately 88.7% of Oxford's premium revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1993, include individual life insurance coverage,
annuity coverages, excess loss health insurance coverage, and short-
term travel accident coverage.  These reinsurance arrangements are
entered into with unaffiliated insurers, except for travel accident
products reinsured from RWIC.

RWIC - PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

          RWIC's underwriting activities consist of three basic
areas:  U-Haul and U-Haul affiliated underwriting; direct
underwriting; and assumed reinsurance underwriting.  U-Haul
underwritings include coverage for U-Haul and U-Haul employees, and
U-Haul affiliated underwritings consist primarily of coverage for U-
Haul customers.  For the year ended December 31, 1993,
approximately 38% of RWIC's written premiums resulted from U-Haul
and U-Haul affiliated underwriting activities.  RWIC's direct
underwriting is done through home office underwriters and selected
general agents.  The products provided include liability coverage
for rental vehicle lessees and storage rental properties, and
coverage for commercial multiple peril, surety, and excess workers'
compensation.  RWIC's assumed reinsurance underwriting is done via
broker markets and includes, among other things, reinsurance of
municipal bond insurance written through MBIA, Inc.

          RWIC provides a liability for unpaid losses that is based
on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims reported prior to
the end of the accounting period, estimates received from ceding
reinsurers and estimates for incurred but unreported losses based
on RWIC's historical experience supplemented by insurance industry
historical experience.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based
on historical ratios of loss adjustment expense paid to losses
paid.

          The liabilities are estimates necessary to settle all
claims as of the date of the stated reserves and all incurred but
not reported claims.  RWIC updates the reserves as additional facts
regarding claims become apparent.  In addition, court decisions,
economic conditions and public attitudes impact the estimation of
reserves and also the ultimate cost of claims.  In estimating
reserves, no attempt is made to isolate inflation from the combined
effect of numerous factors including inflation.  Unpaid losses and
unpaid loss expenses are not discounted.

          RWIC's unpaid loss and loss expenses are certified
annually by an independent actuarial consulting firm as required by
state regulation.

          Effective December 31, 1993, RWIC adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 113, "Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts".  The primary impact of SFAS No. 113 is the requirement
to report assets and liabilities relating to reinsured contracts
gross of the effects of reinsurance.  Previously, RWIC reported
such effects on a net basis.  As a result of adoption of SFAS No.
113, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
as of December 31, 1993 has been increased approximately $76
million to reflect policy liabilities without regard to
reinsurance.  A corresponding amount due from reinsurers on unpaid
losses, including amounts related to claims incurred but not
reported, has also been reflected.

          The table on page 12 illustrates the change in unpaid
loss and loss expenses.  The first line shows the reserves as
originally reported at the end of the stated year.  The second
section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the
end of successive years with respect to that reserve.  The third
section, reading down, shows reestimates of the original recorded
reserve as of the end of successive years.  The last section
compares the latest reestimated reserve amount to the reserve
amount as originally established.  This last section is cumulative
and should not be summed.

</TABLE>
<PAGE> 13          
          The operating results of the property and casualty
insurance industry, including RWIC, are subject to significant
fluctuations due to numerous factors, including premium rate
competition, catastrophic and unpredictable events (including man-
made and natural disasters), general economic and social
conditions, interest rates, investment returns, changes in tax
laws, regulatory developments, and the ability to accurately
estimate liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses.

INVESTMENTS

          Oxford's and RWIC's investments must comply with the
insurance laws of the State of Arizona where the companies are
domiciled.  These laws prescribe the type, quality, and
concentration of investments that may be made.  In general, these
laws permit investments in federal, state, and municipal
obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stocks, real
estate mortgages, and real estate, within specified limits and
subject to certain qualifications.  Moreover, in order to be
considered an acceptable reinsurer by cedents and intermediaries, a
reinsurer must offer financial security.  The quality and liquidity
of invested assets are important considerations in determining such
security.

          The investment philosophies of Oxford and RWIC emphasize
protection of principal through the purchase of investment grade
fixed income securities.  Approximately 99% of their respective
portfolios consist of investment grade securities.  The maturity
distributions are designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet
future cash needs.

REINSURANCE

          The Company's insurance operations assume and cede
insurance from and to other insurers and members of various
reinsurance pools and associations.  Reinsurance arrangements are
utilized to provide greater diversification of risk and to minimize
exposure on large risks.  However, the original insurer remains
liable should the assuming insurer not be able to meet its
obligations under the reinsurance agreements.

REGULATION

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to
considerable regulation and supervision in the states in which they
transact business.  The purpose of such regulation and supervision
is primarily to provide safeguards for policyholders.  As a result
of federal legislation, the primary regulation of the insurance
industry is performed by the states.  State regulation extends to
such matters as licensing companies; restricting the types or
quality of investments; regulating capital and surplus and
actuarial reserve maintenance; setting solvency standards;
requiring triennial financial examinations, market conduct surveys,
and the filing of reports on financial condition; licensing agents;
regulating aspects of the insurance companies' relationship with
<PAGE> 14
their agents; restricting expenses, commissions, and new business
issued; imposing requirements relating to policy contents;
restricting use of some underwriting criteria; regulating rates,
forms, and advertising; limiting the grounds for cancellations or
non-renewal of policies; regulating solicitation and replacement
practices; and specifying what might constitute unfair practices.
State laws also regulate transactions and dividends between an
insurance company and its parent or affiliates, and generally
require prior approval or notification for any change in control of
the insurance subsidiary.

          In the past few years, the insurance and reinsurance
regulatory framework has been subjected to increased scrutiny by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC"),
state legislatures, insurance regulators, and the United States
Congress.  State legislatures have considered or enacted
legislative proposals that alter, and in many cases increase, state
authority to regulate insurance companies and holding company
systems.  The NAIC and state insurance regulators have been
examining existing laws and regulations with an emphasis on
insurance company investment and solvency issues.  Legislation has
been introduced in Congress that could result in the federal
government assuming some role in the regulation of the insurance
industry.  It is not possible to predict the future impact of
changing state and federal regulation on the operations of Oxford
and RWIC.

          Beginning in 1993, the NAIC adopted and implemented
minimum risk-based capitalization requirements for life insurance
companies, including Oxford.  As of the date of this report, Oxford
is in compliance with these requirements.  The NAIC has adopted a
model for establishing minimum risk-based capitalization
requirements for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance
companies.  The NAIC's stated objective in developing such risk-
based capital standards is to improve solvency monitoring.  RWIC
will adopt the minimum risk-based capitalization requirements in
fiscal 1995.  Adoption will have no material effect on RWIC.

COMPETITION

          The insurance industry is competitive.  Competitors
include a large number of life insurance companies and property and
casualty insurance companies, some of which are owned by
stockholders and others of which are owned by policyholders
(mutual).  Many companies in competition with Oxford and RWIC have
been in business for a longer period of time or possess
substantially greater financial resources.  Competition in the
insurance business is based upon price, product design, and
services rendered to producers and policyholders.
<PAGE> 15
AMERCO REAL ESTATE COMPANY

          AREC owns and manages most of the Company's real estate
assets, including the Company's U-Haul Center locations.  AREC has
responsibility for acquiring and developing properties suitable for
new U-Haul Centers and self-storage locations.  In addition to the
U-Haul operations, AREC actively seeks to lease or dispose of
surplus properties.  See "Business - History".


                       ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES

          The Company and its subsidiaries own property, plant and
equipment that are utilized in the manufacture, repair and rental
of U-Haul equipment and that provide offices for the Company.  See
Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
information regarding the leasing obligations of the Company and
its subsidiaries, including those under U-Haul TRAC leases.  See "U-
Haul Operations - General" in Item 1.  Such facilities exist
throughout the United States and Canada.  The majority of land and
buildings used by U-Haul is owned in fee and is substantially
unencumbered.  In addition, U-Haul owns certain real estate not
currently used in its operations.  U-Haul operates approximately
1,100 U-Haul centers (approximately 650 of which rent self-storage
space), 7 manufacturing facilities, and 23 repair facilities.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

  Underground Storage Tanks

          The Company owns properties that, as of March 31, 1994,
contained a total of approximately 1,600 underground storage tanks
("USTs").  The USTs are used to store various petroleum products,
including gasoline, fuel oil, and waste oil.  The USTs are subject
to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that
require testing and removal of leaking USTs, and remediation of
polluted soils and groundwater under certain circumstances.  In
addition, if leakage from USTs has migrated, the Company may be
subject to civil liability to third parties.  In fiscal years 1990
through 1994, the Company incurred expenditures totaling
approximately $16.3 million for removal and remediation of
approximately 1,123 USTs, a portion of which may be recovered from
insurance and certain states' funds for the removal of USTs.
Expenditures incurred through the end of fiscal 1994 may not be
representative of future experience.  However, the Company believes
that compliance with laws and regulations, and cleanup and
liability costs related to USTs will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.

          In fiscal 1989, the Company instituted a program to test
its USTs for leakage and to remove all but approximately 100 of the
approximately 2,755 USTs then existing by the year 2000.  The
approximately 100 USTs expected to remain at the conclusion of the
Company's testing and removal program are currently anticipated to
consist primarily of waste oil tanks not required to be removed
under current laws and regulations and gasoline tanks located at
its remote rental locations where their use is deemed necessary to
<PAGE> 16
service the Company's moving customers.  The Company currently
budgets $3 million annually for UST testing, removal, and
remediation.  The Company treats these costs as capital costs to
the extent that they improve the safety or efficiency of the
associated properties as compared to when the properties were
originally acquired or if the costs are incurred in preparing the
properties for sale.

  Federal Superfund Sites

          The Company has been named as a "potentially responsible
party" ("PRP") with respect to the disposal of hazardous wastes at
fifteen federal or state superfund hazardous waste sites located in
twelve states.  Under applicable laws and regulations the Company
could be held jointly and severally liable for the costs to clean-
up these sites.  Currently, the Company has entered into buyout
agreement settlements for seven of the sites and one site is under
negotiation for settlement.  Four of the sites have been inactive
for more than two years and two of the sites have been disputed by
the Company with no response for more than two years.  One site is
under state clean-up direction.  Based upon the information
currently available to the Company regarding these fifteen sites,
the current anticipated magnitude of the clean-up, the number of
PRPs, and the volumes of hazardous waste currently anticipated to
be attributed to the Company and other PRPs, the Company believes
its share of the cost of investigation and clean-up at the fifteen
superfund sites will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or operating results.  In addition,
the Company believes that insurance coverage may be available to
cover all or some of the cost with respect to these sites.

  Washington State Hazardous Waste Sites

          The Company owns property within two state hazardous
waste sites in the State of Washington.  The Company owns a parcel
of property in Yakima, Washington that is believed to contain
elevated levels of pesticide and other contaminant residue as a
result of onsite operations conducted by one or more former owners.
The State of Washington has designated the property as a state
hazardous waste site known as the "Yakima Valley Spray Site".  The
Company has been named by the State of Washington as a "potentially
liable party" ("PLP") under state law with respect to this site.
The Company, together with eight other companies and persons, has
formed a committee that has retained an environmental consultant.
The process of site assessment on the Yakima Valley Spray Site is
in its early stages and, based upon the information currently
available to the Company regarding the volume and nature of wastes
present, the Company is unable to reasonably assess the potential
investigation and clean-up costs, but the costs could be
substantial.  Although the Company has entered into an agreement
with such other companies and persons under which the Company has
assumed responsibility for 20% of the costs to investigate the
site, no agreement among the parties with respect to clean-up costs
has been entered into at the date of this Form 10-K.

          In addition, the Company has been named by the State of
Washington as a PLP along with 12 other PLPs with respect to
<PAGE> 17
another state-listed hazardous waste site known as the "Yakima
Railroad Site".  The Yakima Valley Spray Site is located within the
Yakima Railroad Site.  The Company has been notified that the
Yakima Railroad Site involves potential groundwater contamination
in an area of approximately two square miles.  The Company has
contested its designation as a PLP at this site, but, at the date
of this Form 10-K, no formal ruling has been issued in this matter.

          In February 1992, the State of Washington issued an
enforcement order to the Company and eight other parties requiring
conduct of an interim remedial action involving the provision of
bottled water to households that obtain drinking water from wells
within the Yakima Railroad Site.  Without conceding any liability,
the Company and several of the other PLPs have implemented the
bottled water program.  The State of Washington has stated its
intention to expand the existing municipal water system to supply
municipal water to those households currently receiving bottled
water, and it is estimated that the cost thereof will be
approximately $6 million, with such cost being allocated among the
PLPs.

          In addition, there will be costs associated with remedial
measures to address the regional groundwater contamination issue.
The process of site assessment on the Yakima Railroad Site is in
its early stages and, based upon the information currently
available to the Company regarding the volume and nature of wastes
present, the Company is unable to reasonably assess the potential
investigation and clean-up costs, but the costs could be
substantial.  Moreover, the investigative and remedial costs
incurred by the State can be imposed upon the Company and any other
PLP as a joint and several liability.  At the date of this  Form 10-
K, other than the indication of the expansion of the municipal
water system, there has been no formal indication from the State of
Washington of its intentions regarding future cost recoveries at
the Yakima Railroad Site.

  Other

          The Company owns 7 facilities that manufacture and
assemble various components of the Company's equipment.  In
addition, the Company owns various facilities engaged in the
maintenance and servicing of its equipment.  Various individual
properties owned and operated by the Company are subject to various
state and local laws and regulations relating to the methods of
disposal of solvents, tires, batteries, antifreeze, waste oils and
other materials.  Compliance with these requirements is monitored
and enforced at the local level.  Based upon information currently
available to the Company, compliance with these local laws and
regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating
results.

          The Company currently leases approximately 179 properties
to various businesses.  The Company has a policy of leasing
properties subject to an environmental indemnification from the
lessee for operations conducted by the lessee.  It should be
recognized, however, that such indemnification's do not cover pre-
<PAGE> 18
existing conditions and may be limited by the lessee's financial
capabilities.  In any event, to the extent that any lessee does not
perform any of its obligations under applicable environmental laws
and regulations, the Company may remain potentially liable to
governmental authorities and other third parties for environmental
conditions at the leased properties.  Furthermore, as between the
Company and its lessees, disputes may arise as to allocations of
liability with respect to environmental conditions at the leased
properties.

          Finally, it should be recognized that the Company's
present and past facilities have been in operation for many years
and, over that time in the course of those operations, some of the
Company's facilities have generated, used, stored, or disposed of
substances or wastes that are or might be considered hazardous.
Therefore, it is possible that additional environmental issues may
arise in the future, the precise nature of which the Company cannot
now predict.


                    ITEM  3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Company and certain members of the Company's Board of
Directors are defendants in an action currently pending in the 
Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of 
Maricopa entitled Samuel W. Shoen, M.D., et al. v. Edward J. Shoen,
et al., No. CV88-20139, instituted August 2, 1988.  The plaintiffs,
certain stockholders of the Company, who are part of a stockholder
group that is currently opposed to existing Company management (see
"Principal Shareholders"), filed a Fourth Amended Complaint in
February 1992 and have alleged, among other things, that certain of
the individual plaintiffs were wrongfully excluded from sitting on
the Company's Board of Directors in 1988 through the sale of
Company common stock to certain key employees.  That sale allegedly
prevented such stockholder group from gaining a majority position
in the Company's voting stock and control of the Company's Board of 
Directors.  The plaintiffs allege various breaches of fiduciary
duty and other unlawful conduct by the individual defendants and
seek equitable relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.
The Court has dismissed all claims for equitable relief that would
have allowed the plaintiffs to sit on the Board of Directors,
subject only to the right, to the extent that any exists of the
plaintiffs to appeal such dismissal.  The Court has also dismissed 
all claims by all but two of the plaintiffs, except for certain
derivative claims for attorney's fees and costs.  The Court has
scheduled a trial of the case on August 17, 1994.  Management of
the Company does not expect the plaintiffs' damage claims to result
in a material loss to the Company.          
         
         Private arbitration proceedings commenced by Sophia M. Shoen
and Paul F. Shoen against the Company were convened on June 19, 1994.
In the arbitration, Sophia M. Shoen asserts that the Company has
breached its obligations to her by failing to timely register the sale
of her shares and by failing to remove the right of first refusal on
all Company common stock.  Paul F. Shoen asserts that the Company has
breached its obligations to him by failing to consummate the purchase
from him of 58,824 shares of
<PAGE> 19
Company common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000 and, on
an anticipatory basis, by failing to remove the right of first refusal on
all of the Company's outstanding common stock.  Sophia M. Shoen and
Paul F. Shoen assert that, as a consequence of these alleged breaches, they
have the right to give notice of their release from a Stockholder Agreement
described under Item  12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
and Management.  The Company disagrees with the above assertions.  An
arbitration hearing on these issues is presently scheduled for July 26, 1994.

          The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a
number of suits and claims incident to the type of business
conducted and several administrative proceedings arising from state
and local provisions that regulate the removal and/or clean up of
underground fuel storage tanks.  It is the opinion of management
that none of the suits, claims or proceedings involving the
Company, individually or in the aggregate, are expected to result
in any material loss and, accordingly, no provision has been made
in the accompanying financial statements.

ITEM  4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

          No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this
report, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.


                           PART II

ITEM  5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED 
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

          As of June 24, 1994, there were 161 holders of record of
the Company's common stock in comparison to 165 as of August 12,
1993.  No established public trading market exists for the purchase
and sale of the Company's common stock, and to the best knowledge
and belief of the Company there is no one engaged in making a
market for the Company's common stock.

          Cash dividends declared to the Company's stockholders of
record for the two most recent fiscal years are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
            Date                   Cash Dividend per Common Share
            ----                   ------------------------------

        <S>                                       <C>
        August 4, 1992                            $  .0258
        October 6, 1992                              .0258
        August 3, 1993                               .0814
</TABLE>

          The Company does not have a formal dividend policy.  The
Company's Board of Directors periodically considers the
advisability of declaring and paying dividends in light of the
existing circumstances.  The dividends paid during fiscal 1993 and 
fiscal 1994 are not indicative of future dividends and there is no
assurance that dividends on common stock will be declared in the
future.  See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in Item 8 for a discussion of certain contractual restrictions on 
the Company's ability to pay dividends.  See Note 19 of Notes to 
<PAGE> 20
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of 
certain statutory restrictions on Ponderosa's ability to pay 
dividends to the Company.

          See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for a discussion of the Company's non-cash dividends.
See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for a discussion of changes to common shares outstanding and per
share amounts.

          The common stock of U-Haul is wholly-owned by the
Company.  As a result, no active trading market exists for the
purchase and sale of such common stock.  No cash dividends were
declared to the Company by U-Haul during the two most recent fiscal
years.

(1)   For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, "earnings" consists of
pretax earnings from operations plus total fixed charges excluding interest capitalized
during the period and "fixed charges" consists of interest  expense, preferred stock
dividends, capitalized interest, amortization of debt expense and discounts and one-third of
the Company's annual rental expense (which the Company believes is a reasonable
approximation of the interest factor of such rentals).  For the year ended March 31, 1991,
pretax earnings were not sufficient to cover fixed charges by an amount of $4.2 million.

ITEM  7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          For financial statement preparation, the Company's
insurance subsidiaries report on a calendar year basis while the
Company reports on a fiscal year basis ending March 31.
Accordingly, with respect to the Company's insurance subsidiaries,
any reference to the years 1993, 1992, and 1991 corresponds to the
Company's fiscal years 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  There
have been no events as to such subsidiaries between January 1 and
March 31 of each of 1994, 1993, and 1992 that would materially
affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively.

          The following management discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with Notes 1, 19, and 20 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which discuss the
principles of consolidation, condensed consolidated financial
information, and industry segment and geographic data,
respectively.  In consolidation, all intersegment premiums are
eliminated and the benefits, losses, and expenses are retained by
the insurance companies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1994, 1993, AND 1992

          The following table shows industry segment data from the
Company's three industry segments, rental operations, life
insurance, and property and casualty insurance, for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992.  Rental operations is
composed of the operations of U-Haul and AREC.  Life insurance is
composed of the operations of Oxford.  Property and casualty
insurance is composed of the operations of RWIC.

</TABLE>

FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 1994 VERSUS FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 1993

U-HAUL OPERATIONS

          U-Haul revenues consist of (i) total rental and other
revenue and (ii) net sales.  Total rental and other revenue
increased by $63.3 million, approximately 8.5%, to $809.4 million
in fiscal 1994.  The increase from fiscal 1993 is primarily
attributable to a $52.2 million increase in net revenues from the
rental of moving related equipment, which benefited from
transactional growth reflecting higher utilization and rental fleet
expansion.  Revenues from the rental of self-storage facilities
increased by  $6.6 million to $70.5 million  in fiscal 1994, an
increase of approximately 10.3%.  Storage revenues were positively
impacted by additional rentable square footage, higher average
occupancy levels, and higher average rental rates.  All other
revenue categories increased in the aggregate by $8.7 million
during the current year which primarily reflects increases in gains
on note sales of approximately $5.0 million and interest income.

          Net Sales were $156.0 million in fiscal 1994, which
represented an increase of approximately 7.2% from fiscal 1993 net
sales of $145.5 million.  Revenue growth from the sale of hitches,
moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.), and propane net sales 
increased $10.7 million during the current year.

          Cost of sales was $92.2 million in fiscal 1994, which
represented a decrease of approximately 1.0% from fiscal 1993.  The
reduction in fiscal 1994 reflects a combination of the absence of
recreational vehicle sales, reduced levels of outside repair and a
reduction in inventory adjustments which fully offset increased
material costs corresponding to the increase in hitch, moving
support and propane sales.

          Operating expenses increased to $633.6 million in fiscal
1994 from $599.8 million in fiscal 1993, an increase of
approximately 5.6%.  The change from the prior year reflects
increases in almost all major expense categories with the exception
of lease expense for equipment.  Rental equipment maintenance costs
increased by $27.4 million reflecting fleet expansion, higher
utilization, a marginal increase in the age of the fleet and
increased emphasis on maximizing rental equipment available to rent
<PAGE> 25
by reducing downtime.  Lease expense for equipment declined from
$117.6 million in fiscal 1993 to $82.9 million in fiscal 1994, a
decrease of approximately 29.5%, reflecting lease terminations,
lease restructuring and lower finance costs on new leases
originated during the current year.  All other operating expense
categories increased in the aggregate by $41.1 million,
approximately 12.4%, to $373.0 million which is primarily
attributable to higher levels of rental and sales activity.

          Depreciation expense during fiscal 1994 was $133.5
million as compared to $110.1 million in the prior year, reflecting
the addition of new trucks and trailers and the acquisition of
trucks that were previously leased.

OXFORD - LIFE INSURANCE

          Premiums from Oxford's reinsurance lines before
intercompany eliminations were $15.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 1993, an increase of $0.9 million, approximately 6.0%
over 1992 and accounted for 88.7% of Oxford's premiums in 1993.
These premiums are primarily from term life insurance and single
and flexible premium deferred annuities.  Increases in premiums are
primarily from the anticipated increase in annuitizations as a
result of the maturing of deferred annuities.

          Premiums from Oxford's direct lines before intercompany
eliminations were $2.0 million in 1993, a decrease of $1.0 million
(33%) from the prior year.  Oxford's direct lines are principally
related to the underwriting of group life and disability income.
Insurance on the lives of the employees of AMERCO and its
subsidiary companies accounted for approximately 6.3% of Oxford's
premiums in 1993.  Other direct lines accounted for approximately
5.0% of Oxford's premiums in 1993.

          Net investment income before intercompany eliminations
was $12.6 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Gains on the disposition of fixed
maturity investments were $2.1 million and $4.7 million.  Oxford
had $1.8 million and $2.2 million of other income, for 1993 and
1992, respectively.

          Benefits and expenses incurred were $24.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1993, an increase of 5.2% over 1992.
Comparable benefits and expenses incurred for 1992 were $23.2
million.  This increase is primarily due to the increase in
annuitizations discussed above.

          Operating profit after intercompany eliminations
decreased by $3.4 million, approximately 27.6%, in 1993 to $8.9
million, primarily due to the decrease in gains on fixed maturity
investments.
<PAGE> 26
RWIC - PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

          RWIC gross premium writings for the year ended December
31, 1993 were $175.1 million, compared to $155.2 million in 1992,
an increase of approximately 12.8%  The rental industry market
accounted for a significant share of these premiums, approximately
37% and 40% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  These writings include
U-Haul customers, fleetowners and U-Haul as well as other rental
industry insureds with similar characteristics.  Selected general
agency lines, principally commercial multiple peril, surety and
excess workers' compensation and casualty accounted for 8.1%, 3.2%
and 5.4% respectively, of gross premium writings in 1993, compared
to approximately 15.4%, 2.8% and 11.9% respectively in 1992.  RWIC
also underwrites reinsurance via broker markets, and premiums in
this area increased from $47.1 million in 1992 to $59.5 million in
1993 due to favorable market conditions.

          Net earned premiums increased $24.3 million,
approximately 24%, to $125.4 million for the year ended December
31, 1993.  This compares with net earned premiums of $101.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 1992.  The premium increase was
primarily due to increased writings in the reinsurance area, along
with growth in the excess workers' compensation line of RWIC's
general agency business.

          Underwriting expenses incurred were $135.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1993, an increase of $17.8 million,
approximately 15.1% over 1992.  Comparable underwriting expenses
incurred for 1992 were $117.8 million.  Higher underwriting
expenses are due to larger premium volumes being written in 1993
which increased acquisition costs and commensurate reserves.

          Net investment income was $27.4 million in 1993, a
decrease of approximately 6.5%, as compared to 1992 net investment
income of $29.3 million.  This decrease is due primarily to lower
rates available in the high quality fixed income market.  RWIC's
net realized gain on the sale of investments was $2.1 million and
$0.7 million in 1993 and 1992, repectively, while other income
totaled $1.4 million and $2.9 million.

          RWIC completed 1993 with net after tax income of $14.8
million as compared to $11.8 million for the comparable period
ended December 1992.  This represents an increase of $3.0 million,
or 25.4% over 1992.  The increase is due to a combination of better
underwriting results and unplanned gains on bond calls.  Net income
at December 31, 1992 of $11.8 million includes the effect of
adopting SFAS 109 (Accounting for Income Taxes), previously
reported December 31, 1992 net income was $12.8 million.
<PAGE> 27
INTEREST EXPENSE

          Interest expense was $68.8 million in fiscal 1994, as
compared to $68.0 million in fiscal 1993.  The increase reflects
higher average levels of debt outstanding (see liquidity and
capital resources), a higher proportion of fixed rate debt, and a
lengthening of maturities offset by lower cost of funds.

                         
FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 1993 VERSUS FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 1992

U-HAUL OPERATIONS

          U-Haul revenues consist of (i) total rental and other
revenue and (ii) net sales.  Total rental and other revenue
increased by $57.6 million, approximately 8.4%, to $746.1 million
in fiscal 1993.  The increase from fiscal 1992 is primarily
attributable to a $54.7 million increase in net revenues from the
rental of moving related equipment, which rose to $684.1 million,
as compared to $629.4 million, in fiscal 1992.  Improved
utilization within the truck rental fleet accounted for the
majority of the revenue growth, with one-way rental transactions
increasing by 6.1% and local rental transactions increasing by
16.5%.  Also contributing to the increased revenues was an increase
in the number of available rental trailers and trucks.  Revenues
from the rental of self-storage facilities increased $5.3 million
to $63.9 million in fiscal 1993, an increase of approximately 9.2%.
Storage revenues were positively impacted by additional rentable
square footage, higher average occupancy levels, and higher average
rental rates.  The increases in revenues from the rental of moving-
related equipment and self-storage facilities were partially offset
by an aggregate decrease of $2.4 million in general rental item
revenues, gains on the sale of property, plant, and equipment, and
other miscellaneous revenues.

          Net sales were $145.5 million in fiscal 1993, which
represented a decrease of approximately 6.7% from fiscal 1992 net
sales of $156.0 million.  Moderate revenue growth from the sale of
hitches, moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.), and propane was
offset by reduced sales of recreational vehicles due to the
liquidation of inventory as well as a reduction in outside repair
income due to a reduction in rental trucks owned by a third party,
which were previously under a managed equipment agreement.

          Cost of sales was $93.1 million in fiscal 1993, which
represented a decrease of approximately 9.5% from fiscal 1992.  The
reduction in fiscal 1993 reflects reductions in recreational
vehicle sales and outside repair income.

          Operating expenses increased to $599.8 million in fiscal
1993 from $562.3 million in fiscal 1992, an increase of
approximately 6.7%.  The change from the prior year primarily
reflects increased rental equipment maintenance costs and higher
personnel costs.  The higher maintenance costs reflect a slight
<PAGE> 28
increase in the age of the truck fleet due to no new units being
added in fiscal 1992 and a relatively small number of new units
being added in fiscal 1993.  Also contributing to higher
maintenance costs were U-Haul's repurchase of rental trucks owned
by a third party, which were previously under a managed equipment
agreement, and higher utilization.  Lease expense for the fleet
replacement cycle initiated in 1987 peaked in fiscal 1992 at $121.9
million and subsequently declined to $117.6 million in fiscal 1993,
a decrease of approximately 3.5%.

OXFORD - LIFE INSURANCE

          Premiums from Oxford's reinsurance lines before
intercompany eliminations were $14.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1992, a decrease of $4.1 million, approximately 21.6%
from 1991 and accounted for 83.3% of Oxford's premiums in 1992.
These premiums are primarily from term life insurance and single
and flexible premium deferred annuities.  Reductions in premiums
reflect the anticipated decrease in renewal premiums as a result of
normal attrition and mortality, combined with the fact that during
1992 Oxford reduced its activities in the reinsurance market
compared to 1991 because of unfavorable market conditions.

          Premiums from Oxford's direct lines before intercompany
eliminations were $3.0 million in 1992, an increase of $1.5 million
(100%) over the prior year.  Oxford's direct lines are principally
related to the underwriting of group life and disability income.
Insurance on the lives of the employees of AMERCO and its
subsidiary companies accounted for approximately 10.8% of Oxford's
premiums in 1992.  Other direct lines accounted for approximately
5.9% of Oxford's premiums in 1992.

          Net investment income before intercompany eliminations
was $11.5 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December
31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Gains on the disposition of fixed
maturity investments were $4.7 million and $0.1 million.  Oxford
had $2.2 million and $1.6 million of other income, for 1992 and
1991, respectively.

          Benefits and expenses incurred were $23.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 1992, an increase of 7.9% over 1991.
Comparable benefits and expenses incurred for 1991 were $21.5
million.  This increase is primarily due to the increase in
deferred acquisition cost amortization discussed below.

          Operating profit increased by $1.3 million, approximately
11.5%, in 1992 to $12.3 million, primarily due to increased margins
on interest-sensitive business and gains on disposition or
prepayments of fixed maturity investments.  As required by
generally accepted accounting principles, the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs was accelerated due to gains on
the fixed maturity investments associated with interest-sensitive
products, resulting in a charge of approximately $2.0 million.

RWIC - PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

          RWIC gross premium writings for the year ended December
31, 1992 were $155.2 million, compared to $133.7 million in 1991,
an increase of approximately 16.1%.  The rental industry market
accounted for a significant share of these premiums, approximately
40% and 53% in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  These writings include
U-Haul customers, fleetowners, and U-Haul, as well as other rental
industry insureds with similar characteristics.  Selected general
agency lines, principally commercial multiple peril, surety and
excess workers compensation and casualty accounted for
approximately 15.4%, 2.8%, and 11.9% respectively, of gross premium
writings in 1992, compared to approximately 12.8%, 1.8%, and 14.8%
respectively, in 1991.  RWIC also underwrites reinsurance via
broker markets, and premiums in this area increased from $23.1
million in 1991 to $47.1 million in 1992 due to favorable market
conditions.

          Net earned premiums increased $12.3 million,
approximately 13.9%, to $101.1 million for the year ended December
31, 1992.  This compares with net earned premiums of $88.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 1991.  The premium increase was
primarily due to increased writings in the reinsurance area, along
with growth in the commercial multiple peril lines of RWIC's
general agency business.

          Underwriting expenses incurred were $117.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 1992, an increase of $21.1 million,
approximately 21.8%, over 1991.  Comparable underwriting expenses
incurred for 1991 were $96.7 million.  Higher underwriting expenses
due to Hurricane Andrew related losses (approximately $12 million
on a pre-tax basis) incurred in the reinsurance area were the
largest contributors to this increase, and accounted for
approximately 57% of the increase.

          Net investment income was $29.3 million in 1992, a
decrease of approximately 0.7%, as compared to 1991 net investment
income of $29.5 million.  The slight decrease in net investment
income is due largely to the lower rates available in the high
quality fixed income market.  RWIC's gain on the sale of
investments was $0.7 million and $0.6 million, and RWIC had $2.9
million of other income for 1992 and other expense of $0.9 million
for 1991.

          RWIC's operating profit in 1992 decreased $5.0 million,
approximately 23.6%, to $16.2 million from $21.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 1991.

INTEREST EXPENSE

          Interest expense was $68.0 million in fiscal 1993, as
compared to $76.2 million in fiscal 1992.  The decline in interest
expense reflects lower average debt levels outstanding and
favorable refinance costs on maturing debt.
<PAGE> 30
RESULT OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED GROUP

          As a result of the foregoing, pre-tax earnings of $66.0
million were realized in fiscal 1994 as compared to $49.2 million
in fiscal 1993 and $25.7 million in fiscal 1992.  After providing
for income taxes, extraordinary costs associated with the early
retirement of debt and the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle, net earnings for fiscal 1994 were $40.2
million as compared to $31.9 million in fiscal 1993 and $20.8
million in fiscal 1992.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

U-HAUL OPERATIONS

          To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain
a large inventory of fixed asset rental items.  At March 31, 1994,
net property, plant and equipment represented approximately  73.7%
of total U-Haul assets and approximately 50.1% of consolidated
assets.  In fiscal 1994, capital expenditures increased to $530.5
million, as compared to $130.8 million in fiscal 1993, due to
expansion of the rental truck fleet, the purchase of trucks
previously leased, and increases in the available square footage in
the self-storage segment.  The capital needs required to fund these
acquisitions were funded with internally generated funds from
operations, debt and lease financings and the issuance of preferred
stock.

          Cash flows from operations was $202.3 million in fiscal
1994, as compared to $162.8 million in fiscal 1993.  The increase
results from an increase in net earnings and depreciation and
amortization.

          At March 31, 1994, total notes and loans payable
outstanding was $723.8 million as compared to $697.1 million at
March 31, 1993.  This increase reflects the impact of higher levels
of capital additions and expenditures for premature lease
terminations initiated by the Company.

          During each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 1995,
1996, 1997, U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will
average approximately $360 million as a result of the expansion of
the rental truck fleet and storage segment.  This level of capital
expenditures, combined with an average of approximately $100
million in annual long-term debt maturities during this same
period, are expected to create annual average funding needs of
approximately $460 million.  Management estimates that U-Haul will
fund approximately 55% of these requirements with internally
generated funds, including proceeds from the disposition of older
trucks and other asset sales.  The remainder of the required
capital expenditures are expected to be financed through existing
credit facilities, new debt placements, lease fundings, and equity
offerings.  During fiscal 1994, the Company arranged approximately
$652 million in debt, lease and equity financing which has
significantly increased liquidity available to the Company in the
<PAGE> 31
form of short-term investments, and unutilized committed and
uncommitted facilities.  In October 1993, the Company placed $152.5
million in preferred stock through a public offering.

OXFORD - LIFE INSURANCE

          Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts
from interest-sensitive products, and investment income.  The
primary uses of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to
policyholders.  Matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow
demands of the types of insurance being written is an important
consideration.  Benefit and claim statistics are continually
monitored to provide projections of future cash requirements.

          Cash provided by operations and financing activities
amounted to $4.1 million, $6.2 million, and $185.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  In
1991, cash flows from new reinsurance agreements were approximately
$154.0 million.  During 1993 and 1992 there were no cash flows from
new reinsurance agreements.  In addition to cash flow from
operations and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid
funds are available through Oxford's short-term portfolio.  At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, short-term investments amounted to $8.4
million and $12.2 million, respectively.  Management believes that
the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable
cash needs.

          Stockholder's equity of Oxford, excluding investment in
RWIC, decreased to $86.9 million in 1993 from $90.8 million in
1992.  During 1993, Oxford paid dividends of $10.0 million to
Ponderosa.

          Applicable laws and regulations of the State of Arizona
require the Company's insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum
capital determined in accordance with statutory accounting
practices in the amount of $1.0 million.  In addition, the amount
of dividends that can be paid to shareholders by insurance
companies domiciled in the State of Arizona is limited.  Any
dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval.
Statutory surplus that can be distributed as dividends without
prior regulatory approval is $17,619,000 at December 31, 1993.
These restrictions are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.

RWIC - PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

          RWIC's short-term investment portfolio was $6.2 million
at December 31, 1993.  This level of liquid assets, combined with
budgeted cash flow, is believed by management to be adequate to
meet periodic needs.  The structure of the long-term portfolio is
designed to match future cash needs.  Through capital and operating
budgets, RWIC seeks to schedule cash needs in accordance with
investment and underwriting proceeds.  RWIC does not have plans for
any near-term large capital outlays.

<PAGE> 32
          RWIC maintains a diversified investment portfolio,
primarily in bonds at varying maturity levels.  Ninety-eight
percent of the bond portfolio consists of investment grade
securities.  The maturity distribution is designed to provide
sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current liquidity
is adequate, with current invested assets equal to 99.7% of total
liabilities.

          The liability for unpaid losses is based on the estimated
ultimate cost of settling claims reported prior to the end of the
accounting period, estimates received from ceding reinsurers, and
estimates for unreported losses based on the historical experience
of RWIC, supplemented by insurance industry historical experience.
The liability for unpaid loss adjustment expenses is based on
historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.
Unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted.

          Stockholder's equity of RWIC increased approximately
10.4% to $165.1 million in 1993 from $149.6 million in 1992.
Stockholder's equity at December 31, 1992 includes the impact of
adopting SFAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (as previously
reported, RWIC's stockholder's equity as of that date was $134.7
million).  As of March 31, 1994, stockholders' equity of RWIC was
$170.2 million.

CREDIT AGREEMENTS

          The Company's operations are funded by various credit and
financing arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings,
unsecured medium-term notes, and revolving lines of credit with
domestic and foreign banks.  As of March 31, 1994, the Company had
$723.8 million in total notes and loans payable outstanding and
unutilized committed lines of credit of approximately $141.5
million.

          Certain of the Company's credit agreements contain
restrictive financial and other covenants, including, among others,
covenants with respect to incurring additional indebtedness,
maintaining certain financial ratios, and placing certain
additional liens on its properties and assets.  At March 31, 1994,
the Company was in compliance with these covenants.  In addition,
these credit agreements contain provisions that could result in a
required prepayment upon a "change in control" of the Company.

          Under certain of the Company's credit agreements, a
"change in control" is deemed to occur if (a) any transfer of any
shares of any class of capital stock results in the Company's ESOP
and members of the Shoen family owning in the aggregate less than
the amount of capital stock as may be necessary to enable them to
cast in excess of 50% of the votes for the election of directors of
the Company or (b) during any period of two consecutive years,
persons who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board
of Directors of the Company (including any director approved by a
vote of not less than 66 2/3% of such board) cease for any reason
to constitute greater than 50% of the then acting Board.
<PAGE> 33 
          The Company is further restricted in the type and amount
of dividends and distributions that it may issue or pay, and in the
issuance of certain types of preferred stock.  The Company is
prohibited from issuing shares of preferred stock that provide for
any mandatory redemption, sinking fund payment, or mandatory
prepayment, or that allow the holders thereof to require the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company to repurchase such
preferred stock at the option of such holders or upon the
occurrence of any event or events without the consent of its
lenders.

OTHER

          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
in December 1990.  The statement requires that the expected costs
of health care and life insurance provided to retired employees by
recognized as expense during the years employees render service.
The Company adopted the provisions of this statement effective
April 1, 1993.  The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
recognized by the Company at April 1, 1993 was $5.0 million.  Net
of income taxes, the cumulative effect of adoption at April 1, 1993
was $3.1 million.

          Further, during the first quarter of fiscal 1994 the
Company adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This statement requires a
change from the deferred to the liability method of computing
deferred income taxes.  The adoption of the provisions of this
statement resulted in a $11.1 million net increase in deferred
income taxes payable.  The Company adopted this change
retroactively to April 1, 1988.  For additional information, see
Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

          In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  The statement
applies to employers who provide certain benefits to former or
inactive employees after employment but before retirement.  It
requires that the cost of such benefits be recognized over the
service period of employees as these benefits vest or accumulate.
The provisions of this statement must be adopted for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993.  The effect of this statement on
the Company's financial position or results of operations will not
be material.

          In December 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113,
"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts."  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company
adopted the standard.  The primary impact on the Company's
financial statements is the requirement to report assets and
liabilities relating to reinsured contracts gross of the effects of
reinsurance.  Previously, such effects were reported on a net
<PAGE> 34
basis.  As a result of adoption of the standard, unpaid losses and
loss expenses as of March 31, 1994 have been increased by
approximately $76 million to reflect the Company's policy
liabilities without regard to reinsurance.  A corresponding amount
due from reinsurers on unpaid losses, including amounts related to
claims incurred but not reported, has also been reflected.
Additionally, unearned premiums have been increased by
approximately $12 million for policy premiums ceded to reinsurers
for which the coverage period has not yet expired.  Prepaid
insurance premiums of a corresponding amount have also been
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.  The consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 1993 has not been restated to reflect
the adoption of the standard.

          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", was issued by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board in May 1993.  This
standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 1994.
The standard requires that an impaired loan's fair value be
measured and compared to the recorded investment in the loan.  If
the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in
the loan, a valuation allowance is established.  The Company has
not completed an evaluation of the effect of this standard.

          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities",
was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in May 1993.
This standard requires classification of debt securities into one
of the following three categories based on management's intention
with regard to such securities:  held-to-maturity, available-for-
sale and trading.  Securities classified as held-to-maturity are
recorded at cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums or
accretion of discounts while those classified as available-for-sale
are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported
on a net basis in a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Securities classified as trading are recorded at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses reported on a net basis in income.
Effective December 31, 1993, RWIC adopted the standard.  RWIC does
not currently maintain a trading portfolio.  Oxford and U-Haul have
not completed an evaluation of this standard.

          Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising
Costs", was issued by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
in December 1993.  This statement of position provides guidance on
financial reporting on advertising costs in annual financial
statements.  The statement of position requires reporting
advertising costs as expenses when incurred or when the advertising
takes place, reporting the costs of direct-response advertising,
and amortizing the amount of direct-response advertising reported
as assets.  This statement of position is effective for financial
statements for years beginning after June 15, 1994.  The Company
currently matches certain advertising costs with revenue generated
in future periods, and at March 31, 1994, $8.2 million in
advertising costs are deferred and included in prepaid expenses.
<PAGE> 35 
The Company has completed an evaluation of the effect of this
statement of position but has not determined the timing of
adoption.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

          Inflation has had no material financial effect on the
Company's results of operations in the years discussed.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS




To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of AMERCO


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and schedules listed in
the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 36 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of AMERCO and its subsidiaries at
March  31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test 
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the 
opinion expressed above.

As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for ceded reinsurance, certain
investments and postretirement benefits in fiscal 1994.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The Summary of Earnings of Independent
Trailer Fleets included on pages 83 through 85 of this Form 10-K is presented
for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic
financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relating to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                      March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992


(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
    the accounts of the parent corporation, AMERCO, and its subsidiaries, all
    of which are wholly-owned.  All material intercompany accounts and
    transactions of AMERCO and its subsidiaries (herein called the "Company" or
    the "consolidated group") have been eliminated.

   The operating results and financial position of AMERCO's consolidated
    insurance operations are determined as of December 31 of each year.  There
    were no effects related to intervening events which would significantly
    affect consolidated financial position or results of operations for the
    financial statements presented herein.  See Note 19 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements of AMERCO for additional information
    regarding the subsidiary.

   Description of Business: The consolidated group's principal line of business
    is the rental of various kinds of equipment, principally trucks, automobile-
    type trailers, auto transports and general rental items, including floor
    care items, tools for home and garden use, recreational equipment and
    accessories under the brand name U-Haul and the sale of related products
    and services.  In addition, the consolidated group is engaged in the rental
    of self-storage facilities for the storage of household goods and other
    forms of personal property.  Through Ponderosa Holdings, Inc.,
    ("Ponderosa"), which serves as the holding company for Oxford Life
    Insurance Company ("Oxford") and Republic Western Insurance Company
    ("RWIC"), the Company operates in various life, annuity, group health and
    property/ casualty insurance products.  A portion of the insurance
    subsidiaries' business is conducted with members of the consolidated group.

   Foreign Currency: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
    of U-Haul Co. (Canada) Ltd., a subsidiary of AMERCO.

   Assets (including property, plant and equipment) and liabilities,
    denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, are translated to U.S.
    dollars at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.  Income and
    expense amounts (including depreciation expense) are translated at the
    average exchange rate during the fiscal year.

   Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers liquid investments with an
     original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued


(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

   Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable
     of Ponderosa include premiums and agents' balances due net of commissions
     payable and amounts due from ceding reinsurers.  Accounts receivable of
     Ponderosa are reduced by amounts considered to be uncollectible.  Accounts
     receivable of the Company's rental subsidiaries principally include trade
     accounts receivable and mortgage and other notes receivable.  Allowance
     for doubtful accounts are provided based on historical collection loss
     experience and a review of the current  status of existing receivables by
     the Company's rental subsidiaries.

   Inventories: Inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost (last-in
    first-out) (LIFO) or market.

   Investments: Fixed maturities consist of bonds and redeemable preferred
    stock which are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium or
    accretion of discount.  Oxford's intent is to hold these investments until
    maturity.  Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at unpaid balances,
    less allowance for possible losses and any unamortized premium or discount.
    Real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Policy loans
    are carried at their unpaid balance.  Short-term investments consist of
    other securities scheduled to mature within one year of their acquisition
    date.  Amounts held by ceding reinsurers represent obligations due to
    Oxford.  These obligations of the ceding company are supported by
    investments in fixed maturities.  See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements of AMERCO.

   Interest on bonds is recognized when earned.  Dividends on preferred stocks
    are recognized on ex-dividend dates.  Realized gains and losses on the sale
    of investments are recognized at the trade date and included in net income
    using the specific identification method.

   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs:  Commissions and other costs incurred in
    acquiring traditional life insurance, interest sensitive life and annuity
    policies, group health insurance and property-casualty insurance which vary
    with and are primarily related to the production of new business, have been
    deferred.

   Traditional life, annuity and group health acquisition costs are amortized
    over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the
    ratio of annual premium income to expected total premium income.  Such
    expected premium income is estimated using assumptions as to mortality and
    withdrawals consistent with those used in calculating the policy benefit
    reserves.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued


(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

   Acquisition costs for interest sensitive life insurance and annuity policies
    are being amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the
    present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges and
    investment, mortality and expense margins.

   Property-casualty acquisition costs are amortized over the related contract
    period which generally does not exceed one year.

   Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are carried at
    cost and are depreciated on the straight-line and accelerated methods over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Maintenance and repairs are
    charged to operating expenses as incurred.  Major overhaul costs of rental
    equipment, principally trucks, are amortized over an estimated period
    benefitted of one year.  Renewals and betterments are capitalized.  Gains
    and losses on dispositions of property, plant and equipment are included in
    other revenue as realized.  Interest costs incurred as part of the initial
    acquisition of assets are capitalized.  Interest expense of $595,000,
    $159,000 and $234,000 was capitalized in the years ended 1994, 1993 and
    1992, respectively.

   Rental truck extended warranty costs are amortized over a period of 5 or 6
    years.  The amount amortized is based on an annual percentage provided by
    the truck manufacturer.  Extended warranty costs of $2,830,000 are deferred
    as of March 31, 1993 and are included in prepaid expenses.  Extended
    warranty costs deferred as of March 31, 1994 are immaterial.

   Certain recoverable environmental costs related to the removal of
     underground storage tanks or related contamination are capitalized and
     depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the properties.  The
     capitalized costs improve the safety or efficiency of the property as
     compared to when the property was originally acquired or are incurred in
     preparing the property for sale.

   Financial Instruments:  The Company enters into interest rate swap
    agreements to reduce its interest rate exposure.  Amounts to be paid or
    received under the agreements are accrued as interest rates change and are
    recognized as incurred.  Although the Company is exposed to credit loss for
    the interest rate differential in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to the agreements, it does not anticipate nonperformance by
    the counterparties.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued


(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

   At March 31, 1994, interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional
    amount of $193,000,000 were outstanding.  At March 31, 1994, a value of
    $14,000,000 was determined from treasury rates combined with a swap spread
    which represents the estimated amount the Company would pay to terminate
    the agreements.  The Company has one additional swap outstanding in the
    amount of $15,000,000 which is a component of a note agreement with a bank.
    The fair value of the swap component of the agreement cannot be separated
    from the entire note agreement to determine the estimated fair value.  The
    amount of the note outstanding at March 31, 1994 is $15,000,000 with a
    fixed yen interest rate of 6.2% and a maturity date of November 30, 1994.

   The Company has mortgage loans which potentially expose the Company to
    credit risk.  The portfolio of notes is principally comprised of mini-
    warehouse storage facilities and other residential and commercial
    properties.  The Company has not experienced losses related to the notes
    from individual notes or groups of notes in any particular industry or
    geographic area.

   At March 31, 1994, mortgage notes with a book value of $90,876,000 were
    outstanding.  The estimated fair value of the notes at March 31, 1994 was
    $92,778,000.  The value was determined using discounted cash flows at a
    rate of 7.1% for residential and commercial notes and from bids related to
    the mini-warehouse storage notes.  At March 31, 1993, mortgage notes with a
    book value of $104,888,000 were outstanding.  The estimated fair value of
    the notes at March 31, 1993 was $107,367,000.  Other financial instruments 
    that are subject to fair value disclosure requirements are carried in the
    financial statements at amounts that approximate fair value.

   The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
    credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments and trade
    receivables.  The Company places its temporary cash investments with
    financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
    financial institution.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
    receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their
    dispersion across many different industries and geographic areas.

   Policy Benefits and Losses, Claims and Loss Expenses Payable: Liabilities
    for policy benefits payable on traditional life and annuity policies are
    established in amounts adequate to meet estimated future obligations on
    policies in force.  These liabilities are computed using the net level
    premium method and include mortality and withdrawal assumptions which are
    based upon recognized actuarial tables and contain margins for adverse
    deviation.  At December 31, 1993, interest assumptions used to compute
    policy benefits payable range from 2 1/2% to 11 1/4%.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued


(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

   With respect to interest sensitive life and annuity policies, the liability
    for policy benefits and expenses payable consists of policy account
    balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding
    surrender charges.

   Liabilities for group health and other policy claims and benefits payable
    represent estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for reported
    losses and estimates of losses incurred but not yet reported.  These
    estimates are based on past claims experience and consider current claim
    trends as well as social and economic conditions.

   Liabilities for property-casualty losses represent the estimated ultimate
    unpaid cost of settling claims reported prior to the end of the accounting
    period, estimates received from ceding reinsurers and estimates for
    unreported losses based on historical experience supplemented by insurance
    industry historical experience.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based
    on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.

   Rental and Other Revenue: AMERCO recognizes its share of rental revenue on
    the accrual basis pursuant to contractual arrangements between AMERCO,
    fleet owners, rental dealers and customers.  See Note 8 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements of AMERCO for further discussion.

   Premium Revenue: Group health and property-casualty gross premiums are
    prorated over the term of the related contracts.  Traditional life and
    annuity premiums are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders.
    Revenue for interest sensitive life insurance and annuity policies consist
    of surrender charges that have been assessed against policy account
    balances during the period.  Benefits and expenses are associated with
    amortization of policy acquisition costs.

   Reinsurance: Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, and
    reserves related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases
    consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued
    and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.  Premiums ceded to other
    companies have been reported as a reduction of premium income.  Amounts
    applicable to reinsurance ceded for future policy benefits, unearned
    premium reserves, and claim liabilities have been reported as reductions of
    these items, and expense allowances received in connection with reinsurance
    ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy
    acquisition costs and are deferred and amortized accordingly.

   Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for all items included in
    the Consolidated Statements of Earnings which are reported in different
    accounting periods for tax purposes.

   Effective fiscal 1991, the Company elected to file a consolidated federal
    income tax return with its insurance subsidiaries.  Previously, federal
    income tax returns were filed separately by the insurance company
    subsidiaries.  See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of
    AMERCO.

   New Accounting Standards:

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 - Employers' Accounting
    for Postemployment Benefits.

   Issued in November 1992, this Statement applies to employers who provide
    certain benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but
    before retirement.  It requires that the cost of such benefits be
    recognized over the service period of employees as these benefits vest or
    accumulate.  The provisions of this statement must be adopted for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 1993.  The impact of adoption of this
    statement will not be material.

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113 - Accounting and
    Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts.

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 113.  The primary impact
    on the Company's financial statements is the requirement to report assets
    and liabilities relating to reinsured contracts gross of the effects of
    reinsurance.  Previously, such effects were reported on a net basis.  As a
    result of the adoption of SFAS 113, unpaid losses and loss expenses as of
    March 31, 1994 have been increased by approximately $76 million to reflect
    the Company's policy liabilities without regard to reinsurance.  A
    corresponding amount due from reinsurers on unpaid losses, including
    amounts related to claims incurred but not reported, has also been
    reflected.  Additionally, unearned premiums have been increased by
    approximately $12 million for policy premiums ceded to reinsurers for which
    the coverage period has not yet expired.  Prepaid reinsurance premiums of a
    corresponding amount have also been reflected in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.  The consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,
    1993 has not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 113 as of that
    date.

(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by 
     Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", was issued by the Financial 
     Accounting Standards Board in May 1993.  This standard is effective 
     for years beginning after December 15, 1994.  The standard requires 
     that an impired loan's fair value be measured and compared to the 
     recorded investment in the loan.  If the fair value of the loan is  
     less than the recorded investment in the loan, a valuation allowance
     is established.  The Company has not completed an evaluation of the 
     effect of the standard.
   
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 - Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

   Effective December 31, 1993, RWIC adopted SFAS 115.  This statement requires
    classification of debt securities into one of the following three
    categories based on management's intention with regard to such securities:
    held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and trading.  Securities classified as
    held-to-maturity are recorded at cost adjusted for the amortization of
    premiums or accretion of discounts while those classified as available-for-
    sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported on
    a net basis as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Securities
    classified as trading, if any, are recorded at fair value with unrealized
    gains or losses reported on a net basis in income.  RWIC does not currently
    maintain a trading portfolio.  U-Haul and Oxford will adopt this statement 
    in fiscal 1995.  An evaluation of this statement has not been completed by 
    U-Haul or Oxford.

   Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs", was issued by
     the Accounting Standards Executive Committee in December 1993.  This
     statement of position provides guidance on financial reporting on
     advertising costs in annual financial statements.  The statement of
     position requires reporting advertising costs as expenses when incurred or
     when the advertising takes place, reporting the costs of direct-response
     advertising, and amortizing the amount of direct-response advertising
     reported as assets.  This statement of position is effective for financial
     statements for years beginning after June 15, 1994.  The Company currently
     matches certain advertising costs with revenue generated in future periods,
     and at March 31, 1994, $8.2 million in advertising costs are deferred and
     included in prepaid expenses.  The Company has completed an evaluation of
     the effect of this statement of position but has not determined the timing
     of adoption.

   Earnings per share:  Earnings per common share are computed based on the
    weighted average number of shares outstanding and net income reduced for
    preferred dividends.  See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements of AMERCO for further discussion.

   Financial Statement Presentation:  Certain reclassifications have been made
     to the financial statements for the years ended 1993 and 1992 to conform
     with the current year's presentation.

   Certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to ending
    inventories.  Such costs remaining in inventory at years-ended 1994, 1993
    and 1992 are estimated at $7,679,000, $7,224,000 and $7,100,000,
    respectively.  For the years-ended March 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, aggregate
    general and administrative costs were $430,209,000, $467,390,000 and
    $426,021,000, respectively.

   LIFO inventories, which represent approximately 98% of total inventories at
    year-end 1994 (95% at year-end 1993), would have been $3,591,000 greater at
    year-end 1994 ($3,325,000 at year-end 1993) if the consolidated group had
    used the FIFO method.

     prices at the close of trading December 31, 1993 or December 31, 1992, as
     appropriate.

   The amortized cost and estimated market value of debt securities by
     contractual maturity are shown below.  Expected maturities will differ
     from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call
     or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

   Domestic/Eurodollar revolving credit loans are available from participating
    banks under an agreement which provides for a total credit line of
    $170,500,000 through the expiration date of the revolving term of September
    25, 1995.  The Company may elect to borrow under the credit agreement in
    the form of Eurodollar borrowings or domestic dollar borrowings.  Depending
    on the form of borrowing elected, interest will be based on the prime rate,
    the certificate of deposit rate, the federal funds effective rate or the
    interbank offering rate and in addition, margin interest rates will be
    charged.  Loans may also be at a fixed rate based upon the discretion of
    the borrower and lender.  At March 31, 1994, the weighted average interest
    rate on borrowings outstanding was 3.97%.  Facility fees, which are based
    upon the amount of credit line, aggregated $588,000 and $381,000 for 1994
    and 1993, respectively.  Prior to August 1992, the agreement required
    payment of commitment fees.  Commitment fees, which are based upon any
    unused credit line, aggregated $230,000 for 1993.  As of year-end 1994,
    loans outstanding under the revolving credit line totaled $45,000,000.
    Management intends to refinance the borrowings on a long-term basis by
    either replacing them with long-term obligations, renewing or extending
    them.

   AMERCO has lines of credit with various banks totaling $106,289,000 at March
    31, 1994.

   The Company has executed interest rate swap agreements ("SWAPS") to
    potentially mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its
    floating rate debt.  These agreements effectively change the Company's
    interest rate exposure on $208,000,000 of floating rate notes to a weighted
    average fixed rate of 8.61%.  The SWAP's mature at the time the related
    notes mature.

   During fiscal 1994, SWAP's aggregating approximately $77.0 million were
    terminated.  In addition, the Company exercised existing SWAP agreements
    aggregating approximately $50.0 million during fiscal 1994.  Incremental
    interest expense associated with SWAP activity was $11,989,000 and
    $9,724,000 during 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   The notes payable and the loan agreements contain certain restrictive
    covenants including limits on the incurrence of other indebtedness,
    restrictions on related party transactions, and restrictions on the
    aggregate amount of dividends payable to Common stockholders and
    repurchases of capital stock.  Under the most restrictive dividend
    covenant, AMERCO is prohibited from paying dividends if, at the time of
    payment, cumulative dividends are in excess of the sum of $15,000,000 plus
    50% of consolidated net income as defined, for the entire period subsequent
    to March 31, 1993.

   During the first and third quarters of fiscal 1994, the Company purchased
    $25.2 million of its medium-term notes originally due in fiscal 1995
    through 2000.  The weighted average rate of the notes purchased is 9.34%.
    The purchase resulted in an extraordinary charge of $1,897,000 net of
    $1,021,000 of tax benefit.

   During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company terminated swaps with
    a notional value of $77 million originally due in fiscal 1995.  The
    terminations resulted in an extraordinary charge of $1,473,000 net of
    $793,000 of tax benefit.

   In April 1994, the Company terminated three $10 million floating-rate notes.
    The notes were due to mature in fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997.

   In May 1994, the Company terminated five revolving credit agreements
    providing committed lines of credit totaling $259 million; amounts
    outstanding under these agreements at March 31, total $118 million.  The
    Company subsequently entered into two revolving credit loans.  The
    agreements provide for lines of credit of $185 million and $365 million
    through the maturity dates of May 1995 and June 1997, respectively.  The
    Company may elect to borrow under the credit agreements in the form of
    Eurodollar borrowings or domestic dollar borrowings.  Depending on the form
    of borrowing elected, interest will be based on the prime rate, the
    certificate of deposit rate, the Federal funds effective rate or the
    interbank offering rate.  Under the three-year agreement, loans may also be
    at a fixed rate based upon the discretion of the borrower and lender.

   In June 1994, the Company entered into a $10 million uncommitted revolving
     credit agreement.  Interest on the loans is based upon the discretion of
     the lender.

   The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for the next five years, as

(6)   Stockholders' Equity
   In October 1990, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's
    Articles of Incorporation to reduce the par value of the Common Stock from
    $100.00 per share to $0.25 per share and to effect a 400-for-1 stock split
    whereby each issued share of Common Stock, $100.00 par value, was converted
    into 400 shares of Common Stock, $0.25 par value per share.  The number of
    shares of Common Stock authorized increased from 107,500 to 65,000,000
    shares.  The amendment also changed the par value of the Company's
    Preferred Stock from no par value to $.01 par value per share and increased
    the number of preferred shares authorized from 100,000 to 5,000,000 shares.
    All references in the accompanying financial statements to the number of
    common shares and per-share amounts reflect the above described change in
    outstanding shares.

(6)   Stockholders' Equity, continued

   In October 1992, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's
    Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of the
    Company to a total of 350,000,000 shares from 65,000,000 shares of Common
    Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.  The increased capital stock
    consists of 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock, 150,000,000 shares of
    Serial Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.  The Board of
    Directors (the Board) may authorize the Serial Common Stock to be issued in
    such series and on such terms as the Board shall determine.  The amendment
    also clarifies the voting rights of the Preferred Stock and allows the
    issuance of Preferred Stock with or without par value.

   In October 1993, the Company issued 6,100,000 shares of 8.5% cumulative, no
    par, non-voting preferred stock.  The preferred stock is not convertible
    into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of
    the Company.  Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears and have priority
    as to dividends over the Company's common stock.  The preferred stock is
    not redeemable prior to December 1, 2000.  On or after December 1, 2000,
    the Company, at its option, may redeem all or part of the preferred stock,
    for cash at $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the
    redemption date.

   Under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (the Act), the balance in
    Oxford's account designated "Policyholders' Surplus Account" is frozen at
    its December 31, 1983 balance of $19,251,000.  Federal income taxes (Phase
    III) will be payable thereon at applicable current rates if amounts in this
    account are distributed to the stockholder or to the extent the account
    exceeds a prescribed maximum.  Oxford did not incur a Phase III liability
    for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991.

   The Internal Revenue Service has examined AMERCO's income tax returns for
    the years ended 1987 through 1989.  All issues have been agreed to and
    provisions have been made in the financial statements.  An examination of
    years ended 1990 and 1991 is currently underway.  The tax effect of the
    adjustments which have been proposed have been reflected in the current
    year's tax provision.

   At year-end 1994 AMERCO and RWIC have non-life net operating loss
    carryforwards available to offset taxable income in future years of
    $166,955,000 for tax purposes.  These carryforwards expire in 2000 through
    2007.  AMERCO also has investment tax credit and other credit carryforwards
    of $7,319,000 for tax purposes which expire in 1999 through 2004.  The use
    of certain carryforwards may be limited or prohibited if a reorganization
    or other change in corporate ownership were to occur.

(8)   Transactions With Fleet Owners and Other Rental Equipment Owners
   Fleet Owners (independent rental equipment owners) own approximately 25% of
    all U-Haul rental trailers, .07% of all U-Haul rental trucks and certain
    other rental equipment.  There are over 5,600 fleet owners, including
    certain officers, directors, employees and stockholders of the Company.
    All rental equipment is operated under contract with U-Haul, a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of AMERCO, whereby U-Haul administers the operations and
    marketing of such equipment and in return receives a percentage of rental
    fees paid by customers.  AMERCO guarantees performance of these contracts.
    Based on the terms of various contracts, rental fees are distributed to the
    subsidiaries of AMERCO (for services as operators), to the fleet owners
    (including certain subsidiaries and related parties of AMERCO) and to
    Rental Dealers (including Company-operated U-Haul Centers).

   The Company owns over 99% of all general rental items and the remainder of
    the rental equipment is consigned to AMERCO and its consolidated
    subsidiaries.  The equipment is operated under various  contracts with
    subsidiaries of AMERCO, whereby the consolidated group administers the
    operations and marketing of the equipment.  In return the investors receive
    a percentage of the rental fees paid by customers.

   Oxford reinsures short-term accidental death and medical insurance risks for
    customers who rent vehicles owned by the Company and fleet owners.
    Premiums earned were $1,428,000, $1,399,000 and $1,917,000 in 1994, 1993
    and 1992, respectively.

   RWIC insures and reinsures general liability, auto liability, commercial
    multiple peril and worker's compensation coverage for member companies of
    the consolidated group.  Premiums earned by RWIC on these policies amounted
    to $18,800,000, $18,300,000 and $21,900,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
    respectively and were eliminated in consolidation.

   RWIC insures and reinsures certain risks of U-Haul customers and independent
     fleet owners.  Premiums earned on these policies amounted to $32,800,000,
     $31,700,000 and $33,800,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

(9)   Dealer Financial Security Plan
   In September 1984, the Company adopted an unfunded dealer financial security
    plan (the Security Plan) for its independent dealers and their key
    employees who elected to enroll in the plan.  Subsequent to the initial
    enrollment in the Security Plan, the Company suspended the plan to
    additional enrollees.  Under the Security Plan, deductions are made from
    dealer commissions in return for future benefits including death,
    disability and retirement benefits.  These benefits are paid directly from
    the general assets of the Company.  Life insurance is carried on each
    Security Plan participant in favor of the Company to indirectly fund future
    benefit payments.  Total deductions withheld from commissions for 1994,
    1993, and 1992 were $613,000, $714,000 and $729,000, respectively.  Total
    insurance premium expense for the years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted
    to $1,304,000, $1,300,000 and $1,391,000, respectively.  Benefits paid
    under the Security Plan for the years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992 were
    insignificant.


(10)  Employee Benefit Plans
   AMERCO and its subsidiaries participate in the AMERCO Employee Savings,
    Profit Sharing and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan) which is
    designed to provide all eligible employees with savings for their
    retirement and to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company.

   The Plan has three separate features: a profit sharing feature (the Profit
    Sharing Plan) under which the Employer may make contributions on behalf of
    participants; a savings feature (the Savings Plan) which allows
    participants to defer income under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986; and an employee stock ownership feature (the ESOP) under
    which the Company may make contributions of AMERCO common stock or cash to
    acquire such stock on behalf of participants.  Generally, employees of the
    Company are eligible to participate in the Plan upon completion of a one
    year service requirement.

   At its discretion, profits of such amounts as determined by the Board of
    Directors (which shall not exceed the amounts that are deductible under the
    Internal Revenue Code) may be contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan at the
    end of each Plan year to a designated trustee and administered and applied
    in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement.  The Company did not
    contribute to the Profit Sharing Plan during the years ended 1994, 1993 and
    1992.

(10)  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

   Under the Savings Plan, an employee may make pre-tax contributions of up to
    eighteen percent of base salary.  Participants are immediately vested in
    all contributions plus actual earnings thereon.

   The ESOP is designed to enable eligible employees to acquire a proprietary
    interest in the Company.  The Company may, in its sole and absolute
    discretion, elect to contribute to the trust fund amounts to be used by the
    ESOP trustee to purchase shares of the $.25 par value common stock of the
    Company and/or the Company may contribute stock directly to the trust fund.

   To fund the ESOP trust (ESOT), the Company borrowed $16,000,000 repayable
    over ten years in annual installments of $1,600,000 beginning December
    1989.  Proceeds of this borrowing were loaned to the ESOT on the same terms
    and are used by the ESOT to purchase shares of AMERCO common stock.
    Interest payments under this agreement were $253,000 in 1994, $402,000 in
    1993 and $566,000 in 1992.  With each loan payment, a portion of the stock
    is allocated to the participating employees' accounts.  Contributions to
    the ESOT charged to expense were $2,269,000, $2,255,000 and $1,023,000 for
    the years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

   To fund additional purchases of the Company stock, the ESOT borrowed
    $1,172,000 from the Company repayable over ten years under a stock pledge
    agreement. The interest rate is based upon the average interest rate paid
    by the Company.  Interest payments amounted to $90,000, $105,000 and
    $101,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  As of March 31, 1994,
    $820,000 is outstanding under this agreement.

   During fiscal year 1991, the Company executed an additional stock pledge
    agreement with the ESOT to make loans available in an aggregate principal
    amount equal to $10,000,000 over a five year commitment period.  Borrowings
    under the agreement are repaid based upon a twenty year amortization
    period. Interest is based upon the average rate paid by AMERCO under all
    promissory notes, commercial paper and other evidences of indebtedness
    issued by AMERCO and outstanding as of the date the rate is to be
    calculated.  Under this agreement, $9,331,000 is outstanding at March 31,
    1994.  Interest payments under this agreement were $474,000 and $366,000
    for 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Subsequent to March 31, 1994 borrowings
    total $418,000.

   The Plan held 1,111,557 shares in trust valued at the appraised value of
    $17.00 per share as of March 31, 1994.

(10)  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

   In April, 1994 the ESOT modified the 1991 agreement to increase the
     commitment from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 and extend the commitment
     period an additional five years.

   During fiscal 1989, the Company adopted a Key Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (the KESPP) authorizing it to sell to employees and non-employee directors
    of the Company up to 3,240,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a
    per share price of $6.79, the fair market value of such shares on the date
    such plan was adopted.  Pursuant to authorization by the Board of
    Directors, five key employees purchased 3,239,600 shares under the KESPP
    for cash and promissory notes at the rate of nine percent per annum.  In
    July 1989, the Plan purchased 1,904,000 shares of the Company's $.25 par
    value common stock from four key employees at a per share price of $8.63,
    the fair market value of such shares on the date of sale.  Principal and
    interest payments on the promissory notes were received by the Company from
    the key employees.

   Oxford insures various group life and group disability insurance plans
    covering employees of the consolidated group.  As of January 1, 1991, the
    Company elected to self-fund its group-health and dental plans. Premiums
    earned were $1,325,000, $1,037,000 and $308,000 for the years ended 1994,
    1993 and 1992, respectively and were eliminated in consolidation.


(11)  Postretirement Benefits

   The Company provides medical and life insurance benefits to retired
     employees and eligible dependents over age 65 if the employee meets
     specified age and service requirements.

   The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
     Other Than Pensions" effective April 1, 1993.  The standard requires that
     employers use the accrual method of accounting for postretirement
     benefits.  Prior to 1994, the Company recognized these costs, which were
     not material, as claims were incurred.  The Company elected to immediately
     recognize the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for
     postretirement benefits of $5.0 million ($3.1 million net of income tax
     benefit) which represents the accumulated postretirement benefit
     obligation (APBO) existing at April 1, 1993.  In addition, the impact of
     the change in 1994 ongoing operations is an increase in expense of about
     $1.1 million ($672 thousand after income taxes).  The Company continues to
     fund medical and life insurance benefit costs as claims are incurred.

</TABLE>
   The discount rate used in determining the APBO was 7.75%.  The assumed
     health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
     postretirement benefit obligation was 9.3% in 1994, declining annually to
     an ultimate rate of 3.5% in 2010.  The assumed health care cost trend rate
     reflects a $20,000 maximum lifetime benefit included in the Company's
     plan.

   If the health care cost trend rate assumptions were increased by 1.0%, the
     APBO, as of March 31, 1994, would be increased by approximately $950
     thousand.  The effect of this change on the sum of the service cost and
     interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for
     1994 would be an increase of approximately $148 thousand.

(13)  Reinsurance
   The Company assumes and cedes reinsurance on both a coinsurance and risk
    premium basis.  The Company obtains reinsurance for that portion of risks
    exceeding retention limits.

   The Company also reinsures a wide range of property-casualty risks with
    third parties and insures general and auto liability, multiple peril and
    worker's compensation coverage for the consolidated group, independent
    fleet owners and customers as a direct writer and as a reinsurer through
    third party companies.

   To the extent that a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligation under the
    related reinsurance agreements, the Company would remain liable for the
    unpaid losses and loss expenses.  Pursuant to certain of these agreements,
    the Company holds letters of credit in the amount of $17,000,000 from
    reinsurers.  The Company has issued letters of credit totaling
    approximately $2,200,000 in favor of certain ceding companies.

   Losses and loss expense recoveries from reinsurers of $24,300,000 and
    $25,400,000 were recognized in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(14)  Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
   The Company and certain members of the Company's Board of Directors are
    defendants in an action where the plaintiffs, certain stockholders of the
    Company have alleged, among other things, that certain of the individual
    plaintiffs were wrongfully excluded from sitting on the Company's Board of
    Directors in 1988 through the sale of Company common stock to certain key
    employees.  The plaintiffs seek equitable relief, compensatory damages, and
    punitive damages.  All claims for equitable relief that would have allowed
    the plaintiffs to sit on the Board of Directors have been dismissed,
    subject only to the right of the plaintiffs to appeal such dismissal.  The
    Company and director-defendants filed a motion for summary judgement that
    would be dispositive of all remaining claims.  A ruling on this motion is
    expected at any time.  If the motion is not granted a trial is scheduled to
    begin on August 17, 1994.  The remaining claims for damages are not
    expected to result in a material loss to the Company.

   The Company is a defendant in a number of suits and claims incident to the
    type of business conducted and several administrative proceedings arising
    from state and local provisions that regulate the removal and/or clean up
    of underground fuel storage tanks.  Management's opinion is that none of
    the suits or claims involving AMERCO and/or its subsidiaries is expected to
    result in any material loss.

   The Company occupies certain facilities and uses certain equipment under
    operating lease commitments with terms expiring through 2079. Lease expense
    was $84,359,000, $119,106,000 and $123,368,000 for the years ended 1994,
    1993 and 1992, respectively.  During the year ended March 31, 1994, U-Haul
    Leasing & Sales Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of U-Haul, entered into
    twenty-seven transactions, and entered into four additional subsequent
    transactions whereby the Company sold rental trucks and subsequently leased
    them back.  AMERCO has guaranteed $39,205,000 of residual values at March
    31, 1994 and $3,109,000 of residual values subsequent to March 31, 1994 on
    these assets at the end of lease term.  Certain leases contain renewal and
    fair market value purchase options and mileage and other restrictions
    similar to those disclosed in Note 5 for notes payable and loan agreements.

(15)  Preferred Stock Purchase Rights
   In July 1988, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a stockholder-rights
    plan, and such rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one
    right for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock to the
    holders of record of common shares on July 29, 1988.  As a result of the
    400-for-1 common stock split that occurred on October 1, 1990, each
    outstanding share of common stock currently has one four-hundredth of a
    right associated with it.  When exercisable, each right will entitle its
    holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of the new
    Series C Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $15,000.  AMERCO has
    reserved 5,000 shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock for the
    Series C Preferred Stock authorized in this stockholder-rights plan.  The
    rights will become exercisable if a person or group of affiliated or
    associated persons acquire or obtain the right to acquire beneficial
    ownership of 50% or more of the common stock without approval of a majority
    of the Board of Directors of the Company.  The majority approval must be
    made by members of the Board who were members as of July 25, 1988
    (Disinterested Directors) or subsequent members elected to the Board if
    such persons are recommended or approved by a majority of the Disinterested
    Directors.  The rights will expire on July 29, 1998 unless earlier redeemed
    by the Company pursuant to authorization by a majority of the Disinterested
    Directors.

   In the event the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
    combination transaction after the rights become exercisable, provision
    shall be made so that each holder of a right shall have the right to
    receive, upon exercise thereof and payment of the exercise price, that
    number of common shares of such corporation which at the time of such
    transaction would have a market or book value of two times the exercise
    price of the right.  If the Company is the surviving company, each holder
    would have the right to receive, upon payment of the exercise price, common
    shares with a market or book value of two times the exercise price.


(16) Stock Option Plan
   In October 1992, the stockholders approved a ten year incentive plan
    entitled the AMERCO Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the Plan) for officers
    and key employees of the Company.

   Under the Plan, Incentive Stock Options (ISOs), Non-qualified Stock Options,
    Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR), Restricted Stock Dividend Equivalents and
    Performance Shares may be awarded.  The aggregate numbers of shares of
    stock subject to award under the Plan may not exceed 3,000,000.  The stock
    subject to the Plan is AMERCO Common Stock unless prior to the date the
    first award is made under the Plan, a Committee of at least two Board
    members determines, in its discretion, to utilize another class of the
    Company's stock.  No options or awards have been granted under the Plan.

(16) Stock Option Plan, continued

   The Plan provides for the granting of ISOs as defined under the Internal
    Revenue Code and Non-qualified Stock Options under such terms and
    conditions as the Committee determines in its discretion.  The ISOs may be
    granted at prices not less than one-hundred percent of the fair market
    value at the date of grant with a term not exceeding ten years.

   The Plan provides for the granting of SARs subject to certain conditions and
    limitations to holders of options under the Plan.  SARs permit the optionee
    to surrender an exercisable option for an amount equal to the excess of the
    market price of the common stock over the option price when the right is
    exercised.

   Under the Restricted Stock feature of the Plan, a specified number of common
    shares may be granted subject to certain restrictions.  Restriction
    violations during a specified period result in forfeiture of the stock.
    The Committee may, in its discretion, impose any restrictions on a
    Restricted Stock award.

   The Plan authorizes the Committee to grant Dividend Equivalents in
    connection with options.  Dividend Equivalents are rights to receive
    additional shares of Company stock at the time of exercise of the option to
    which such Dividend Equivalents apply.

   Under the Plan, Performance Share units may be granted.  Each unit is deemed
    to be the equivalent of one share of Company stock and such units are
    credited to a Performance Share account.  The value of the units at the
    time of award or payment is the fair market value of an equivalent number
    of shares of stock.  At the end of the award period, payment may be made
    subject to certain predetermined criteria and restrictions.


(17)  Related Party Transactions
   AMERCO and Consolidated Subsidiaries have related party transactions with
    certain major stockholders, directors and officers of the consolidated
    group as disclosed in Notes 10 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements of AMERCO.

   Additionally, during the years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992, a subsidiary of
    AMERCO purchased $2,607,000, $2,608,000 and $2,681,000, respectively, of
    printing from a company wherein an officer is a major stockholder, director
    and officer of AMERCO.

   Management believes that these transactions were consummated on terms
    equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions.

   Fleet  Owner  income is based on Rental Dealer reports of rentals  
      transacted through the day preceding the last Monday of each month and 
      received by U-Haul  International,  Inc. by the end of the month and  
      affiliated  Rental Company  U-Haul Center reports of rentals transacted 
      through the last day of  each  month.   Payments to Fleet Owners for 
      trailers lost  or  retired from  rental  service  as  a result of damage
      by accident  have  not  been reflected in this summary because such 
      payments do not relate to earnings before   depreciation   and   income 
      taxes  but, rather, investment (depreciation).

   The  investment  data is based upon the cost of trailers to the Fleet Owners
      as reflected by sales records of affiliated manufacturing companies.

(B) The  summary of earnings data stated in terms of amount per $100 of average
      investment represents the aggregate results of operations (earnings data)
      divided  by  the average amount of investment during  the  periods.   The
      average amount of investment is based upon a simple average of the month-
      end   investment  during  each  period.   Average earnings data is  not
      necessarily representative of an individual Fleet Owner's earnings.

                  Notes to Condensed Financial Information

(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   AMERCO, a Nevada corporation, was incorporated in April, 1969, and is the
     holding company of all companies affiliated with the U-Haul Rental
     System.  The financial statements of the Registrant should be read in
     conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto
     included in this Form 10-K.

   The Company is included in a consolidated Federal income tax return with all
     of its U.S. subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the provision for income taxes
     has been calculated for Federal income taxes of the Registrant and
     subsidiaries included in the consolidated return of the Registrant
     excluding Oxford Life Insurance Company (Oxford) and Republic Western
     Insurance Company (RWIC).  State taxes for all subsidiaries and Federal
     taxes for Oxford and RWIC are allocated to the respective subsidiaries.

   The financial statements include only the accounts of the Registrant (a
     Nevada corporation), which include certain of the corporate operations of
     AMERCO.  The debt and related interest expense of the Registrant have
     been allocated to the consolidated subsidiaries.  The intercompany
     interest income and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial
     statements.

(2)   Guarantees
   AMERCO has guaranteed performance of fleet owner contract obligations of U-
     Haul International, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, and residual values
     on certain long-term leases.  See Notes 8 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated
     Financial Statements.

                            RESTATED

                           BY-LAWS OF

                             AMERCO

                      A NEVADA CORPORATION


                                    Date:  As of February 8, 1994




                            ARTICLE I



SECTION 1.  Offices:
            -------   

The principal office and registered office of the corporation shall
be located in the State of Nevada at such locations as the Board of
Directors may from time to time authorize by resolutions.  The
corporation may have such other offices either within or without
the State of Nevada as the Board of Directors may designate or as
the business of the corporation may require from time to time.


SECTION 2.  References:
            ----------   

Any reference herein made to law will be deemed to refer to the law
of the State of Nevada, including any applicable provisions of
Chapter 78 of Title 7, Nevada Revised Statutes (or its successor),
as at any given time in effect.  Any reference herein made to the
Articles will be deemed to refer to the applicable provision or
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation, and
all amendments thereto, as at any given time on file with the
office of the clerk of Washoe County, Nevada.


SECTION 3.  Shareholders of Record:
            ----------------------

The word "shareholder" as used herein shall mean one who is a
holder of record of shares in the corporation.


<PAGE>     



                           ARTICLE II

                          SHAREHOLDERS


SECTION 1.  Annual Meeting:
            --------------  

An annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors
to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such
other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be
held on the last Saturday of September of each year at a time of
day and place as determined by the Board of Directors, or on such
other date as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

SECTION 2.  Special Meetings:
            ----------------

          a.   Special meetings of the shareholders may be held
whenever and wherever called by the Chairman of the Board, a
majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the delivery of proper
written request of the holders of not less than fifty percent (50%)
of all the shares outstanding and entitled to vote at such meeting. 
The business which may be conducted at any such special meeting
will be confined to the purpose stated in the notice thereof, and
to such additional matters as the Chairman of such meeting may rule
to be germane to such purposes.

          b.   For purposes of this Section, proper written request
for the call of a special meeting shall be made by a written
request specifying the purposes for any special meeting requested
and providing the information required by Section 5 hereof.  Such
written request must be delivered either in person or by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Chairman of the
Board, or such other person as may be specifically authorized by
law to receive such request.  Within thirty (30) days after receipt
of proper written request, a special meeting shall be called and
notice given in the manner required by these By-Laws and the
meeting shall be held at a time and place selected by the Board of
Directors, but not later than ninety (90) days after receipt of
such proper written request.  The shareholder(s) who request a
special meeting of shareholders must pay the corporation the
corporation's reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing a
notice of a meeting of shareholders before such notice is prepared
and mailed.

SECTION 3.  Notice:
            ------

Notice of any meeting of the shareholders will be given by the
corporation as provided by law to each shareholder entitled to vote
at such meeting.  Any such notice may be waived as provided by law.

<PAGE>  


SECTION 4.  Right to Vote:
            -------------

For each meeting of the shareholders, the Board of Directors will
fix in advance a record date as contemplated by law, and the shares
of stock and the shareholders "entitled to vote" (as that or any
similar term is herein used) at any meeting of the shareholders
will be determined as of the applicable record date.  The Secretary
(or in his or her absence an Assistant Secretary) will see to the
making and production of any record of shareholders entitled to
vote that is required by law.  Any such entitlement may be
exercised through proxy, or in such other manner as is specifically
provided by law.  No proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months
from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided by the
proxy.  In the event of contest, the burden of proving the validity
of any undated, irrevocable, or otherwise contested proxy will rest
with the person seeking to exercise the same.  A telegram,
cablegram, or facsimile appearing to have been transmitted by a  
shareholder (or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact) may, in
the discretion of the tellers, if any, be accepted as a
sufficiently written and executed proxy.


SECTION 5.  Manner of Bringing Business Before the Meeting:
            ----------------------------------------------

At any annual or special meeting of shareholders only such business
(including nomination as a director) shall be conducted as shall
have been properly brought before the meeting.  In order to be
properly brought before the meeting, such business must be a proper
subject for stockholder action under Nevada law and must have
either been (A) specified in the written notice of the meeting (or
any supplement thereto) given to shareholders on the record date
for such meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors,
(B) brought before the meeting at the direction of the Board of
Directors or the Chairman of the meeting, selected as provided in
Section 9 of this Article II, or (C) specified in a written notice
given by or on behalf of a shareholder on the record date for such
meeting entitled to vote thereat or a duly authorized proxy for
such shareholder, in accordance with the following requirements. 
A notice referred to in clause (C) hereof must be delivered
personally to, or mailed to and received at, the principal
executive office of the corporation, addressed to the attention of
the Secretary, not more than ten (10) days after the date of the
initial notice referred to in clause (A) hereof, in the case of
business to be brought before a special meeting of shareholders,
and not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the
anniversary date of the initial notice referred to in clause (A)
hereof with respect to the previous year's annual meeting, in the
case of business to be brought before an annual meeting of
shareholders.  Such notice referred to in clause (C) hereof shall
set forth (i) a full description of each such item of business
proposed to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for
conducting such business at such meeting, (ii) the name and address
<PAGE> 
of the person proposing to bring such business before the meeting,
(iii) the class and number of shares held of record, held
beneficially, and represented by proxy by such person as of the
record date for the meeting, if such date has been made publicly
available, or as of a date not later than thirty (30) days prior to
the delivery of the initial notice referred to in clause (A)
hereof, if the record date has not been made publicly available,
(iv) if any item of such business involves a nomination for
director, all information regarding each such nominee that would be
required to be set forth in a definitive proxy statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 14 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor
thereto, and the written consent of each such nominee to serve if
elected, (v) any material interest of such shareholder in the
specified business, (vi) whether or not such shareholder is a
member of any partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other
group pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, relationship,      
understanding, or otherwise, whether or not in writing, organized
in whole or in part for the purpose of acquiring, owning, or voting
shares of the corporation, and (vii) all other information that
would be required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission if, with respect to the business proposed to be brought
before the meeting, the person proposing such business was a
participant in a solicitation subject to Section 14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor
thereto.  No business shall be brought before any meeting of the
shareholders of the corporation otherwise than as provided in this
Section.

Notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing provisions, the Board
of Directors shall not be obligated to include information as to
any shareholder nominee for director or any other shareholder
proposal in any proxy statements or other communication sent to
shareholders.

The Chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine
that any proposed item of business or nomination as director was
not brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing
procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to
the meeting and the improper item of business or nomination shall
be disregarded.


SECTION 6.  Right to Attend:
            --------------- 

Except only to the extent of persons designated by the Board of
Directors or the Chairman of the meeting to assist in the conduct
of the meeting, and except as otherwise permitted by the Board or
such Chairman, the persons entitled to attend any meeting of
shareholders may be confined to (i) shareholders entitled to vote
thereat and (ii) the persons upon whom proxies valid for purposes
of the meeting have been conferred or their duly appointed
<PAGE>  
substitutes   (if  the  related   proxies   confer  a   power  of
substitution); provided, however, that the Board of Directors or
the Chairman of the meeting may establish rules limiting the number
of persons referred to in clause (ii) as being entitled to attend
on behalf of any shareholder so as to preclude such an excessively
large representation of such shareholder at the meeting as, in the
judgment of the Board or such Chairman, would be unfair to other
shareholders represented at the meeting or be unduly disruptive to
the orderly conduct of business at such meeting (whether such
representation would result from fragmentation of the aggregate
number of shares held by such shareholder for the purpose of
conferring proxies, from the naming of an excessively large proxy
delegation by such shareholder, or from employment of any other
device).  A person otherwise entitled to attend any such meeting
will cease to be so entitled if, in the judgment of the Chairman of
the meeting, such person engages thereat in disorderly conduct
impeding the proper conduct of the meeting in the interests of all
shareholders as a group.


SECTION 7.  Quorum Requirements:
            -------------------

One-third of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to
vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
at a meeting of the shareholders.  If less than one-third of the
outstanding shares are represented at a meeting, the majority of
the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting without further
notice.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be
present or represented, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the meeting originally called.


SECTION 8.  Tellers:
            ------- 

The Board of Directors, in advance of any shareholders meeting may
appoint one or more tellers to act at such meeting (and any
adjournment thereof), and may appoint one or more alternate tellers
to serve (in the order designated) in the absence of any teller or
tellers so appointed.  If any person appointed as a teller or
alternate teller fails to appear or to act, a substitute may be
appointed by the Chairman of the meeting.  The tellers (acting
through a majority of them on any disputed matter) will determine
the number of shares outstanding, the authenticity, validity and
effect of proxies, the credentials of persons purporting to be
shareholders or persons named or referred to in proxies, and the
number of shares represented at the meeting in person and by proxy;
they will receive and count votes, ballots, and consents and
announce the results thereof; they will hear and determine all
challenges and questions pertaining to proxies and voting; and, in
general, they will perform such acts as may be proper to conduct
elections and voting with complete fairness to all shareholders. 
No such teller need be a shareholder of the corporation.  Unless
<PAGE> 
otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or other
governing instrument, each shareholder shall be entitled to one
vote for each share of stock held by him or her, and, in the event
a shareholder holds a fraction of a share or a full share plus a
fraction, any such fractional share shall be entitled to a
proportionate fraction of one vote or such other votes, if any, as
is provided in the Articles of Incorporation or other governing
instrument.


SECTION 9.  Organization and Conduct of Business:
            ------------------------------------

Each shareholders meeting will be called to order and thereafter
chaired by the Chairman of the Board if there then is one; or, if
not, or if the Chairman of the Board is absent or so requests, then
by the President; or if both the Chairman of the Board and the
President are unavailable, then by such other officer of the
corporation or such shareholder as may be appointed by the Board of
Directors.  The Secretary (or in his or her absence an Assistant
Secretary) of the corporation will act as secretary of each
shareholders meeting; if neither the Secretary nor an Assistant
Secretary is in attendance, the Chairman of the meeting may appoint
any person (whether a shareholder or not) to act as secretary
thereat.  After calling a meeting to order, the 
Chairman thereof may require the registration of all shareholders
intending to vote in person, and the filing of all proxies, with
the teller or tellers, if one or more have been appointed (or, if
not, with the secretary of the meeting).  After the announced time
for such filing of proxies has ended, no further proxies or
changes, substitutions, or revocations of proxies will be accepted. 
The Chairman of a meeting will, among other things, have absolute
authority to determine the order of business to be conducted at
such meeting and to establish rules for, and appoint personnel to
assist in, preserving the orderly conduct of the business of the
meeting (including any informal, or question and answer, portions
thereof).  Any informational or other informal session of
shareholders conducted under the auspices of the corporation after
the conclusion of or otherwise in conjunction with any formal
business meeting of the shareholders will be chaired by the same
person who chairs the formal meeting, and the foregoing authority
on his or her part will extend to the conduct of such informal
session.


SECTION 10.  Voting:
             ------

The number of shares voted on any matter submitted to the
shareholders which is required to constitute their action thereon
or approval thereof will be determined in accordance with
applicable law, the Articles, and these By-Laws, if applicable. 
Voting will be by ballot on any matter as to which a ballot vote is
demanded, prior to the time the voting begins, by any person
<PAGE>   
entitled to vote on such matter; otherwise, a voice vote will
suffice.  No ballot or change of vote will be accepted after the
polls have been declared closed following the ending of the
announced time for voting.


SECTION 11.  Shareholder Approval or Ratification:
             ------------------------------------  

The Board of Directors may submit any contract or act for approval
or ratification at any duly constituted meeting of the
shareholders, the notice of which either includes mention of the
proposed submittal or is waived as provided by law.  If any
contract or act so submitted is approved or ratified by a majority
of the votes cast thereon at such meeting, the same will be valid
and as binding upon the corporation and all of its shareholders as
it would be if approved and ratified by each and every shareholder
of the corporation.


SECTION 12.  Informalities and Irregularities:
             --------------------------------

All informalities or irregularities in any call or notice of a
meeting, or in the areas of credentials, proxies, quorums, voting,
and similar matters, will be deemed waived if no objection is made
at the meeting.


SECTION 13.  Action Without a Meeting:
             ------------------------

Shareholder action by written consent is prohibited.


SECTION 14.  Application of Nevada Revised Statutes Sections 78.378
             ------------------------------------------------------
             to 78.3793, inclusive:
             ---------------------

The provisions of Sections 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, of the
Nevada Revised Statutes shall not apply to the exchange of shares
of the corporation's Series A Common Stock, 0.25 par value, for
shares of the corporation's common stock, $0.25 par value, held by
Mark V. Shoen, James P. Shoen and Edward J. Shoen.

                           ARTICLE III

                       BOARD OF DIRECTORS

SECTION 1.  Number and Term of Directors:
            ----------------------------

The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than 4 nor more
than 8 directors, the exact number of directors to be determined
from time to time solely by a resolution adopted by an affirmative
vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  The directors
shall be divided into four classes, designated Class I, Class II,
<PAGE>   
Class III and Class IV.  Subject to applicable law, each class
shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-fourth of the
total number of directors constituting the entire Board of
Directors.  At the 1990 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Class I
directors shall be elected for a one-year term, Class II directors
for a two-year term, Class III directors for a three-year term, and
Class IV directors for a four-year term.  At each succeeding annual
meeting of shareholders, commencing in 1991, successors to the
class of directors whose term expires at the annual meeting shall
be elected or reelected for a four-year term.

If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease
shall be apportioned among the classes of directors so as to
maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as
possible, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors
shorten the term of any incumbent director.  When the number of
directors is increased by the Board of Directors and any newly
created directorships are filled by the Board, there shall be no
classification of the additional directors until the next annual
meeting of shareholders.

A director shall hold office until the meeting for the year in
which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall
be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.


SECTION 2.  Vacancies:
            ---------

Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
number of the directors and any vacancy on the Board of Directors
shall be filled by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
of Directors then in office.  A director elected by the Board of
Directors to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next
meeting of shareholders called for the election of directors and
until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify;
provided, however, that if a vacancy on the Board of Directors
occurs or is filled after the date by which a shareholder, acting
in accordance with Article II, Section 5(C) of these By-Laws, may
present a director nomination before the next meeting of
shareholders called for the election of directors, the director
elected by the Board of Directors to fill such vacancy shall hold
office until the next meeting of shareholders called for the
election of directors at which a shareholder, acting in accordance
with Article II, Section 5(C) of these By-Laws, may present a
director nomination.  This Section shall not apply to any vacancies
in the office of any "Preferred Stock Director," as defined in
section (e)(ii) of the Certificate of Designation, Preference, and
Rights of Series A Preferred Stock of AMERCO dated October 14,
1993, such vacancies shall be filled pursuant to the terms of said
section (e)(ii).
<PAGE>  


SECTION 3.  Regular Meetings:
            ----------------

After the adjournment of the annual meeting of the shareholders of
the corporation, the newly elected Directors shall meet for the
purpose of organization, the election of officers, and the
transaction of such other business as may come before said meeting. 
No notice shall be required for such meeting.  The meeting may be
held within or without the State of Nevada.  Regular meetings,
other than the annual ones, may be held at regular intervals at
such times and places as the Board of Directors may provide.


SECTION 4.  Special Meetings:
            ----------------

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any
time by the President or by any one member of the Board giving
written notice thereof to the President of said corporation, or
said special meeting may be called without notice by unanimous
consent of all the members by the presence of all the members of
said board at any such meeting.  The special meetings of the Board
of Directors may be held within or without the State of Nevada.


SECTION 5.  Notice:
            ------

No notice need be given of regular meetings of the Board of
Directors.  Notice of the time and place (but not necessarily the
purpose or all of the purposes) of any special meeting will be
given to each director in person or by telephone, or via mail or
telegram addressed in the manner then appearing on the
corporation's records.  Notice to any director of any such special
meeting will be deemed given sufficiently in advance when (i), if
given by mail, the same is deposited in the United States mail at
least four days before the meeting date, with postage thereon
prepaid, (ii) if given by telegram, the same is delivered to the
telegraph office for fast transmittal at least 48 hours prior to
the convening of the meeting, (iii) if given by facsimile
transmission, the same is received by the director or an adult
member of his or her office staff or household, at least 24 hours
prior to the convening of the meeting, or (iv) if personally
delivered or given by telephone, the same is handed, or the
substance thereof is communicated over the telephone, to the
director or to an adult member of his or her office staff or
household, at least 24 hours prior to the convening of the meeting. 
Any such notice may be waived as provided by law.  No call or
notice of a meeting of directors will be necessary if each of them
waives the same in writing or by attendance.  Any meeting, once
properly called and noticed (or as to which call and notice have
been waived as aforesaid) and at which a quorum is formed, may be
adjourned to another time and place by a majority of those in
attendance.
<PAGE>  


SECTION 6.  Quorum:
            ------ 

A majority of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business, except where otherwise provided by law
or by these By-Laws, but if at any meeting of the Board less than
a quorum is present, a majority of those present may adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum is obtained.



SECTION 7.  Action by Telephone or Consent:
            ------------------------------

Any meeting of the Board or any committee thereof may be held by
conference telephone or similar communications equipment as
permitted by law in which case any required notice of such meeting
may generally describe the arrangements (rather than the place) for
the holding thereof, and all other provisions herein contained or
referred to will apply to such meeting as though it were physically
held at a single place.  Action may also be taken by the Board or
any committee thereof without a meeting if the members thereof
consent in writing thereto as contemplated by law.


SECTION 8.  Order of Business:
            ----------------- 

The Board of Directors may, from time to time, determine the order
of business at their meeting.  The usual order of business at such
meetings shall be as follows:


       1st     Roll Call; a quorum being present.

       2nd.    Reading of minutes of the preceding meeting and
               action thereon.

       3rd.    Consideration of communications of the Board of
               Directors.

       4th.    Reports of officials and committees.

       5th.    Unfinished business.

       6th.    Miscellaneous business.

       7th.    New business.

          corporation, any other corporation, partnership, joint
          venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
          enterprise, against any liability or expense incurred by
          him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
          her status as such, whether or not the corporation would
          have the power to indemnify him or her against such
          liability or expense under the provisions of law; and 
          
          2.   The corporation may create a trust fund, grant a
          security interest or lien on any assets of the
          corporation and/or use other means (including, without

          and/or other similar arrangements), and enter into

All certificates for the shares of the capital stock of the
corporation shall be signed by the President or Vice-President, and
Secretary or Assistant Secretary.  All certificates shall be
consecutively numbered in progression beginning with number one. 
Each certificate shall show upon its face that the corporation is
organized under the laws of Nevada, the number and par value, if
any, of each share represented by it, the name of the person owning
the shares represented thereby, with the number of each share and
the date of issue, and that the stock thereby represented is
transferable only upon the books of the corporation.  A stock
transfer book, known as the stock register shall be kept, in which
shall be entered the number of each certificate issued and the name
of the person owning the shares thereby represented, with the
number of such shares and the date of issue.  The transfer of any
share or shares of stock in the corporation may be made by
surrender of the certificate issued therefor, and the written
assignment thereof by the owner or his duly authorized Attorney in
Fact. Upon such surrender and assignment, a new certificate shall
be issued to the Assignee as he may be entitled, but without such
surrender and assignment no transfer of stock shall be recognized
by the corporation.  The Board of Directors shall have the power
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for
agents and registrars of transfer, and may require all stock
certificates to bear signatures of either or both.  The stock
transfer books shall be closed ten days before each meeting of the
shareholders and during such period no stock shall be transferred.


SECTION 2.  Right of First Refusal on Its  Common Stock, $0.25 par
            ------------------------------------------------------
value:
- - -----


          a.   In case any holder of shares of the corporation's
          common stock, $0.25 par value, and Series A Common Stock,
          $0.25 par value (collectively, the "Common Stock") shall
          wish to make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
          all or any part of the Common Stock held by him, he shall
          first notify the Secretary of the corporation in writing
          designating the number of shares of Common Stock which he
          desires to dispose of, the name(s) of the person(s) to
          whom such shares are to be disposed of, and the bona fide
          cash price at which such shares are to be disposed of.


<PAGE> 
          b.   The corporation shall have a period of 30 calendar
          days following the date of its receipt of such notice to
          determine whether it wishes to purchase such shares at
          the price stated therein.  Such determination shall be
          made by the corporation by its delivery to such holder of
          a written acceptance of such offer within such 30-day
          period.  Such written acceptance shall specify the date
          (to be not later than the tenth calendar day following
          the date on which such 30-day period expired), time and
          place at which such holder shall deliver to the
          corporation the certificate(s) for the shares of Common
          Stock to be so sold against the delivery by the
          corporation of a certified or bank cashier's check in the
          amount of the purchase price therefor.


          c.   If the corporation shall not so accept such offer
          within such 30-day period, then such holder shall be
          entitled, for a period of 90 days commencing on the first
          day after the date on which such 30-day period expires,
          to dispose of all or any part of the shares of Common
          Stock designated in such notice to the corporation at the
          price set forth therein to the prospective named
          transferee(s) and such transferee(s) shall be entitled to
          have such shares transferred upon the books of the
          corporation upon its acquisition thereof at such price. 
          If such holder shall not dispose of all or any part of
          such shares within such 90-day period (or, in the event
          of a sale of part thereof, the shares remaining
          untransferred), such shares shall continue to be subject
          in all respects to the provision of this Article VII,
          Sec. 2.

          d.   All certificates for shares of Common Stock shall,
          so long as the provisions of this Article VII, Sec. 2
          shall be in effect, bear the following legend:

               "The transfer of the shares represented by this
               certificate is subject to a right of first refusal
               by the corporation as provided in its By-Laws, and
               no transfer of this certificate or the shares
               represented hereby shall be valid or effective
               unless and until such provision of the By-Laws
               shall have been met.  A copy of the By-Laws of the
               corporation is available for inspection at the
               principal office of the corporation."

          e.   The provisions of this Article VII, Sec. 2 may be
          terminated or modified at any time by the affirmative
          vote of not less than a majority of the then number of
          directors of the corporation.  Each holder of shares of
<PAGE>           
          Common Stock shall be notified of any such termination
          and shall have the right to exchange his outstanding
          certificate for such shares for a certificate without the
          aforesaid legend.

          f.   The provisions of this Article VII, Sec. 2 may be
          extended to other classes or series of the corporation's
          stock prior to the issuance thereof upon the affirmative
          vote of not less than a majority of the then number of
          directors of the corporation.



SECTION 3.  Lost Certificates:
            -----------------

In the event of the loss, theft or destruction of any certificate
representing shares of stock of this corporation, the corporation
may issue (or, in the case of any such stock as to which a transfer
agent and/or registrar have been appointed, may direct such
transfer agent and/or register to countersign, register and issue)
a replacement certificate in lieu of that alleged to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and cause the same to be delivered to the
owner of the stock represented thereby, provided that the owner
shall have submitted such evidence showing the circumstances of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction, and his or her ownership of the
certificate as the corporation considers satisfactory, together
with any other facts which the corporation considers pertinent, and
further provided that an indemnity agreement and/or indemnity bond
shall have been provided in form and amount satisfactory to the
corporation and to its transfer agents and/or registrars, if
applicable.

2. What is the extended loss and expense reserve - direct and assumed-for the following classes? An example of an extended loss 
    and expense reserve is the actuarial reserve for the free-tail coverage arising upon death, disability or retirement in most 
    medical malpractice policies.  Such a liability is to be reported here even if it was not reported elsewhere in Schedule P, 
    but otherwise reported as a liability item on page 3.  Show the full reserve amount, not just the change during the current 
    year.

 3. The term "Loss expense" includes all payments for legal expenses, including
    attorney's and witness fees and court costs, salaries and expenses of 
    investigators, adjustors and field men, rents, stationery, telegraph and 
    telephone charges, postage, salaries and expenses of office employees, home
    office expenses and all other payments under or on account of such 
    injuries, whether the payments are allocated to specific claims or are 
    unallocated.
    Are they so reported in this statement?    Answer:       Yes (X) No ( )

 4. The unallocated loss expense payments paid during the most recent calendar 
    year should be distributed to the various years in which losses were 
    incurred as follows: (1) 45% to the most recent year, (2) 5% to the next 
    most recent year, and (3) the balance to all years, including the most 
    recent, in proportion to the amount of loss payments paid for each year 
    during the most recent calendar year. If the distribution in (1) or (2) 
    produces an accumulated distribution to such year in excess of 10%
    of the premiums earned for such year, disregarding all distributions made 
    under (3), such accumulated distribution should be limited to 10% of 
    premiums earned and the balance distributed in accordance with (3).  
    Are they so reported in this statement ?   Answer:       Yes (X) No ( )

 5. Do any lines in Schedule P include reserves which are reported gross of any
    discount to present value of future payments, but are reported net of such 
    discounts on Page 10?                       Answer:       Yes ( ) No (X)

    If yes, proper reporting must be made in the Notes to Financial Statements,
    as specified in the Instructions. Also, the discounts must be reported in 
    Schedule P - Part 1, Columns 31 and 32.

    Schedule P must be completed gross of non-tabular discounting. Work papers 
    relating to discount calculations must be available for examination upon 
    request.

    Discounting is allowed only if expressly permitted by the state insurance 
    department to which this Annual Statement is being filed.

 6. What were the net premiums in force at the end of the year for: (in 
    thousands of dollars)

          (a) Fidelity                                   $          31
          (b) Surety                                     $       5,228

          (b) per claimant                                        (   )


    If not the same in all years, explain in Question 8.

 8. The information provided in Schedule P will be used by many persons to 
    estimate the adequacy of the current loss and expenses reserves, among 
    other things. Are there any especially significant events, coverage, 
    retention or accounting changes which have occurred which must be 
    considered when making such analyses (An extended statement may be 
    attached)?
