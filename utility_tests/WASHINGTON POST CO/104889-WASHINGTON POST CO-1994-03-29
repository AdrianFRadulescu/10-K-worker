                                     PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

     The principal business activities of The Washington Post Company (the
"Company") consist of newspaper publishing (principally The Washington Post),
television broadcasting (through the ownership and operation of four
network-affiliated stations), the ownership and operation of cable television
systems, and magazine publishing (Newsweek magazine).

     Information concerning the consolidated operating revenues, consolidated
income from operations and identifiable assets attributable to the principal
segments of the Company's business for the last three fiscal years is contained
in Note M to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  (Revenues for each segment are
shown in such Note M net of intersegment sales, which did not exceed .2% of
consolidated operating revenues.)

     During each of the last three years the Company's operations in geographic
areas outside the United States, consisting primarily of the publication of the
international editions of Newsweek and cable television operations in the
United Kingdom, accounted for less than 7% of the Company's consolidated
revenues and less than 1% of its consolidated income from operations, and the
identifiable assets attributable to such operations represented less than 7% of
the Company's consolidated assets.

                              NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING
THE WASHINGTON POST

     The Washington Post is a morning and Sunday newspaper primarily
distributed by home delivery in the Washington, D.C.  metropolitan area,
including large portions of Virginia and Maryland.

     The following table shows the average paid daily (including Saturday) and
Sunday circulation of The Post for the twelve-month periods ended September 30
in each of the last five years, as reported by the Audit Bureau of Circulations
("ABC") for the years 1989-1992 and as estimated by The Post for the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 1993 (for which period ABC had not
completed its audit as of the date of this report) from the semi-annual
publisher's statements submitted to ABC for the six-month periods ended March
31, 1993 and September 30, 1993:

mornings seven days a week and is primarily distributed by home delivery in
Snohomish County.

    The Herald's average paid circulation as reported to ABC for the twelve

                            TELEVISION BROADCASTING

    Through wholly owned subsidiaries the Company owns four VHF television
stations located in Detroit, Michigan; Miami, Florida; Hartford, Connecticut;
and Jacksonville, Florida; which are respectively the 9th, 16th, 25th and 54th
largest broadcasting markets in the United States.  Each of the Company's
stations is affiliated with a national network.  Although network affiliation
agreements generally have limited terms, such agreements typically are renewed
and each of the Company's television stations has maintained its network
affiliation continuously for at least twenty years.

    The Company's 1993 net operating revenues from television advertising, by

      In January 1994 subsidiaries of the Company entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire the assets of television station KPRC-TV, an NBC affiliate
in Houston, Texas, and television station KSAT-TV, an ABC affiliate in San
Antonio, Texas, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $250
million.  Houston and San Antonio are respectively the 10th and 40th largest
broadcasting markets in the United States.

REGULATION OF BROADCASTING AND RELATED MATTERS

      The Company's television broadcasting operations are subject to the
jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
Under authority of such Act the FCC, among other things, assigns frequency
bands for broadcast and other uses; issues, revokes, modifies and renews
broadcasting licenses for particular frequencies; determines the location and
power of stations and establishes areas to be served; regulates equipment used
by stations; and adopts and implements regulations and policies which directly
or indirectly affect the ownership, operations and profitability of
broadcasting stations.

      Each of the Company's television stations holds a license valid for a
period of five years which is renewable upon application for a similar period.

      The FCC is conducting proceedings dealing with such matters as the
standards to be applied to broadcast renewal applications, various broadcast
network regulations, multiple ownership restrictions, regulations pertaining to
cable television operations (discussed below under "Cable Television Division
Regulation of Cable Television and Related Matters"), whether to allocate
additional radio spectrum to existing broadcasting stations to enable them to
implement advanced television ("ATV") technologies, whether to adopt a uniform
ATV broadcast transmission standard for television and impose requirements on
existing television stations to activate ATV channels and ultimately to turn
back to the FCC their existing conventional television channels, and various
proposals to further the development of alternative video delivery systems that
would compete in varying degrees with both cable television and television
broadcasting operations.  The Company cannot predict the resolution of these
and various other matters although, depending upon their outcome, they could
affect the Company's television broadcasting interests either adversely or
favorably.

      Various of the foregoing questions as well as other important substantive
and policy issues (including changes in the law governing what broadcasters may
charge political candidates) will also likely be considered by Congress.

                           CABLE TELEVISION DIVISION

      As of the end of 1993 the Company (through subsidiaries) provided basic
cable service to approximately 482,000 subscribers (representing about 70% of
the 692,000 homes passed by the systems) and had in force more than 301,000
subscriptions to premium program services.  The Company's cable systems are
located in 15 Midwestern, Southern and Western states and typically serve
smaller communities; thus 30 of the Company's systems pass fewer than 10,000
dwelling units, 14 pass 10,000-25,000 dwelling units, and only eight pass more
than 25,000 dwelling units, of which the two largest are in Modesto and Santa
Rosa, California, each serving more than 45,000 basic subscribers.

REGULATION OF CABLE TELEVISION AND RELATED MATTERS

      The Company's cable operations are subject to various requirements
imposed by local, state and federal governmental authorities.  The franchises
granted by local governmental authorities are typically nonexclusive and
limited in time and generally contain various conditions and limitations
relating to payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a
percentage of revenues.  Additionally, franchises often regulate the conditions
of service and technical performance, and contain various types of restrictions
on transferability.  Failure to comply with such conditions and limitations may
give rise to rights of termination by the franchising authority.

      The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the
"1992 Cable Act"), requires or authorizes the imposition of a wide range of
regulations on cable television operations.  The three major areas of
regulation are (i) the rates charged for certain cable television services,
(ii) required carriage ("must carry") of some local broadcast stations, and
(iii) retransmission consent rights for commercial broadcast stations.

      Except in relatively rare instances of "effective competition" (defined
in the 1992 Cable Act as the presence of another cable operator or another
multichannel video service serving specified levels of customers in the same
community), monthly subscription rates for the basic tier of cable service may
be regulated by municipalities, subject to procedures and criteria established
by the FCC, and the FCC may regulate the rates charged for optional tiers of
service.  Rates charged by cable television systems for pay- per-view service,
for per-channel premium program services and for advertising are all exempt
from regulation under the 1992 Cable Act.  In April 1993 the FCC announced a
"freeze" on rate increases for regulated services (i.e. the basic and optional
tiers), which currently is due to expire on May 15, 1994, and promulgated
benchmarks for determining the reasonableness of rates for such services.  The
FCC expected that its benchmarks, which took effect on September 1, 1993, would
produce an overall average reduction of 10% in the rates charged for regulated
services.  The Company estimates that the combined effect of compliance with
the benchmarks and the rate freeze reduced its 1993 revenue from cable
operations by approximately $3 million.  The FCC's benchmarks were widely
criticized by some for being too stringent and by others for being too
permissive.  On February 22, 1994, acting on petitions to reconsider the
original benchmarks, the FCC adopted revisions designed to reduce overall rates
for regulated services by, on average, an additional 7%.  Although the Company
anticipates some further negative impact from these revisions, it is unable to
estimate the amount of that impact since the details of the rules implementing
the latest FCC action are not yet available.  Under the FCC's approach, cable
operators may exceed the benchmarks if they can show in a cost-of-service
proceeding that higher rates are needed to earn a reasonable return on
investment.  Also on February 22, 1994, the FCC announced the adoption of rules
to implement the cost-of-service standard; among other things the new rules
establish an interim industry-wide rate of return of 11.25%.  Various parties
have indicated they will seek judicial review of the FCC's rate regulation
decisions.

      Pursuant to the "must-carry" rules a commercial television broadcast
station may, under certain circumstances, insist on carriage of its signal on
cable systems located within the station's market area, while a noncommercial
public station may insist on carriage of its signal on cable systems located
within either the station's predicted Grade B contour or 50 miles of the
station's transmitter.  As a result of these obligations (the constitutionality
of which is presently under review in the United States Supreme Court) certain
of the Company's cable systems have had to add broadcast stations that they
might not otherwise have elected to carry, and the freedom the Company's
systems would otherwise have to drop signals previously carried has been
reduced.





                                       5
<PAGE>   7
      Beginning in October 1993 and at three-year intervals thereafter
commercial broadcasters may elect to forego must-carry rights and insist
instead that their signals not be carried without the prior consent of the
stations.  Prior to October 1993 some of the broadcast stations carried by the
Company's cable television systems opted for retransmission consent and
initially took the position that they would not grant consent without
commitments by the Company's systems to make cash payments.  As a result of
case- by-case negotiations, the Company's cable systems were able to continue
carrying virtually all of the stations insisting on retransmission consent
without having to agree to pay any stations for the privilege of carrying their
signals.  However some commitments were made to carry other program services
offered by a station or an affiliated company, to provide advertising
availabilities on cable for sale by a station and to distribute promotional
announcements with respect to a station.

      Various other matters addressed in the 1992 Cable Act may significantly
affect the costs or profits of cable television systems.  These matters include
a prohibition on exclusive franchises, restrictions on the ownership of
competing video delivery services, restrictions on transfers of cable
television ownership, new consumer protection measures, new technical and
signal quality standards, and various regulations intended to facilitate the
development of competing video delivery services.

      In contrast to the 1992 Cable Act, the Cable Communications Policy Act of
1984 (the "1984 Cable Act") restricted regulation of cable television in many
important respects.  Important provisions of the 1984 Cable Act that remain in
effect after the 1992 Cable Act include a requirement that franchises be
granted for reasonable periods of time, various remedies and safeguards to
protect cable operators against arbitrary refusals to renew franchises, and a
limitation on franchise fees to 5% of revenues.

      Apart from its new authority under the 1992 Cable Act, the FCC regulates
various other aspects of cable television operations.  Since 1990 cable systems
have been required to black out from the distant broadcast stations they carry
syndicated programs for which local stations have purchased exclusive rights
and request exclusivity.  Other long-standing FCC rules require cable systems
to delete under certain circumstances duplicative network programs broadcast by
distant stations.  The FCC also imposes certain technical standards on cable
television operators, exercises the power to license various microwave and
other radio facilities frequently used in cable television operations,
regulates the assignment and transfer of control of such licenses, and oversees
compliance with certain affirmative action and equal employment opportunity
obligations applicable to cable systems.  In addition, pursuant to the Pole
Attachment Act the FCC exercises authority to disapprove unreasonable rates
charged to cable operators by telephone and power utilities for utilizing space
on utility poles or in underground conduits.

      The Copyright Act of 1976 grants to cable television systems, under
certain terms and conditions, the right to retransmit the signals of television
stations pursuant to a compulsory copyright license.  Those terms and
conditions include the payment of certain license fees set forth in the statute
or established by subsequent administrative regulations.  The compulsory
license fees have been increased on several occasions since this Act went into
effect.  Some pending legislative proposals would modify or eliminate the
compulsory copyright licensing scheme, and the FCC and others have urged that
the compulsory license be phased out for local or distant broadcast signals or
both.  Still other proposals would extend the compulsory license to "wireless
cable," direct- broadcast satellite and other competitive media.

      Currently telephone companies are generally prohibited by the 1984 Cable
Act and certain FCC rules from operating cable systems in areas in which they
provide telephone service.  However Congress, the FCC and the courts are in
varying degrees revisiting this question.  The FCC has recommended changes in
the 1984 Cable Act to permit telephone company ownership of co-located cable
systems, and the agency has authorized, subject to judicial review, a
"video-dial-tone" service in which telephone companies would provide video
programming supplied by others.  A court decree that prohibited the former Bell
regional operating companies from offering certain information services,
including acting as cable television system operators, has been modified to
eliminate those restrictions, although the modification is being appealed.
This decree modification will have the effect of permitting the former Bell
regional operating companies to provide cable television services out of their
home regions, but the 1984 Cable Act continues to prohibit all telephone
companies from providing cable service in their home regions.

      Litigation is pending in various courts in which prohibitions on cable
television operations without a franchise and various franchise requirements
are being challenged as unlawful under the First Amendment, the antitrust laws
and on other grounds.  If successful, such litigation could foster the
development and operation of duplicative cable facilities that would compete
with existing cable systems.

      During the last three years the FCC has adopted several rule changes
intended to facilitate the development of so-called "wireless cable," a video
service capable of distributing as many as 30 television channels in a local
area by over-the-air microwave transmission.

      The regulation of certain cable television rates pursuant to the 1992
Cable Act has negatively impacted the revenues of the Company's cable systems
as discussed above.  The Company cannot predict whether the FCC's rate
regulation decisions will in fact be appealed and, if so, whether those
decisions will ultimately be upheld.  In addition, the Company is unable to
predict the outcome of the various other matters discussed above or what effect
such matters may ultimately have on its cable television business.

U.K. CABLE TELEVISION OPERATIONS

      In September 1993 the Company sold its entire interest in companies
constructing and operating cable television systems in the United Kingdom.

                              MAGAZINE PUBLISHING

      Newsweek is a weekly news magazine published both domestically and
internationally.  In gathering, reporting and writing news and other material
for publication, Newsweek maintains news bureaus in 10 U.S. and 16 foreign
cities.  Worldwide there are approximately 285 full-time editorial staff
members, 216 of whom are in New York.

      The domestic edition of Newsweek is comprised of over 100 different
geographic or demographic editions which carry substantially identical news and
feature material but enable advertisers to direct messages to specific market
areas or demographic groups.  Domestically, Newsweek ranks second in
circulation among the three leading weekly news magazines (Newsweek, Time and
U.S. News & World Report).  Its average weekly domestic circulation rate base

     Newsweek is sold on newsstands and through subscription mail order sales
derived from a number of sources, principally direct mail promotion.  The basic
one-year subscription price is $41.08.  During 1993 most subscriptions were
sold at a discount from the basic price.  Since January 1992 Newsweek's

     Newsweek's advertising rates are based on its average weekly circulation
rate base and are competitive with the other weekly news magazines.  Effective
with the January 4, 1993 issue, national advertising rates were increased by an
average of 5.5%.  Beginning with the issue dated January 3, 1994, national
advertising rates were increased again by an average of 4.9%.

     Newsweek Business, which is published 39 times a year, is a demographic
edition of Newsweek distributed to subscribers qualified by a professional or
managerial job title and a minimum income level.  Advertising rates for this
edition, which has a circulation rate base of 750,000, were last increased in
January 1993 with that increase averaging 5.5%.

     Newsweek's other demographic edition, Newsweek Woman, which was published
ten times during 1993, has a circulation rate base of 700,000 selected female
subscribers.  At the beginning of 1993 advertising rates for this edition were
increased by an average of 15.0%, with an additional average increase of 4.9%
instituted early in 1994.

     Internationally, Newsweek is published in an Atlantic edition covering the
British Isles, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, a Pacific edition covering
Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, and a Latin America edition, all of which are
in the English language.  Editorial copy solely of domestic interest is
eliminated in the international editions and is replaced by other
international, business or national coverage primarily of interest abroad.
Since 1984 a 24-page section of Newsweek has been included in The Bulletin, an
Australian weekly news magazine which also circulates in New Zealand.  In 1986
a Japanese-language edition of Newsweek, Nihon Ban, began publication in Tokyo
pursuant to an arrangement with a Japanese publishing company which translates
editorial copy, sells advertising in Japan and prints and distributes the
edition.  In November 1991 a Korean-language edition of Newsweek, Hankuk Pan,
began publication pursuant to a similar arrangement with a Korean publishing
company.

PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

     In 1994 the FCC is expected to begin awarding licenses to operate systems
using new wireless telephone technologies (generally referred to as personal
communications services or "PCS").  It is contemplated PCS systems will use
transmitters which are smaller and closer together than those of conventional
cellular systems and other techniques to reduce the size and cost of portable
telephones.





                                       10
<PAGE>   12
     In September 1990 the Company formed a limited partnership with American
Personal Communications, Inc. ("APC"), a private company owned by individuals
with substantial prior experience in the cellular telephone industry, to
develop experimental PCS systems in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area.  APC
currently is the sole general partner (although the Company has the right,
subject to prior FCC consent, eventually to convert its interest into that of a
general partner); the Company holds a majority of the partnership interests and
provides most of the partnership's financing.  The partnership was awarded two
FCC experimental licenses (subsequently consolidated into a single license) and
began experimental PCS operations in the fall of 1991.

     On December 23, 1993, the FCC finalized the award of a "pioneer's
preference" to the partnership, in recognition of its efforts to develop PCS.
The preference is for 30 MHz of spectrum in the "Block A" set of frequencies
(as described below) and covers the Washington/Baltimore Major Trading Area,
which consists of the District of Columbia and 65 counties in Maryland,
northern Virginia, West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania with an aggregate
population of nearly 8 million people.  The preference entitles the partnership
to apply for a license subject only to meeting basic licensing qualifications.
Accordingly, the partnership filed its application for a PCS authorization on
January 18, 1994.  Petitions for reconsideration and judicial appeals may be
filed with respect to the partnership's preference grant and its scope, and
petitions to deny may be filed with respect to its application.

     The partners may also bid on PCS licenses outside the Washington/Baltimore
area.  The Company and APC have agreed that if either party wishes to bid for
licenses covering such areas the other party will have a right to participate.

     The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provided that PCS licenses
would be awarded by auctions, subject to the FCC's power to except holders of a
pioneer's preference.  By mid-1994 the FCC is expected to adopt rules for
conducting these auctions.  For the PCS frequencies for which the partnership
might be interested in applying, auctions are likely to begin late in 1994.

     The FCC also has issued rules for the licensing and operation of PCS
services.  Those rules are the subject of petitions for reconsideration on
which the FCC is expected to act by the summer of 1994.  The present rules
allocate seven different frequency blocks for broadband, licensed PCS
(narrowband PCS uses much narrower bandwidths in other frequencies to provide
more specialized services; and unlicensed PCS, to be implemented on still other
frequencies, also would not generally be competitive with broadband PCS):
Block A--1850-1865 and 1930-1945 MHz, Block B--1865-1880 and 1945-1960 MHz,
Block C--1880-1890 and 1960-1970 MHz, Block D--2130-2135 and 2180-2185 MHz,
Block E--2135-2140 and 2185-2190 MHz, Block F--2140-2145 and 2190-2195 MHz,
and Block G--2145-2150 and 2195-2200 MHz.  The first two sets of frequencies
would be licensed for each of 51 Major Trading Areas ("MTA's") as designated by
Rand McNally and adopted by the FCC.  The remaining five frequency blocks would
be licensed for 492 Basic Trading Areas ("BTA's"), also as designated by Rand
McNally and adopted by the FCC.  Companies with substantial cellular holdings
in these areas would be eligible to bid only for Blocks E, F and G, and could
hold only one such license.  Block C and D frequencies would be reserved for
designated entities   women, minorities, small businesses and rural telephone
companies.

     PCS will compete with established cellular providers which generally use
analog technology but which can convert to digital technologies.  Their
eligibility for Block E, F or G spectrum, combined with their current access to
25 MHz of spectrum unencumbered by incumbent microwave users, would potentially
provide them with advantages compared to PCS providers.  Enhanced Specialized
Mobile





                                       11

Radio ("ESMR") is another service already licensed by the FCC that will provide
competition to PCS.  Even more than cellular, ESMR has consolidated
geographically and in many markets ESMR operators are co-owned or affiliated
with other systems which in aggregate will cover geographic areas that are
substantially larger than MTA's.  PCS will also compete with paging,
conventional wireline telephone services and other new services that are in
various stages of development.

     It is expected that PCS will be regulated, like cellular, at both the
state and federal levels (although the FCC has precluded a substantial amount
of state regulation).  PCS operators will have to negotiate interconnection
arrangements with local telephone companies pursuant to general guidelines set
by the FCC.  Roaming arrangements among PCS operators may also be subject to
FCC oversight.  PCS licensees also will be subject to certain build-out
requirements (e.g., they must make service available to one- third of the
population in five years, two-thirds in seven years, and 90% in nine years),
and the term of their licensees will be ten years, subject to renewal.

                          PRODUCTION AND RAW MATERIALS

     The Washington Post is produced at the newspaper's principal place of
business and plant in downtown Washington, D.C., and at its satellite printing
plants in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Southeast Washington, D.C.  All
editions of The Herald are produced at its plant in Everett, Washington.  The
Gazette Newspapers are produced by three independent contract printers.
Newsweek's domestic edition is produced in five independent printing plants;
advertising inserts and photo-offset films for the domestic edition are also
produced by independent contractors.  The international editions of Newsweek
are printed in England, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and Hollywood,
Florida; insertions for The Bulletin are printed in Australia.

     In 1993 The Washington Post consumed about 250,000 tons* of newsprint
purchased from a number of suppliers, including Bowater Incorporated, which
supplied approximately 30% of The Post's 1993 newsprint requirements.  About
half of the newsprint The Post purchases from Bowater Incorporated is provided
by Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited, 49% of the common stock of which is
owned by the Company (the majority interest being held by a subsidiary of
Bowater Incorporated).  Bowater Mersey owns and operates a newsprint mill near
Halifax, Nova Scotia, and owns extensive woodlands that provide much of the
mill's wood requirements.  In 1993 Bowater Mersey produced about 260,000 tons
of newsprint.

     The Company, through a subsidiary, has a 35% limited partnership interest
in Bear Island Paper Company, which owns and operates a newsprint mill in
Doswell, Virginia, about 85 miles south of Washington, D.C.  The general
partner, which has a 30% interest and manages the mill, is Brant-Allen
Industries, Inc., a firm experienced in the construction and operation of
similar mills; the other limited partner, also with a 35% interest, is a
subsidiary of Dow Jones & Company, Inc. The Paper Company and  Bear Island
Timberlands Company, in which a subsidiary of the Company also has a 35%
limited partnership interest, own an aggregate of approximately 150,000 acres
of Virginia woodlands.  These woodlands supply a portion of the wood
requirements of the Paper Company's mill.  That mill produced about 220,000
tons of newsprint in 1993, and during that year The Washington Post purchased
about 20% of its newsprint requirements from Bear Island Paper Company.  In
March 1994 Bear Island

Paper Company expects to complete construction of a recycling plant that is
designed to provide at least 20% of the pulp used by the mill.

     The announced price of newsprint (excluding discounts which decreased
before rising during the second half of the year) was approximately $620 per
ton throughout 1993.  The Post believes it has adequate newsprint available
through contracts with its various suppliers.  About 50% of The Post's current
newsprint consumption consists of newsprint with some recycled content, and the
use of recycled newsprint by The Post is expected to increase in the future.
During 1990 the Company acquired 90% of the stock of Capitol Fiber Inc., which
handles and sells to recycling industries old newspapers and other paper
collected in Washington, D.C, Maryland and northern Virginia.

     In 1993 The Herald consumed approximately 5,900 tons of newsprint supplied
by four different suppliers, the largest of which furnished about 35% of the
newspaper's total requirements.  Approximately 70% of the newsprint used by The
Herald includes some recycled content.

     The domestic edition of Newsweek consumed 31,480 tons of paper in 1993,
the bulk of which was purchased from eight major suppliers under long-term
contracts at prevailing market prices.  The current cost of body paper (the
principal paper component of the magazine) is approximately $870 per ton.

     Over 90% of the aggregate domestic circulation of Newsweek is delivered by
second class mail, and most subscriptions are solicited by either first or
third class mail.  Thus substantial increases in postal rates for these classes
of mail may have a significant negative impact on Newsweek's operating income.
On March 8, 1994, the U.S. Postal Service proposed a rate increase for all
classes of mail averaging 10.3%.  This proposal, which would take effect in
January 1995 at the earliest, is subject to review by the Postal Rate
Commission and then to approval by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal
Service.  If approved, this proposal would increase Newsweek's annual postage
costs by approximately $4 million.  On the other hand, since advertising
distributed by third class mail competes to some degree with newspaper
advertising, the Company believes the increases in third class rates included
in this proposal could have a positive impact on the advertising revenues of
The Washington Post, The Herald and The Gazette Newspapers, although the
Company is unable to quantify the amount of such impact.

                                  COMPETITION

     The Washington Times, a newspaper published since 1982 in Washington,
D.C., began publishing Saturday and Sunday editions in competition with The
Washington Post in September 1991.  The Washington Times previously published
only on weekdays.  The Post also encounters competition in varying degrees from
newspapers published in suburban and outlying areas, other nationally
circulated newspapers and from television, radio, magazines and other
advertising media, including direct mail advertising.

     The Herald circulates principally in Snohomish County, Washington; its
chief competitors are the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
which are daily and Sunday newspapers published in Seattle and whose Snohomish
County circulation is principally in the southwest portion of the county.
Since 1983 the two Seattle newspapers have consolidated their business and
production operations and combined their Sunday editions pursuant to a joint
operating agreement, although they continue to publish separate daily
newspapers.  Although The Herald's principal circulation is in Snohomish
County, it is also distributed in two other nearby counties (including King
County where Seattle is located) in





                                       13
<PAGE>   15
which its circulation is less than that of the Seattle newspapers.  Numerous
weekly and semi-weekly newspapers and shoppers are distributed in The Herald's
principal circulation area.

     The circulation of The Gazette Newspapers is limited to Montgomery County
and parts of Frederick and Carroll Counties, Maryland (areas where The
Washington Post also circulates).  The Gazette Newspapers compete in varying
degrees with many advertising vehicles available in their service areas,
including The Potomac and Bethesda/Chevy Chase Almanacs, The Free Press and The
Western Montgomery Bulletin, weekly controlled-circulation community
newspapers, The Montgomery County Sentinel, a weekly paid-circulation community
newspaper, and The Montgomery County Journal, a daily paid-circulation
community newspaper (which also publishes two controlled- circulation weekly
editions).

     The Company's television stations compete for audiences and advertising
revenues with television and radio stations and cable television systems
serving the same or nearby areas and to a lesser degree with other media such
as newspapers and magazines.  Both independent stations and stations affiliated
with the Fox Broadcasting Network are becoming increasingly competitive, and
cable television systems are expanding their operations in the Company's
broadcast markets where they compete for television viewing in varying degrees
by importing out-of-market television signals and by distributing pay-cable,
advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable
systems.  Some cable television programming services also compete with
television stations for exhibition rights to various syndicated programs and
sports events.  In addition, telephone companies have shown increasing interest
in providing cable television and other video services, such as the
video-dial-tone service recently authorized by the FCC, and Congress is
considering legislation to eliminate or scale back the prohibition on in-region
telephone company provision of cable television services.  With or without this
or other legislative changes, the Company's television stations may also become
subject to increased competition from low power television stations, wireless
cable services, direct home reception of satellite program services, satellite
master antenna systems (which can carry pay-cable and similar program
material), and prerecorded video programming.  Further, high definition and
other improved television technologies are being developed which in the future
may enhance the ability of some of these other video providers to compete for
viewers with the local television broadcasting stations owned by the Company.

     Cable television systems operate in a highly competitive environment.  In
addition to competing with the direct reception of television broadcast signals
by the viewer's own antenna, such systems (like existing television stations)
are subject to competition from other forms of television program delivery such
as low power television stations, direct home reception of satellite program
services, wireless cable services, satellite master antenna systems and
prerecorded video programming.  Various legislative and regulatory proposals
may also increase the competition faced by existing cable television systems
by, among other things, authorizing the provision of competing services by
local telephone companies.

     According to figures compiled by Publishers' Information Bureau, Inc., of
the 181 magazines reported on by the Bureau, Newsweek ranked fifth in total
advertising revenues in 1993, when it received approximately 3.4% of all
advertising revenues of the magazines included in the report.  The magazine
industry is highly competitive both within itself and with other advertising
media which compete for audience and advertising revenue.

     The Company's publications and television broadcasting and cable
operations also compete for readers' and viewers' time with various other
leisure-time activities.

     The future of the Company's various business activities depends on a
number of factors, including the general strength of the economy, population
growth, technological innovations and new entertain-



                                       14
<PAGE>   16

ment, news and information dissemination systems, overall advertising
revenues, the relative efficiency of publishing and broadcasting compared to 
other forms of advertising and, particularly in the case of television
broadcasting and cable operations, the extent and nature of government
regulations.

                                   EMPLOYEES

     The Company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 6,600 persons on a
full-time basis.

     The Washington Post has approximately 2,950 full-time employees.  About
2,050 of The Post's full-time employees and about 450 part-time employees are
represented by one or another of nine unions.  Collective bargaining agreements
are currently in effect with locals of the following unions covering the
full-time and part-time employees and expiring on the dates indicated:  1,332
employees in the editorial, newsroom and commercial departments represented by
the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild (July 9, 1995); 33 electricians
represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (August 14,
1994); 141 paperhandlers and general workers represented by the Printing
Specialty and Paper Products Union (March 31, 1995); 47 machinists represented
by the International Association of Machinists (January 13, 1996); 57
photoengravers-platemakers represented by the Graphic Arts International Union
(February 19, 1996); 153 building service employees represented by the Service
Employees International Union (April 30, 1996); 38 engineers, carpenters and
painters represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers (March
1, 1997); 390 mailers and 195 mailroom helpers represented by the Washington
Mailers' Union (June 15, 1997); and 187 typographers represented by the
Columbia Typographical Union (October 2, 2000).

     Of the approximately 210 full-time and 95 part-time employees at The
Herald, about 57 full-time and 13 part-time employees are represented by one or
another of three unions.  The newspaper's collective bargaining agreement with
the Graphic Communications International Union, which represents press
operators, will expire on January 15, 1995; its agreement with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents part-time bundle
haulers, will expire on May 31, 1998; and its agreement with the Communications
Workers of America, which represents printers and mailers, will expire on
October 31, 1998.

     The Gazette Newspapers have approximately 135 full-time and 55 part-time
employees, none of whom is represented by a union.

     Newsweek has approximately 965 full-time employees (including 216
full-time editorial staff members in New York, most of whom are represented by
the New York Newspaper Guild under a collective bargaining agreement which
expires in December 1995).  Newsweek has never experienced a strike, although
there have been occasional work stoppages by employees of some of its former
independent printers which did not materially interfere with the publication of
Newsweek.

     The Company's broadcasting operations have approximately 635 full-time
employees, of whom about 240 are union-represented.  Of the 11 collective
bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees, four have expired
and are being renegotiated.  Three other collective bargaining agreements will
expire in 1994.

     The Company's Cable Television Division has approximately 800 full-time
employees, none of whom are represented by a union.

     During the first quarter of 1993 Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center Ltd.
implemented a restructuring plan pursuant to which it replaced independent
center administrators and certain of their employees with Kaplan employees.  As
a result of this action the number of full-time employees at Kaplan has
increased from approximately 225 persons to approximately 750 persons (which
number does not include substantial numbers of part-time employees who serve in
instructional and clerical capacities).  Robinson Terminal Warehouse
Corporation (the Company's newsprint warehousing and





                                       16

distribution subsidiary) and Legi-Slate each has fewer than 125 employees.
None of these units' employees is represented by a union.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

     The Company owns the publishing plant and principal offices of The
Washington Post in downtown Washington, D.C., including both a seven-story
building in use since 1950 and a connected nine-story office building on
contiguous property completed in 1972 in which are located the Company's
principal executive offices.  In 1980 the Company completed construction of a
satellite printing plant on 13 acres of land owned by the Company in Fairfax
County, Virginia, and in September 1981 purchased the printing plant of the
defunct Washington Star located in Southeast Washington, D.C.  The Company owns
a 34-acre tract of undeveloped land in Prince George's County, Maryland, and a
39-acre tract of undeveloped land near Dulles Airport in Fairfax County,
Virginia, both of which are suitable for the construction of facilities for the
printing and distribution of copies of The Post to suburban locations.  The
Company also owns 10 acres of undeveloped land in Montgomery County, Maryland.

     Additionally, the Company owns land on the corner of 15th and L Streets,
N.W., in Washington, D.C., adjacent to The Washington Post plant and office
building.  The Company has leased this property under a long-term ground lease
to The Prudential Insurance Company of America, which in 1982 completed
construction of a new multi-story office building on the site.  The Company
rents a number of floors in this building.   The Company also owns and occupies
a small office building on L Street which is next to The Post's downtown plant.

     The Herald owns its plant and office building in Everett, Washington; it
also owns two warehouses adjacent to its plant and a small office building in
Lynnwood, Washington, from which it manages its south Snohomish County
operations.  During 1993 The Herald completed installation of a new offset
press.

     The Gazette Newspapers, Inc. owns the one-story brick building in
Gaithersburg, Maryland, that serves as headquarters for The Gazette Newspapers.
Satellite editorial and sales offices are located in leased premises.

     The principal offices of Newsweek are currently located in the Newsweek
Building at 444 Madison Avenue in New York City, where Newsweek rents space on
18 floors.  Newsweek will relocate its New York City offices to 251 West 57th
Street during the first quarter of 1994.  The lease on the space in the new
location will expire in 2009, but is renewable for a 15-year period at
Newsweek's option at rentals to be negotiated or arbitrated.  Newsweek's
accounting, production and distribution depart- ments, and its subscription
service and computer operations, are located in a facility Newsweek built in
1987 on a 16-acre tract in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey.

     The headquarters offices of the Company's broadcasting operations are
located in the same facilities in downtown Washington that house the Company's
principal executive offices.  Each of the Company's television stations
operates in facilities owned by the Company.

     The headquarters offices of the Cable Television Division are located in
leased premises in Phoenix, Arizona.  The majority of the offices and head-end
facilities of the Division's individual cable systems are located in buildings
owned by the Company.  Substantially all the tower sites used by the Division
are leased.

     Robinson Terminal Warehouse Corporation owns two wharves and several
warehouses in Alexandria, Virginia.  These facilities are adjacent to the
business district and occupy approximately





                                       17
<PAGE>   19
seven acres of land.  Robinson also owns two partially developed tracts of land
in Fairfax County, Virginia, aggregating about 22 acres.  These tracts are near
The Washington Post's satellite printing plant and include several warehouses.
In 1992 Robinson purchased approximately 23 acres of undeveloped land on the
Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland, for the possible construction of
additional warehouse capacity.

     Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center Ltd. owns a six-story building
located at 131 West 56th Street in New York City, which serves as the Manhattan
Educational Center, and a one-story building in Brooklyn, New York, which
houses Kaplan's printing and production facilities.  Kaplan's headquarters
offices are located at 810 Seventh Avenue in New York City, where Kaplan rents
space on two floors under leases which expire between 1994 and 1998.  All
Kaplan educational centers outside of Manhattan occupy leased premises.

     Legi-Slate's offices are located in leased premises in Washington, D.C.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various civil lawsuits
that have arisen in the ordinary course of their businesses, including actions
for libel and invasion of privacy.  Management does not believe that any
litigation pending against the Company will have a material adverse effect on
its business or financial condition.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Washington Post Company

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements, including the financial
statement schedules, referred to under Item 14(a)(i) on page 20 and listed in
the index on page 23 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of The Washington Post Company and its subsidiaries at January 2, 1994
and January 3, 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note E to the financial statements, the Company adopted,
effective at the beginning of 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                             =====================


A.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Washington Post Company ("the company") operates principally in four areas
of the media business: newspaper publishing, television broadcasting, magazine
publishing and cable television. Segment data is set forth in Note M.

FISCAL YEAR. The company reports on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the
Sunday nearest December 31. The fiscal year 1993, which ended on January 2,
1994, included 52 weeks, while 1992 included 53 weeks and 1991 included 52
weeks. With the exception of the newspaper publishing operations, subsidiaries
of the company report on a calendar-year basis.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its subsidiaries; significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.

CASH EQUIVALENTS. Short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less are
considered cash equivalents. The carrying amount approximates fair value.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES. Marketable securities consist of debt instruments that
mature over 90 days from the purchase date and are stated at cost plus accrued
interest, which approximates fair value.

INVENTORIES. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost of
newsprint is determined by the first-in, first-out method, and cost of magazine
paper is determined by the specific-cost method.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES. The company uses the equity method of accounting for
its investments in and earnings and losses of affiliates.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
cost and includes interest capitalized in connection with major long-term
construction projects. Replacements and major improvements are capitalized;
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
    Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment: 3 to 12 years for
machinery and equipment, 20 to 50 years for buildings and 5 to 20 years for
land improvements. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the
lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Goodwill and other intangibles represent the
unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring subsidiary companies over the fair
values of such companies' net tangible assets at the dates of acquisition.
Goodwill and other intangibles acquired prior to October 30, 1970, the
effective date of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, are not being
amortized because in the opinion of the company there has been no diminution of
the value of such assets. Goodwill and other intangibles acquired subsequently
are being amortized by use of the straight-line method over various periods up
to 40 years.

DEFERRED PROGRAM RIGHTS. The broadcast subsidiaries are parties to agreements
that entitle them to show motion pictures and syndicated programs on
television. The unamortized cost of these rights and the liability for future
payments under these agreements are included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The unamortized cost is charged to operations using accelerated
amortization rates for motion pictures and accelerated or straight-line rates
for syndicated programs.

DEFERRED SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE AND MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION PROCUREMENT COSTS.
Deferred subscription revenue, which primarily represents amounts received from
customers in advance of magazine and newspaper deliveries, is included in
revenues over the subscription term.  Deferred subscription revenue to be
earned after one year is included in "Other liabilities" in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  Subscription procurement costs are charged to operations as
incurred.

INCOME TAXES. The 1993 provision for income taxes has been determined under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (SFAS No. 109), which requires the use of the asset and liability
approach. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax basis
of assets and liabilities.
    Prior to 1993, the provision for income taxes was determined under
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 11, which required use of the
deferred method. Under that method, the provision for income taxes was based on
pretax financial income, which differed from taxable income because certain
elements of income and expense were reflected in different periods for

                                       30

                          ---------------------------

financial accounting and tax purposes. Deferred taxes were provided on these
timing differences using the tax rate in effect when the timing differences
originated, and the effects of reversing timing differences were reflected at
those historical tax rates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
and the translation of the accounts of the company's foreign operations where
the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are recognized currently in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains and losses on translation of the
accounts of the company's foreign operations where the local currency is the
functional currency and the company's equity investments in its foreign
affiliates are accumulated and reported separately in the "Cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustment" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS. The company provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The expected
cost of providing these postretirement benefits is accrued over the years that
employees render the necessary service.

B.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES

    At January 2, 1994, the unamortized excess of the company's investments
over its equity in the underlying net assets of its affiliates at the date of
acquisition was approximately $89,700,000. Amortization included in "Equity in
losses of affiliates" was $2,600,000 for the years ended January 2, 1994, and
January 3, 1993, and $2,550,000 for the year ended December 29, 1991.

E.  INCOME TAXES

In 1993 the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which requires the use of the asset and liability method of
accounting for deferred income taxes. The cumulative effect of this adoption
was an increase in 1993 net income of $11,600,000 and is shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Income as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.  Financial statements for years prior to 1993 were not
restated. Information shown below for those prior years was determined under
the provisions of APB Opinion No. 11.
    The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):

    During 1993 the company sold its cable franchises in the United Kingdom.
This transaction increased foreign taxes by approximately $6,800,000.
    In 1992 and 1991 deferred tax benefit resulted principally from the excess
of financial statement depreciation over tax depreciation, the tax effect of
which amounted to $1,783,000 in 1992 and $2,437,000 in 1991, and accrued
postretirement benefit expense, the effect of which amounted to $4,138,000 in
1992 and $3,163,000 in 1991. These amounts were offset by the tax effect of
$7,469,000 in 1992 and $5,335,000 in 1991 of net pension credits in excess of
contributions.
    The provision for income taxes exceeds the amount of income tax determined
by applying the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35 percent in 1993 and 34
percent in 1992 and 1991 to income before taxes as a result of the following

G.  CAPITAL STOCK, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS

CAPITAL STOCK. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock
participates equally in dividends. The Class B stock has limited voting rights
and as a class has the right to elect 30 percent of the Board of Directors; the
Class A stock has unlimited voting rights including the right to elect a
majority of the Board of Directors. In 1991, 9,128 shares of the company's
Class A common stock were converted into an equal number of shares of the
company's Class B common stock.
    During 1993 and 1992 the company purchased a total of 99,800 and 33,949
shares, respectively, of its Class B common stock at a cost of approximately
$23,133,000 and $7,484,000.

STOCK OPTIONS. In May 1993 the Stock Option Plan was amended to increase to
1,900,000 the number of shares of the company's Class B common stock to be
reserved for options to be granted under the Plan. The purchase price of the
shares covered by an option cannot be less than the fair value on the granting
date. At January 2, 1994, there were 662,950 shares reserved for issuance under
the Stock Option Plan, of which 155,000 shares were subject to options
outstanding and 507,950 shares were available for future grants.  Changes in
options outstanding for the years ended January 2, 1994, and January 3, 1993,

STOCK AWARDS. In 1982 the company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Plan that, among other provisions, authorizes the awarding of stock to key
employees. Stock awards made under the Incentive Compensation Plan are subject
to the general restriction that stock awarded to a participant will be
forfeited and revert to company ownership if the participant's employment
terminates before the end of a specified period of service to the company. At
January 2, 1994, there were 140,164 shares reserved for issuance under the
Incentive Compensation Plan. Of this number, 27,955 shares were subject to
awards outstanding, and 112,209 shares were available for future awards.
Activity related to stock awards for the years ended January 2, 1994, and
January 3, 1993, was as follows:

AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. Earnings per share are based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year,
adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares issuable under outstanding stock
options and awards made under the Incentive Compensation Plan. The average
number of shares outstanding was 11,750,000 for 1993, 11,830,000 for 1992 and
11,876,000 for 1991.

H.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The company and its subsidiaries have various funded and unfunded pension and
incentive savings plans and in addition contribute to several multi-employer
plans on behalf of certain union-represented employee groups. Substantially all
of the company's employees, including some located in foreign countries, are
covered by these plans. Pension (benefit) cost for all retirement plans
combined was $(2,300,000) in 1993, $5,200,000 in 1992 and $3,000,000 in 1991.
Included in 1992 are costs of $8,300,000 related to a new deferred compensation
arrangement at The Washington Post newspaper. Included in 1991 are costs of
$4,900,000 associated with the voluntary reduction of staff at The Washington
Post newspaper.
    The costs for the company's defined benefit pension plans are actuarially
determined and include amortization of prior service costs over various
periods, generally not exceeding 20 years. The company's policy is to fund the
costs accrued for its defined benefit plans.
    The following table sets forth the funded status of the defined benefit
plans and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 2,
1994, and January 3, 1993 (in thousands):

    The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future
compensation levels used for 1993, 1992 and 1991 in determining the actuarial
present value of the projected benefit obligation were 7.5 percent and 4
percent, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9
percent in 1993, 1992 and 1991.
    Contributions to multi-employer pension plans, which are generally based on
hours worked, amounted to $1,900,000 in 1993, $1,500,000 in 1992 and $1,300,000
in 1991.
    The costs of unfunded retirement plans are charged to expense when accrued.
The company's liability for such plans, which is included in "Other
Liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $45,000,000 at January 2,
1994, and $41,500,000 at January 3, 1993.

I.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The company and its subsidiaries provide health care and life insurance
benefits to certain retired employees. These employees become eligible for
benefits after meeting minimum age and service requirements.
    In 1991 the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." As permitted by
SFAS No. 106, the company elected to recognize in 1991 the accumulated benefit
obligation related to prior service costs. This obligation of $78,208,000,
after income taxes of $30,311,000, is shown on the Consolidated Statements of
Income as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

    The curtailment gain of $6,000,000 relates to the termination in December
1992 of one of the company's health care plans at The Washington Post
newspaper. The terminated plan has been replaced by a deferred payment
arrangement and a related expense of $8,300,000 was recognized as a result of
this change (see Note H).
    For 1993, 1992 and 1991 the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
was determined using a discount rate of 8 percent and a health care cost trend
rate of approximately 14 percent for pre-age-65 benefits, decreasing to 6.5
percent in the year 2022 and thereafter; and rates of approximately 11 to 14
percent for post-age-65 benefits, decreasing to 6.5 percent in the year 2022
and thereafter.
    The company's policy is to fund the above-mentioned benefits as claims and
premiums are paid.  The effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at January 4, 1993, of a 1 percent increase each year in the
health care cost trend rate used would result in increases of approximately
$16,500,000 in the obligation and $2,000,000 in the aggregate service and
interest components of the 1993 expense.
    The cash expenditures for postretirement benefits were $2,830,000 in 1993,
$2,560,000 in 1992 and $2,222,000 in 1991.

J.  LEASE COMMITMENTS

The company leases primarily real property under operating agreements. Many of
the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses that require payments
of additional rent to the extent of increases in the related operating costs.
At January 2, 1994, future minimum rental payments under noncancelable
operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

    Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of
$3,000,000 due in the future under noncancelable subleases.
    Rent expense under operating leases included in operating costs and
expenses was approximately $22,200,000 in 1993, $21,500,000 in 1992 and
$20,000,000 in 1991. Sublease income was approximately $1,300,000 in 1993, 1992
and 1991.
    In 1993 the company entered into a lease agreement under which certain
costs are paid for through a restricted funding mechanism. At January 2, 1994,
$6,900,000 included in "Cash and cash equivalents" is restricted under the
provisions of this funding arrangement.

K.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

In September 1993 the company sold its cable franchises in the United Kingdom.
The related gain of $20,175,000 before giving effect to taxes of $6,804,000 is
included in "Other income (expense), net" in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. This transaction increased earnings by $1.14 per share in 1993.
    During 1992 the company expended approximately $32,000,000, including
related expenses, for investments in new businesses. These included a cable
system in Mississippi; Pro Am Sports System, a company that provides sports
programming in the Detroit area; and continued investment in personal
communications services (PCS) technology development. The company also
purchased shares in ACTV, Inc., a company that is involved in interactive
television, and made additional investments in The Gazette Newspapers, Inc.,
which increased the company's ownership to 84 percent in 1992 and 100 percent
in 1993.
    The acquisitions, except for the investment in ACTV, Inc., were accounted
for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
the companies acquired have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition. The excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired is being amortized over periods up to 40 years. The investment in
ACTV, Inc., is accounted for under the cost method of accounting.
    In 1994 the company entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of two
television stations from H & C Communications, Inc., for approximately
$250,000,000. The completion of the transaction is contingent upon approval by
the Federal Communications Commission.

L.  CONTINGENCIES

The company and its subsidiaries are parties to various civil lawsuits that
have arisen in the ordinary course of their businesses, including actions for
libel and invasion of privacy. Management does not believe that any litigation
pending against the company will have a material adverse effect on its business
or financial condition.

M.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The company operates principally in four areas of the communications industry:
newspaper publishing, television broadcasting, magazine publishing and cable
television.
    Newspaper operations involve the publication of newspapers in the
Washington, D.C., area and Everett, Washington, and newsprint warehousing and
recycling facilities.
    Broadcast operations are conducted primarily through four VHF television
stations. All stations are network-affiliated, with revenues derived primarily
from sales of advertising time.
    Magazine operations consist of the publication of a weekly news magazine,
Newsweek, which has one domestic and three international editions. Revenues
from both newspaper and magazine publishing operations are derived from
advertising and, to a lesser extent, from circulation.
    Cable television operations consist of over 50 cable systems offering basic
cable and pay television services to more than 480,000 subscribers in 15
midwestern, western and southern states. Prior to September 1993 cable
television operations also included services provided in the United Kingdom.
The principal source of revenues is monthly subscription fees charged for
services.
    Other businesses include the operations of a database publishing company, a
regional sports cable system, a wireless telephone system and educational
centers engaged in preparing students for admissions tests and licensing
examinations (including the preparation and publishing of training materials).
    Income from operations is the excess of operating revenues over operating
expenses including corporate expenses, which are allocated to operations of the
segments. In computing income from operations by segment, the effects of equity
in earnings of affiliates, interest income, interest expense, other income and
expense items and income taxes are not included.
    Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the company's
operations in each business segment. Investments in affiliates are discussed in
Note D. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities.

                          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
                       ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                            AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                       =================================

This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 1993 COMPARED TO 1992

Net income in 1993 was $165.4 million, an increase of 29 percent over net
income of $127.8 million last year. Earnings per share rose 30 percent to
$14.08, from $10.80 in 1992. Earnings in 1993 included a one-time credit of
$11.6 million ($.98 per share) related to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" and an
after-tax gain of $13.4 million ($1.14 per share) from the sale of the
company's cable franchises in the United Kingdom. Excluding these two items,
1993 net income and earnings per share increased 10 percent and 11 percent,
respectively.
    Revenues for 1993 totaled $1,498 million, an increase of 3 percent from
$1,451 million in 1992. Both advertising revenues and circulation and
subscriber revenues rose 2 percent, while other revenues increased 18 percent.
Full year revenues from businesses acquired at the end of 1992, principally Pro
Am Sports System (PASS), a regional sports cable network, contributed to the
improvement in other revenues in 1993. Results for 1993 included 52 weeks at
The Washington Post and The Herald newspapers; 1992 included 53 weeks.
    Costs and expenses for the year increased 3 percent to $1,259 million, from
$1,219 million in 1992. Approximately 40 percent of the total increase relates
to additional expenses associated with businesses that were acquired at the end
of 1992, while the remainder reflects normal increases in the costs of
operations and the continued investment in personal communications services
(PCS). Nonrecurring charges included in 1992 costs were expenses related to a
restructuring at Kaplan and net costs associated with the termination of one of
the health care plans at The Washington Post newspaper. In 1993 operating
income rose to $239.0 million, a 3 percent increase over $232.1 million in
1992.

NEWSPAPER DIVISION. Results at the newspaper division included 52 weeks in
1993, compared with 53 weeks in 1992 and also included full year results at The
Gazette Newspapers (formerly known as The Gaithersburg Gazette) in 1993,
compared with ten months in 1992.  At the newspaper division revenues increased
2 percent in 1993. Advertising revenue for the division rose 3 percent. At The
Washington Post, advertising revenues increased 2 percent, as rate increases
more than offset a 1 percent decline in advertising linage. Retail linage at
The Post decreased by less than 1 percent, and general volume was down 2
percent. Classified linage was 3 percent below last year, primarily due to the
continued softness in the Washington, D.C., real estate market. Preprint volume
remained strong in 1993. Circulation revenues for the newspaper division
decreased 1 percent, principally due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in 1992.
For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 1993, daily circulation at The
Washington Post rose 1 percent, while Sunday circulation decreased almost 1
percent from 1992 levels, reflecting the introduction of several competing
Sunday newspapers in the Washington, D.C., market. The Post maintained its
share of the market with 51 percent penetration daily, while Sunday penetration
declined to 66 percent.
    Newspaper division operating margin was 18 percent, unchanged from the
prior year. The previously mentioned increases in advertising revenues were
offset by normal increases in payroll and fringe benefit costs. A slight
increase in average newsprint prices accounted for the 3 percent rise in
newsprint expense.

BROADCAST DIVISION. Revenues at the broadcast division increased 9 percent over
last year. National advertising revenues increased 10 percent during the year,
while local advertising revenues rose 8 percent. These increases were primarily
due to a surge in automobile advertising in 1993.
    Viewership remained strong in all four markets in 1993. In the latest
ratings period, all four television stations were ranked number one, sign-on to
sign-off, in their markets.
    Operating margin at the broadcast division increased to 37 percent, from 34
percent in 1992. Results in 1992 included the impact of Hurricane Andrew on
WPLG in Miami and lower revenues from sports programming at WDIV in Detroit,
which were partially offset by higher political advertising revenues.

                          ---------------------------


MAGAZINE DIVISION. Newsweek revenues in 1993 decreased 4 percent, principally
due to an 8 percent decline in advertising revenues at both the domestic and
international editions. Lower rates and fewer pages were responsible for the
decrease. Circulation revenues increased 1 percent at Newsweek, with higher
volume and rates at the international editions being the major contributors to
the increase. In 1993 Newsweek Domestic published the same number of weekly
issues as in 1992 (52), with two special newsstand issues in 1993, compared
with one special issue in 1992. At Newsweek International 51 weekly issues were
published in 1993, the same as in the prior year.
    At Newsweek, the operating margin decreased to  5 percent, from 7 percent
in 1992, principally as a result of the decrease in advertising revenues and
certain costs related to the relocation of the New York City operations
scheduled for 1994.

CABLE DIVISION. Revenues at the cable division in 1993 increased 7 percent over
last year (excluding the operations in the United Kingdom, which were sold in
September 1993, revenues also increased 7 percent). The number of basic
subscribers rose 4 percent, primarily due to the 10,000 subscribers acquired
from Coast TV Cable, Inc., in Long Beach, Mississippi. Also affecting the
change in division revenues were higher advertising revenues at the domestic
systems, an approximately $3 million negative impact of rate reregulation and
the sale of the company's cable operations in the United Kingdom.
    Operating margin in 1993 remained flat at 22 percent, compared to the prior
year. Excluding the operations in the United Kingdom, 1993 operating margin was
25 percent, the same as in 1992. Domestic cable cash flow rose 5 percent to
$85.9 million, from $82.0 million last year. Total costs at the domestic
systems increased 9 percent, reflecting the continued rise in programming costs
and the larger number of subscribers.

OTHER BUSINESSES. In 1993 revenues from other businesses increased 23 percent.
Revenues from PASS, acquired at the end of 1992, were the major contributor to
the increase. Revenues at Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center rose 3 percent
over last year, and enrollments increased 2 percent, principally in the lower
priced courses.
    The company's other businesses recorded an operating loss of $9.1 million
in 1993, compared with an operating loss of $6.1 million in 1992, principally
due to the expansion of established businesses, the continuing investment in
PCS and lower operating results at Kaplan. This decline at Kaplan was a result
of additional costs related to a change in its operating structure, implemented
at the end of 1992.

EQUITY IN EARNINGS AND LOSSES OF AFFILIATES. The company's equity in earnings
of affiliates for 1993 was a loss of $2.0 million, compared with a loss of
$11.7 million in 1992. Better results at the company's newsprint affiliates,
which included gains on the sale of land in 1993, contributed to the
improvement.

NON-OPERATING ITEMS. Interest income, net of interest expense, was $6.1 million
in 1993, compared with $5.5 million in 1992. This increase was a result of
higher invested cash balances, which were partially offset by lower interest
rates.
    Other income in 1993 was $20.4 million, compared with other expense of $1.7
million in 1992. In 1993 other income included a $20.2 million gain on the sale
of the company's cable franchises in the United Kingdom. In 1992 other expense
included the recognition of unrealized losses on the company's forward foreign
currency contracts, in addition to the costs associated with the disposition of
certain plant, property and equipment.

INCOME TAXES. The effective tax rate decreased to 41.6 percent in 1993, from 43
percent in 1992, exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle. During 1993 the company adjusted the provision for income taxes to
reflect the increase in the federal income tax rate, which was retroactive to
the beginning of the year. Offsetting the rate increase was the lower effective
rate for foreign taxes recorded on the sale of the company's cable operations
in the United Kingdom.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 1992 COMPARED TO 1991

In 1992 net income increased 80 percent to $127.8 million, from net income of
$70.8 million in 1991. Earnings per share increased 81 percent to $10.80, from
$5.96 in 1991. The company's 1991 earnings included a one-time, after-tax
charge of $47.9 million ($4.04 per share) related to a change in accounting for
certain employee postretirement benefits. Net income in 1991 also included a
credit of $10.0 million ($.84 per share) resulting from a settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an after-tax charge of $3.5 million ($.30
per share) for severance and related costs resulting from a voluntary reduction
in staff at The Washington Post newspaper. Excluding these nonrecurring charges
and credits from 1991 results, both net income and earnings per share for 1992
increased 14 percent.
    Results for 1992 included 53 weeks at The Washington Post and The Herald
newspapers; 1991 included 52 weeks. Also included in 1992 are the acquisitions
of The Gazette Newspapers and other small businesses.

                          ---------------------------


    Total operating revenues in 1992 were $1,451 million, an increase of 5
percent from $1,380 million in 1991. The improvement was due to a 5 percent
rise in advertising revenues, an increase of 6 percent in circulation and
subscriber revenues and a 4 percent increase in other revenues.
    Total operating costs and expenses were $1,219 million, an increase of 3
percent over $1,187 million in 1991. Included in 1991 operating expenses was a
pretax charge of $6 million for severance and related costs resulting from a
voluntary reduction in staff at The Washington Post newspaper. Also included in
1991 expenses was a write down of the company's programming rights to "The
Cosby Show." Excluding these charges in 1991, total operating costs and
expenses increased approximately 4 percent in 1992. This increase reflects
normal increases in payroll and related fringe benefit costs and other
expenses, partially offset by lower newsprint and magazine paper costs, which
decreased 16 percent. Higher costs related to the expansion of cable operations
in the United Kingdom and continued investment in PCS also contributed to the
increase. Several nonrecurring charges are included in 1992, including charges
related to a restructuring at Kaplan and net expenses related to the
termination of one of the health care plans at The Washington Post newspaper.
Income from operations in 1992 increased 20 percent to $232.1 million, from
$192.9 million in 1991.

NEWSPAPER DIVISION. Revenues at the newspaper division rose 5 percent from 1991
levels, mostly due to a 5 percent increase in advertising revenues. Results at
The Gazette Newspapers also contributed to the increase. Rate increases more
than offset the 4 percent decrease in advertising linage at The Washington
Post, reflecting the slow economic recovery of the Washington, D.C., market.
Retail volume decreased 8 percent, and general volume was down 7 percent, while
classified volume was flat. Preprint volume, on the other hand, rose 14 percent
as a result of increased daily demand for inserts by advertisers, some of which
were formerly users of ROP. Circulation revenues increased 5 percent in 1992,
due to an increase in Sunday rates at The Post, from $1.25 to $1.50.  For the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 1992, daily circulation at The Post was
even with the prior year, while Sunday circulation increased slightly, with
primary market penetration remaining high at 68 percent on Sunday and 51
percent for daily.
    At the newspaper division, operating margin increased to 18 percent, from
14 percent in 1991. Contributing to this increase was the decline in newsprint
prices and effective cost controls; over the past three years The Post has
reduced the number of full-time employees by 7 percent through voluntary
buyouts and early retirement programs.

BROADCAST DIVISION. Broadcast division revenues decreased 1 percent. Local
advertising revenues rebounded from 1991 levels, increasing 6 percent. However,
national and network revenues fell 6 percent and 9 percent, respectively, more
than offsetting the increase in local advertising. Results included the impact
of Hurricane Andrew on WPLG in Miami and lower advertising revenue from sports
programming at WDIV in Detroit. These losses were partially offset by $6.8
million in political advertising.
    Operating margin at the broadcast division increased to 34 percent, from 30
percent in 1991, which included the write down of programming rights to "The
Cosby Show."

MAGAZINE DIVISION. At Newsweek total revenues increased 6 percent in 1992.
Advertising revenues increased 9 percent, bolstered by a combination of volume
and rate increases at both the domestic and international editions. Newsweek
circulation revenues rose 3 percent over 1991 levels. Higher subscription rates
at the domestic edition were principally responsible for the increase. During
the year the domestic edition produced the same number of weekly issues as in
1991 (52); 1992 also included the publication of one special issue, compared to
four in 1991. The international edition published 51 issues in both 1992 and
1991.
    Newsweek's operating margin increased to 7 percent, from 3 percent the
prior year. Contributing to this improvement were lower manufacturing and
distribution costs compared with last year, which included the expenses
associated with the four special issues and the special inserts related to the
Persian Gulf War.

CABLE DIVISION. Cable division revenues in 1992 rose 9 percent over the prior
year (7.5 percent excluding the operations in the United Kingdom). Contributing
to the increase were a 3 percent rise in the number of basic subscribers,
higher rates and increased advertising at the domestic systems. On December 31,
1992, the company acquired the assets of Coast TV Cable, Inc., which have not
been included in the 1992 results.
    Operating margin in 1992 remained flat at 22 percent, unchanged from the
prior year. Excluding the operations in the United Kingdom, 1992 operating
margin would have been 25 percent, compared to 23 percent in 1991. Total
operating costs at the domestic systems rose by 6 percent, due to the larger
number of subscribers and higher programming costs, while cash flow increased 9
percent to $82.0 million, from $75.3 million last year.

OTHER BUSINESSES. In 1992 revenues from other businesses increased 2 percent,
primarily as a result of the newly acquired businesses in 1992. At Stanley H.
Kaplan Educational Center, enrollments increased 2 percent; however, the
improvement resulted from increased registrations for lower priced courses,
while enrollments in higher priced courses decreased.
    Operating income at the company's other businesses decreased from $10.2
million in 1991, to an operating loss of $6.1 million in 1992, due to
continuing investment in PCS and lower operating results at Kaplan. This
decline at Kaplan included a restructuring charge related to the change in its
distribution system to gain more control over its field operations.

EQUITY IN EARNINGS AND LOSSES OF AFFILIATES. The company's equity in earnings
of affiliates for 1992 was a loss of $11.7 million, compared with a loss of
$1.9 million in 1991. Further weaknesses at the company's newsprint
manufacturing affiliates contributed to the loss.

NON-OPERATING ITEMS. Net interest income totaled $5.5 million in 1992, compared
with net interest expense of $.4 million in 1991.  Included in 1991 were a fee
of $2.1 million related to the $50 million prepayment on the company's 10.68
percent promissory notes and interest of $1.6 million related to the tax
settlement with the IRS, mentioned previously.
    Other expense in 1992 and 1991 included the costs related to the
disposition of certain plant, property and equipment. In 1992 other expense
also included the recognition of unrealized losses on the company's forward
foreign currency contracts.

INCOME TAXES. The effective tax rate increased to 43 percent in 1992, from 37.6
percent in 1991, exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
for other postretirement benefits. The favorable settlement with the IRS
significantly lowered the effective rate in 1991.

FINANCIAL CONDITION: CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND LIQUIDITY

During the period 1991 through 1993 the company spent approximately $285
million on purchases of additional plant, property and equipment, investments
in new businesses, various other capital programs, and the repurchase of Class
B common stock. In September 1993 the company sold its cable franchises in the
United Kingdom for approximately $65 million. Including this transaction, since
the end of 1992 working capital has increased by approximately $124 million. At
January 2, 1994, the company had $172 million in cash and cash equivalents,
$258 million in marketable securities and $52 million in debt.
    During 1993 and 1992 the company repurchased 99,800 and 33,949 shares,
respectively, of its Class B common stock at a cost of $23.1 million and $7.5
million, respectively. Sixty-three thousand of these shares were purchased from
The Washington Post Company Profit Sharing Plan. The annual dividend rate in
1994 remains at $4.20 per share.
    In December 1993 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded a
pioneer's preference for personal communications services to American PCS, L.P.
(known as American Personal Communications or APC), a limited partnership in
which The Washington Post Company has a 70 percent interest. In accordance with
that preference, APC has applied at the FCC for a license to operate a PCS
system in most of Maryland, Washington, D.C., northern Virginia and portions of
West Virginia and Pennsylvania. APC has begun to acquire cell sites and specify
PCS equipment, and upon authorization from the FCC, will begin construction of
the system itself. The company estimates that its cost of construction could
approximate $200 million, most of which will be incurred in 1994 and 1995.
    The company has an agreement to purchase the assets of two television
stations in Houston and San Antonio, Texas, for approximately $250 million. The
completion of the transaction is contingent upon approval by the FCC, which the
company received in February 1994.
    Excluding the expansion of PCS and the purchase of the television stations,
the company estimates that in 1994 it will spend approximately $80 million to
$100 million for plant and equipment, principally for the completion of various
projects at the newspaper and magazine divisions and the development of new
media products. It expects to fund all of these expenditures from cash flow
from operations.
    In February 1994 the FCC issued new rules related to pricing and
reregulation of the cable industry. The company is in the process of evaluating
the rules, but does not expect them to have a material effect on consolidated
financial results.
    In management's opinion, the company will have ample liquidity to meet the
various cash needs in 1994 as outlined above.

                          THE WASHINGTON POST COMPANY

                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


                 Section 1.  Purpose.  The Washington Post Company Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") is an unfunded plan established for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or
highly compensated employees, as referred to in Sections 201(a)(2), 301(a)(3)
and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, in order to induce employees of outstanding ability to
join or continue in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company
and to increase their efforts for its welfare by providing them with
supplemental benefits notwithstanding the limitations imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code on retirement and other benefits from tax qualified plans.

                 This Plan is strictly a voluntary undertaking on the part of
the Company and shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment or
part of a contract between the Company and any employee or any employee of an
Affiliate, nor shall it be deemed to give any employee the right to be retained
in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate, as the case be made, or to
interfere with the right of the Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, to
discharge any employee at any time, nor shall this Plan interfere with the
right of the Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, to establish the
terms and conditions of employment of any employee.

                 Benefits under this Plan shall be payable solely from the
general assets of the Company and participants herein shall not be entitled to
look to any source for payment of such benefits other than the general assets
of the Company.

(iii) compensation under the terms of the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
of the Company paid during such Plan Year, (iv) Workers' Compensation, (v)

                 (u)      "Vesting Year" means each calendar year in which a
Participant or a key Employee Participant has at least 1,000 hours of Service

                 Section 3.  Supplemental Retirement Benefits.
                 (a)      Each designated person, who is an Executive
Participant as of December 3, 1993, or becomes an Executive Participant or a
Key Employee Participant after December 3, 1993, for purposes of being eligible
to receive benefits under this Section and has ten or more Vesting Years upon
termination of Service and to whom benefits become payable under any of the
Retirement Plans, shall be paid a supplemental annual retirement benefit (the
"Supplemental Retirement Benefits") under this Plan equal in amount to the
difference between (i) the aggregate annual benefits paid to such person under
the Retirement Plans and (ii) the aggregate annual benefits that would be
payable to such person under the Retirement Plans if the 415 and 401(a)(17)
Limitations were not contained therein.  If such a Participant's Surviving
Spouse is entitled to and is receiving a spouse's benefit under any Retirement
plan, the Surviving Spouse shall be paid a benefit hereunder equal to the
difference between (i) the aggregate spouse's benefits payable to such
Surviving Spouse under the Retirement Plans and (ii) the aggregate spouse's
benefit that would be payable to such Surviving Spouse under the Retirement
Plans if the 415 and 401(a)(17) Limitations were not contained therein.   For
purposes of calculating the Supplemental Retirement Benefit or the Surviving
Spouse's benefit hereunder for an Executive Participant or the Surviving Spouse
of an Executive Participant, as the case may be, Compensation rather than
Actual Salary will be used.
                 (b)      The Supplemental Retirement Benefits provided by this
Plan shall be paid to the Participant (or to any beneficiary designated by him
in accordance with the Retirement Plan, or to his Surviving Spouse if eligible
for and receiving a spouse's benefit





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   8



under the Retirement Plan) concurrently with the payment of the benefits
payable under the Retirement Plan in which he was participating at the date of
termination and shall be payable in the same form as such benefits are being
paid thereunder.  In the event the Supplemental Retirement Benefit commences
prior to Normal Retirement Date or is payable in a form other than an annuity
for the life of the former employee only, the Supplemental Retirement Benefit
shall be actuarially adjusted in the same manner as are benefits payable under
the Retirement Plan in which he was participating at the time of termination.
The Committee may, however, in its sole discretion direct that the Supplemental
Retirement Benefit payable with respect to a former employee be paid as an
actuarially equivalent single sum payment; provided, that (except for a
distribution to pay taxes as provided in Section 5) no such payment may be made
prior to termination of Service or prior to the date that benefits may become
payable under any of the Retirement Plans, and provided, further, that in
determining actuarial equivalency of a single sum payment in cash, there shall
be used the interest rate which would be used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation for the purpose of determining the present value of a single sum
distribution on plan termination and the 1974 George B. Buck Mortality Table,
set forward one year.

                 Section 4.  Supplemental Savings Plan Benefits.
                 (a)      In the event that the Actual Salary of an Executive
Participant designated as eligible to receive benefits under this Section 4 for
1989 or any subsequent Plan Year exceeds the 401(a)(17) Limitations for such
Plan Year, such Executive Participant shall be eligible to make additional
salary reduction contributions under this Plan and receive a Supplemental
Savings Award under this Plan for such Plan Year; provided, that such Executive
Participant is then participating in his employer's Savings Plan and making (i)
the maximum allowable basic, matchable tax-deferred contributions to such
Savings Plan and (ii) the maximum allowable after tax contributions which can
result in a matching employer contribution, as permitted under such Savings
Plan, after taking into account the application of





                                      -7-
<PAGE>   9



the non-discrimination rules of Sections 401(k) and (m) of the Internal Revenue
Code for such Plan Year.  In order to compute the amount of such Supplemental
Savings Award, a determination will be made of the dollar amount of
contributions the Executive Participant is able to make to his employer's
Savings Plan which result in matching employer contributions for such Executive
Participant under the terms of such Savings Plan.  This dollar amount will then
be expressed as a percentage (the "Applicable Percentage") of the amount of
compensation which can be recognized for purposes of the Savings Plan under
Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code for the then-current Plan Year.
Prior to the beginning of each Plan Year, the Executive Participant will be
provided with the opportunity to elect to irrevocably defer under this Plan the
Applicable Percentage (or any whole lower percentage) of the Executive
Participant's Actual Salary earned in excess of the 401(a)(17) Limitations for
such Plan Year.  Such a salary reduction is referred to as a "Supplemental
Basic Contribution." In the event that an Executive Participant elects to make
a Supplemental Basic Contribution under this Plan and, to the extent the
Company is not his employer, his employer forwards on a timely basis such
Supplemental Basic Contribution to the Company, such individual will receive a
Supplemental Savings Award under this Plan in the form of (i) a matching
contribution equal to the product of the Executive Participant's Supplemental
Basic Contribution times the matching employer contribution percentage under
the terms of the applicable Savings Plan and (ii) to the extent such
Participant's employer makes an unmatched contribution to the applicable
Savings Plan on behalf of such Participant, a contribution equal to the
difference between the amount of such unmatched contribution actually made
under such Savings Plan on behalf of such Participant and the amount of such
unmatched contribution such Participant would have received under such Savings
Plan if the 401(a)(17) Limitations had not been in effect (the "Supplemental
Savings Award").  The Supplemental Savings Award for any Plan Year shall be
made as of the first day of the following year or on such other basis as may be
approved by the Committee.





                                      -8-
<PAGE>   10



                 (b)      The amount of an Executive Participant's supplemental
savings plan benefits under this Plan shall be the aggregate amount of the
Supplemental Savings Awards and the Supplemental Basic Contributions together
with interest accrued thereon (the "Supplemental Savings Account").  Interest
shall be credited on the amount of an Executive Participant's Supplemental
Savings Account by crediting the closing account balance at the end of such
Plan Year or on such other basis as may be approved by the Committee with
interest at the rate per annum determined pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph (c) and compounded monthly.

                 (c)      The Compensation Committee shall establish the rate
of interest to be credited as provided in paragraph (b) above.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no year shall the rate of interest to be credited be higher
than 10%.  In the event a Supplemental Savings Account becomes payable prior to
the end of a calendar year, interest will be allocated on a pro rata basis
(computed on the basis of a year consisting of twelve (12) 30-day months).

                 (d)      Supplemental Savings Awards and the interest thereon
shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable.

                 (e)      No withdrawal of funds in an Executive Participant's
Supplemental Savings Account for hardship or any other reason may be made while
an Executive Participant remains employed by the Company or an Affiliate.  The
Supplemental Savings Account shall be paid in cash as soon as practicable
following termination of Service.

                 (f)      An Executive Participant shall designate a
beneficiary to receive the unpaid portion of his Supplemental Savings Account
in the event of his death.  The designation shall be made in a writing filed
with the Committee on a form approved by it and signed by the Executive
Participant.  If no effective designation of beneficiary shall be on file with
the

Committee when supplemental savings benefits would otherwise be distributable
to a beneficiary, then such benefits shall be distributed to the Surviving
Spouse of the Executive Participant or, if there is no Surviving Spouse, to the
executor of his will or the administrator of his estate.

                 Section 5.  Funding.  Benefits under this Plan shall not be
funded in order that the Plan may be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3
and 4 of Title I of ERISA.  The Committee shall maintain records of
Supplemental Savings Accounts and records for the calculation of supplemental
retirement benefits.  In the event benefits are hereafter determined to be
taxable for Participants prior to actual receipt thereof, a payment may be made
to such Participants in an amount sufficient to pay such taxes notwithstanding
that the Participant may not then have terminated Service or that the payment
is being made prior to the date that benefits would otherwise be paid under any
of the Retirement Plans.  Amounts so paid (i) with respect to  supplemental
savings benefits shall reduce the Executive Participant's Supplemental Savings
Account and (ii) with respect to Supplemental Retirement Benefits shall be used
as an offset to the Supplemental Retirement Benefits, if any, thereafter
payable.

                 Section 6.  Administration.  This Plan shall be administered
by the Committee.  All decisions and interpretations of the Committee shall be
conclusive and binding on the Company, and the Participants.  The Plan may be
amended or terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company at any time and
any Participant may have his designation as such terminated by the Committee at
any time; provided, however, that no such amendment or termination or change in
designation shall deprive any Participant of supplemental retirement or savings
benefits accrued to the date of such amendment or termination or modify the
last two sentences of Section 5 in a manner adverse to any Participant.

                 Section 7.  Loss of Benefits.  Notwithstanding any other
section of this Plan, if a Participant is discharged by the Company or an
Affiliate because of conduct that the  Participant knew or should have known
was detrimental to legitimate interests of the Company or its Affiliates,
dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation of funds or confidential, secret or
proprietary information belonging to the Company or an Affiliate or commission
of a crime, such Participant's rights to any benefits under this Plan shall be
forfeited; except that such  Participant shall be entitled to receive the
aggregate amount of his Supplemental Basic Contributions, without any interest,
in such event.

                 Section 8.  Nonassignability.  No Participant, or beneficiary
shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of any benefits
payable to him hereunder nor shall any benefit hereunder be subject to
garnishment, attachment, transfer by operation of law, or any legal process.

                 Section 9.  Limitation of Liability.  The Company's sole
obligation under this Plan is to pay the benefits provided for herein and
neither the Participant nor any other person shall have any legal or equitable
right against the Company, an Affiliate, the Boards of Directors thereof, the
Committee or any officer or employee of the Company or an Affiliate other than
the right against the Company to receive such payments from the Company as
provided herein.

                 Section 10.  Use of Masculine and Feminine; Singular and
Plural.  Wherever used in this Plan, the masculine gender will include the
feminine gender and the singular will include the plural, unless the context
indicates otherwise.
