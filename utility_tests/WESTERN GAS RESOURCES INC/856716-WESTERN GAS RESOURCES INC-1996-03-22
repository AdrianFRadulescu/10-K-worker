ITEMS 1 AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

GENERAL

Western Gas Resources, Inc. (the "Company") is an independent gas gatherer,
processor and marketer with operations located in major oil- and gas-producing
basins in the Rocky Mountain, Gulf Coast and Southwestern regions of the United
States. The Company owns and operates natural gas gathering, processing and
storage facilities and markets and transports natural gas and natural gas
liquids ("NGLs"). The Company provides necessary services to the producers of
natural gas and NGLs by connecting producers' wells to the Company's gathering
system for delivery to its processing plants, processing the gas to remove NGLs
and by-products and marketing the gas and NGLs throughout the United States.
Most of the natural gas processed by the Company is associated gas from oil
wells. The Company also owns certain producing properties, primarily in
Louisiana and Texas.

Historically, the Company has derived over 95% of its revenues from the sale of
natural gas and NGLs. Set forth below are the Company's revenues by type of
operation (000s):

The Company has developed a three-part business plan to increase profitability
through expanding its gas marketing activities, acquiring or developing gas
gathering and processing assets that meet the Company's target rates of return
and increasing the efficiency of its existing facilities. As a part of its
initial implementation of the business plan, the Company has (i) restructured
its marketing department along more specialized lines designating separate
managers for national accounts, end-use sales and electric power marketing, (ii)
added business development personnel dedicated to acquiring gas supplies for its
existing facilities, and (iii) reduced its operating expenses. See further
discussion at "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Forward Looking Information."

The Company's principal offices are located at 12200 North Pecos Street, Denver,
Colorado 80234-3439, and its telephone number is (303) 452-5603. The Company was
incorporated in Delaware in 1989.

(1)  The Company's interest in all facilities is 100% except for Midkiff/Benedum
     (74%); Black Lake (69%); Lincoln Road (72%); Williston (50%); Westana (50%)
     and Newcastle (50%).  All facilities are operated by the Company and all
     data include interests of the Company, other joint interest owners and
     producers of gas volumes dedicated to the facility.
(2)  Gas gathering systems miles and gas throughput capacity are as of  December
     31, 1995.
(3)  Aggregate wellhead natural gas volumes collected by a gathering system.
(4)  Volumes of residue gas and NGLs are allocated to a facility when a well is
     dedicated to that facility; volumes exclude NGLs fractionated for third
     parties.
(5)  Sour gas facility (capable of processing gas containing hydrogen sulfide).
(6)  Hub and gas storage facility.
(7)  Straddle plant (a plant located near a transmission pipeline which
     processes gas dedicated to or gathered by the pipeline company or another
     third-party).
(8)  Fractionation facility (capable of fractionating raw NGLs into end-use
     products).
(9)  Gas throughput and gas production in excess of gas throughput capacity is
     unprocessed gas delivered directly to an unaffiliated pipeline.
(10) Commencing in March 1996, the Company and its joint venture partner at the
     Lincoln Road gas plant temporarily suspended processing operations at the
     Lincoln Road plant and began processing the related gas at the Company's
     Granger facility. If volumes increase substantially beyond Granger's
     capacity, the Lincoln Road plant might be re-started. The Company
     anticipates that this consolidation will result in lower overall plant
     operating expenses for the combined systems.
(11) NGL production represents conversion of third-party feedstock to iso-
     butane.
(12) Processing facility has been shut-in since August 1993.  The gas dedicated
     to these facilities is processed by a third-party under a contractual
     arrangement.  In January 1996, Koch Hydorcarbon Company ("Koch"), which
     operates the Teddy Roosevelt and Williston Gas Company's ("Williston")
     assets under a lease agreement, exercised its option to purchase certain
     gas gathering assets located in North Dakota from the Company and
     Williston. The closing of the sale is expected to occur on August 1, 1996.
     See further discussion at "Significant Acquisitions and Projects - Other."
(13) Includes assets purchased in October and December 1995 that were combined
     with these existing facilities.

Capital expenditures related to existing operations are expected to be
approximately $76.1 million during 1996 consisting of the following: capital
expenditures related to gathering, processing and pipeline assets are expected
to be $63.2 million, of which $47.6 million will be used for new well connects,
system expansions and asset consolidations and $15.6 million for maintaining
existing facilities. The Company expects capital expenditures on the Katy Gas
Storage Facility ("Katy Facility"), exploration and production activities and
miscellaneous items to be $4.8 million, $3.8 million and $4.3 million,
respectively.

GAS GATHERING AND PROCESSING

The Company contracts with producers to gather raw natural gas from individual
wells located near its plants.  Once a contract has been executed, the Company
connects wells to gathering lines through which the natural gas is delivered to
a processing plant. At the plant, the natural gas is compressed, unfractionated
NGLs are extracted, and the remaining dry residue gas is treated to meet
pipeline quality specifications.  Eight of the Company's processing plants can
further separate, or fractionate, the mixed NGL stream into ethane, propane,
butane and natural gasoline to obtain higher value for the NGLs, and six of the
Company's plants are able to process and treat natural gas containing hydrogen
sulfide or other impurities which require removal prior to transportation. In
addition, the Company has one facility which converts normal butane into iso-
butane.

The Company continually acquires additional natural gas supplies to maintain or
increase throughput levels to offset natural production declines in dedicated
volumes.  Such natural gas supplies are obtained by purchasing existing systems
from third parties or by connecting additional wells.  The opportunity to
connect new wells to existing facilities is primarily affected by levels of
drilling activity near the Company's gathering systems.  The Company believes it
has expanded into areas which present significant potential for new drilling or
purchases of existing systems.  Historically, the Company has connected
additional reserves which more than offset production from reserves dedicated to
existing facilities.  However, certain individual plants have experienced
declines in dedicated reserves.  In 1995, including the reserves associated with
Westana Gathering Company ("Westana") and 1995 acquisitions, the Company
connected new reserves to its gathering systems to replace approximately 94% of
1995 production. On a Company-wide basis, dedicated reserves, including certain
proved undeveloped properties and revisions to previous estimates, decreased
from 2.3 Tcf as of December 31, 1994 (as revised) to approximately 2.1 Tcf at
December 31, 1995. The decrease is primarily due to decreased drilling in areas
in which the Company operates and declines in reserves at the Company's Black
Lake field.

Substantially all gas flowing through the Company's facilities is supplied under
long-term contracts providing for the purchase or processing of such gas for
periods ranging from five to twenty years, using three basic contract types.
Approximately 57% of the

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
Company's gas throughput (exclusive of the Toca straddle plant) for the year
ended December 31, 1995 was purchased under percentage-of-proceeds agreements in
which the Company is typically responsible for arranging for the transportation
and marketing of the natural gas and NGLs. The price paid to producers is a
specified percentage of the net proceeds received from the sale of the natural
gas and the NGLs. This type of contract permits the Company and the producers to
share proportionally in price changes.

Approximately 24% of the Company's gas throughput for the year ended December
31, 1995 was gathered under contracts which are primarily fee-based whereby the
Company receives a set fee for each Mcf of gas gathered. This type of contract
provides the Company with a steady revenue stream that is not dependent on
commodity prices, except to the extent that low prices may cause a producer to
curtail production.

Approximately 19% of the Company's gas throughput for the year ended December
31, 1995 was processed under contracts which combine gathering and compression
fees with "keep-whole" arrangements or well-head purchases. Typically, producers
are charged a gathering and compression fee based upon volume. In addition, the
Company retains a predetermined percentage of the NGLs recovered by the
processing facility and keeps the producers whole by returning to the producers
at the tailgate of the plant an amount of residue gas equal on a Btu basis to
the raw gas received at the plant inlet. The "keep-whole" component of the
contracts permits the Company to benefit when the value of the NGLs is greater
as a liquid than as a portion of the residue gas stream. However, when the value
of the NGLs is lower as a liquid than as a portion of the residue gas stream,
the Company may be affected unfavorably.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND PROJECTS

The Company's significant acquisitions and projects since January 1, 1993 are:

     Northern Acquisition

In July 1995, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase eight West Texas
gathering systems, consisting of approximately 230 miles of gathering lines in
the Permian Basin, from Transwestern Gathering Company and Enron Permian
Gathering, Inc. In October 1995, the Company acquired and assumed the operations
of the Transwestern Gathering Company assets for an adjusted purchase price of
$4.0 million. Closing on the remaining assets occurred in December 1995 for a
purchase price of $14.7 million. For the month ended January 31, 1996,
throughput on the systems totaled approximately 150 MMcf per day from
approximately 70 wells under fee-based contracts.

     Redman Smackover Joint Venture

Effective January 1, 1995, the Company entered into the Redman Smackover Joint
Venture ("Redman Smackover") agreement with DDD Energy, Inc., a wholly owned
exploration and production subsidiary of Seitel, Inc., Redman Energy
Corporation, and DDD 1995 Oil & Gas Partnership. Redman Smackover acquired
working interests in three producing gas fields in East Texas in the Smackover
formation with an estimated 25 Bcf of proved reserves from Union Oil Company of
California for an adjusted purchase price of $11.0 million. The Company's
contribution to Redman Smackover was approximately $5.4 million through December
31, 1995. The Company is the managing venturer with a 50% ownership interest.

     Oasis

Effective December 1, 1994, the Company acquired the West Texas gathering and
treating assets of Oasis Pipeline Company ("Oasis") for approximately $26.0
million. The Oasis purchase included 14 gathering systems in the Permian Basin
comprising approximately 600 miles of gathering lines and two treating
facilities. In addition, the Company entered into a long-term agreement with
Oasis for 100 MMcf per day of firm transportation service on its intrastate
pipeline. The Company has installed a 200 MMcf per day pipeline interconnection
between this pipeline and the Katy Facility.

     Katy Facility

The Company commenced operations of the Katy Facility in February 1994. The Katy
Facility, which is located approximately 20 miles from Houston, Texas, utilizes
a partially depleted natural gas reservoir with 19 Bcf of working gas capacity
and a pipeline header system, currently connected to eleven pipelines, which has
the capability to deliver up to 400 MMcf per day of natural gas from the
reservoir. Lease acquisition and construction costs incurred through the
commencement of operations, including pad gas, approximated $106.1 million. See
"Marketing - Natural Gas" below.

     Mountain Gas

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the stock of Mountain Gas
Resources, Inc. ("Mountain Gas") from Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II,
L.P. for total consideration of approximately $168.2 million, including the
payment of certain transaction costs and the assumption and repayment of $35
million of long-term debt attributable to Mountain Gas.

Mountain Gas owns the Red Desert and Granger facilities, both located near the
Company's Lincoln Road gas processing plant and gathering system. The 22%
interest in the Granger facility previously not owned by Mountain Gas was
purchased by the Company in two separate transactions in November and December
1993 for an aggregate of $27.7 million. At the date of acquisition, the Red
Desert facility consisted of a cryogenic plant and the Granger plant consisted
of a refrigeration unit and a cryogenic unit. In December 1993, the Company
completed construction of an additional cryogenic processing plant at Granger,
at a total additional cost of approximately $4.8 million.

     Black Lake

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company purchased the Black Lake gas processing
plant and related reserves ("Black Lake") from Nerco Oil & Gas, Inc. for
approximately $136.2 million. The acquisition included a 68.9% working interest
in the Black Lake field in Louisiana and a gas processing plant. To increase
the efficiency of Black Lake's processing capabilities, the Company installed a
cryogenic processing plant at a cost of approximately $4.1 million. The
cryogenic processing plant, which became fully operational in October 1994, has
decreased fuel usage and plant operating expenses, and also provides flexibility
to recover or reject ethane.

     Westana Joint Venture

Effective August 1, 1993, the Company formed Westana, a general partnership,
with PanEnergy. Westana provides gas gathering and processing services in the
Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and markets natural gas and NGLs for producers
connected to its system. The Company is the principal operator, with each
partner holding a 50% ownership interest.

The Company contributed its Chester gas processing plant and gathering system,
with a net book value of $13.8 million, to Westana. The Company also made
additional partnership contributions of $7.2 million through December 31, 1995,
which will be recouped through preferential distributions. In addition to the
assets contributed by the Company, Westana operates PanEnergy's 400 mile
gathering system and six compressor stations, which will be contributed to
Westana by PanEnergy. PanEnergy has received and accepted abandonment approval
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and is now awaiting certain
clarification of the abandonment approval. Upon clarification from the FERC on
the abandonment approval, PanEnergy will contribute its gathering assets to
Westana. The Company expects the contribution of the PanEnergy assets will
occur in 1996.

     Other

The Company continually monitors the economic performance of each of its
operating facilities to ensure that a desired cash flow objective is achieved.
If an operating facility is not generating desired cash flows or does not fit in
with the Company's strategic plans, the Company will explore various options,
such as consolidation with other Company-owned facilities, dismantlement, asset
swap or outright sale. In 1995, the Company sold the Waha Header and certain
non-strategic assets acquired in the Oasis acquisition and completed the
consolidation of its Lamont gathering system with the Chaney Dell system. The
Company anticipates completing the salvage of substantially all of the Lamont
processing plant assets by the end of the first quarter of 1996. In 1994, the
Company sold its Sligo plant, swapped its Pyote treating facilities for
gathering assets in Kansas, which were subsequently disposed of during the
second quarter of 1995, consolidated assets in the Powder River Basin and sold
its Walnut Bend gathering system. The Company anticipates that the salvage of
the Walnut Bend processing plant will be substantially completed by the end of
the third quarter of 1996. Commencing in March 1996, the Company and its joint
venture partner at the Lincoln Road gas plant temporarily suspended processing
operations at that plant and began processing the associated gas at the
Company's Granger facility. If volumes increase substantially beyond Granger's
capacity, the Lincoln Road plant might be re-started. The Company anticipates
that this consolidation will result in lower overall plant operating expenses
for the combined systems. In January 1996, Koch, which operates the Teddy
Roosevelt and Williston assets under a lease agreement, exercised its option to
purchase certain gas gathering assets located in North Dakota from the Company
and Williston. Proceeds from the sale of the gathering assets will be
approximately $2.4 million, of which the Company is entitled to receive $1.5
million. The closing on the sale is expected to occur on August 1, 1996, at
which time the operation of Williston and the Company's Teddy Roosevelt facility
will cease and any remaining assets will be salvaged.

MARKETING

     Natural Gas

The Company markets residue gas produced at its plants and purchased from third
parties to end-users, local distribution companies ("LDCs"), pipelines and other
marketing companies throughout the United States. Historically, the Company's
gas marketing was an outgrowth of the Company's gas processing activities and
was directed towards selling gas processed at its plants to ensure their
efficient operation. As the Company expanded into new basins and the natural
gas industry became deregulated and offered more opportunity, the Company began
to increase its third-party gas marketing. Average gas sales increased to
1,572 MMcf per day for the year ended December 31, 1995 compared to 220 MMcf per
day for the year ended December 31, 1990, primarily as a result of increased
third-party sales and sales attributable to acquisitions and to the Katy
Facility, which began operations in 1994. The Company has continued to increase
sales to end-users and to achieve greater market penetration close to its
facilities while also expanding into new markets throughout the United States.

The Company sells gas under agreements with varying terms and conditions in
order to match seasonal and other changes in demand. Most of the Company's
current sales contracts are short-term, ranging from a few days to one year. At
December 31, 1995, the Company's commitment under long-term contracts, several
of which have an annual redetermination of prices and several of which are rebid
prior to expiration, was approximately 300 MMcf per day.

The Company intends to continue to expand its residue gas marketing and third-
party sales, particularly to industrial and commercial end-users. The Company's
marketing department has recently been restructured along more specialized lines
to include separate managers for national accounts, end-use sales and electric
power marketing. The Company has also expanded its marketing in areas beyond
its traditional gas supply centers (Houston and the Gulf Coast) to demand
centers, such as Chicago, New York and California. Third-party sales and
residue gas storage, combined with the stable supply from Company facilities,
enable the Company to respond quickly to changing market conditions and to take
advantage of seasonal price variations and peak demand periods.

The Company customarily stores residue gas in underground storage facilities to
ensure an adequate supply for long-term sales contracts and for resale during
periods when prices are favorable. In order to meet the peaking demand for
residue gas in certain markets, the Company constructed the Katy Facility. The
ability to withdraw gas from the Katy Facility on short notice positions the
Company to market residue gas to LDCs and other customers that need a reliable
yet variable supply of residue gas. The Katy Facility allows the Company to
bypass certain transportation bottlenecks and enhances flexibility in its
marketing operations. The complex utilizes a partially depleted natural gas
reservoir with 19 Bcf of working gas capacity and a pipeline header system,
currently connected to eleven pipelines, which has the capability to deliver up
to 400 MMcf per day of residue gas from the reservoir.

At December 31, 1995, the Company held approximately 12.8 Bcf of residue gas
inventory in underground storage at an average cost of $1.82 per Mcf ($1.65 per
MMBtu), primarily at the Katy Facility. At December 31, 1995, the Company had
hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales for approximately 12.5 Bcf of
stored gas at a weighted average price of $1.88 per MMBtu for the 1995-1996
winter heating season. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Note
5 - Risk Management" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

In December 1993, the Company entered into a three-year winter-peaking gas
purchase and sales agreement with a major utility in East Texas which designates
the Katy Facility as the primary delivery point. Under the agreement, which was
amended in August 1994 to expire in March 1997, the utility has the right to
purchase, during each year of the contract, up to approximately 50 MMcf of
residue gas per day in November and March and approximately 140 MMcf of residue
gas per day in December, January and February, at the Houston Ship Channel Index
Price, determined daily, plus a demand charge. The agreement calls for a
minimum demand charge to be paid to the Company for each contract term, whether
or not delivery is taken. This minimum demand charge is calculated based upon
five Bcf of available storage during each fiscal year of the contract term.

In February 1995, the Company entered into a long-term firm storage and
transportation agreement with a St. Louis-based LDC. Under the agreement, the
Company has leased approximately three Bcf of storage capacity of the Katy
Facility to the LDC. The gas will principally serve local distribution
requirements of the LDC's customers in central Missouri.

During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company sold residue gas to
approximately 370 end-users, pipelines, LDCs and other customers. No single
customer accounted for more than 3.5% of consolidated revenues for the year
ended December 31, 1995.


     NGL Marketing

The Company markets NGLs (ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, natural
gasoline, and condensate) produced at its plants and purchased from third
parties in the Rocky Mountain, Gulf Coast and Southwestern regions of the United
States. A majority of the Company's production of NGLs moves to the Gulf Coast
area, which is the largest NGL market in the United States. Through the
development of end-use markets and distribution capabilities, the Company seeks
to ensure that production from the plants moves on a reliable basis, avoiding
curtailment of production.

Consumption of NGLs is primarily determined by various end-user markets
including the petrochemical industry, the petroleum refining industry and the
retail and industrial fuel markets. As an example, the petrochemical industry
uses ethane, propane, normal butane and natural gasoline as feedstocks in the
production of ethylene, which is used in the production of various plastics
products. Over the last several years, the petrochemical industry has increased
its use of NGLs as a major feedstock. Further, various NGLs are used for home
heating and cooling, transportation and for certain agricultural applications.
Demand is primarily affected by price, seasonality and the economy.

The volatility of NGL prices in recent years has caused the Company to move to
short-term contracts, with no prices set on a firm basis for more than a 30-day
period. Although some existing contracts do commit the Company for periods as
long as a year, prices are redetermined on a market-related basis. The Company
leases NGL storage space at major trading locations near Houston and in central
Kansas in order to store products so that they can be sold at higher prices on a
seasonal basis. At December 31, 1995, approximately 15,800 MGal of NGLs were in
storage at an average cost of $.31 per gallon. The Company generally intends
that stored NGLs turn over on an annual basis. The Company from time to time
enters into futures contracts to hedge a portion of its share of condensate and
crude oil production. Although no such hedges were outstanding at December 31,
1995, the Company will continue to enter into futures contracts as management
deems appropriate. See also "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Note
5 - Risk Management" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

For the year ended December 31, 1995, NGL sales averaged 2,890 MGal per day, an
increase from 630 MGal per day in 1990, primarily due to acquisitions during the
five-year period. Sales were made to approximately 170 different customers, and
no single customer accounted for more than 3% of the Company's consolidated
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1995. Revenues are also derived from
contractual marketing fees charged to some producers for NGL marketing services.
For the year ended December 31, 1995, such fees were less than 1% of the
Company's consolidated revenues.

PRODUCING PROPERTIES

Revenues derived from the Company's producing properties comprised approximately
2.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1995. The producing properties
are primarily working interests in a unit operated by the Company comprising the
Black Lake field in Louisiana, which provides production to the Black Lake
plant, and 20 gas properties producing from the Smackover formation of the East
Texas Basin, which provide production to the Edgewood plant. The Company also
has working interests in the Powder River Basin in northeastern Wyoming, the
Sandwash Basin in northwestern Colorado, the Austin Chalk formation in southeast
Texas and the San Juan Basin in southwest Colorado. The Company also owns
various working interests in 13 wells in the Smackover formation through Redman
Smackover.

COMPETITION

The Company competes with other companies in the gathering, processing and
marketing business, both for supplies of natural gas and for customers to which
natural gas and NGLs are sold.  Competition for natural gas supplies is
primarily based on efficiency, reliability, availability of transportation and
ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producers' natural gas.
Competition for natural gas and NGL customers is primarily based upon
reliability and price of deliverable natural gas and NGLs. For customers that
have the capability of using alternative fuels, such as oil and coal, the
Company also competes based primarily on price against companies capable of
providing such alternative fuels.  The Company's competitors for obtaining
additional gas supplies, for gathering and processing gas and for marketing gas
and NGLs include national and local gas gatherers, brokers,

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
marketers and distributors of various size, financial resources and experience.
In recent years, the Company has also experienced narrowing margins due to the
increasing availability of pricing information to the participants in the
natural gas industry.

REGULATION

The purchase and sale of natural gas and the fees received for gathering and
processing by the Company have generally not been subject to regulation, and
therefore, except as constrained by competitive factors, the Company has
considerable pricing flexibility. Many aspects of the gathering, processing,
marketing and transportation of natural gas and NGLs by the Company, however,
are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations which can have a
significant impact upon the Company's overall operations.

As a processor and marketer of natural gas, the Company depends on the
transportation and storage services offered by various interstate and intrastate
pipeline companies for the delivery and sale of its own gas supplies as well as
those it processes and/or markets for others. Both the performance of
transportation and storage services by interstate pipelines, and the rates
charged for such services, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the
Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the "NGA") and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the
"NGPA"). The availability of interstate transportation and storage service
necessary to enable the Company to make deliveries and/or sales of residue gas
can at times be pre-empted by other system users in accordance with FERC-
approved methods for allocating the system capacity of "open access" pipelines.
Moreover, the rates charged by pipelines for such services are often subject to
negotiation between shippers and the pipelines within certain FERC-established
parameters and will periodically vary depending upon individual system usage and
other factors. An inability to obtain transportation and/or storage services at
competitive rates can hinder the Company's processing and marketing operations
and/or affect its sales margins.

During the past ten years, the FERC has implemented a nondiscriminatory blanket
transportation program which initially authorized, and ultimately mandated,
interstate natural gas pipelines to perform "open access," self-implementing
(i.e., not generally requiring case-specific certificate authorization)
transportation services.  Order Nos. 636, et seq., which constitute the FERC's
                                          -------                             
most recent issuances in this program, promulgated regulations that
substantially restructure the services provided by interstate pipelines by
"unbundling" (i.e., separating) and separately pricing pipeline gathering,
transportation, storage and sales activities in an effort to enable non-pipeline
merchants to compete with pipelines for gas purchasers on an equal basis. These
regulations have largely been implemented by all interstate transporters
utilized by the Company (as well as by the Company's own non-major interstate
pipeline located in Wyoming) in numerous individual pipeline restructuring and
rate proceedings. The conversion of pipelines from natural gas merchants to
primarily transporters of gas through implementation of the FERC's open access
transportation and restructuring programs has caused the pipelines to incur
significant producer take-or-pay costs and other transition costs resulting from
their abandonment of gas purchasing and sales activities. The FERC has allowed,
and indicated in Order Nos. 636, et seq. that it will continue to allow, the
                                 ------                                     
recovery of some or all of these and related costs from current shippers of gas.
Pipeline flow-through of many of these costs is subject to the outcome of
administrative and appellate proceedings in individual pipeline rate and
restructuring cases, and Order Nos. 636, et seq. themselves are currently the
                                         ------                              
subject of numerous petitions for appellate review presently pending in the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The outcome
of these proceedings could affect the Company's operations and the costs of
transporting and selling gas.

Pursuant to Section 1(b) of the NGA, production and gathering activities are
exempt from the FERC's jurisdiction; however, judicial precedent has held that
where gathering is performed largely in connection with the delivery of gas in
interstate commerce, such gathering can be considered merely an extension of the
jurisdictional transportation of such gas and thus subject to NGA rate
regulation itself. Recently, primarily as a result of the unbundling of
interstate pipeline gathering services required by Order Nos. 636, et seq., many
                                                                   ------       
pipelines have sought FERC authorization to abandon gathering operations and
facilities previously held to be subject to the NGA. In response to those
requests, the FERC has established a general policy permitting the abandonments
but requiring a showing demonstrating that existing customers have been offered,
for a two-year period, continued service through the abandoned facilities at the
same rates and under the same terms as were previously offered by the pipeline.
The Company has been active in acquiring and/or operating natural gas gathering
facilities abandoned by interstate pipelines and, thus, certain of its
operations and acquisitions have been affected by this FERC policy. The policy
is currently being challenged at both agency and appellate levels, but at this
stage the outcome of such challenges is too speculative to predict.

INSURANCE AND OPERATIONAL RISKS

The Company is subject to various hazards which are inherent in the industry in
which it operates such as explosions, product spills, leaks and fires, each of
which could cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and
destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental
damage, and may result in curtailment or suspension of operations at the
affected facility. The Company maintains physical damage, comprehensive general
liability, workers' compensation and business interruption insurance. Such
insurance is subject to deductibles that the Company considers reasonable. The
Company is not fully

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
insured against all risks in its business; however, the Company believes that
the coverage it maintains is adequate and consistent with other companies in the
industry.  Consistent with insurance coverage typically available to the natural
gas industry, the Company's insurance policies do not provide coverage for
losses or liabilities relating to pollution, except for sudden and accidental
occurrences.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 1995, the Company employed 862 full-time employees, none of whom
was a union member.  The Company considers relations with employees to be
excellent.

The Company paid annual dividends on the Common Stock aggregating $.20 per share
during the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.  The Company has declared a
dividend of $.05 per share of common stock for the quarter ending March 31, 1996
to holders of record as of March 29, 1996.  Declarations of dividends on the
Common Stock are within the discretion of the Board of Directors. In addition,
the Company's ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in its
financing facilities, the most restrictive of which prohibits declaring or
paying dividends after December 31, 1995 that exceed, in the aggregate, the sum
of $10 million plus 50% of the Company's  cumulative consolidated net income
earned after December 31, 1995 plus 50% of the net proceeds received by the
Company after December 31, 1995 from the sale of any equity securities.  The
dividends declared in the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995, payable in 1996, are
excluded from this calculation.  At December 31, 1995, this threshold amounted
to $10.0 million.

(a) In 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No.121,"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," which resulted in the recognition of a
non-cash loss of $17.6 million. Also, the Company implemented a cost reduction
program to reduce operating and selling and administrative expenses. As a result
of this program, a $2.1 million restructuring charge was incurred, primarily
related to employee severance costs.

(b) In December 1993, a fire at the Granger facility's NGL tank farm required
the facility to be shut down for one week. The new cryogenic processing plant as
well as the smaller existing cryogenic unit were also damaged. Construction of a
new tank farm and repairs to the cryogenic units were completed and fully
operational in August 1994. Claims for physical damage to the Company's
facilities totaled approximately $6.7 million. In addition, the Company
recorded, as other revenue, $3.3 million relating to lost income covered under
its business interruption insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 1994.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company had resolved substantially all remaining
issues and collected all remaining insurance proceeds. The total reimbursements
the Company received under its insurance policies were $6.6 million for physical
damage and $3.9 million related to business interruption.

</TABLE>

Net income decreased $13.5 million and net cash provided by operating activities
increased $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994.
The decrease in net income for the year was primarily due to a $17.6 million 
pre-tax impairment loss recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No.
121,"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of," and a $2.1 million pre-tax restructuring charge the
Company recorded in May 1995 relating to its cost reduction program. In
addition, net income was adversely affected by higher product purchase costs
associated with the Company's third-party residue gas sales and increased
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense, partially
offset by higher residue gas volumes sold and higher NGL prices.

Revenues from the sale of residue gas increased approximately $168.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994. Average gas sales volumes
increased 475 MMcf per day to 1,572 MMcf per day for the year ended December 31,
1995 compared to 1994, largely due to an increase of approximately 460 MMcf per
day in the sale of residue gas purchased from third parties. Average gas prices
decreased $.24 per Mcf to $1.53 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 1995
compared to 1994. The effect of the decrease in residue gas prices on the
Company's net margin from equity production was partially offset by the
Company's futures positions; approximately $10.0 million of gain was recognized
in the year ended December 31, 1995 related to such contracts. The Company has
entered into futures positions for a portion of its equity gas for 1996. See
further discussion at "Forward Looking Information-Hedging."

Revenues from the sale of NGLs increased approximately $22.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994. Average NGL sales volumes
remained relatively constant at 2,890 MGal per day and average NGL prices
increased $.03 per gallon to $.31 per gallon for the year ended December 31,
1995 compared to 1994.

Processing, transportation and storage revenues increased $6.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994. Approximately $3.6 million of the
increase was due to greater NGL revenues from the Company's Giddings system and
increased treating revenue, primarily from gathering systems acquired in
December 1994. The remaining increase was primarily due to a long-term firm
storage and transportation agreement at the Katy Facility that the Company
entered into in February 1995.

Other net revenue decreased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995
compared to 1994.  The difference was primarily attributable to a $3.3 million
insurance recovery recorded in 1994 for business losses associated with the
December 1993 fire at the Company's Granger facility.

The increase in product purchases corresponds to the increase in third-party
residue gas sales.  Combined product purchases as a percentage of residue gas
and NGL sales increased two percentage points to 86%  for the year ended
December 31, 1995 compared to 1994.  The rising gas purchase percentage is a
continuing trend  based upon the growth of third-party sales, which typically
have lower margins than sales of the Company's equity production.  Until
recently, the Company had experienced narrowing margins related to third-party
sales due to the increasing availability of pricing information in the natural
gas industry. The Company believes by targeting end-use markets, these margins
will be stabilized. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be 
successful in capturing these markets.

Plant operating expense increased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1995.  The  increase was attributable to assets purchased in the Oasis
acquisition in December 1994, primarily for property taxes, and taxes on higher
levels of inventory held at the Katy Facility, partially offset by cost savings
resulting from the cost reduction plan initiated in May 1995.

Selling and administrative expense decreased $3.0 million, primarily due to the
cost reduction plan implemented in May 1995.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $1.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1995 compared to the prior year period.  The increase was
primarily attributable to the Oasis assets, additional depletion related to the
Company's oil and gas production and various plant upgrades and equipment
additions in 1995.

Interest expense increased  $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995
compared to 1994, due to an increase in the Company's average borrowing rate
from 6.6% to 7.5% per annum and higher average debt outstanding during 1995,
primarily due to the redemption of the 7.25% Cumulative Perpetual Convertible
Preferred Stock.

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1995 includes a
$300,000 adjustment to reflect management's estimate  of deferred taxes.

</TABLE>

Net income decreased $30.7 million and net cash provided by operating activities
decreased $75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the
same period in 1993. Overall, throughput and sales volumes at the Company's
facilities remained comparable to historical levels.  The Company's decrease in
net income and net cash provided by operating activities was primarily
attributable to a decline in NGL and residue gas prices and higher interest,
selling and administrative and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs
associated with the Company's 1993 acquisitions of Black Lake and Mountain Gas,
along with the completion of the Katy Facility construction. In addition,
because of lower demand and lower than expected prices, the Katy Facility did
not generate significant revenue.  As a result, revenues from the Katy Facility
in 1994 did not  fully offset related depreciation, depletion and amortization,
interest and operating costs.

                                       15

Revenues from the sale of residue gas increased approximately $144.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, as a
volume increase of 342 MMcf per day was somewhat offset by a decrease in average
residue gas sales prices of $.25 per Mcf. Approximately 300 MMcf per day of the
volume increase was attributable to an increase in the sale of residue gas
purchased from third-parties, primarily resulting from the acquisition of
Citizens National Gas Company assets in the third quarter of 1993. The remaining
volume increase was the result of increased production volumes at the Company's
facilities, primarily due to the Mountain Gas and Black Lake acquisitions, new
well connect activities and consolidations with smaller gathering systems.

Revenues from the sale of NGLs decreased approximately $24.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 1994 compared to 1993, as a volume increase of
approximately 30 MGal per day was more than offset by a $.03 per gallon decrease
in the average NGL sales price. Approximately 22 MGal per day of the volume
increase was attributable to an increase in the sale of NGLs purchased from
third-parties. The remaining volume increase was primarily attributable to the
acquisitions of Mountain Gas and Black Lake, new well connect activity and
consolidations with smaller gathering systems. This volume increase was somewhat
offset by unfavorable economics of ethane and propane extraction in the first
quarter of 1994 and by limited NGL volumes at the Granger facility, primarily as
a result of the December 1993 fire. The curtailment of production while plant
improvements were completed during the third quarter of 1994 at Black Lake also
contributed to lower volumes.

Processing, transportation and storage revenues increased $9.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. The increase
was due to additional gathering revenue associated with the Company's Granger
gathering system acquired in the Mountain Gas acquisition in July 1993,
increased gathering revenue at the Company's Lincoln Road facility and the
recognition of demand fees associated with a winter-peaking gas purchase and
sales contract at the Katy Facility during 1994.

Other net revenue increased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1994
compared to the same period in 1993. For the year ended December 31, 1994, the
Company accrued approximately $3.3 million as an amount to be recovered under
its business interruption insurance policy for business losses associated with
the December 1993 fire at the Company's Granger facility and approximately $1.4
million in rate refunds from a pipeline company. These 1994 recoveries were
somewhat offset by a $2.6 million gain recorded as a result of the termination
of interest rate swap agreements in 1993.

Historically, product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales
from the Company's plant production have approximated 70%. Product purchases as
a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales from third-party purchases were
substantially higher in 1994 and approximated 95%. Total product purchases as a
percentage of residue gas and NGL sales increased approximately 2.5 percentage
points to 84% for the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period
in 1993. The increase in the Company's combined percentage was primarily due to
an increasing proportion of 1994 residue gas sales revenues resulting from
products purchased from third parties.

Plant operating expense and oil and gas exploration and production costs
increased approximately $6.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the
year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. The increase
in plant operating expense was primarily due to the additional operating costs
associated with three gas processing facilities acquired from Mountain Gas and
Black Lake in July 1993 and the Katy Facility, which commenced operations in
February 1994. The oil and gas exploration and production cost increase resulted
primarily from costs associated with producing properties acquired in the Black
Lake acquisition.

Selling and administrative expense increased approximately $5.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, primarily due
to administrative expenses necessitated by the 1993 acquisitions, an overall
increase in insurance expenditures and a reduction in overhead capitalized to
the Company's construction projects.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased approximately $19.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in
1993. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Mountain Gas and
Black Lake in July 1993 and the commencement of Katy Facility operations in
February 1994, and was partially offset by lower depreciation and depletion
expense resulting from the addition of recoverable reserves at Black Lake and
Edgewood during 1994.

Interest expense increased approximately $19.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, primarily due to
additional borrowings necessitated by the Mountain Gas and Black Lake
acquisitions, a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized to the Katy
Facility and an increase in the Company's variable borrowing rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been
net cash provided by operating activities, funds available under its financing
facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities.  In the past, these
sources have been sufficient to meet the needs and finance the growth of the
Company's business.  The Company can give no assurance that the historical
sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future
development and acquisition projects, and it may be required to investigate
alternative financing sources.  Net cash provided by operating activities has
been primarily affected by product prices, the Company's success in increasing
the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of natural gas
processed by such facilities, as well as the margin on third-party residue gas
purchased for resale.  The Company's continued growth will be dependent upon
success in the areas of marketing, additions to dedicated plant reserves,
acquisitions and new project development.

The Company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the
Revolving Credit Facility, together with cash provided by operating activities,
will provide it with sufficient financing to connect new reserves, maintain its
existing facilities and complete its current capital improvement projects. The
Company also believes that cash provided by operating activities will be
sufficient to meet its debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements.

The Company's sources and uses of funds for the year ended December 31, 1995 are
summarized as follows (000s):

</TABLE>

Additional sources of  liquidity available to the Company are volumes of residue
gas and NGLs in storage facilities.  The Company stores residue gas and NGLs
primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long-term sales contracts and for
resale during periods when prices are favorable.  The Company held residue gas
in storage for such purposes of approximately 12.8 Bcf  at an average cost of
$1.82 per Mcf ($1.65 per MMBtu) at December 31, 1995 as compared to 21.9 Bcf at
an average cost of $2.16 per Mcf ($1.94 per MMBtu) at December 31, 1994,
primarily at the Katy Facility.  The Company also held NGLs in storage of 15,816
MGal at an average cost of $.31 per gallon and 11,600 MGal at an average cost of
$.30 per gallon at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively, at
various third party storage facilities. At December 31, 1995, the Company had
hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales for approximately 12.5 Bcf of
stored gas at a weighted average price of $1.88 per MMBtu for the 1995-1996
winter heating season.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company had shelf registrations available providing
for the sale of up to $200 million of debt securities and preferred stock and up
to four million shares of common stock.  On February 13, 1996, the Company filed
a registration statement registering an additional $100 million of debt
securities or preferred or common stock, which the Company believes will be
declared effective in April 1996.

The Company has been successful overall in replacing production with new
reserves.  However, volumes of natural gas dedicated to some of the Company's
plants have declined in recent years because additions to dedicated plant
reserves have not fully offset production.  In 1995, including the reserves
associated with Westana Gathering Company ("Westana") and 1995 acquisitions, the
Company connected new reserves to its gathering systems to replace approximately
94% of 1995 production.  On a Company-wide

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
basis, dedicated reserves, including certain proved undeveloped properties and
revisions to previous estimates, decreased from 2.3 Tcf as of December 31, 1994
(as revised) to approximately 2.1 Tcf at December 31, 1995. The decrease is
primarily due to decreased drilling in all areas in which the Company operates
and declines in reserves at the Company's Black Lake field.

In May 1995, the Company redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of
its 7.25% Cumulative Senior Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (liquidation
preference of $40 million) pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of
Designation relating to such preferred stock, at an aggregate redemption price
of approximately $42.0 million.

     Risk Management Activities

The Company's policy is to utilize risk management tools primarily to reduce
commodity price risk for its equity production and to lock in profit margins for
its storage and marketing activities. It is the Company's objective to maintain
a balanced portfolio of financial exposure between physical obligations (fixed
price purchase and sales, storage inventories) and related financial instruments
(futures, swaps, and options positions). This effectively allows the Company to
fix its total margin because gains or losses in the physical market are offset
by corresponding losses or gains in the financial instruments market.

Hedging and related activities may expose the Company to the risk of financial
loss in certain circumstances, including instances when (i) production is less
than expected, (ii) the Company's customers fail to purchase or deliver the
contracted quantities of natural gas or NGLs, or (iii) the Company's over-the-
counter ("OTC") counterparties fail to perform. To the extent that the Company
engages in hedging activities, it may be prevented from realizing the benefits
of favorable price changes in the physical market. However, it is similarly
insulated against decreases in such prices.

In 1993, the Board of Directors adopted its Natural Gas Futures Trading
Procedures and created a committee of officers to oversee the Company's risk
management activities. As an additional control, the Company has developed
information systems that allow daily monitoring of its risk management
activities and its exposure related to futures, swaps and options positions
resulting from changes in the market.

The Company uses futures, swaps, and options to reduce price risk and basis
risk. Basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being
hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging. Basis risk is the
risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset
by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged.
Basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price
differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery
locations.

The Company enters into futures transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and the Kansas City Board of Trade and through OTC swaps with creditworthy
counterparties consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural
gas companies. The Company conducts its standard credit review of OTC
counterparties and has agreements with such parties which contain collateral
requirements. OTC exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review
process. The Company generally uses standardized swap agreements which allow for
offset of positive and negative exposures.

Gains and losses on hedges of product inventory are included in the carrying
amount of the inventory and are ultimately recognized in residue and NGL sales
when the related inventory is sold. Gains and losses related to qualifying
hedges, as defined by SFAS No. 80, "Accounting for Futures Contracts", of firm
commitments or anticipated transactions are recognized in residue and NGL sales
when the hedged physical transaction occurs. The $1.9 million of losses deferred
in inventory at December 31, 1995 were recognized in January 1996 and were more
than offset by margins from the Company's related forward fixed price hedges and
physical sales.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company held a notional quantity of approximately
330 Bcf of natural gas futures, swaps, and options extending from January 1996
to February 1998. This was comprised of approximately 37 Bcf long and 31 Bcf
short of exchange-traded futures and 126 long and 136 short Bcf of OTC swaps and
options. As of December 31, 1994, the Company held a notional quantity of
approximately 210 Bcf of futures, swaps, and options extending through December
1997. This was comprised of approximately 34 Bcf long and 58 Bcf short of
exchange traded futures and 56 long and 62 short Bcf of OTC swaps and options.

The Company enters into speculative futures trades on a very limited basis for
purposes which include testing of hedging techniques. Company procedures contain
strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop-loss
requirements and net open positions limits (currently, a total position of 100
net contracts long or short). Speculative futures positions are marked to market
at the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in
income for that period. Net gains from such speculative activities for the year
ended December 31, 1995 were not material. See further discussion of hedging
activities at

     Capital Investment Program

Between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 1995, the Company expended
approximately $672 million on new projects and acquisitions. For the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 the Company expended $79 million, $101 million
and $492 million, respectively, on acquisitions, the construction of the Katy
Facility, connection of new reserves, the acquisition of consolidating assets
for existing systems and upgrades to existing and newly acquired facilities.

Capital expenditures related to existing operations are expected to be
approximately $76.1 million during 1996 consisting of the following: capital
expenditures related to gathering, processing and pipeline assets are expected
to be $63.2 million, of which $47.6 million will be used for new connects,
system expansions and asset consolidations and $15.6 million for maintaining
existing facilities. The Company expects capital expenditures on the Katy Gas
Storage Facility ("Katy Facility"), exploration and production activities and
miscellaneous items to be $4.8 million, $3.8 million and $4.3 million,
respectively.

Depending on the timing of the Company's future projects, it may be required to
seek additional sources of capital.  The Company's ability to secure such
capital is restricted by its credit facilities, although it may request
additional borrowing capacity from the banks, seek waivers from the banks to
permit it to borrow funds from third parties, seek replacement credit facilities
from other lenders or issue additional equity securities.  While the Company
believes that it would be able to secure additional financing, if required, no
assurance can be given that it will be able to do so or as to the terms of any
such financing.

     Financing Facilities

Revolving Credit Facility.  The Company's variable rate Revolving Credit
Facility, as restated on September 2, 1994 and subsequently amended, with a
syndicate of eight banks, provides for a maximum borrowing base of $300 million,
of which $137.5 million was outstanding at December 31, 1995.  If the facility
is not renewed, its commitment period will terminate on October 1, 1997. Any
outstanding balance thereunder at such time will convert to a three-year term
loan, which shall be payable in 12 equal quarterly installments, commencing
January 1, 1998.  The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's
option, at certain spreads over the Eurodollar rate, at the Federal Funds rate
plus .50%, or at the agent bank's prime rate.  The interest rate spreads are
adjusted based on the Company's debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31,
1995, the spread was 1.25% over the Eurodollar rate, resulting in an interest
rate of 7.21%.

The Company pays a commitment fee on the unused commitment ranging from .15% to
 .375% based on the debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31, 1995, the
Company's debt to capitalization ratio was .58 to 1 resulting in a commitment
fee rate of .375%.

Term Loan Facility.  The Company also has a Term Loan Facility with four banks
for $25 million which bears interest at 9.87%. Payments on the Term Loan
Facility of $12.5 million are due in  September 1996 and September 1997,
respectively.  The Company intends to finance the $12.5 million payment due in
1996 through amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility.  The
agreements governing the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
(the "Credit Facilities Agreement") contain certain mandatory prepayment terms.
If funded debt of the Company, which has a final maturity on or before October
1, 2000, exceeds four times (4.0 to 1.0) the sum of the Company's last four
quarters' cash flow (as defined in the agreement) less preferred stock dividends
projected to be paid during the next four quarters, the overage must be repaid
in no more than six monthly payments, commencing 90 days from notification.
This mandatory prepayment threshold will be reduced to 3.5 to 1.0 at September
1, 1998.  At December 31, 1995, taking into account all the covenants contained
in the Credit Facilities Agreement,  the Company had approximately $50 million
of available borrowing capacity.

The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities are unsecured.  Pursuant to the
Credit Facilities Agreement, the Company is required to maintain a current ratio
(as defined therein) of at least 1.0 to 1.0, a minimum tangible net worth equal
to the sum of $345.0 million plus 50% of consolidated net income earned after
June 30, 1995 plus 75% of the net proceeds received after June 30, 1995 from the
sale of equity securities,  a debt to capitalization ratio (as defined therein)
of no more than  60% through October 31, 1996 and 55% thereafter, and an EBITDA
to interest ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.0 through October 31, 1996, 3.25 to
1.0 from November 1, 1996 through October 31, 1997 and 3.75 to 1.0 thereafter.
The Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on or after
December 31, 1995 that in the aggregate exceed the sum of $10 million plus 50%
of consolidated net income earned after December 31, 1995 plus 50% of the
cumulative net proceeds received by the Company after December 31, 1995 from the
sale of any equity securities.  The dividends declared in the fourth fiscal
quarter of 1995, payable in 1996, are excluded from

                                       19
<PAGE>
 

this calculation. At December 31, 1995, $10 million was available under this
limitation, which is sufficient to pay required preferred stock dividends in 
1996. The Company generally utilizes excess daily funds to reduce any
outstanding revolving credit balances and associated interest expense and it
intends to continue such practice. The $5.8 million cash balance at December 31,
1995 is an overnight investment necessitated by the timing of cash receipts.

Master Shelf Agreement. In December 1991, the Company entered into a Master
Shelf Agreement (the "Master Shelf") with The Prudential Insurance Company of
America ("Prudential") pursuant to which Prudential agreed to quote, from time-
to-time, an interest rate at which Prudential or its nominee would be willing to
purchase up to $100 million of the Company's senior promissory notes (the
"Master Notes"). Any such Master Notes will mature in no more than 12 years,
with an average life not in excess of 10 years, and are unsecured. The Master
Shelf contains certain financial covenants which substantially conform with
those contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, as restated and amended. In
July 1993 and July 1995, Prudential and the Company amended the Master Shelf to
provide for additional borrowing capacity (for a total borrowing capacity of
$200 million) and to extend the term of the Master Shelf to October 31, 1995.
The Master Shelf Agreement, as restated and amended, is fully utilized, as
indicated in the following table (000s):

1993 Senior Notes. On April 28, 1993 the Company sold $50 million of 7.65%
Senior Notes due 2003 to a group of insurance companies. Annual principal
payments of $7.1 million on the 1993 Senior Notes are due on April 30 of each
year from 1997 through 2002, with any remaining principal and interest
outstanding due on April 30, 2003. The 1993 Senior Notes contain certain
financial covenants that substantially conform with those contained in the
Master Shelf Agreement, as restated and amended.

1995 Senior Notes.  The Company sold $42 million of 1995 Senior Notes to a group
of insurance companies in the fourth quarter of 1995, with an interest rate of
8.16% per annum and principal due in a single payment in December 2005. The 1995
Senior Notes contain certain financial covenants that conform with those
contained in the Master Shelf Agreement, as restated and amended. The Company
used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility.

Receivables Facility.  In April 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with
Receivables Capital Corporation ("RCC"), as purchaser, and Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association ("BA"), as agent, pursuant to which the
Company will sell to RCC at face value on a revolving basis an undivided
interest in certain of the Company's trade receivables. As part of the sale, the
Company granted to RCC a security interest in such receivables. The Company may
sell up to $75 million of trade receivables under the Receivables Facility, at a
rate equal to RCC's commercial paper rate plus .375%, of which $75 million was
funded at a rate of 6.3% as of December 31, 1995. The Receivables Facility has a
364-day term and contains financial covenants similar to those in the Credit
Facilities Agreement, as restated and amended, along with certain covenants
regarding the quality of the trade receivables pool.

On September 2, 1994, in anticipation of entering into the Receivables Facility,
BA entered in a Master Note Agreement (the "Short-Term Note") with the Company
and advanced the Company $75 million at the Eurodollar rate plus .50%, which
resulted in an interest rate of 6.56% per annum at June 30, 1995. The Company
used the $75 million drawn on the Receivables Facility to repay the Short-Term
Note, which was then canceled.

COVENANT COMPLIANCE.  At December 31, 1995, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants in its loan agreements.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS.  Historically, the Company has entered into
interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
The transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest
payment obligations or the exchange of foreign and U.S. currencies, without the
exchange of the underlying principal amounts. The net effect of interest

                                       20
<PAGE>
 
rate swap activity is reflected as an increase or decrease in interest expense.
Any gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements and the effects of
foreign currency positions that were marked to market are included in other
income. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the total notional principal amount of
outstanding interest rate swap agreements was $0 and $50 million, respectively.
In addition to the financial risk, which will vary during the life of these swap
agreements in relation to the maturity of the underlying debt and market
interest rates, the Company is subject to credit risk exposure from
nonperformance of the counterparties to the swap agreements.

In anticipation of issuing the 1995 Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 1995,
the Company entered into an interest rate lock on a notional amount of $50
million, linked to the ten-year U.S. Treasury Bill rate, with a creditworthy
counterparty to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates while it
completed the 1995 Senior Notes placement. At the time the Company terminated
the rate lock, interest rates had decreased, which resulted in the realization
of a $390,000 loss. The Company considered the loss to be a cost of obtaining
the privately placed debt and is therefore amortizing it over the ten-year term
of the 1995 Senior Notes.

The following table summarizes the results of the Company's interest rate swap
and foreign currency positions for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 (000s):

     Environmental

The construction and operation of the Company's gathering lines, plants and
other facilities used for the gathering, transporting, processing, treating or
storing of residue gas and NGLs are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, including those that can impose obligations
to clean up hazardous substances at the Company's facilities or at facilities to
which the Company sends wastes for disposal. In most instances, the applicable
regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or solid waste
management procedures. The Company employs six environmental engineers to
monitor environmental compliance and potential liabilities at its facilities.
Prior to consummating any major acquisition, the Company's environmental
engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired. In addition, on an
ongoing basis, the environmental engineers perform systematic environmental
assessments of the Company's existing facilities. The Company believes that it
is in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and
regulations. Environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning,
designing, constructing and operating the Company's facilities. The Company
believes that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and
regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operation.

In 1990, the Congress enacted the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean
Air Act") which impose more stringent standards on emissions of certain
pollutants and require the permitting of certain existing air emissions sources.
Many of the regulations have not yet been promulgated and until their
promulgation, the Company cannot make a final assessment of the impact of the
Clean Air Act. However, based upon its preliminary review of the proposed
regulations, the Company does not anticipate that compliance with the Clean Air
Act will require any material capital expenditures, although it will increase
permitting costs in 1996 and may increase certain operating costs on an ongoing
basis. The Company does not believe that such cost increases will have a
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

The Company believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend in
environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter
standards. The Company is unaware of future environmental standards that are
reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations, but it cannot rule out
that possibility.

The Company is in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at
facilities that it operates. In addition, the former owner of certain facilities
that the Company acquired in 1992 is conducting remediation at those facilities
pursuant to contractual obligations. The Company's expenditures for
environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
significant in relation to the results of operations of the Company and totaled
approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. For the year
ended December 31, 1995, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $757,000
in air emissions fees to the states in which it operates. Although the Company
anticipates that such environmental expenses will increase over time, the
Company does not believe that such increases will have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION

The Company has developed a three-part business plan to increase profitability
through continued growth of the Company's core businesses. The Company plans to
expand its marketing activities, acquire or develop gas gathering and processing
assets that meet the Company's target rates of return and increase the
efficiency of its existing facilities.

     Marketing

The Company's existing natural gas and NGL marketing was a by-product of the
Company's processing activities and was directed towards selling natural gas and
NGLs processed at its plants to ensure their efficient operation. As the Company
expanded into new basins and the natural gas industry became deregulated, the
Company began to increase its third-party marketing. The Company believes that
the knowledge and understanding gained through its gas gathering and processing
operations coupled with its understanding of the pipeline network are the basis
for its success in marketing natural gas and NGLs. Average daily gas sales
increased to 1,572 MMcf per day and NGL sales increased to 2,890 MGal per day
for the year ended December 31, 1995 compared to 220 MMcf and 630 MGal,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1990, a 615% and 359% increase,
respectively.

     Natural Gas

The Company plans to expand its gas marketing by (i) targeting special needs of
end-users willing to pay higher margins, (ii) increasing its use of the Katy
Facility and (iii) entering the recently deregulated electric power marketing
sector. The Company's marketing department has recently been restructured along
more specialized lines to include separate managers for national accounts, end-
use sales and electric power marketing. In 1996, the Company plans to hire four
experienced marketers who will primarily be involved in seeking national
accounts with companies having multiple facilities throughout the country. There
is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such accounts.
The Company has also expanded its marketing activity to areas beyond its
traditional gas supply centers (Houston and the Gulf Coast) to demand centers,
such as Chicago, New York and California.

The Katy Facility, which commenced operations in February 1994, utilizes a
partially depleted natural gas reservoir with 19 Bcf of working gas capacity and
a pipeline header system, currently connected to eleven pipelines. The Katy
Facility has the capability to deliver up to 400 MMcf per day of natural gas
from the reservoir. In the first two years of the facility's operation, the
Company used a majority of the storage for its own account to take advantage of
the price differential between summer and winter gas. As part of its marketing
plans, the Company intends to increase its long-term firm storage agreements
with local distribution companies from 45% to up to 75% of the available 
capacity.

     NGLs

The Company's plans for NGL marketing are focused on increasing third-party
sales. The Company is also pursuing industrial end-users of NGLs and recently
entered into a long-term agreement for the sale of approximately two-thirds of
the propane produced at the Granger Plant to a mining company through a
transporter/wholesaler. In addition, the Company plans to spend approximately $5
million in 1996 to upgrade certain processing facilities which will allow for
production of higher-value NGLs. For example, the Company is installing a butane
splitter at the Granger Plant which will permit fractionation of field-grade
butane into normal butane and iso-butane, products that receive a premium over
the field-grade butane.

     Electric Power

The Company believes that the anticipated deregulation by states of retail power
marketing will offer the Company significant opportunities to offer both natural
gas and electric power to its existing end-user customer base and to utilize the
Company's demonstrated ability in the natural gas sector to respond quickly to
changing regulatory and market conditions. In 1994, the Company received a
certificate from the FERC to sell electric power at the wholesale level. The
Company intends to dedicate six employees to power marketing by the end of 1996.
The Company is in the process of developing the contractual infrastructure

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
necessary to market power and has already put into place 150 blanket
transmission agreements with carriers and 150 tolling agreements with power
generators to trade natural gas for electric power. There is no assurance that
the retail electric power marketing industry will develop or that the Company
will be successful if the industry develops.

     Business Development

The Company's business development activities are oriented towards (i)
identifying and acquiring gas gathering and processing assets and (ii) obtaining
additional gas supplies to maintain or increase throughput levels at the
Company's existing facilities to offset natural production declines.

Historically, the Company has expanded primarily through acquisitions. Since
December 31, 1990, the Company has had a net increase of 13 gas processing
plants and has increased its gas gathering system miles by 188% to 11,079 miles,
resulting in an increase in gas throughput of 370% for the five-year period
ended December 31, 1995. As part of its business plan, the Company will continue
to pursue aggressively gas gathering and processing assets which meet the
Company's target rate of return, with an emphasis on acquisitions that
complement its existing operations or provide growth in marketing.

The Company's business plan assumes that the Company will spend $50 million in
each of 1996, 1997 and 1998 on acquisitions and projects that complement its
current asset base. One of the significant criteria for the Company in making
acquisitions or entering into development projects is that such transactions
have a projected internal rate of return of 20% per year, before income taxes
and financing costs, for a 15-year period, although the Company will also
consider lower return transactions if they provide other opportunities or
benefits. The primary factor affecting internal rates of return is the price of
natural gas, which also generally affects the volumes of natural gas produced by
both the Company and third parties. Other assumptions underlying the Company's
business plan are that for every $1 million in investment, the Company will (i)
spend an additional $100,000 in each succeeding year for new well connects and
related expansion (an aggregate of $5 million per year if the full $50 million
is spent) and (ii) incur an additional $10,000 in general and administrative
costs.

The Company believes that the foregoing criteria and assumptions are reasonable
under current industry and general economic and market conditions. However, the
Company cannot predict the volumes and prices of natural gas and NGLs, and
actual industry and general economic and market conditions could differ, perhaps
significantly, from the conditions that the Company has assumed in projecting
rates of return for transactions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that
the Company will identify any qualifying transactions or that it will ultimately
be able to acquire assets or enter into such projects.

     Operations

The Company continually monitors the economic performance of each of its
operating facilities to ensure that it meets a desired cash flow objective. If
an operating facility is not generating desired cash flows or does not fit in
with the Company's strategic plans, the Company will explore various options,
such as consolidation with other Company-owned facilities, dismantlement, asset
swap or outright sale. In 1995, the Company sold the Waha Header and certain 
non-strategic assets acquired in the Oasis acquisition and completed the
consolidation of its Lamont gathering system with the Chaney Dell system. The
Company anticipates completing the salvage of substantially all of the Lamont
processing plant by the end of the first quarter of 1996. In 1994, the Company
sold its Sligo plant, swapped its Pyote treating facilities for gathering assets
in Kansas which were subsequently disposed of during the second quarter of 1995,
consolidated assets in the Powder River Basin and sold its Walnut Bend gathering
system. The Company anticipates that the salvage of the Walnut Bend processing
plant will be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 1996.
Commencing in March 1996, the Company and its joint venture partner at the
Lincoln Road gas plant temporarily suspended processing operations at that plant
and began processing the associated gas at the Company's Granger facility. If
volumes increase substantially beyond Granger's capacity, the Lincoln Road plant
might be re-started. The Company anticipates that this consolidation will result
in lower overall plant operating expenses for the combined systems. In January
1996, Koch, which operates the Teddy Roosevelt and Williston assets under a
lease agreement, exercised its option to purchase certain gas gathering assets
located in North Dakota from the Company and Williston. Proceeds from the sale
of the gathering assets totaled $2.4 million of which the Company is entitled to
receive $1.5 million. The closing on the sale is expected to occur on August 1,

     Hedging

In order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations on  its operating
results, the Company enters into futures contracts and basis positions to hedge
the majority of its natural gas equity production. The following table
summarizes the Company's hedged equity position as of March 1, 1996:

From time to time, the Company also hedges a portion of its share of condensate
and crude oil production, although no such hedges were outstanding at December
31, 1995. The Company will continue hedging such production as deemed
appropriate by management.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K are the responsibility of management.  The financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles appropriate in the circumstances and include amounts that are based
on management's informed judgments and estimates.

Management relies on the Company's system of internal accounting controls to
provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions
are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's
authorization.  The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal accounting
control and that the cost of such systems should not exceed the benefits to be
derived.  The internal accounting controls, including internal audit, in place
during the periods presented are considered adequate to provide such assurance.

The Company's financial statements are audited by Price Waterhouse LLP,
independent accountants.  Their report states that they have conducted their
audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  These standards
include an evaluation of the system of internal accounting controls for the
purpose of establishing the scope of audit testing necessary to allow them to
render an independent professional opinion on the fairness of the Company's
financial statements.

Oversight of Management's financial reporting and internal accounting control
responsibilities is exercised by the Board of Directors, through an Audit
Committee that consists solely of outside directors.  The Audit Committee meets
periodically with financial management, internal auditors and the independent
accountants to review how each is carrying out its responsibilities and to
discuss matters concerning auditing, internal accounting control and financial
reporting.  The independent accountants and the Company's internal audit
department have free access to meet with the Audit Committee without Management
present.

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Western Gas Resources, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of cash flows, of operations, and of changes in
stockholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Western Gas Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the results of their cash flows and their operations for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company changed
its method of accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets in 1995 to
comply with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

L.P. for total consideration of approximately $168.2 million, including the
payment of certain transaction costs and the assumption and repayment of $35
million of long-term debt of Mountain Gas. Mountain Gas owns the Red Desert and
Granger facilities. The 22% interest in the Granger facility previously not
owned by Mountain Gas was purchased by the Company in two separate transactions
in November and December 1993 for an aggregate of $27.7 million. At the date of
acquisition, the Red Desert facility consisted of a cryogenic plant and the
Granger plant consisted of a refrigeration unit and a cryogenic unit. In
December 1993, the Company completed construction of an additional cryogenic
processing plant at Granger, at a total additional cost of approximately $4.8
million.

     Black Lake

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company purchased the Black Lake gas processing
plant and related reserves ("Black Lake") from Nerco Oil & Gas, Inc. ("Nerco")
for approximately $136.2 million. The acquisition included a 68.9% working
interest in the Black Lake field in Louisiana and a gas processing plant. The
purchase also included 50% of the stock of Black Lake Pipeline Company, which
owns a 240 mile liquids pipeline extending from Cotton Valley, Louisiana to Mont
Belvieu, Texas and transports NGLs for Black Lake and three unaffiliated gas
processing plants. In May 1994, the Company sold its 50% of the stock in Black
Lake Pipeline Company for approximately $5.4 million. The difference of
approximately $2.5 million between the book value and the sales price was
treated as a purchase price adjustment.

     Westana Joint Venture

Effective August 1, 1993, the Company formed Westana Gathering Company
("Westana"), a general partnership, with PanEnergy. Westana provides gas
gathering and processing services in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and markets
natural gas and NGLs for producers connected to its system. The Company is the
principal operator with each partner holding a 50% ownership interest.

The Company contributed its Chester gas processing plant and gathering system,
with a net book value of $13.8 million, to Westana.  The Company also made
additional contractual partnership contributions of $7.2 million through
December 31, 1995 which are expected to be recouped through preferential
distributions. In addition to the assets contributed by the Company, Westana
operates PanEnergy's 400 mile gathering system and six compressor stations,
assets which will be contributed to Westana by PanEnergy.  PanEnergy has
received and accepted abandonment approval by the FERC and is now awaiting
certain clarification of the abandonment approval.  Upon clarification from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") on the abandonment approval,
PanEnergy will contribute their gathering assets to Westana.  The Company
expects the contribution of the PanEnergy assets to occur in 1996.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------------------------------

The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries are presented herein to assist the reader in evaluating the
financial information contained herein. The Company's accounting policies are in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

     Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company's interest in certain
investments is accounted for by the equity method.

     Revenue Recognition

Revenue for sales or services is recognized at the time the natural gas or NGLs
is delivered or at the time the service is performed.

     Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock

Earnings (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income
(loss) attributable to shares of common stock by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Net income (loss) attributable to shares of
common stock is net income (loss) less preferred stock dividends. The Company
declared preferred stock dividends of $11.6 million, $12.2 million and $6.1
million for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. In
addition, net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 1995 attributable to
common stock was reduced by the $2.0 million redemption premium and certain up-
front costs of $1.8 million paid on the 7.25% Preferred Stock. The computation
of fully diluted earnings per share of common stock for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1995 was not dilutive; therefore, only primary
earnings per share of common stock is presented.

     Inventories

Product inventory includes $23.3 million and $47.5 million of residue gas and
$4.8 million and $3.5 million of NGLs at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

The cost of residue gas and NGL inventories is determined by the weighted
average cost and last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, respectively, on a location-
by-location basis. Residue inventory covered by hedging contracts is accounted
for on a specific identification basis.

     Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated realizable
value, including interest on funds borrowed to finance the construction of new
projects. Interest incurred during the construction period of new projects is
capitalized and amortized over the life of the associated assets. Such
capitalized interest was $1.5 million, $1.5 million and $4.9 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful life of each facility which ranges from three to 35 years. Useful lives
are determined based on the shorter of the life of the equipment or the reserves
serviced by the equipment. The cost of certain gas purchase contracts is
amortized using the units-of-production method.

     Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
exploration and production activities. Acquisition costs, development costs and
successful exploration costs are capitalized. Exploratory dry hole costs, lease
rentals and geological and geophysical costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Upon surrender of undeveloped properties, the original cost is charged

                                       34

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

 
against income. Producing properties and related equipment are depleted and
depreciated by the units-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves
for producing properties and proved developed reserves for lease and well
equipment.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

As of October 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," which requires that an impairment
loss be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the expected
future undiscounted net cash flows. This test is to be performed at the lowest
level at which cash flows can be identified. Historically, the Company had
performed this test for its oil and gas producing properties on a Company-wide
basis. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 121, the Company reviewed its assets at the
plant facilities and oil and gas producing properties levels. In order to
determine whether an impairment existed, the Company compared its net book value
of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows, determined by
applying future prices estimated by management over the shorter of the lives of
the facilities or the reserves supporting the facilities. If impairment existed,
write-downs of assets were based upon expected discounted cash flows using an
interest rate commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying asset.

     Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of "temporary differences" between
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such
amounts as measured by tax laws. These temporary differences are determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

     Hedging Activities

Gains and losses on hedges of product inventory are included in the carrying
amount of the inventory and are ultimately recognized in residue and NGL sales
when the related inventory is sold. Gains and losses related to qualifying
hedges, as defined by SFAS No. 80, "Accounting for Futures Contracts", of firm
commitments or anticipated transactions are recognized in residue and NGL sales
when the hedged physical transaction occurs. The $1.9 million of losses deferred
in inventory at December 31, 1995, recognized in January 1996, was more than
offset by margins from the Company's related forward fixed price hedges and
physical sales.

     Interest Rate Swap Agreements

The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to
changes in interest rates. The transactions generally involve the exchange of
fixed and floating interest payment obligations without the exchange of the
underlying principal amounts. The net effect of interest rate swap activity is
reflected as an increase or decrease in interest expense. Any gains on
termination of interest rate swap agreements and the effects of foreign currency
positions that were marked to market are included in other income. In addition
to the financial risk that will vary during the life of these swap agreements in
relation to the maturity of the underlying debt and market interest rates, the
Company is subject to credit risk exposure from nonperformance of the
counterparties to the swap agreements.

     Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable. The risk is
limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer
base and their dispersion across industries and geographic locations. At
December 31, 1995, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes all cash balances and highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

     Supplementary Cash Flow Information

Interest paid was $38.8 million, $32.8 million and $16.4 million, respectively,
for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

Income taxes paid were $1.6 million, $1.1 million and $10.2 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

In February 1994, the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company,
surrendered 25,016 shares of the Company's common stock, which were valued at
$31.50 per share based upon the February 22, 1994 closing price, as repayment of
a loan and all accrued interest of approximately $788,000.

In 1994, the Company exchanged its Pyote Treating Facility for the Jayhawk
gathering system in a transaction valued at approximately $800,000. In 1993, the
Company exchanged its Fairview Gas Processing Plant for various gas gathering
and processing equipment located in Utah and Kansas in a transaction valued at
approximately $3.7 million.

     Use of Estimates and Significant Risks

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements
and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of
estimates relate to oil and gas reserves, fair value of financial instruments,
future cash flows associated with assets, and useful lives for depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Company is subject to a number of risks inherent in the industry in which it
operates, primarily fluctuating prices and gas supply. The Company's financial
condition and results of operations will depend significantly upon the prices
received for natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to fluctuations in
response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional
factors that are beyond the control of the Company. In addition, the Company
must continually connect new wells to its gathering systems in order to maintain
or increase throughput levels to offset natural declines in dedicated volumes.
The number of new wells drilled will depend upon, among other factors, prices
for gas and oil, the energy policy of the federal government and the
availability of foreign oil and gas, none of which is within the Company's
control.

     Reclassification

Certain prior years' amounts in the consolidated financial statements and
related notes have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in
1995.

     Stock Compensation

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," with an effective date for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1995. As permitted under SFAS No. 123, the
Company has elected to continue to measure compensation costs for stock-based
employee compensation plans as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The Company will comply with
the pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 in 1996 as required under
the pronouncement.

NOTE 3 - SPECIAL ITEMS
- ----------------------

In May 1995, the Company implemented a cost reduction program to reduce
operating and selling and administrative expenses. As a result of this program,
a $2.1 million restructuring charge was incurred, primarily related to employee
severance costs. This cost reduction program has not affected adversely the
overall operations of the Company.

In September 1995, the Company sold its 50% interest in the Waha Header, a
pipeline header in West Texas, resulting in an after-tax gain of $596,000.

As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 121, the Company recognized a non-cash
loss on the impairment of long-lived assets of $15.1 million and $2.5 million
related to its property and equipment and oil and gas properties, respectively.

In December 1993, a fire at the Granger facility's NGL tank farm required the
facility to be shut down for one week. The new cryogenic processing plant as
well as the smaller existing cryogenic unit were also damaged. Construction of a
new tank farm and repairs to the cryogenic units were completed and fully
operational in August 1994. Claims for physical damage to the Company's
facilities totaled approximately $6.7 million. In addition, the Company
recorded, as other revenue, $3.3 million relating to lost income covered under
its business interruption insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 1994.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company had resolved substantially all remaining
issues and collected all remaining insurance proceeds. The total reimbursements
the Company received under its insurance policies were $6.6 million for physical
damage and $3.9 million related to business interruption.


NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTIES
- ------------------------

The Company purchases a significant portion of production from Williston Gas
Company ("Williston"), a joint venture of which the Company owns 50%, Westana
and Redman Smackover for resale to unrelated third parties. In addition, the
Company performs various operational and administrative functions for Williston
and Westana and charges each entity a monthly overhead fee to cover such
services.

The Company records receivable and payable balances at the end of each
accounting period related to the above referenced transactions and to payments
made by the Company on behalf of Williston and Westana that are typically
reimbursed in the next subsequent month.

In July 1990, the Company loaned Bill M. Sanderson, President, Chief Operating
Officer and a Director, approximately $748,000 to purchase 294,524 shares of
common stock in the Company. In February 1994, the loan and all accrued interest
was repaid in full by Mr. Sanderson through surrender of 25,016 shares of the
Company's Common Stock, which were valued at $31.50 per share based upon the
February 22, 1994 closing price.

The Company has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan to
certain key employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options as each
portion of their options vests under the Key Employees' Incentive Stock Option
Plan and the Employee Option Plan (See Note 10). The Company will forgive the
loan and accrued interest if the employee has been continuously employed by the
Company for periods specified under the agreements. As of December 31, 1995 and
1994, loans, including accrued interest, totaling $2.1 million and $1.6 million,
respectively, were outstanding to key employees under these programs. The loans
are secured by a portion of the common stock issued upon exercise of the options
and are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders' equity. During 1995 and
1994, the Board of Directors approved the forgiveness of loans to key employees
totaling approximately $59,000 and $130,000, respectively, after resignation and
prior to satisfaction of the continuous service requirements of the loan
agreement.

NOTE 5 - RISK MANAGEMENT
- ------------------------

NATURAL GAS AND NGL HEDGES

The Company's policy is to utilize risk management tools primarily to reduce
commodity price risk for its equity production and to lock in profit margins for
its storage and marketing activities. It is the Company's objective to maintain
a balanced portfolio of financial exposure between physical obligations (fixed
price purchase and sales, storage inventories) and related financial instruments
(futures, swaps, and options positions). This effectively allows the Company to
fix its total margin because gains or losses in the physical market are offset
by corresponding losses or gains in the financial instruments market.

Hedging and related activities may expose the Company to the risk of financial
loss in certain circumstances, including instances when (i) production is less
than expected, (ii) the Company's customers fail to purchase or deliver the
contracted quantities of natural gas or NGLs, or (iii) the Company's over-the-
counter ("OTC") counterparties fail to perform. To the extent that the Company
engages in hedging activities, it may be prevented from realizing the benefits
of favorable price changes in the physical market. However, it is similarly
insulated against decreases in such prices.

In 1993, the Board of Directors adopted its Natural Gas Futures Trading
Procedures and created a committee of officers to oversee the Company's risk
management activities. As an additional control, the Company has developed
information systems that allow daily monitoring of its risk management
activities and its exposure related to futures, swaps and options positions
resulting from changes in the market.

The Company uses futures, swaps, and options to reduce price risk and basis
risk. Basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being
hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging. Basis risk is the
risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset
by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged.
Basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price
differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery
locations.

The Company enters into futures transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and the Kansas City Board of Trade and through OTC swaps with creditworthy
counterparties consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural
gas companies. The Company conducts its standard credit review of OTC
counterparties and has agreements with such parties which contain collateral
requirements. OTC exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review
process. The Company generally uses standardized swap agreements which allow for
offset of positive and negative exposures.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company held a notional quantity of approximately
330 Bcf of natural gas futures, swaps, and options extending from January 1996
to February 1998. This was comprised of approximately 37 Bcf long and 31 Bcf
short of

                                       38
<PAGE>
 
                          WESTERN GAS RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


exchange-traded futures and 126 long and 136 short Bcf of OTC swaps and options.
As of December 31, 1994, the Company held a notional quantity of approximately
210 Bcf of futures, swaps, and options extending through December 1997. This was
comprised of approximately 34 Bcf long and 58 Bcf short of exchange-traded
futures and 56 long and 62 short Bcf of OTC swaps and options.

The Company enters into speculative futures trades on a very limited basis for
purposes which include testing of hedging techniques. Company procedures contain
strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop-loss
requirements and net open positions limits (currently, a total of 100 net
contracts long or short). Speculative futures positions are marked to market at
the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in income
for that period. Net gains from such speculative activities for the year ended
December 31, 1995 were not material.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

In anticipation of issuing the 1995 Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 1995,
the Company entered into an interest rate lock on a notional amount of $50
million, linked to the ten-year U.S. Treasury Bill rate, with a creditworthy
counterparty to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates while it
completed the 1995 Senior Notes placement. At the time the Company terminated
the rate lock, interest rates had decreased, which resulted in the realization
of a $390,000 loss. The Company considered the loss to be a cost of obtaining
the privately placed debt and is therefore amortizing it over the ten-year term
of the 1995 Senior Notes.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the total notional principal amount of
outstanding interest rate swap agreements was $0 and $50 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes the results of the Company's interest rate swap
and foreign currency positions for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
the fair value of its financial instruments:

     Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable
Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, the carrying value
approximates the fair value.

     Short-term debt
The short-term debt is borrowed on a revolving basis at a variable interest
rate; as a result, the carrying value approximates the fair value of the
outstanding debt.

     Long-term debt
A portion of the long-term debt was borrowed under a revolving credit facility
which accrues interest at current rates; as a result, carrying value
approximates fair value. The remaining portion of the Company's long-term debt
is comprised of fixed rate facilities; for this portion, fair market value was
estimated using discounted cash flows based upon the Company's current borrowing
rates for debt with similar maturities.

     Financing Facilities

Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's variable rate Revolving Credit
Facility, as restated on September 2, 1994 and subsequently amended, with a
syndicate of eight banks, provides for a maximum borrowing base of $300 million,
of which $137.5 million was outstanding at December 31, 1995. If the facility
is not renewed, its commitment period will terminate on October 1, 1997. Any
outstanding balance thereunder at such time will convert to a three-year term
loan, which shall be payable in 12 equal quarterly installments, commencing
January 1, 1998. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's
option, at certain spreads over the Eurodollar rate, at the Federal Funds rate
plus .50%, or at the agent bank's prime rate. The interest rate spreads are
adjusted based on the Company's debt to capitalization ratio. At December 31,
1995, the spread was 1.25% over the Eurodollar rate, resulting in an interest
rate of 7.21%.

The Company pays a commitment fee on the unused commitment ranging from .15% to
 .375% based on the debt to capitalization ratio. At December 31, 1995, the
Company's debt to capitalization ratio was .58 to 1 resulting in a commitment
fee rate of .375%.

Term Loan Facility. The Company also has a Term Loan Facility with four banks
for $25 million which bears interest at 9.87%. Payments on the Term Loan
Facility of $12.5 million are due in September 1996 and September 1997,
respectively. The Company intends to finance the $12.5 million payment due in
1996 through amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility. The
agreements governing the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
(the "Credit Facilities Agreement") contain certain mandatory prepayment terms.
If funded debt of the Company, which has a final maturity on or before October
1, 2000,

exceeds four times (4.0 to 1.0) the sum of the Company's last four quarters'
cash flow (as defined in the agreement) less preferred stock dividends projected
to be paid during the next four quarters, the overage must be repaid in no more
than six monthly payments, commencing 90 days from notification. This mandatory
prepayment threshold will be reduced to 3.5 to 1.0 at September 1, 1998. At
December 31, 1995, taking into account all the covenants contained in the Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Company had approximately $50 million of available
borrowing capacity.

The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities are unsecured. Pursuant to the
Credit Facilities Agreement, the Company is required to maintain a current ratio
(as defined therein) of at least 1.0 to 1.0, a minimum tangible net worth equal
to the sum of $345.0 million plus 50% of consolidated net income earned after
June 30, 1995 plus 75% of the net proceeds received after June 30, 1995 from the
sale of equity securities, a debt to capitalization ratio (as defined therein)
of no more than 60% through October 31, 1996 and 55% thereafter, and an EBITDA
to interest ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.0 through October 31, 1996, 3.25 to
1.0 from November 1, 1996 through October 31, 1997 and 3.75 to 1.0 thereafter.
The Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on or after
December 31, 1995 that in the aggregate exceed the sum of $10 million plus 50%
of consolidated net income earned after December 31, 1995 plus 50% of the
cumulative net proceeds received by the Company after December 31, 1995 from the
sale of any equity securities. The dividends declared in the fourth fiscal
quarter of 1995, payable in 1996, are excluded from this calculation. At
December 31, 1995, $10 million was available under this limitation, which is
sufficient to pay required preferred stock dividends in 1996. The Company
generally utilizes excess daily funds to reduce any outstanding revolving credit
balances and associated interest expense and it intends to continue such
practice. The $5.8 million cash balance at December 31, 1995 is an overnight
investment necessitated by the timing of cash receipts.

Master Shelf Agreement. In December 1991, the Company entered into a Master
Shelf Agreement (the "Master Shelf") with The Prudential Insurance Company of
America ("Prudential") pursuant to which Prudential agreed to quote, from time-
to-time, an interest rate at which Prudential or its nominee would be willing to
purchase up to $100 million of the Company's senior promissory notes (the
"Master Notes"). Any such Master Notes will mature in no more than 12 years,
with an average life not in excess of 10 years, and are unsecured. The Master
Shelf contains certain financial covenants which substantially conform with
those contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, as restated and amended. In
July 1993 and July 1995, Prudential and the Company amended the Master Shelf to
provide for additional borrowing capacity (for a total borrowing capacity of
$200 million) and to extend the term of the Master Shelf to October 31, 1995.
The Master Shelf Agreement, as restated and amended, is fully utilized, as
indicated in the following table (000s):

1993 Senior Notes. On April 28, 1993 the Company sold $50 million of 7.65%
Senior Notes due 2003 to a group of insurance companies. Annual principal
payments of $7.1 million on the 1993 Senior Notes are due on April 30 of each
year from 1997 through 2002, with any remaining principal and interest
outstanding due on April 30, 2003. The 1993 Senior Notes contain certain
financial covenants that substantially conform with those contained in the
Master Shelf Agreement, as restated and amended.

1995 Senior Notes. The Company sold $42 million of 1995 Senior Notes to a group
of insurance companies in the fourth quarter of 1995, with an interest rate of
8.16% per annum and principal due in a single payment in December 2005. The 1995
Senior Notes contain certain financial covenants that conform with those
contained in the Master Shelf Agreement, as restated and amended. The Company
used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility.

Receivables Facility. In April 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with
Receivables Capital Corporation ("RCC"), as purchaser, and Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association ("BA"), as agent, pursuant to which the
Company will sell to RCC at face value on a revolving basis an undivided
interest in certain of the Company's trade receivables. As part of the sale, the
Company granted to RCC a security interest in such receivables. The Company may
sell up to $75 million of trade receivables under the Receivables Facility, at a
rate equal to RCC's commercial paper rate plus .375%, of which $75 million was
funded at a rate of 6.3% as of December 31, 1995. The Receivables Facility has a
364-day term and contains financial covenants similar to those in the Credit
Facilities Agreement, as restated and amended, along with certain covenants
regarding the quality of the trade receivables pool.

On September 2, 1994, in anticipation of entering into the Receivables Facility,
BA entered in a Master Note Agreement (the "Short-Term Note") with the Company
and advanced the Company $75 million at the Eurodollar rate plus .50%, which
resulted in an interest rate of 6.56% per annum at June 30, 1995. The Company
used the $75 million drawn on the Receivables Facility to repay the Short-Term
Note, which was then canceled.

COVENANT COMPLIANCE. At December 31, 1995, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants in its loan agreements.

Approximate future maturities of long-term debt at the date indicated are as

The Company believes that the carryforwards will be utilized prior to their
expiration because they are substantially offset by existing taxable temporary
differences reversing within the carryforward period or are expected to be
realized by achieving future profitable operations based on the Company's
dedicated and owned reserves, past earnings history, projections of future
earnings and current assets.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
- -----------------------------------------------

     Katy Condemnation

Commencing in March 1993 and continuing through July 1993, Western Gas Resources
Storage, Inc. ("Storage"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a
total of 165 condemnation actions in the County Court at Law No. 1 and No. 2 of
Fort Bend County, Texas, to obtain certain storage rights and rights-of-way
relating to its Katy Gas Storage Facility and the related underground reservoir
("Katy").  The County Court appointed panels of Special Commissioners which
awarded compensation to the owners whose rights were condemned.  Condemnation
awards are a capital cost of the Katy project.

A majority of the land and mineral owners involved in the condemnation
proceedings appealed to County Court, seeking a declaration that Storage did not
possess the right to condemn or, in the alternative, that they should be awarded
more compensation than previously awarded by the Special Commissioners.  In all
of those appeals, the right to condemn issue has been resolved in favor of
Storage, although factual issues in individual cases remain open as to whether
that right was exercised properly.

Trials in four of the appeals to County Court have now been concluded.  The
first trial involved a parcel adjacent to the 82 acre site where the compression
facilities are located, the second trial involved a parcel within 1,000 feet of
the 82 acre site, and the third and fourth trials involved parcels further than
one mile from the 82 acre site.  The jury verdicts compared with the awards of
the Special Commissioners were, respectively, as follows:  $214,000 versus
$2,000; $38,000 versus $600; $553 versus $553; and $1,000 versus $500.  The
Company believes that several reversible errors were committed in the first two
trials and appeals of those cases are now pending in the Texas Court of Appeals.

     Internal Revenue Service

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its examination of the
Company's returns for the years 1990 and 1991 and has proposed adjustments to
taxable income reflected in such returns which would shift the recognition of
certain items of income and expense from one year to another ("Timing
Adjustments").  To the extent taxable income in a prior year is increased by
proposed Timing Adjustments, taxable income may be reduced by a corresponding
amount in other years. However, the Company would incur an interest charge as a
result of such adjustment.  The Company currently is protesting certain of these
proposed adjustments through the IRS appeals process.  In the opinion of
management, adequate provision has been made for the additional income taxes and
interest which may result from the proposed adjustments. However, it is
reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution could result in an amount which
differs materially from amounts provided.

     Other

The Company is involved in various other litigation and administrative
proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of
management, any liabilities (net of insurance) that may result from these
claims, as well as the specific claim discussed above, will not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

NOTE 10 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
- --------------------------------

     Profit Sharing Plan

A discretionary profit sharing plan (a defined contribution plan) exists for all
Company employees meeting certain service requirements. The Company makes annual
contributions to the plan as determined by the Board of Directors and provides
for a match of 1% up to 4% of employee contributions. Contributions are made to
common/collective trusts for which Fidelity Management Trust Company acts as
trustee. The discretionary contributions were $1.3 million, $1.3 million and
$2.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The matching contributions were $227,000, $264,000 and $272,000
for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     $5.40 Stock Option Plan

In April 1987, the Partnership adopted an employee option plan ("$5.40 Plan")
that authorizes granting options to employees to purchase 430,000 common units
in the Partnership. Pursuant to the Restructuring, the Company assumed the
Partnership's obligation under the employee option plan. The plan was amended
upon the Restructuring to allow each holder of existing options to exercise such
options and acquire one share of common stock for each common unit they were
originally entitled to purchase. The exercise price and all other terms and
conditions for the exercise of such options issued under the amended plan were
the same as under the plan, except that the Restructuring accelerated the time
upon which certain options may be exercised. In February 1994, the Board of
Directors retroactively approved, adopted and ratified approximately 53,000
options granted to employees in excess of the 430,000 options originally
authorized. No additional options may be granted under this plan. Options may be
exercised only at the rate of 20% of the shares of common stock subject to such
option for each year of continuous service by the optionee commencing from the
later of July 2, 1987 or the optionee's employment commencement date. The
Company has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan to certain
key employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options, provided that the
Company will not loan in excess of 25% of the total amount available to the
employee in any one year. The Company will forgive any associated loan and
accrued interest on July 2, 1997, if the employee is then employed by the
Company. As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, loans and accrued interest related to
100,374 and 96,963 shares of common stock, respectively, totaling $637,000 and
$545,000, were outstanding under these terms.

     Key Employees' Incentive Stock Option Plan and Non-employee Director Stock
      Option Plan

Effective April 1987, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Key
Employees' Incentive Stock Option Plan ("Key Employee Plan") and a Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan ("Directors' Plan") that authorize the granting of
options to purchase 250,000 and 20,000 shares of the Company's common stock,
respectively Under the plans, each of these options became exercisable as to 25%
of the shares covered by it on the later of January 1, 1992 or one year from the
date of grant, subject to the continuation of the optionee's relationship with
the Company, and became exercisable as to an additional 25% of the covered
shares on the latter of each subsequent January 1 through 1995 or on each
subsequent date of grant anniversary, subject to the same condition. The Company
has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan certain key employees
an amount sufficient to exercise their options as each portion of their options
vests. The Company will forgive the associated loan and accrued interest if the
employee has been continuously employed by the Company for four years after the
date of each loan increment. As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, loans and accrued
interest related to 125,000 and 93,750 shares of common stock, respectively,
totaling $1.5 million and $1.1 million, were outstanding under these terms.

     1993 Stock Option Plan

The 1993 Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") became effective on May 24, 1993
after approval by the Company's stockholders. The 1993 Plan is intended to be an
incentive stock option plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company has reserved
1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of options under the
1993 Plan. The 1993 Plan will terminate on the earlier of March 28, 2003 or the
date on which all options granted under the 1993 Plan have been exercised in
full.

             NOTES TO COSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



The Board of Directors of the Company determines and designates from time to
time those employees of the Company to whom options are to be granted. If any
option terminates or expires prior to being exercised, the shares relating to
such option shall be released and may be subject to reissuance pursuant to a new
option. The Board of Directors has the right to, among other things, fix the
price, terms and conditions for the grant or exercise of any option. The
purchase price of the stock under each option shall be the fair market value of
the stock at the time such option is granted. Options granted will vest 20% each
year on the anniversary of the date of grant commencing with the first
anniversary. The employee must exercise the option within five years of the date
each portion vests. At December 31, 1995 approximately 170,344 options were
vested. No options have been exercised under the 1993 plan.

The following table summarizes the stock option activity under the Company's
employee benefit plans:

     Reserve Quantity Information
 
Reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the
estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future
rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of
such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering
and geological interpretation and judgement. Results of subsequent drilling,
testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of previous
estimates. Further, the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable
fluctuate with changes in prices and operating costs. Reserve estimates, by
their nature, are generally less precise than other financial statement
disclosures.
 
 The following table sets forth information for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993 with respect to changes in the Company's proved reserves,
 all of which are in the United States.  The Company has no significant
 undeveloped reserves.

     Standardized Measures of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

Estimated discounted future net cash flows and changes therein were determined
in accordance with SFAS No. 69.  Certain information concerning the assumptions
used in computing the valuation of proved reserves and their inherent
limitations are discussed below.  The Company believes such information is
essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data presented.

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas
relating to the Company's proven reserves to the year-end quantities of those
reserves.  Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by
contractual arrangements, including futures contracts, in existence at year-end.

The assumptions used to compute estimated future net revenues do not necessarily
reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues or costs, nor their
present worth.  In addition, variations from the expected production rate also
could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of the Company's
control, such as unintentional delays in development, changes in prices or

regulatory controls.  The reserve valuation further assumes that all reserves
will be disposed of by production.  However, if reserves are sold in place,
additional economic considerations could also affect the amount of cash
eventually realized.

Future development and production costs are computed by estimating the
expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas
reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions.

Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end
statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated,
to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the Company's proved oil and gas
reserves.  Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and
allowances are recognized.

An annual discount rate of 10% was used to reflect the timing of the future net
cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

Information with respect to the Company's estimated discounted future cash flows
from its oil and gas properties for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993 is as follows (000s):

                                 SENIOR NOTES
                                 ------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          The undersigned, Western Gas Resources, Inc. (the "COMPANY"), hereby
agrees with each Purchaser as follows:

          PARAGRAPH 1.  RESTATEMENT AND AMENDMENT; AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE OF
NOTES.

          1A.  RESTATEMENT AND AMENDMENT OF EXISTING AGREEMENT.  The Company and
Prudential entered into a Master Shelf Agreement dated as of December 19, 1991
as amended by Letter Amendment No. 1 dated October 22, 1992 (the "ORIGINAL
AGREEMENT").  On July 22, 1993, the Company and Prudential entered into an
Amended and Restated Master Shelf Agreement which Amended and Restated the
Original Agreement in its entirety.  Such Amended and Restated Master Shelf
Agreement has been amended by Letter Amendment No. 1 dated June 30, 1993, Letter
Amendment No. 2 dated August 31, 1994, Letter Amendment No. 3 dated April 1,
1995, Letter Amendment No. 4 dated July 28, 1995 and Letter Amendment No. 5
dated November 30, 1995. (The Amended and Restated Master Shelf Agreement, as
amended, is referred to herein as the "EXISTING AGREEMENT").  The Company has
issued to Prudential or Prudential Affiliates $200,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of Senior Notes pursuant to the Existing Agreement.  The Company and
Prudential are entering into this Agreement to, among other things, incorporate
the amendments into the agreement and amend other provisions of the Existing
Agreement. Accordingly, the Company, Prudential and each Purchaser agrees that
the Existing Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as
provided in this Agreement.

          1B.  AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE OF NOTES.  The Company has authorized and
issued 
<PAGE>
 
its senior promissory notes (the "NOTES") in the aggregate principal amount of
$200,000,000, dated the date of issue thereof, maturing, in the case of each
Note so issued, no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance 
thereof (with an average life not in excess of 10 years), bearing interest on
the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and
having such other particular terms, as set forth, in the case of each Note so
issued, in the Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to such Note delivered
pursuant to paragraph 2F, and substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached
hereto.  The term "NOTES" as used herein shall include each Note delivered
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and each Note delivered in
substitution or exchange for any such Note pursuant to any such provision.  
Notes which have (i) the same final maturity, (ii) the same installment payment
                  -                            --                              
dates, (iii) the same installment payment amounts (as a percentage of the
        ---                                                              
original principal amount of each Note), (iv) the same interest rate, and (v)
                                          --                               - 
the same interest payment periods, are herein called a "SERIES" of Notes.
                                                                          
Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings specified in paragraph 10.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

          PARAGRAPH 2.   PURCHASE AND SALE OF NOTES.

          2A.  FACILITY.  Prudential is willing to consider, in its sole
discretion and within limits which may be authorized for purchase by Prudential
and Prudential Affiliates from time to time, the purchase of Notes pursuant to
this Agreement.  The willingness of Prudential to consider such purchase of
Notes is herein called the "FACILITY".  At any time, the aggregate principal
amount of Notes stated in paragraph 1, minus (i) the aggregate principal amount
                                       -----                                   
of Notes purchased and sold pursuant to this Agreement prior to such time
(including the Existing Notes) and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of
Accepted Notes which have not yet been purchased and sold hereunder prior to
such time, is herein called the "AVAILABLE FACILITY AMOUNT" at such time.
Notwithstanding the willingness of Prudential to consider purchases of Notes,
this Agreement is entered into on the express understanding that neither
Prudential nor any other Prudential Affiliate shall be obligated to make or
accept offers to purchase Notes, or to quote rates, spreads or other terms with
respect to specific purchases of Notes, and the Facility shall in no way be
construed as a capital commitment by Prudential or any other Prudential
Affiliate.

          2B.  ISSUANCE PERIOD.  Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this
Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Termination Date (or if such day is not a
Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such day) and (ii) the thirtieth
day after Prudential shall have given to the Company, or the Company shall have
given to Prudential, a notice stating that it elects to terminate the issuance
and sale of Notes pursuant to this Agreement (or if such thirtieth day is not a
Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such thirtieth day).  The period
during which Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement is herein
called the "ISSUANCE PERIOD".  The "TERMINATION DATE" shall be October 31, 1995.

          2C.  SPREAD INFORMATION.  Upon request by the Company on any Business
Day during the Issuance Period if there is an Available Facility Amount on such
Business Day, Prudential will, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide to
the Company information (by telecopier or telephone) with respect to various
spreads at which Prudential or Prudential Affiliates might be interested in
purchasing Notes of different average lives.  The amount and content of

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
information so provided shall be in the sole discretion of Prudential, but it is
the intent of Prudential to provide information which will be of use to the
Company in determining whether to initiate procedures for use of the Facility.
Information so provided shall not constitute an offer to purchase Notes, and
neither Prudential nor any other Prudential Affiliate shall be obligated to
purchase Notes at the spreads specified.  Information so provided shall be
representative of potential interest only for the period commencing on the day
such information is provided and ending on the earlier of the fifth Business Day
after such day and the first day after such day on which further spread
information is provided.  Prudential may suspend or terminate providing
information pursuant to this paragraph 2C if, in its sole discretion, it
determines that there has been an adverse change in the credit quality of the
Company after the date of this Agreement.

          2D.  REQUEST FOR PURCHASE.  The Company may from time to time during
the Issuance Period make requests for purchases of Notes (each such request
being a "REQUEST FOR PURCHASE").  Each Request for Purchase shall be made to
Prudential by telecopier and confirmed by nationwide overnight delivery service,
and shall (i) specify the aggregate principal amount of Notes covered thereby,
which shall not be less than $10,000,000 and not be greater than the Available
Facility Amount at the time such Request for Purchase is made, (ii) specify the
principal amounts, final maturities, and installment payment dates and amounts
of the Notes covered thereby, (iii) specify the use of proceeds of such Notes,
(iv) specify the proposed day for the closing of the purchase and sale of such
Notes, which shall be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than 10
Business Days and not more than 25 Business Days after the making of such
Request for Purchase, (v) specify the number of the account and the name and
address of the depository institution to which the purchase prices of such Notes
are to be transferred on the Closing Day for such purchase and sale, (vi)
certify that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph 8 are
true on and as of the date of such Request for Purchase except to the extent of
changes caused by the transactions herein contemplated and that there exists on
the date of such Request for Purchase no Event of Default or Default, and (vii)
be substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto.  Each Request for
Purchase shall be in writing and shall be deemed made when received by
Prudential.

          2E.  RATE QUOTES.  Not later than five Business Days after the Company
shall have given Prudential a Request for Purchase pursuant to paragraph 2D,
Prudential may provide (by telephone promptly thereafter confirmed by
telecopier, in each case no earlier than 9:30 A.M. and no later than 1:00 P.M.
New York City local time) interest rate quotes for the several principal
amounts, maturities and installment payment schedules (for Notes with average
lives not to exceed 10 years) of Notes specified in such Request for Purchase.
Each quote shall represent, the fixed interest rate per annum, payable on the
outstanding principal balance of such Notes until such balance shall have become
due and payable, at which Prudential would be willing to purchase such Notes at
100% of the principal amount thereof.

          2F.  ACCEPTANCE.  Within 30 minutes after Prudential shall have
provided any interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph 2E or such shorter
period as Prudential may specify to the Company at any time, including the time
at which the rate is quoted (such period being the "ACCEPTANCE WINDOW"), the
Company may, subject to paragraph 2G, elect to accept such interest 

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
rate quotes as to not less than $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Notes specified in the related Request for Purchase. Such election shall be made
by an Authorized Officer of the Company notifying Prudential by telephone or
telecopier within the Acceptance Window (but not earlier than 9:30 A.M. or later
than 2:00 P.M., New York City local time) that the Company elects to accept such
interest rate quotes, specifying the Notes (each such Note being an "ACCEPTED
NOTE") as to which such acceptance (an "ACCEPTANCE") relates. The day the
Company gives, and Prudential receives, notice of an Acceptance with respect to
any Accepted Notes is herein called the "ACCEPTANCE DAY" for such Accepted
Notes. Any interest rate quotes as to which Prudential does not receive an
Acceptance within the Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of
Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes.
Subject to paragraph 2G and the other terms and conditions hereof, (i) the
Company agrees to sell to Prudential or a Prudential Affiliate, and Prudential
agrees to purchase, or to cause the purchase by a Prudential Affiliate of, the
Accepted Notes (the "PRUDENTIAL ACCEPTED NOTES") as to which interest rate
quotes shall have been provided to the Company for purchases by Prudential or
Prudential Affiliates at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes. Prior to
the close of business on the Business Day next following the Acceptance Day, the
Company and Prudential will execute a confirmation of such Acceptance
substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (a "CONFIRMATION OF
ACCEPTANCE").

          2G.  MARKET DISRUPTION.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
2F, if Prudential shall have provided interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph
2E and thereafter prior to the time notice of an Acceptance with respect to such
quotes shall have been received by Prudential in accordance with paragraph 2F
there shall occur a general suspension, material limitation, or significant
disruption of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or
in the market for U.S. Treasury securities and other financial instruments, then
such interest rate quotes shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Notes
hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes.  If the
Company thereafter notifies Prudential of the Acceptance of any such interest
rate quotes, such Acceptance shall be ineffective for all purposes of this
Agreement, and Prudential shall promptly notify the Company that the provisions
of this paragraph 2G are applicable with respect to such Acceptance.

          2H.  CLOSING.  Not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City local time) on
the Closing Day for any Accepted Notes, the Company will deliver to each
Purchaser listed in the Confirmation of Acceptance relating thereto at the
offices of Prudential Capital Group, 1201 Elm St., Suite 4900, Dallas, Texas
75270 the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser in the form of a single
Accepted Note for the Accepted Notes which have exactly the same terms (or such
greater number of Notes in authorized denominations as such Purchaser may
request) dated the Closing Day and registered in such Purchaser's name (or in
the name of its nominee), against payment of the purchase price thereof by
transfer of immediately available funds for credit to the Company's account
specified in the Request for Purchase of such Notes.  If the Company fails to
tender to any Purchaser the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser on
the scheduled Closing Day for such Accepted Notes as provided above in this
paragraph 2H, or any of the conditions specified in paragraph 3 shall not have
been fulfilled by the time required on such scheduled Closing Day, the Company

Day notify such Purchaser in writing whether (x) such closing is to be
                                              -                       
rescheduled (such rescheduled date to

Delayed Delivery Fee in accordance with paragraph 2I(2) or (y) such closing is 
                                                            -

Purchaser may at its election, at any time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local
time, on such scheduled Closing Day, notify the Company in writing that such
closing is to be canceled as provided in paragraph 2I(3).

          2I.  FEES.

          2I(1)  FACILITY FEE.  The Company paid to Prudential in immediately
available funds a fee (the "FACILITY FEE") on each Closing Day, in an amount
equal to  (i) .30% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold on such
Closing Day for the first $150,000,000 of Notes issued pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) .10% of the aggregated principal amount of Notes sold on such
Closing Day with respect to the remaining $50,000,000 of Notes issued pursuant
to this Agreement.

          2I(2)  DELAYED DELIVERY FEE.  If the closing of the purchase and sale
of any Accepted Note is delayed for any reason (other than, with respect to any
Accepted Note, because the Purchaser of such Accepted Note is prohibited by law
from purchasing an Accepted Note or the Purchaser of such Accepted Notes shall
request a delay in writing) beyond the original Closing Day for such Accepted
Note, the Company will pay to the Purchaser which shall have agreed to purchase
such Accepted Note, on the last Business Day of each calendar month, commencing
with the first such day to occur more than 30 days after the Acceptance Day for
such Accepted Note and ending with the last such day to occur prior to the
Cancellation Date or the actual closing date of such purchase and sale, and on
the Cancellation Date or actual closing date of such purchase and sale (if such
Cancellation Date or closing date occurs more than 30 days after the Acceptance
Day for such Accepted Note), a fee (the "DELAYED DELIVERY FEE") equal to the
product of (i) the amount determined by Prudential to be the amount by which the
            -                                                                   
bond equivalent yield per annum of such Accepted Note exceeds the average
investment rate per annum on alternative investments (this rate (on a bond
equivalent basis) would be, as of the date of this Agreement, the 30-60-90 day
Commercial Paper rate for Prudential, with the exact period being a function of
the actual number of days elapsed) having a maturity date or dates the same as,
or closest to, the Rescheduled Closing Day or Rescheduled Closing Days from time
to time fixed for the delayed delivery of such Accepted Note, (ii) the principal
                                                               --               
amount of such Accepted Note, and (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is
                                   ---                                      
equal to the number of actual days elapsed from and including the 31st day after
the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note (in the case of the first such payment
with respect to such Accepted Note) or from and including the date of the next
preceding payment (in the case of any subsequent payment with respect to such
Accepted Note) to but excluding the date of such payment, and the denominator of
which is 360.  In no case shall the Delayed Delivery Fee be less than zero.
Nothing contained herein shall obligate any Purchaser to purchase any Accepted
Note on any day other than the Closing Day for such Accepted Note, as the same
may be rescheduled from time to time in compliance with paragraph 2H.

          2I(3)  CANCELLATION FEE.  If the Company at any time notifies the
Purchaser obligated to purchase any Accepted Note in writing that the Company is
canceling the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note, or if the
Purchaser obligated to purchase any Accepted Note notifies the Company in
writing under the circumstances set forth in the last sentence of paragraph 2H
that the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note is to be
canceled, or if the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note is
not consummated on or prior to the last day of the Issuance Period (the date of
any such notification, or the last day of the Issuance Period, as the case may
be, being the "CANCELLATION DATE"), the Company will, upon demand by such
Purchaser pay such Purchaser in immediately available funds an amount (the
"CANCELLATION FEE") equal to the price increase described in the next sentence
(the "PRICE MOVEMENT") divided by 100 and multiplied by the principal amount of
such Accepted Note.  The Price Movement (expressed in decimals) shall be
calculated by subtracting (a) the bid price at the time of the Acceptance on the
                           -                                                    
Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note of U.S. Treasury securities having a
maturity equal to or closest to the average life of such Accepted Note (as
determined by Prudential) as reported on the display designated as "Page 678" on
the Telerate Service (or such other display as may replace Page 678 on the
Telerate Service), from (b) the ask price at 10:00 A.M. (New York City local
                         -                                                  
time) on the Cancellation Date of such U.S. Treasury securities (as determined
by Prudential in (a) above) as reported on the display designated as "Page 678"
on the Telerate Service (or such other display as may replace Page 678 on the
Telerate Service).  Each price shall be based on a U.S. Treasury security having
a par value of $100.00 and shall be rounded to the second decimal place.  In no
case shall the Cancellation Fee be less than zero.

          2I(4)  STRUCTURING FEE.  The Company paid Prudential a structuring fee
of $75,000 on October 18, 1991 for structuring the Facility.

          2I(5)  EXTENSION FEE.  The Company paid Prudential the first $50,000
installment of the extension fee on June 4, 1993 for extending the Facility.

the Company shall apply to the prepayment of the Notes of such Series, without
premium, the principal amounts specified, if any, in each Note of such Series
and such principal amounts of such Notes, together with interest thereon to the

date.

          4D.  APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS.  In the case of each partial
prepayment pursuant to paragraph 4A or 4B of all outstanding Notes of any
Series, the principal amount to be prepaid shall be allocated to all Notes of
such Series at the time outstanding (including, for the purpose of this
paragraph 4D only, all Notes prepaid or otherwise retired or purchased or
otherwise acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other
than by prepayment pursuant to paragraph 4A or 4B) in proportion to the
respective outstanding principal amounts thereof.

or indirectly, Notes held by any holder unless the Company or such Subsidiary or
Affiliate shall have offered to prepay or otherwise retire or purchase or

outstanding upon the same terms and conditions.  Any Notes so prepaid or
otherwise retired or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or 

                                      -9-

continuance of such Event of Default, by notice in writing to the Company,

immediately due and payable together with interest accrued thereon and together

limitation, notice of intent to accelerate), all of which are hereby waived by

              -                                                           
Holder(s) of the Notes of any Series may at its or their option during the
continuance of such Event of Default, by notice in writing to the Company,
declare all of the Notes of such Series to be, and all of the Notes of such
Series shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together with

                                                                 -             
shall have been declared to be due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c)
above, any holder of any other Note may at any time thereafter, regardless of
whether any Event of Default shall at such time be continuing, by notice in
writing to the Company, declare all of the Notes held by such holder to be, and
all of the Notes held by such holder shall thereupon be and become, immediately
due and payable together with interest accrued thereon and together with the
Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect to each such Note, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (including, without
limitation, notice of intent to accelerate), all of which are hereby waived by
the Company.  The Company acknowledges and the parties hereto agree, that the
holder of each Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free
from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and
the provisions for payment of the Yield-Maintenance Amount by the Company in the
event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of
Default, are intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right
under such circumstances.

          7B.  RESCISSION OF ACCELERATION.  At any time after any or all of the
Notes of any Series are declared immediately due and payable and have not been
paid in full, the Required Holder(s) of such Series of Notes may, by notice in
writing to the Company, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences
if (i) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, the principal of
and Yield Maintenance Amount, if any, payable with respect to any Notes which
have become due otherwise than by reason of such declaration, and interest on
such overdue interest and overdue principal and Yield-Maintenance Amount at the
rate specified in the Notes, (ii) all Events 

                                     -26-
<PAGE>
 
of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts which have become due
solely by reason of such declaration have been cured or waived pursuant to
paragraph 11C, and (iii) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment
of any monies due pursuant to the Notes or this Agreement. No such rescission or
annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default
or impair any right arising therefrom.

          7C.  NOTICE OF ACCELERATION OR RESCISSION.  Whenever any Note shall be
declared immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph 7A or any such
declaration shall be rescinded and annulled pursuant to paragraph 7B, the
Company shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the holder of each Note
at the time outstanding.

          7D.  OTHER REMEDIES.  If any Event of Default or Default shall occur
and be continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights under this Agreement and such Note by exercising such remedies as are
available to such holder in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement.  No remedy conferred in this
Agreement upon the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

          PARAGRAPH 8.   REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES.

          8.   REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES.  The Company
represents, covenants and warrants as follows:

          8A.  ORGANIZATION.  The Company is a corporation duly organized and
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, each
Subsidiary is duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, and the Company has and each
Subsidiary has the corporate power to own its respective property and to carry
on its respective business as now being conducted.  The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Notes are within the
Company's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action.

          8B.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The Company has furnished each Purchaser
of any Accepted Notes with the following financial statements, identified by a
principal financial officer of the Company:  (i) a consolidated balance sheet of
                                              -                                 
the Company and its Subsidiaries as at December 31 in each of the three fiscal
years of the Company most recently completed prior to the date as of which this
representation is made or repeated to such Purchaser (other than fiscal years
completed within 90 days prior to such date for which audited financial
statements have not been released) and a consolidated statement of income and
statement of cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for each such year,
all certified by the Company's then-current nationally recognized independent
auditing firm; and (ii) consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
                    --                                                    
Subsidiaries 

                                     -27-
<PAGE>
 
as at the end of the quarterly period (if any) most recently completed prior to
such date and after the end of such fiscal year (other than quarterly periods
completed within 45 days prior to such date for which financial statements have
not been released) and the comparable quarterly period in the preceding fiscal
year and consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flows for the
periods from the beginning of the fiscal years in which such quarterly periods
are included to the end of such quarterly periods, prepared by the Company. Such
financial statements (including any related schedules and/or notes) are true and
correct in all material respects (subject, as to interim statements, to changes
resulting from audits and year-end adjustments), have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently followed
(except as set forth in the notes thereto if consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards) throughout the
periods involved and show all liabilities, direct and contingent, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries required to be shown in accordance with such principles.
The balance sheets fairly present the condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and the statements of income and
statements of cash flows fairly present the results of the operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated. There has been no
material adverse change in the business, condition or operations (financial or
otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole since the end of
the most recent fiscal year for which such audited financial statements have
been furnished.

          8C.  ACTIONS PENDING.  There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, by or before any court, arbitrator or administrative
or governmental body which might result in any material adverse change in the
business, condition or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.  There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending or
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which purports to
affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Note.

          8D.  OUTSTANDING DEBT.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has outstanding any Debt except as permitted by paragraph 6C(2).
There exists no default under the provisions of any instrument evidencing such
Debt or of any agreement relating thereto.

          8E.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.  The Company and its Subsidiaries and
all of their respective properties and facilities have complied at all times and
in all respects with all federal, state, local and regional statutes, laws,
ordinances and judicial and administrative orders, judgments, rulings and
regulations relating to protection of the environment except, in any such case,
where failure to comply would not result in a material adverse effect on the
business, condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          8F.  TAXES.  The Company has and each of its Subsidiaries has filed
all Federal, State and other income tax returns which, to the best knowledge of
the officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are required to be filed, and
each has paid all taxes as shown on such returns and on all assessments received
by it to the extent that such taxes have become due, except such taxes as are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves 

                                     -28-
<PAGE>
 
have been established in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

          8G.  CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS.  Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or subject
to any charter or other corporate restriction which materially and adversely
affects its business, property or assets, or financial condition.  Neither the
execution nor delivery of this Agreement or the Notes, nor the offering,
issuance and sale of the Notes, nor fulfillment of nor compliance with the terms
and provisions hereof and of the Notes will conflict with, or result in a breach
of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to,
the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any award of
any arbitrator or any agreement (including any agreement with stockholders),
instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject.  Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise subject to any provision
contained in, any instrument evidencing indebtedness of the Company or such
Subsidiary, any agreement relating thereto or any other contract or agreement
(including its charter) which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes
restrictions on the incurring of, Debt of the Company of the type to be
evidenced by the Notes except as set forth in the agreements listed in Exhibit E
attached hereto.

          8H.  OFFERING OF NOTES.  Neither the Company nor any agent acting on
its behalf has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes or any similar
security of the Company for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy the Notes or
any similar security of the Company from, or otherwise approached or negotiated
with respect thereto with, any Person other than institutional investors, and
neither the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take
any action which would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the
provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act or to the provisions of any
securities or Blue Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.

          8I.  REGULATION G, ETC.   The proceeds of the sale of the Notes will
be used to refinance existing indebtedness or for general corporate purposes.
None of the proceeds of the sale of any Notes will be used, directly or
indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of
purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined in Regulation G (12 CFR
Part 207) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (herein called
"margin stock") or for the purpose of maintaining, reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any stock that
is then currently a margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute
the purchase of such Notes a "purpose credit" within the meaning of such
Regulation G, unless the Company shall have delivered to the Purchaser which is
purchasing such Notes, on the Closing Day for such Notes, an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to such Purchaser stating that the purchase of such Notes does not
constitute a violation of such Regulation G.  After applying the proceeds of the
sale of the Notes, not more than 25% of the value of the assets subject to the
terms of paragraph 5C, 6C(1), 6C(4) or 6C(5) will be "margin stock."  Neither
the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action
which might cause this Agreement or the Notes to violate Regulation G,
Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or
as the same may hereafter be in effect.

          8J.  ERISA.  No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section
302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan).  No liability to the PBGC
has been or is expected by the Company to be incurred with respect to any Plan
(other than a Multiemployer Plan) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which is or would be materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
or presently expects to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA
with respect to any Multiemployer Plan which is or would be materially adverse
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  No Plan providing welfare
benefits to retired former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has been established or is maintained for which the present value of future
benefits payable, in excess of irrevocably designated funds for such purpose, is
materially adverse to the financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  Either PTE 84-14 or PTE 90-1 applies to the
purchase of the Notes to be purchased by the Purchasers, and the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes will not
involve any transaction which is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of
ERISA or in connection with which a penalty could be imposed under section
502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.
The representation by the Company in the next preceding sentence is made in
reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your representation in paragraph
9B.

          8K.  GOVERNMENTAL CONSENT.  Neither the nature of the Company or of
any Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any
relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
other action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental or regulatory body (other than routine filings after the Closing
Day for any Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue
Sky authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes or fulfillment
of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes.

          8L.  TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  The Company has and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and defensible title to its respective real properties
(other than properties which it leases) and good title to all of its other
respective properties and assets, including the properties and assets reflected
in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in paragraph 8B (other than
properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business), subject
to no Lien of any kind except Liens permitted by paragraph 6C(1) except that (i)
with respect to easements and rights of way associated with the Company's gas
gathering systems:  (a) the Company has such title as is customary and
appropriate in accordance with applicable industry standards and (b) the costs
of curing defects in such title, if any, would not exceed $10,000,000 in the
aggregate and (ii) no representation or warranty is made with respect to any gas
or mineral property or interest to which no proved oil or gas reserves are
properly attributed.  All leases necessary in any material respect for the
conduct of the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect.

          8M.  HOSTILE TENDER OFFERS.  None of the proceeds of the sale of any
Notes will 

                                     -30-
<PAGE>
 
be used to finance a Hostile Tender Offer.

          8N.  DISCLOSURE.  Neither this Agreement nor the Offering Materials
nor any other document, certificate or statement furnished to any Purchaser by
or on behalf of the Company in connection herewith contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained herein and therein not misleading.  There is no fact
peculiar to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which materially adversely
affects or in the future may (so far as the Company can now foresee) materially
adversely affect the business, property or assets, or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and which has not been set forth
in this Agreement or with respect to any Purchaser, in the Offering Materials
furnished to such Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company prior to the Request
for Purchase of the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser.  The
financial projections contained in the Offering Materials are reasonable based
on the assumptions stated therein and the best information available to the
officers of the Company.

          8O.  DELIVERY OF NCNB AGREEMENT.  The Company has delivered to each
Purchaser prior to the date hereof a true, correct and complete copy of the NCNB
Agreement, including all amendments and waivers of any provision thereof.

          8P.  PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT; FEDERAL POWER ACT.  Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company"

in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or, except for
                                                                   ------

                                              --                             
all of the Purchasers which shall have become obligated to purchase Accepted
Notes of any Series (and not without the written consent of all such
Purchasers), any of the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 may be amended or
waived insofar as such amendment or waiver would affect only rights or
obligations with respect to the purchase and sale of the Accepted Notes of such
Series or the terms and provisions of such Accepted Notes.  Each holder of any
Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent
authorized by this paragraph 11C, whether or not such Note shall have been
marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may bear a
notation referring to any such consent.  No course of dealing between the

and references thereto shall mean this Amended and Restated Master Shelf
Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

          11D. FORM, REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES; LOST NOTES.
The Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in denominations of
at least $100,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any principal amount
not evenly divisible by $100,000.  The Company shall keep at its principal
office a register in which the Company shall provide for the registration of
Notes and of transfers of Notes.  Upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Note at the principal office of the Company, the Company shall, at its
expense, execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of a like
aggregate principal amount, registered in the name of such transferee or
transferees; provided that the Company shall not be required to register any
             --------                                                       
transfer that was made in violation of the legend appearing on such Note.  At
the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be exchanged for other Notes
of like tenor and of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal
amount, upon surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the principal office of
the Company.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company
shall, at its expense, execute and deliver the Notes which the holder making the
exchange is entitled to receive.  Each installment of principal payable on each
installment date upon each new Note issued upon any such transfer or exchange
shall be in the same proportion to the unpaid principal amount of such new Note
as the installment of principal payable on such date on the Note surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange bore to the unpaid principal amount of such
Note.  No reference need be made in any such new Note to any installment or
installments of principal previously due and paid upon the Note surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange. Every Note surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed, by the holder of such Note or such
holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.  Any Note or Notes issued in
exchange for any Note or upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid
interest and interest to accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged or
transferred, so that neither gain nor loss of interest shall result from any
such transfer or exchange.  Upon receipt of written notice from the holder of
any Note of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Note and, in the
case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of such holder's
unsecured indemnity agreement, or in the case of any such mutilation upon
surrender and cancellation of such Note, the Company will make and deliver a new
Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.

          11E. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS; PARTICIPATIONS.  Prior to due presentment
for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in whose name any
Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payment of principal of and interest on and any Yield-Maintenance
Amount payable with respect to such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the Company shall not be affected
by notice to the contrary.  Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any
Note may from time to time grant participations in all or any part of such Note
to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder
in its sole and absolute discretion.

delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the transfer by any Purchaser of any
Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may
be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of any investigation made at any
time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any Transferee.  Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

holder's investment in such Note; PROVIDED THAT PRIOR TO DISCLOSING CONFIDENTIAL

same proportion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by each other
holder of Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions.  Any
Notes so prepaid or otherwise retired or purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall not be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose under this Agreement, except as provided in
paragraph 4C.

          Company's major bank credit facility; and

                (vii)    as soon as practicable after receipt thereof, a copy of
          each other report submitted to the Company by independent accountants

<PAGE>
 
                (viii)   with reasonable promptness, such other information as
          the holder of any Note may reasonably request.

Together with each delivery of financial statements required by clauses (i) and
(ii) above, the Company will deliver to the holder of each Note an Officer's
Certificate demonstrating (with computations in reasonable detail) compliance by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with the provisions of paragraphs 6A(l), 6A(2),
6A(3), 6A(4), 6B, 6C(l), 6C(2), 6C(3), 6C(4), 6C(5), 6C(6), and 6C(7) and
stating that there exists no Event of Default or Default, or, if any Event of
Default or Default exists, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof
and what action the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.  Together
with each delivery of financial statements required by clause (ii) above, the
Company will deliver to the holder of each Note a certificate of such
accountants stating that, in making the audit necessary to the certification of
such financial statements, they have obtained no knowledge of any Event of
Default or Default, or, if they have obtained knowledge of any Event of Default
or Default, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof.  Such
accountants, however, shall not be liable to anyone by reason of their failure
to obtain knowledge of any Event of Default or Default which would not be
disclosed in the course of an audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.

          The Company also covenants that forthwith upon the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer, Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice
President-General Counsel, Treasurer or President of the Company obtaining
knowledge of an Event of Default or Default, it will deliver to the holder of
each Note an Officer's Certificate specifying the nature and period of existence
thereof and what action the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.

          5B. INSPECTION OF PROPERTY.  The Company will permit any Person
designated by the holder of any Note in writing, at such holder's expense, to
visit and inspect any of the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries

corporate books and financial records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
make copies thereof or extracts therefrom and to discuss the affairs, finances
and accounts of any of such corporations with the principal officers of the
Company and its independent public accountants, all at such reasonable times and
as often as such holder may reasonably  request, PROVIDED, that each Person so
designated by any holder to visit and inspect any properties shall, by virtue of
such designation, be deemed to have agreed to comply with the Company's on-site
safety procedures that are applicable to such properties.  If at the time of any
such inspection a Default or an Event of Default exists, the Company shall pay
all reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by each holder in connection with
such inspection.

          5C. COVENANT TO SECURE NOTES EQUALLY.  The Company covenants that,
if it or any Subsidiary shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its property
or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than Liens permitted
by the provisions of paragraph 6C(l) (unless prior written consent to the
creation or assumption thereof shall have been obtained pursuant to paragraph
11C), it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby the Notes
will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all other Debt
thereby secured so long as any

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
such other Debt shall be so secured pursuant to such agreements and instruments
as shall be approved by the Required Holder(s), and the Company will cause to be
delivered to each holder of a Note an opinion of independent counsel to the
effect that such agreements and instruments are enforceable in accordance with
their terms, and in any such case the Notes shall have the benefit, to the full
extent that, and with such priority as, the holders of Notes may be entitled
under applicable law, of an equitable Lien on such property or assets securing
the Notes.  A violation of paragraph 6C(1) will constitute an Event of Default
hereunder, whether or not any such provision is made pursuant to this paragraph
5C.

          5D. AGREEMENT ASSUMING LIABILITY ON NOTES.  The Company covenants
that, if at any time any Person should become liable (as co-obligor, endorser,
guarantor or surety), on any other obligation of the Company or any obligation
of any Subsidiary (other than (i) obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business evidencing guaranties of gas purchases, transportation fees and
construction contracts, (ii) surety bonds, appeal bonds and construction bonds
(including bonds necessary for right-of-way condemnation and bonds issuable upon
appeals of judgments or in relation to injunctions or temporary restraining
orders) incurred in the ordinary course of business, (iii) letter of credit
reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit issued in the
ordinary course of business but not for borrowed money, and (iv) endorsements of
negotiable instruments for collection in the ordinary course of business), the
Company will, at the same time, cause such Person to deliver to each holder of
Notes an agreement as shall be approved by Required Holder(s) pursuant to which
such Person becomes similarly liable on the Notes.

          5E. NOTICE OF MATERIAL EVENTS.  The Company will promptly notify the
holder of each Note of (i) any material adverse change in the Company's
business, property or assets, financial condition or results of operations or
the Company's consolidated business, property or assets, financial condition or
results of operations, (ii) the acceleration of the maturity of any Debt owed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any default by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under any indenture, mortgage, agreement, contract or other
instrument to which any of them is a party or by which any of them or any of
their properties is bound, if such acceleration or default would have a material
adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated business, property or assets,
financial condition or results of operations, (iii) any material adverse claim
(or any claim of $5,000,000 or more) asserted against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to the Company's or any Subsidiary's properties,
(iv) the occurrence of any Termination Event or of any event or condition known
to the Company which might adversely affect the enforceability of this Agreement
or any Note and (v) the filing of any suit or proceeding against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in which an adverse decision could have a material
adverse effect upon the Company's or any Subsidiary's business, property or
assets, financial condition, or results of operations. Upon the occurrence of
any of the foregoing the Company will, and will cause each such Subsidiary to,
take all necessary or appropriate steps to remedy promptly any such material
adverse change, Default, Event of Default or default, to protect against any
such adverse claim, to defend any such suit or proceeding, to remedy any such
Termination Event or event affecting enforceability, and to resolve all
controversies on account of any of the foregoing.

obligation to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties is

          the use thereof in the operation of its business,

                (iii)    Liens on property or assets of a Subsidiary to secure

          and (c) such amounts remain unpaid for more than 30 days after the due
          date of the installment referred to in clause (a); or

                (xv)     the Company or any of its Affiliates as employer under

          obligations or rights commences to occur under any such facility
          without a replacement facility (on terms consistent with those set
          forth in paragraph 6C(9)) being effective to provide for replacement
          funding therefor;

then (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (viii), (ix)

or (x) of this paragraph 7A with respect to the Company, all of the Notes at the
time outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable together
with interest accrued thereon and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect to each such Note, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (including, without
limitation, notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration of
maturity), all of which are hereby waived by the Company,

                                      22
<PAGE>
 
(b) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (ii) of this
- ---                                                                             
paragraph 7A, the holder of any Note (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as to which such an Event of Default shall have
occurred may at its option during the continuance of such Event of Default, by
notice in writing to the Company, declare such Note to be, and such Note shall
thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together with interest
accrued thereon and together with, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect to each such Note, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (including, without
limitation, notice of intent to accelerate), all of which are hereby waived by
the Company, (c) if such event is any other Event of Default, the Required
             ---                                                          
Holder(s) may at its or their option during the continuance of such Event of
Default, by notice in writing to the Company, declare all of the Notes to be,
and all of the Notes shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable
together with interest accrued thereon and together with, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect
to each Note, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind
(including, without limitation, notice of intent to accelerate), all of which
are hereby waived by the Company, and (d) if any Note shall have been declared
                                      ---                                     
to be due and payable pursuant to clause (b) above, any holder of any other Note
may at any time thereafter, so long as the Event of Default described in clause
(b) above shall at such time be continuing, by notice in writing to the Company,
declare all of the Notes held by such holder to be, and all of the Notes held by
such holder shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together
with interest accrued thereon and together with, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect to each such
Note, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (including,
without limitation, notice of intent to accelerate), all of which are hereby
waived by the Company.  The Company acknowledges and the parties hereto agree,
that the holder of each Note has the right to maintain its investment in the
Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided
for) and the provisions for payment of the Yield-Maintenance Amount by the
Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result
of an Event of Default, are intended to provide compensation for the deprivation
of such right under such circumstances.

          7B. RESCISSION OF ACCELERATION.  At any time after any or all of the
Notes are declared immediately due and payable and have not been paid in full,
the Required Holder(s) may, by notice in writing to the Company, rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if (i) the Company has paid all
overdue interest on the Notes, the principal of and Yield-Maintenance Amount, if
any, payable with respect to any Notes which have become due otherwise than by
reason of such declaration, and interest on such overdue interest and overdue
principal and Yield-Maintenance Amount at the rate specified in the Notes, (ii)
all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts which have
become due solely by reason of such declaration have been cured or waived
pursuant to paragraph 11C, and (iii) no judgment or decree has been entered for
the payment of any monies due pursuant to the Notes or this Agreement. No such
rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event of
Default or Default or impair any right arising therefrom.

                                      23
<PAGE>
 
          7C.  NOTICE OF ACCELERATION OR RESCISSION.  Whenever any Note shall
be declared immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph 7A or any such
declaration shall be rescinded and annulled pursuant to paragraph 7B, the
Company shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the holder of each Note
at the time outstanding.

          7D.  OTHER REMEDIES.  If any Event of Default or Default shall occur
and be continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights under this Agreement and such Note by exercising such remedies as are
available to such holder in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement. No remedy conferred in this
Agreement upon the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

PARAGRAPH 8.    REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES.

          8.    REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES.  The Company
represents, covenants and warrants as of the date hereof as follows:

          8A. ORGANIZATION.  The Company is a corporation duly organized and
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, each
Subsidiary is duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, and the Company has and each
Subsidiary has the corporate power to own its respective property and to carry
on its respective business as now being conducted. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Notes are within the
Company's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and the execution, delivery and performance by each Guarantor
of its respective Guaranty are within such Guarantor's corporate powers and have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. SCHEDULE 8A attached
hereto sets forth the name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary
and the percentage of the Company's ownership interest in each such Subsidiary
and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, all as of the Date of
Closing.

          8B. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The Company has furnished each Purchaser
with the following financial statements, identified by a principal financial
officer of the Company: (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at December 31 in each of the four fiscal years of the Company
most recently completed and consolidated statements of operations and cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for each of the five fiscal years of the
Company most recently completed, all certified by Price Waterhouse L.L.P.; and

end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 1995 and the comparable
quarterly period in the preceding fiscal year and consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows for the periods from the beginning of the fiscal years
in which such quarterly periods are included to the end of such quarterly
periods, prepared by the Company. Such financial

                                      24
<PAGE>
 
statements (including any related schedules and/or notes) are true and correct
in all material respects (subject, as to interim statements, to changes
resulting from audits and year-end adjustments), have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently followed
(except as set forth in the notes thereto if consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards) throughout the
periods involved and show all liabilities, direct and contingent, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries required to be shown in accordance with such principles.
The balance sheets fairly present the consolidated financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and the statements of
operations and cash flows fairly present the results of the consolidated
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated.  There
has been no material adverse change in the business, property or assets,
financial condition or results of operations (financial or otherwise) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole since December 31, 1994.

          8C. ACTIONS PENDING.  There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of its Affiliates that is controlled by
the Company or any joint venture in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has an investment, or any properties or rights of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its Affiliates that is controlled by the Company or any
joint venture in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an investment,
by or before any court, arbitrator or administrative or governmental body which
is reasonably likely to result in any material adverse change in the business,
property or assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There is no action, suit, investigation
or proceeding pending or threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its Affiliates that is controlled by the Company or any
joint venture in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an investment
which purports to affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any
Note or any Guaranty.

          8D. OUTSTANDING DEBT.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has outstanding any Debt except as permitted by paragraph 6C(2).
There exists no default (and no waiver of any default that is conditional or is
limited in duration) under the provisions of any instrument evidencing such
Debt, or any Debt of any joint venture in which the Company or any Subsidiary
has an investment, or of any agreement relating thereto.

          8E. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.  The Company, each of its
Subsidiaries, each of its Affiliates that is controlled by the Company and each
joint venture in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an investment
and all of their respective properties and facilities have complied at all times
and in all respects with all federal, state, local and regional statutes, laws,
ordinances and judicial and administrative orders, judgments, rulings and
regulations relating to protection of the environment except, in any such case,
where failure to comply would not result in a material adverse effect on the
business, property or assets, financial condition or results of operations
(financial or otherwise) or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

                                      25
<PAGE>
 
          8F. TAXES.  The Company has and each of its Subsidiaries has filed
all Federal, State and other income tax returns which, to the best knowledge of
the officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are required to be filed, and
each has paid all taxes as shown on such returns and on all assessments received
by it to the extent that such taxes have become due, except such taxes as are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  The Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service (or the
applicable statute of limitations has run) and such liabilities have been paid
for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31,
1989.

          8G. CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS.  Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or
subject to any charter or other corporate restriction which materially and
adversely affects its business, property or assets, or financial condition.
Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, the Notes or the
Guaranties, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes, nor fulfillment of
nor compliance with the terms and provisions hereof and of the Notes will
conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of,
or constitute a default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, any award of any arbitrator or any agreement (including any
agreement with stockholders), instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law,
rule or regulation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise
subject to any provision contained in, any instrument evidencing indebtedness of
the Company or such Subsidiary, any agreement relating thereto or any other
contract or agreement (including its charter) which limits the amount of, or
otherwise imposes restrictions on the incurring of, Debt of the Company of the
type to be evidenced by the Notes or the Guaranties except as set forth in the
agreements listed in EXHIBIT C attached hereto.

          8H. OFFERING OF NOTES.  Neither the Company nor any agent acting on
its behalf has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes or any similar
security of the Company for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy the Notes or
any similar security of the Company from, or otherwise approached or negotiated
with respect thereto with, any Person other than the Purchasers and not more
than 80 other institutional investors, and neither the Company nor any agent
acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which would subject the
issuance or sale of the Notes to the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities
Act or to the registration, prospectus delivery or similar provisions of any
securities or Blue Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.

          8I. REGULATION G, ETC.  The proceeds of the sale of the Notes will
be used to refinance existing indebtedness under the Revolving Loan Agreement.
None of the proceeds of the sale of any Notes will be used, directly or
indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of
purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined in Regulation G (12 C.F.R.
Part 207) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (herein called
"margin stock") or for the purpose of maintaining, reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to

                                      26
<PAGE>
 
purchase or carry any stock that is then currently a margin stock or for any
other purpose which might constitute the purchase of such Notes a "purpose
credit" within the meaning of such Regulation G.  After applying the proceeds of
the sale of the Notes, not more than 25% of the value of the assets subject to
the terms of paragraph 5C, 6C(l), 6C(4) or 6C(5) will be "margin stock." Neither
the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action
which might cause this Agreement or the Notes to violate Regulation G,
Regulation T, Regulation X or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in
effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect.

          8J. ERISA.  No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section
302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan). No liability to the PBGC
has been or is expected by the Company to be incurred with respect to any Plan
(other than a Multiemployer Plan) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which is or would be materially adverse to the business, property or assets,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
or presently expects to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA
with respect to any Multiemployer Plan which is or would be materially adverse
to the business, property or assets, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No Plan
providing welfare benefits to retired former employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has been established or is maintained for which the present
value of future benefits payable, in excess of irrevocably designated funds for
such purpose, is materially adverse to the business, property or assets,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. The purchase of Notes by the Purchasers will not constitute a
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in section 406 of ERISA or
section 4975 of the Code). The representation by the Company in the next
preceding sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the
representations of the Purchasers in paragraph 9B. Neither the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate, nor any "employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in
section 3 of ERISA) of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate or any trust created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" that could subject any such Person, or any other party
dealing with such employee benefit plan or trust, to such penalty or tax.

          8K. GOVERNMENTAL CONSENT.  Neither the nature of the Company or of
any Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any
relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
other action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental or regulatory body (other than routine filings after the Date of
Closing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue Sky
authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
any Guaranty, the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes or
fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, of any
Guaranty or of the Notes.

                                      27
<PAGE>
 
          8L. TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  The Company has and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and defensible title to its respective real properties
(other than properties which it leases) and good title to all of its other
respective properties and assets, including the properties and assets reflected
in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in paragraph 8B (other than
properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business), subject
to no Lien of any kind except Liens permitted by paragraph 6C(1) except that (i)
with respect to easements and rights of way associated with the Company's gas
gathering systems: (a) the Company has such title as is customary and
appropriate in accordance with applicable industry standards and (b) the costs
of curing defects in such title, if any, would not exceed $10,000,000 in the
aggregate, (ii) no representation or warranty is made with respect to any gas or
mineral property or interest to which no proved oil or gas reserves are properly
attributed and (iii) with respect to Western Gas Resources Storage, Inc.'s Katy
Hub and Gas Storage Facility:  (a) the condemnation process relating to certain
storage rights, rights-of-way and well easements has not been completed and
therefore, as of the Closing Date, Western Gas Resources Storage, Inc. has, with
respect to such storage rights, rights-of-way and well easements, only the right
to the possession thereof (such right to possession being sufficient to enable
Western Gas Resources Storage, Inc. to conduct its business and operations at
the Katy Hub and Gas Storage Facility as currently conducted and as proposed to
be conducted) and (b) when such condemnation process is completed and Western
Gas Storage, Inc. has paid all amounts determined to be due to the condemnee
with respect thereto, Western Gas Storage, Inc. will obtain good and defensible
title to said storage rights, rights-of-way and well easements.  All leases
necessary in any material respect for the conduct of the respective businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting and are in full
force and effect.

          8M. DISCLOSURE.  Neither this Agreement nor the Private Placement
Memorandum nor any other document, certificate or statement furnished to the
Purchasers by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor in connection
herewith contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and
therein not misleading. There is no fact peculiar to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which materially adversely affects or in the future is reasonably
likely (so far as the Company can now foresee) to materially adversely affect
the business, property or assets, financial condition or results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and which has not been set
forth in this Agreement or in the Private Placement Memorandum. The financial
projections provided to the Purchasers prior to the Date of Closing are
reasonable based on the assumptions stated therein and the best information
available to the officers of the Company.

          8N. DELIVERY OF OTHER AGREEMENTS.  The Company has delivered to
each Purchaser prior to the date hereof a true, correct and complete copy of
each of the NationsBank Agreement, the Master Shelf Agreement, the 1993 Note
Purchase Agreement and the Receivables Purchase Agreement,  including all
amendments and waivers of any provision thereof.

          8O. PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT; FEDERAL POWER ACT.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company" or a "public utility company" as such terms are
defined in the Public Utility Holding

                                      28
<PAGE>
 
Company Act of 1935, as amended, or, except for Western Gas Resources Power
Marketing, Inc., a "public utility" as such term is defined in the Federal Power
Act, as amended.

          8P. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is, or is directly or indirectly controlled by, or acting on behalf of any
Person that is, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

          8Q. RANK OF NOTES.  The Notes rank at least pari passu in right of
payment with all other senior unsecured Debt of the Company, including without
limitation the Debt with respect to the NationsBank Agreement, the Master Shelf
Agreement and the 1993 Note Purchase Agreement.

PARAGRAPH 9.    REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.

          9.    REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.  Each Purchaser severally
represents to the Company as of the date hereof as follows:

          9A. NATURE OF PURCHASE.  Such Purchaser is not acquiring the
Notes to be purchased by it hereunder with a view to or for sale in connection

          any Transferee in enforcing (or determining whether or how to enforce)

          investigative demand issued in connection with this Agreement or the

     hereof.

          11C. CONSENT TO AMENDMENTS.  This Agreement may be amended, and
the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act
herein required to be performed by it, if the Company shall obtain the written
consent to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s)
of the Notes except that, (i) with the written consent of the holders of all
Notes at the time outstanding (and not without such written consents), the Notes
may be amended or the provisions thereof waived to change the maturity thereof,
to change the principal thereof, or to change the rate or time of payment of
interest on or any Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to the Notes,
and (ii) without the written consent of the holder or holders of all Notes at
the time outstanding, no amendment to or waiver of the provisions of this
Agreement shall change the provisions of paragraph 7A or this paragraph 11C
insofar as such provisions relate to proportions of the principal amount of the
Notes, or the rights of any individual holder of Notes, required with respect to
any declaration of Notes to be due and payable or with respect to any consent.
Each holder of any Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by
any consent authorized by this paragraph 11C, whether or not such Note shall
have been marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may
bear a notation referring to any such consent.  No course of dealing between the
Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights
hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any
holder of such Note.  As used herein and in the Notes, the term "THIS AGREEMENT"
and references thereto shall mean this Note Purchase Agreement as it may from
time to time be amended or supplemented.

         11D. SOLICITATION OF NOTEHOLDERS.

                (i)      SOLICITATION.  Neither the Company nor any Guarantor
     shall solicit, request or negotiate for or with respect to any proposed
     waiver or amendment of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes or the
     Guaranties unless each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of
     Notes then owned by it) shall be informed thereof by the Company with
     sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision with
     respect thereto. Executed or true and correct copies of any waiver or
     consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 11D shall be
     delivered by the Company to each holder of outstanding Notes forthwith
     following the date on which the same shall have been executed and delivered
     by all holders of outstanding Notes required to consent or agree to such
     waiver or consent.

                (ii)     PAYMENT.  Neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall,
     directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether
     by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant
     any security, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an
     inducement to the entering into by any holder of Notes of any waiver or
     amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes or the
     Guaranties unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is
     concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to the holders of all
     Notes then outstanding.

                (iii)    SCOPE OF CONSENT.  Any consent made pursuant to this
     paragraph 11D by a holder of Notes that has transferred or has agreed to
     transfer its Notes to the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate and has
     provided or has agreed to provide such written consent as a condition to
     such transfer shall be void and of no force and effect except solely as to
     such holder, and any amendments effected or waivers granted or to be
     effected or granted that would not have been or would not be so effected or
     granted but for such consent (and the consents of all other holders of
     Notes that were acquired under the same or similar conditions) shall be
     void and of no force and effect, retroactive to the date such amendment or
     waiver initially took or takes effect, except solely as to such holder.
 
          11E. FORM, REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES; LOST NOTES.
The Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in denominations of
at least $500,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any principal amount
not evenly divisible by $100,000. The Company shall keep at its principal office
a register in which the Company shall provide for the registration of Notes and
of transfers of Notes. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note
at the principal office of the Company, the Company shall, at its expense,
execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of an aggregate
principal amount, registered in the name of such transferee or transferees;
PROVIDED that the Company shall not be required to register any transfer that
was made in violation of the legend appearing on such Note. At the option of the
holder of any Note, such Note may be exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and
of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon
surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the principal office of the Company.
Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the

                                      43
<PAGE>
 
Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver the Notes which the holder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.  Each installment of principal
payable on each installment date upon each new Note issued upon any such
transfer or exchange shall be in the same proportion to the unpaid principal
amount of such new Note as the installment of principal payable on such date on
the Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange bore to the unpaid
principal amount of such Note. No reference need be made in any such new Note to
any installment or installments of principal previously due and paid upon the
Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange.  Every Note
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or
be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed, by the holder
of such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.  Any Note or
Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon transfer thereof shall carry the
rights to unpaid interest and interest to accrue which were carried by the Note
so exchanged or transferred, so that neither gain nor loss of interest shall
result from any such transfer or exchange.  Upon receipt of written notice from
the holder of any Note of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such
Note and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of
such holder's unsecured indemnity agreement, or in the case of any such
mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, the Company will make
and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Note.

          11F. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS; PARTICIPATIONS.  Prior to due
presentment for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in
whose name any Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the
purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on and any Yield-
Maintenance Amount payable with respect to such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the Company shall not
be affected by notice to the contrary. Subject to the preceding sentence, the
holder of any Note may from time to time grant participations in all or any part
of such Note to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by
such holder in its sole and absolute discretion.

          11G.    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE
AGREEMENT. All representations and warranties contained herein or made in
writing by or on behalf of the Company in connection herewith shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the transfer by any
Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of
any Note, and may be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any
Transferee.  Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes
embody the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter.

          11H.    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  All covenants and other agreements
in this Agreement contained by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the
parties hereto (including, without limitation, any Transferee) whether so
expressed or not.

          11I.  DISCLOSURE TO OTHER PERSONS; CONFIDENTIALITY.  EXCEPT AS
PROVIDED IN THIS PARAGRAPH 11I, EACH HOLDER AND EACH PERSON WHO PURCHASES A
PARTICIPATION IN A NOTE OR ANY PART THEREOF AGREES THAT, PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE
OF A DEFAULT, IT WILL USE ITS BEST EFFORTS TO HOLD IN CONFIDENCE AND NOT TO
DISCLOSE THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Company acknowledges that the holder
of any Note may deliver copies of any financial statements and other documents
delivered to such holder, and disclose any other information disclosed to such
holder, by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement to (i) such holder's directors, officers, employees,
agents and professional consultants, (ii) any other holder of any Note, (iii)
any Person to which such holder offers to sell such Note or any part thereof,
(iv) any Person to which such holder sells or offers to sell a participation in
all or any part of such Note, (v) any federal or state regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over such holder, (vi) the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or any similar organization or (vii) any other Person to which
such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (a) in compliance
with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such holder, (b) in
response to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative
demand, (c) in connection with any litigation to which such holder is a party or
(d) in order to protect such holder's investment in such Note; PROVIDED THAT
                                                               --------     
PRIOR TO DISCLOSING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO ANY OFFEREE REFERRED TO IN
CLAUSES (III) AND (IV) ABOVE, SUCH HOLDER WILL USE ITS BEST EFFORTS TO HAVE SUCH
OFFEREE DELIVER TO THE COMPANY A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE
FORM OF EXHIBIT D HERETO.

          11J. NOTICES.  All written communications provided for hereunder
shall be sent by first class mail or nationwide overnight delivery service (with
charges prepaid) and (i) if to any Purchaser, addressed to such Purchaser at the
address specified for such communications in the PURCHASER SCHEDULE, or at such
other address as such Purchaser shall have specified in writing to the Person
sending such communication, and (ii) if to any other holder of any Note,
addressed to it at such address as it shall have specified in writing to the
Person sending such communication or, if any such holder shall not have so
specified an address, then addressed to such holder in care of the last holder
of such Note which shall have so specified an address to the Person sending such
communication, and (iii) if to the Company, addressed to it at 12200 N. Pecos

PROVIDED, however, that any such communication to the Company may also, at the
option of the Person sending such communication, be delivered by any other means
either to the Company at its address specified above or to any Authorized
Officer of the Company.

          11K.    PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS.  Anything in this
Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal
of or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day.  If the date for any payment is
extended to the next succeeding Business Day by reason of the preceding
sentence, the period of such extension shall be included in the computation of
the interest payable on such Business Day.

                                      45
<PAGE>
 
          11L. SATISFACTION REQUIREMENT.  If any agreement, certificate or
other writing, or any action taken or to be taken, is by the terms of this
Agreement required to be satisfactory to any Purchaser, to any holder of Notes
or to the Required Holder(s), the determination of such satisfaction shall be
made by such Purchaser, such holder or the Required Holder(s), as the case may
be, in the sole and exclusive judgment (exercised in good faith) of the Person
or Persons making such determination.

          11M.    GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
                  -------------                                        
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          11N. LIMITATION ON INTEREST.  The Company and the Purchasers
specifically intend and agree to limit contractually the amount of interest
payable in connection with this Agreement and the Notes to the maximum amount of
interest lawfully permitted to be charged under applicable law. Therefore, none
of the terms of this Agreement or the Notes shall ever be construed to create a
contract to pay interest at a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted to be
charged under applicable law, and neither the Company nor any Guarantor nor any
other party liable or to become liable hereunder or under the Notes shall ever
be liable for interest in excess of the amount determined at such maximum rate.

unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          11P. DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS.  The descriptive headings of the
several paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do
not constitute a part of this Agreement.

          11Q.    COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed

original, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to
produce or account for more than one such counterpart.
