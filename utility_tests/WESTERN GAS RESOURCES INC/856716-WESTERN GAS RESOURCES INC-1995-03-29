GENERAL

Western Gas Resources, Inc. (the "Company") is an independent gas gatherer,
processor and marketer with operations located in major oil and gas-producing

storage facilities and markets and transports natural gas and natural gas
liquids ("NGLs").  The Company provides necessary services to the producers of
natural gas and NGLs by connecting producers' wells to the Company's gathering

Louisiana and Texas.

Historically, the Company has derived over 90% of its revenues from the sale of

Capital expenditures to connect new reserves and to acquire consolidating assets
are anticipated to be approximately $63.5 million for 1995 and capital
expenditures to maintain existing facilities are expected to approximate $16.5
million for 1995.

GAS GATHERING AND PROCESSING

The Company contracts with producers to gather raw natural gas from individual
wells located near its plants.  Once a contract has been executed, the Company
connects wells to gathering lines through which the natural gas is delivered to
a processing plant.  At the plant, the natural gas is compressed, unfractionated
NGLs are extracted, and the remaining dry residue gas is treated to meet
pipeline quality specifications.  Six of the Company's processing plants can
further separate, or fractionate, the mixed NGL stream into ethane, propane,
butane and natural gasoline to obtain higher value for the NGLs and four of the
Company's plants are able to process and treat natural gas containing hydrogen
sulfide or other impurities which require removal prior to transportation.  In
addition, the Company has one facility which converts normal butane into iso-
butane.

The Company continually acquires additional natural gas supplies to maintain or
increase throughput levels to offset natural production declines in dedicated
volumes.  Such natural gas supplies are obtained by purchasing existing systems
from third parties or by connecting additional wells.  The opportunity to
connect new wells to existing facilities is primarily affected by levels of
drilling activity near the Company's gathering systems.  The Company believes it
has expanded into areas which present significant potential for new drilling or
purchases of existing systems.  Historically, the Company has connected
additional reserves which more than offset production from reserves dedicated to
existing facilities.  However, certain individual plants have experienced
declines in dedicated reserves.  In 1994, including reserves associated with
Westana Gathering Company ("Westana"), a general partnership in which the
Company has a 50% ownership interest, the Company connected sufficient new
reserves to its gathering systems to replace approximately 85% of 1994
production, or 194% of 1994 production including the Company's 1994 
acquisitions.  On a Company-wide basis, dedicated reserves, including certain
proved undeveloped properties and revisions to previous estimates, totaled
approximately 2.1 Tcf at December 31, 1994.

Substantially all natural gas flowing through Company facilities is supplied
under long-term contracts providing for the dedication for purchase or
processing of such natural gas for periods ranging from 5 to 20 years.  Under
the typical natural gas purchase contract, the Company is responsible for
arranging the transportation and marketing of the natural gas and NGLs after
processing.  However, some contracts are structured as natural gas processing
arrangements in which gathering and processing services are performed for a fee
and the producer retains marketing responsibility for the natural gas.

In most of its gathering areas, the Company's policy is to structure natural gas
purchase contracts on a percentage-of-proceeds basis under which it is entitled
to a specified percentage of the net proceeds received from the resale of
residue gas and NGLs

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
along with ancillary fees for treating, compression and marketing services.
Percentage-of-proceeds contracts provide for the Company and producers to share
proportionally in price changes.  The Company's existing contracts generally
entitle it to retain the same percentage, typically between 20% to 40%, of the
net proceeds from the resale of residue gas and NGLs.  For the year ended
December 31, 1994, percentage-of-proceeds contracts accounted for approximately
57% of natural gas throughput (exclusive of the Toca straddle plant).

Under its gas gathering and processing contracts, the Company collects fees
based on the volume of natural gas processed or receives a predetermined
percentage, ranging from 40% to 85%, of the NGLs produced.  Natural gas
processed at certain facilities is subject to contracts that combine gathering
and compression fees with "keep whole" arrangements.  In addition to the fees
collected, the Company retains the NGLs recovered at the processing facility and
keeps the producer whole by returning to the producer at the tailgate of the
plant an amount of residue gas equal on a Btu basis to the raw natural gas
received at the plant inlet.  The fixed nature of the gathering and compression
fees reduces the Company's exposure to the margin volatility of residue gas and
NGLs typically experienced in pure "keep-whole" arrangements.  For the year
ended December 31, 1994, gas gathering and processing contracts accounted for
41% of natural gas throughput and other fee-based contracts accounted for 2% of
natural gas throughput (exclusive of the Toca straddle plant).

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND PROJECTS

The Company's significant acquisitions and projects since January 1, 1992 are:

   Katy Gas Storage Facility

The Company has completed the construction of the Katy Gas Storage Facility (the
"Katy Facility") located approximately 20 miles from Houston, Texas and it
commenced operations in February 1994.  The complex utilizes a partially
depleted natural gas reservoir with 18 Bcf of working gas and a pipeline header
system, currently connected to eleven pipelines, which has the capability to
deliver up to 400 MMcf/D of natural gas from the reservoir.  The Katy Facility
will be an electronic trading site through the NYMEX/Channel 4 on-line trading
and information system.  This service is expected to be available in May 1995.
Lease acquisition and construction costs incurred through the commencement of
operations, including pad gas, approximate $106.1 million, excluding capitalized
pre-operating costs.  See "Marketing" below.

   Oasis

Effective December 1, 1994, the Company acquired the West Texas gathering and
treating assets of Oasis for approximately $26.0 million.  The Oasis purchase
included 14 gathering systems in the Permian Basin comprising approximately 600
miles of pipeline and two treating facilities.  In addition, the Company has
entered into a long-term agreement with Oasis for 100 MMcf per day of firm
transportation service on its intrastate pipeline.  The Company will install a
200 MMcf per day pipeline interconnection between this pipeline and the Katy
Facility.

   Mountain Gas

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the stock of Mountain Gas
Resources, Inc. ("Mountain Gas") from Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II,
L.P.  for total consideration of approximately $168.2 million, including the
payment of certain transaction costs and the assumption and repayment of $35
million of long-term debt of Mountain Gas.

Mountain Gas owns the Red Desert and Granger facilities, both located near the
Company's Lincoln Road gas processing plant and gathering system.  The 22%
interest in the Granger facility previously not owned by Mountain Gas was
purchased by the Company in two separate transactions in November and December
1993 for an aggregate of $27.7 million.  At the date of acquisition, the Red
Desert facility consisted of a cryogenic plant and the Granger plant consisted
of a refrigeration unit and a cryogenic unit.  In December 1993, the Company
completed construction of an additional cryogenic processing plant at Granger,
at a total additional cost of approximately $4.8 million.

In December 1993, a fire at the Granger facility's NGL tank farm required the
facility to be shut down for one week.  The new cryogenic processing plant as
well as the smaller existing cryogenic unit were also damaged.  Construction of
a new tank farm and repairs to the cryogenic units were completed and fully
operational in August 1994.  See Note 1 "Organization, Accounting Policies and
Other Matters" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in
this Form 10-K.

   Black Lake

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company purchased the Black Lake gas processing
plant and related reserves ("Black Lake") from Nerco Oil & Gas, Inc. for
approximately $136.2 million. The acquisition included a 68.9% working interest
in the Black Lake field in Louisiana and a gas processing plant.

To increase the efficiency of Black Lake's processing capabilities, the Company
installed a cryogenic processing plant at a cost of approximately $4.1 million.
The cryogenic processing plant, which became fully operational in October 1994,
is expected to decrease fuel usage by 3.6 MMcf per day and plant operating
expenses by $1.4 million per year, and provides flexibility to recover or reject
ethane.  The Company also completed the drilling of an infill development well
to enhance production in the Black Lake field which was completed in October
1994 at a cost of approximately $691,000.

   Westana Joint Venture

Effective August 1, 1993, the Company formed Westana Gathering Company
("Westana"), a general partnership, with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Corporation
("PEPL").  Westana provides gas gathering and processing services in the
Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and markets natural gas and NGLs for producers
connected to its system.  The Company is the principal operator with each
partner holding a 50% ownership interest.

The Company contributed its Chester gas processing plant and gathering system,
with a net book value of $13.8 million, to Westana. Westana also operates PEPL's
400 mile gathering system, which will be contributed to Westana after
abandonment approval by the FERC.  The FERC issued a ruling on March 15, 1995
which the Company is evaluating.  The Company also made additional contractual
partnership contributions of $8.3 million through December 31, 1994 for
necessary modifications to the gathering system.  This contribution is to be
recouped by the Company through preferential partnership distributions.

   Other

The Company continually monitors the economic performance of each operating
facility to see that it meets a desired cash flow objective. If an operating
facility is not generating desired cash flows or does not fit in with the
Company's strategic plans, the Company will explore various options such as
consolidation with other company owned facilities, dismantlement, asset swap or
outright sale.  In 1994, the Company sold the Sligo plant, swapped the Pyote
treating facilities for gathering assets in Kansas, consolidated assets in the
Powder River Basin and sold the Walnut Bend gathering system.  In 1995, the
Company expects to consolidate the Lamont gathering system with the Chaney Dell
system, salvage the Lamont and Walnut Bend processing plants, and sell non-
strategic assets acquired in the recent Oasis acquisition.

MARKETING

   Natural Gas

The Company markets residue gas produced at its plants and purchased from third
parties to end-users, local distribution companies ("LDCs"), pipelines and other
marketing companies throughout the United States.  The Company's success in
obtaining markets for residue gas has been an important factor in maintaining
production levels for its producers and throughput levels for its gas plants.

The Company continues to increase its marketing capabilities. Increased third-
party sales and sales attributable to the Katy Facility, Red Desert, Granger and
Black Lake systems have primarily accounted for the increase in average daily
gas sales from 442 MMcf/D for the year ended December 31, 1992 to 1,097 MMcf/D
for the year ended December 31, 1994. The Company has continued to increase
sales to end-users and to achieve greater market penetration close to its
facilities, while also expanding into new markets throughout the United States.

Most of the Company's current sales contracts are short-term, ranging from a few
days to one year.  At December 31, 1994, the Company's commitment under long-
term contracts, several of which have an annual redetermination of prices and
several of which are rebid prior to expiration, was approximately 235 MMcf/D.

The Company intends to continue to expand its residue gas marketing and third-
party sales particularly to industrial and commercial end-users.  Third-party
sales and residue gas storage, combined with the stable supply from Company
facilities,

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
enable the Company to respond quickly to changing market conditions and to take
advantage of seasonal price variations and peak demand periods.  This creates an
opportunity for the Company to obtain a higher price on average for its
delivered residue gas than the price obtained by other marketers or brokers.
The Company customarily stores residue gas in underground storage facilities to
assure an adequate supply for long-term sales contracts and for resale during
periods when prices are favorable.  At December 31, 1994, the Company held
approximately 21.9 Bcf of residue gas inventory in underground storage at an
average cost of $2.16 per Mcf ($1.94 per MMBtu), primarily at the Katy Facility.
The Company typically hedges a portion of its residue gas volumes and
requirements under gas sales contracts using the futures market. At December 31,
1994, the Company had sales contracts in place for approximately 16.2 million
MMBtu of stored gas at prices ranging from approximately $1.90 per MMBtu to
approximately $2.30 per MMBtu for the 1994-1995 winter heating season.
Additionally, at December 31, 1994 the Company had sales contracts in place for
approximately 12.6 million MMBtu of stored gas at prices ranging from
approximately $1.85 per MMBtu to approximately $2.40 per MMBtu for the 1995-1996
winter heating season. The Company also hedges purchases related to these sales,
the value of which is, or will be, included in the carrying cost of the related
inventory. See Note 3 "Risk Management" to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

In order to meet the peaking demand for residue gas in certain markets, the
Company designed and constructed the Katy Facility.  The ability to withdraw gas
from the Katy Facility on short notice positions the Company to market residue
gas to LDCs and other customers that need a reliable yet variable supply of
residue gas.  The Katy Facility allows the Company to bypass transportation
bottlenecks and enhances flexibility in its marketing operations.  The complex
utilizes of a partially depleted natural gas reservoir with 18 Bcf of working
gas and a pipeline header system, currently connected to eleven pipelines, which
has the capability to deliver up to 400 MMcf per day of residue gas from the
reservoir.

In December 1993, the Company entered into a three-year winter-peaking gas
purchase and sales agreement with a major utility in East Texas which designates
the Katy Facility as the primary delivery point. Under the agreement, which was
amended in August 1994, the utility has the right to purchase, during each year
of the contract, up to approximately 50 MMcf per day in November and March and
approximately 140 MMcf per day in December, January and February, determined
daily, at the Houston Ship Channel Index Price plus a demand charge. The
agreement calls for a minimum demand charge to be paid to the Company for each
contract term, whether or not delivery is taken. This minimum demand charge is
calculated based upon five Bcf.

In February 1995, the Company's gas storage subsidiary entered into a long-term
Firm Storage and Transportation Agreement with a St. Louis-based LDC. Under the
agreement, the Company will lease approximately 3 Bcf of capacity in its Katy
Facility to the LDC.  The gas will principally serve local distribution
requirements of the LDC's customers in central Missouri.

During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company sold residue gas to
approximately 340 end-users, pipelines, LDCs and other customers.  No single
customer accounted for more than 5% of consolidated revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1994.

   NGL Marketing

The Company markets NGLs (ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, natural
gasoline, and condensate) produced at its plants and purchased from third
parties in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions.  A majority
of the Company's production of NGLs moves to the Gulf Coast area, which is the
largest NGL market in the United States.  Through the development of end-use
markets and distribution capabilities, the Company ensures that production from
the plants moves on a reliable basis, avoiding curtailment of production.

The volatility of NGL prices in recent years has caused the Company to move to
short-term contracts, with no prices set on a firm basis for more than a 30-day
period.  Although some contracts do commit the Company for periods as long as a
year, prices are redetermined on a market-related basis. Storage space is leased
at major trading locations near Houston and in central Kansas in order to store
products so that they can be sold at higher prices on a seasonal basis. At
December 31, 1994, approximately 11.6 MGal of NGLs were in storage at an average
cost of $.30 per gallon. The Company generally intends that stored NGLs turn
over on an annual basis. Additionally, the Company has entered into futures
contracts totaling approximately 375,000 barrels of crude oil at an average
price of $18.10 per barrel to hedge a portion of its share of 1995 condensate
and crude oil production. The Company has, and will continue to enter into
futures contracts for certain purchase and sales transactions as they occur.

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
For the year ended December 31, 1994, NGL sales averaged 2,970 MGal per day, an
increase from 2,400 MGal per day in 1992.  Sales were made to approximately 160
different customers and no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the
Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 1994.  Revenues
are also derived from marketing fees charged to some producers for NGL marketing
services.  At December 31, 1994, such fees were less than 1% of the Company's
consolidated revenues.

PRODUCING PROPERTIES

Revenues derived from the Company's producing properties comprised approximately
3.8% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1994.  The producing properties
are primarily working interests in a unit operated by the Company comprising the
Black Lake field in Louisiana, which provides production to the Black Lake
plant, and 20 gas properties producing from the Smackover formation of the East
Texas Basin, which provide production to the Edgewood plant. The Company also
has working interests in six fields in the Powder River Basin in northeastern
Wyoming, six wells in the Sandwash Basin in northwestern Colorado, three gas
wells in the Austin Chalk formation in southeast Texas and three gas wells in
the San Juan Basin in southwest Colorado.

COMPETITION

The Company competes with other companies in the gathering, processing,
marketing and transmission business both for supplies of natural gas and for
customers for its natural gas and NGLs. Competition for residue gas supplies is
primarily based on efficiency, reliability, availability of transportation and
ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producers' residue gas.
Competition for customers is primarily based upon reliability and price of
deliverable residue gas and NGLs.  For customers that have the capability of
using alternative fuels, such as oil and coal, the Company also competes based
primarily on price against companies capable of providing such alternative
fuels.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The construction and operation of the Company's gathering lines, plants and
other facilities used for the gathering, transporting, processing, treating or
storing of residue gas and NGLs are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, including those that can impose obligations
to clean up hazardous substances at the Company's facilities or at facilities
to which the Company sends wastes for disposal.  In most instances, the
applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or
solid waste management procedures.  The Company employs seven environmental
engineers to monitor environmental compliance and potential liabilities at its
facilities.  Prior to consummating any major acquisition, the Company's
environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired.  In
addition, on an ongoing basis, the environmental engineers perform systematic
environmental assessments of the Company's existing facilities.  The Company
believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable material
environmental laws and regulations.  Environmental regulation can increase the
cost of planning, designing, constructing and operating the Company's
facilities.  The Company believes that the costs for compliance with current
environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operation.

In 1990, the Congress enacted the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean
Air Act") which impose more stringent standards on emissions of certain
pollutants and require the permitting of certain existing air emissions sources.
Many of the regulations have not been promulgated and until their promulgation,
the Company cannot make a final assessment of the impact of the Clean Air Act.
However, based upon its preliminary review of the proposed regulations, the
Company does not anticipate that compliance with the Clean Air Act will require
any material capital expenditures, although it will increase permitting costs in
1995 and may increase certain operating costs on an on-going basis.  The Company
does not believe that such cost increases will have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

The Company believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend in
environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter
standards.  The Company is unaware of future environmental standards that are
reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations, but cannot rule out that
possibility.

The Company is in the process of voluntarily cleaning up non-hazardous
substances at facilities that it operates.  In addition, the former owner of
certain facilities that the Company acquired in 1992 is conducting cleanups at
those facilities pursuant to contractual obligations.  The Company's
expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
have not been significant in relation to the results of operations of the
Company and totaled approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1994.  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company paid an aggregate of
approximately $550,000 in air emissions fees to the states in which it operates.
Although the Company anticipates that such air emissions fees will increase over
time, the Company does not believe that such increases will have a material
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

REGULATION

The purchase and sale of natural gas and the fees received for gathering and
processing by the Company have generally not been subject to regulation, and
therefore, except as constrained by competitive factors, the Company has
considerable pricing flexibility.  Many aspects of the gathering, processing,
marketing and transportation of natural gas and NGLs by the Company, however,
are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations which can have a
significant impact upon the Company's overall operations.

As a processor and marketer of natural gas, the Company depends on the
transportation and storage services offered by various interstate pipeline
companies for the delivery and sale of its own gas supplies as well as those it
processes and/or markets for others.  Both the performance of transportation and
storage services by interstate pipelines, and the rates charged for such
services, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the "NGA") and the
Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the "NGPA").  The availability of interstate
transportation and storage service necessary to enable the Company to make
deliveries and/or sales of residue gas can at times be preempted by other system
users in accordance with FERC-approved methods for allocating the system
capacity of "open access" pipelines.  Moreover, the rates charged by pipelines
for such services are often subject to negotiation between shippers and the
pipelines within certain FERC-established parameters and will periodically vary
depending upon individual system usage and other factors.  An inability to
obtain transportation and/or storage services at competitive rates can hinder
the Company's processing and marketing operations and/or affect its sales
margins.

During the past ten years, the FERC has implemented a nondiscriminatory blanket
transportation program which initially authorized, and ultimately mandated,
interstate natural gas pipelines to perform "open access," self-implementing
(i.e., not generally requiring case-specific certificate authorization)
-----                                                                  
transportation services.  Order Nos. 636, et seq., which constitute the FERC's
                                          -------                              
most recent issuances in this program, promulgated regulations that
substantially restructure the services provided by interstate pipelines by
"unbundling" (i.e., separating) and separately pricing pipeline gathering,
              ----                                                        
transportation, storage and sales activities in an effort to enable non-pipeline
merchants to compete with pipelines for gas purchasers on an equal basis.  These
regulations have largely been implemented by all interstate transporters
utilized by the Company (as well as by the Company's own non-major interstate
pipeline located in Wyoming) in numerous individual pipeline restructuring and
rate proceedings.  The conversion of pipelines from natural gas merchants to
primarily transporters of gas through implementation of the FERC's open access
transportation and restructuring programs has caused the pipelines to incur
significant producer take-or-pay costs and other transition costs resulting from
their abandonment of gas purchasing and sales activities.  The FERC has allowed,
and indicated in Order Nos. 636, et seq. that it will continue to allow, the
                                 ------                                     
recovery of some or all of these and related costs from current shippers of gas.
Pipeline flow-through of many of these costs is subject to the outcome of
administrative and appellate proceedings in individual pipeline rate and
restructuring cases, and Order No. 636, et seq. themselves are currently the
                                        ------                              
subject of numerous petitions for appellate review presently pending in the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The
outcome of these proceedings could affect the Company's operations and the costs
of transporting and selling gas.

Pursuant to Section 1(b) of the NGA, production and gathering activities are
exempt from the FERC's jurisdiction; however, judicial precedent has held that
where gathering is performed largely in connection with the delivery of gas in
interstate commerce, such gathering can be considered merely an extension of the
jurisdictional transportation of such gas and thus subject to NGA rate
regulation itself.  Recently, primarily as a result of the aforementioned
unbundling of interstate pipeline gathering services required by Order No. 636,
et seq., many pipelines have sought FERC authorization to abandon gathering
------                                                                    
operations and facilities previously held to be subject to the NGA.  In response
to those requests, the FERC has established a general policy permitting the
abandonments but requiring a showing demonstrating that existing customers have
been offered, for a two-year period, continued service through the abandoned
facilities at the same rates and under the same terms as were previously offered
by the pipeline.  The Company has been active in acquiring and/or operating
natural gas gathering facilities abandoned by interstate pipelines and, thus,
certain of its operations and acquisitions will likely be affected by this FERC
policy.  The policy is currently being challenged at both agency and appellate
levels, but at this stage the outcome of such challenges is too speculative to
predict.

The Company paid annual dividends on the Common Stock aggregating $.20 per share
during the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993.  The Company has declared a
dividend of $.05 per share of common stock for the quarter ending March 31, 1995
to holders of record as of such date.  Declarations of dividends on the Common
Stock are within the discretion of the Board of Directors and are dependent upon
various factors, including the earnings, cash flow, capital requirements and
financial condition of the Company. In addition, the Company's ability to pay
dividends is restricted by certain covenants in its credit facilities,
including a prohibition on declaring or paying dividends that exceed, in the
aggregate, the sum of $35 million plus 50% of the Company's consolidated
cumulative net income earned after March 31, 1994 plus 50% of the cumulative net
proceeds in excess of the Redemption Limit (as defined in the Company's loan
agreement) received from the sale of any equity securities sold after March 31,
1994.  At December 31, 1994, this threshold amounted to $38.2 million.

</TABLE>

Net income decreased $30.7 million and net cash provided by operating activities
decreased $72.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1994 compared to the
same period in 1993. Overall, throughput and sales volumes at the Company's
facilities have remained comparable to historical levels.  The Company's
decrease in net income and net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily attributable to a decline in NGL and residue gas prices and higher
interest, selling and administrative and depreciation costs associated with the
Company's 1993 acquisitions of Black Lake and Mountain Gas, along with the
completion of the Katy Facility construction. In addition, because of lower
demand and lower than expected prices, the Katy Facility did not generate
significant revenue.  As a result, revenues from the Katy Facility in 1994 did
not fully offset related depreciation, interest and operating costs.

Revenues from the sale of residue gas increased approximately $144.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, as a
volume increase of approximately 345 MMcf per day was somewhat offset by a
decrease in average residue gas sales prices of $.25 per Mcf.  Approximately 300
MMcf per day of the volume increase is attributable to an increase in the sale
of residue gas purchased from third parties, primarily resulting from the
acquisition of Citizens National Gas Company ("Citizens") assets in the third
quarter of 1993.  The remaining volume increase is the result of increased
production volumes at the Company's facilities, primarily due to the Mountain
Gas and Black Lake acquisitions, new well connect activities and consolidations
with smaller gathering systems.

Revenues from the sale of NGLs decreased approximately $24.5 million for the
year ended December 31,  1994 compared to the same period in 1993, as a volume
increase of approximately 30 MGal per day was more than offset by a $.03 per
gallon decrease in the average NGL sales price. Approximately 22 MGal per day of
the volume increase is attributable to an increase in the sale of NGLs purchased
from third parties.  The remaining volume increase is primarily attributable to
the acquisitions of Mountain Gas and Black Lake, new well connect activity and
consolidations with smaller gathering systems.  This volume increase was
somewhat offset by unfavorable economics of ethane and propane extraction in the
first quarter of 1994 and by limited NGL volumes at the Granger facility,
primarily as a result of the December 1993 fire.  The curtailment of production
during the third quarter of 1994 at Black Lake while plant improvements were
completed also contributed to lower volumes.

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
Processing and transportation revenues increased $9.4 million for the year ended
December, 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993.  The increase is due to
additional gathering revenue associated with the Company's Granger gathering
system acquired in the Mountain Gas acquisition in July 1993, increased
gathering revenue at the Company's Lincoln Road facility and the recognition of
demand fees associated with a winter-peaking gas purchase and sales contract at
the Katy Facility during 1994.

Other net revenue increased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1994
compared to the same period in 1993.  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the
Company accrued approximately $3.3 million as an amount to be recovered under
its business interruption insurance policy for business losses associated with
the December 1993 fire at the Company's Granger facility and  approximately $1.4
million in rate refunds from a pipeline company.  These 1994 recoveries were
somewhat offset by a $2.6 million gain recorded as a result of the termination
of interest rate swap agreements in 1993.

Historically, product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales
from the Company's plant production have approximated 70%.  Product purchases as
a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales from third-party purchases were
substantially higher in 1994 and approximated 95%. Total  product purchases as a
percentage of residue gas and NGL sales increased approximately 2.5% to 84% for
the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. The
increase in the Company's combined percentage is primarily due to an increasing
proportion of 1994 residue gas sales revenues resulting from products purchased
from third parties.

Plant operating expense and oil and gas exploration and production costs
increased approximately $6.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the
year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993.   The increase
in plant operating expense was primarily due to the additional operating costs
associated with three gas processing facilities acquired from Mountain Gas and
Black Lake in July 1993 and the Katy Facility, which commenced operations in
February 1994.  The oil and gas exploration and production cost increase
resulted primarily from costs associated with producing properties acquired in
the Black Lake acquisition.

Selling and administrative expense increased approximately $5.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, primarily due
to administrative expenses necessitated by the 1993 acquisitions, an overall
increase in insurance expenditures and a reduction in overhead capitalized to 
the Company's construction projects.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased approximately $19.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in
1993.  This increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of Mountain Gas and
Black Lake in July 1993 and the Katy Facility, which commenced operations in
February 1994, and is partially offset by lower depreciation and depletion
expense resulting from the addition of recoverable reserves at Black Lake and
Edgewood during 1994.

Interest expense increased approximately $18.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, primarily due to
additional borrowings necessitated by the Mountain Gas and Black Lake
acquisitions, a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized to the Katy
Facility and an increase in the Company's variable borrowing rate.

Net income decreased $1.6 million and net cash provided by operating activities
increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to the
same period in 1992.

Revenues from the sale of residue gas increased $284.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992 due to an increase
in residue gas prices of $.30 per Mcf and an increase in sales volumes of 315
MMcf per day.  Of this volume increase, 246 MMcf per day is attributable to an
increase in the sale of residue gas purchased from third parties, in part due to
the acquisition of Citizens.  The remaining volume increase is the result of
increased production volumes at the Company's facilities, primarily due to the
Mountain Gas and Black Lake acquisitions as well as new well hookups at the
Midkiff/Benedum and Giddings facilities.

Revenues from the sale of NGLs increased $43.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992 due to an increase in NGL
sales volumes of 545  MGal  per day which was somewhat offset by a $.01 per
gallon decrease in the price of NGLs. Of the volume increase, 377 MGal per day
is attributable to an increase in the sale of NGLs purchased from third parties.
The remaining volume increase is the result of increased production volumes at
the Company's facilities, primarily due to the Mountain Gas and Black Lake
acquisitions as well as new well hookups at the Midkiff/Benedum and Giddings
facilities.

Historically, product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales
from the Company's plant production have approximated 70%.  Product purchases as
a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales from third-party purchases were
substantially higher in 1993 than the historical percentage and approximated
95%.  The increase in the Company's combined percentage is primarily due to a
high proportion of 1993 sales volumes having come from third parties.  As a
result, total product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales
increased approximately 6.3% to 81.5% for the year ended December 31, 1993
compared to the same period in 1992.

Plant operating expense increased $7.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1993 compared to the same period in 1992 primarily due to the Mountain Gas and
Black Lake acquisitions and an increase in repair and maintenance charges
incurred at facilities acquired from UTP.

Selling and administrative expense increased $4.1 million as a result of higher
payroll and benefit charges and professional fees resulting from the Company's
growing operations and its preparation for the Katy Gas Storage Facility, a
litigation reserve established for a lawsuit and franchise taxes resulting from
the Company's expansion into states which do not charge income taxes, somewhat
offset by increased overhead capitalized to the Company's construction projects.
In 1993, overhead capitalized to the Company's construction projects increased
approximately $3.3 million when compared to the same period in 1992.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $17.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992, primarily due
to the Mountain Gas and Black Lake acquisitions.  In February 1994, the Katy

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
Facility commenced operations; depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
associated with the Katy Facility will be approximately $3.0 million per year.

Interest expense increased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1993
compared to the same period in 1992 due to higher average long-term debt
outstanding.  In 1993, interest incurred and capitalized during the construction
period of new projects increased approximately $2.8 million compared to the same
period in 1992.

In 1993, the corporate income tax rate was increased from 34% to 35%.  This rate
increase resulted in an increase in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.1
million for the year ended December 31, 1993.

FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION

The Company cannot accurately predict future hydrocarbon prices and in order to
minimize the impact of price fluctuations on the Company's operating results,
the Company has entered into futures contracts totaling approximately 70 MMcf
per day, or a majority of the Company's share of 1995 natural gas production at
an average price of approximately $2.02 per Mcf.  Additionally, the Company has
entered into futures contracts totaling approximately 375,000 barrels of crude
oil at an average price of $18.10 per barrel to hedge a portion of its share of
1995 condensate and crude oil production. The Company has, and will continue to
enter into futures contracts for certain purchase and sales transactions as they
occur.

Throughput volumes at the Company's facilities are expected to increase
approximately 200 MMcf per day based primarily upon the added production to be
provided by the Company's recent Oasis acquisition and additional well
connections at the Company's facilities in the Green River Basin, Powder River
Basin and Permian Basin.

Average gas sales volumes are also expected to increase to approximately 1.3 Bcf
per day based primarily upon the Company's expanding marketing capabilities,
increased throughput volumes at the Company's processing facilities and as a
result of the Katy Facility.

OTHER

The Company continually monitors the economic performance of each operating
facility to see that it meets a desired cash flow objective. If an operating
facility is not generating desired cash flows or does not fit in with the
Company's strategic plans, the Company will explore various options such as
consolidation with other company owned facilities, dismantlement, asset swap or
outright sale.  In 1994, the Company sold the Sligo plant, swapped the Pyote
treating facilities for gathering assets in Kansas, consolidated assets in the
Powder River Basin and sold the Walnut Bend gathering system.  In 1995, the
Company expects to consolidate the Lamont gathering system with the Chaney Dell
system, salvage the Lamont and Walnut Bend processing plants, and sell non-
strategic assets acquired in the recent Oasis acquisition.

The oil and gas industry has experienced an increasing incidence of mergers,
acquisitions and combinations in recent years.  The Company has evaluated, and
will continue to evaluate, any such opportunities, including smaller
consolidating acquisitions, that it identifies as offering an opportunity to
enhance the Company's operational and industry position.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been
net cash provided by operating activities, funds available under its financing
facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities.  In the past, these
sources have been sufficient to meet the needs and finance the growth of the
Company's business.  The Company can give no assurance that the historical
sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future
development and acquisition projects and may require the Company to investigate
alternative financing sources.  Net cash provided by operating activities has
been primarily affected by product prices, the Company's success in increasing
the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of natural gas
processed by such facilities, and the margin on third-party residue gas
purchased for resale.  The Company's continued growth will be dependent upon
success in the areas of additions to dedicated plant reserves, acquisitions, new
project development and marketing.

For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company's total sources of funds
aggregated $300.0 million and was comprised of net proceeds from the issuance
of the $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock of $132.7 million, net proceeds from
short-term borrowings of $75.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt of $50.0 million, net cash provided by operating activities of $31.0
million, net proceeds received from the disposition of property and equipment of
$10.9 million and net proceeds received from the exercise of common stock
options of $413,000.  During the same period, the Company's use of such funds
aggregated $295.9 million which were used primarily to make payments of $179.0
million under its revolving

                                       17

<PAGE>
 
credit facility, to make capital investments of $100.5 million, to pay dividends
to holders of 7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock, $2.28 Cumulative Preferred
Stock and $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock of $11.3 million and to pay
dividends to holders of Common Stock of $5.1 million.

The Company has Shelf Registrations available which provide for the sale of up
to $200 million of debt securities and preferred stock and up to four million
shares of common stock.

The Company called for the redemption of its 7.25% Cumulative Senior Perpetual
Convertible Preferred Stock (liquidation preference of $40 million) on October
31, 1994, at an aggregate redemption price of $42 million plus accrued
dividends.  After two previous extensions, the Company and holder agreed to
extend the redemption date to May 31, 1995.  The holder has the right on or
prior to the redemption date to convert the preferred stock into an aggregate of
2,090,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  The Company is unable to
predict whether redemption or conversion will occur.

The Company has been successful overall in replacing production with new
reserves.  However, volumes of natural gas dedicated to some of the Company's
plants have declined during recent years because additions to dedicated plant
reserves have not fully offset production.  In 1994, including reserves
associated with Westana, the Company connected new reserves to its gathering
systems replacing approximately 85% of 1994 production, or 194% of 1994 
production including the Company's 1994 acquisition.  On a Company-wide
basis, dedicated reserves, including certain proved undeveloped properties and
revisions to previous estimates related to the Company's proved developed
properties, totaled approximately 2.1 Tcf at December 31, 1994.

An additional source of liquidity to the Company is volumes of residue gas and
NGLs in storage facilities.  The Company stores volumes of residue gas and NGLs
primarily to assure an adequate supply for long-term sales contracts and for
resale during periods when prices are favorable.  At December 31, 1994, the
Company held in storage approximately 11.6 million gallons of NGLs at an average
cost of $.30 per gallon and 21.9 Bcf of residue gas at an average cost of $2.16
per Mcf ($1.94 per MMBtu) primarily at the Katy Facility.

   Hedging Activities

The Company enters into futures, swaps and option contracts to hedge against a
portion of the price risk associated with natural gas and NGLs.  Gains and
losses on hedges of product inventory are included in the carrying amount of the
inventory and are ultimately recognized in residue and NGL purchases or sales 
when the related inventory is sold.  Gains and losses related to qualifying 
hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions also are deferred and are
recognized in residue and NGL sales when the hedged transaction occurs.  Margins
from the Company's forward fixed price hedges and physical sales for 1995 are
expected to more than offset the related $6.1 million of losses deferred at
December 31, 1994.

At December 31, 1994, 2,257 contracts (net) (10,000 Mcf per contract) for the
sale of residue gas in January 1995 through January 1996 at prices ranging from
$1.55 per Mcf to $2.38 per Mcf were outstanding.  At December 31, 1993, 296 such
contracts were outstanding at prices ranging from $1.87 per Mcf to $2.56 per
Mcf.  No such contracts for NGLs were outstanding at December 31, 1994 or
December 31, 1995.  See also "Financing Facilities - Interest Rate Swap
Agreements" below.
 
   Capital Investment Program

Between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1994, the Company expended
approximately $660.3 million on new projects. For the three years ended December
31, 1994, the Company expended $101.0 million, $492.3 million and $67.0 million,
respectively, on acquisitions, the construction of the Katy Facility, connection
of new reserves, the acquisition of consolidating assets for existing systems
and for upgrades to existing and newly acquired facilities.

In order to maintain the volumes of natural gas dedicated to or processed by the
Company's existing facilities, future capital expenditures for gathering
systems needed to connect new reserves and to acquire consolidating assets are
anticipated to be approximately $63.5 million for 1995 and capital expenditures
to maintain existing facilities are expected to approximate $16.5 million for
1995. The availability of new reserves at existing facilities is somewhat
affected by the price of crude oil or natural gas (depending on whether the
natural gas is associated gas or gas well gas) which in turn stimulates new
drilling at higher price levels.

Depending on the timing of the Company's future projects, it may be required to
seek additional sources of capital.  The Company's ability to secure such
capital is restricted by its credit facilities, although it may request
additional borrowing

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
capacity from the banks, seek waivers from the banks to permit it to borrow
funds from third parties, seek replacement credit facilities from other lenders
or issue additional equity securities.  While the Company believes that it would
be able to secure additional financing, if required, no assurance can be given
that it will be able to do so or as to the terms of any such financing.

   Financing Facilities

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  The Company's variable rate Revolving Credit
Facility, as restated on September 2, 1994, and subsequently amended, with a
syndicate of eight banks, provides for a maximum borrowing base of $325 million,
of which $168.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 1994.  The commitment
decreases to $300 million on January 1, 1995.  If the facility is not renewed
on January 1, 1997, any outstanding balance thereunder converts to a four-year
term loan during which such balance will be repaid in equal quarterly
installments.  The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's
option, at certain spreads over the Eurodollar rate, the Federal Funds rate plus
.50% or at the agent bank's prime rate.  The interest rate spreads are adjusted
based on the Company's debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31, 1994, the
spread was 1.0% for the Eurodollar rate, resulting in an interest rate of 7.17%.
Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 1995, the spread will increase to
1.25%.

The Company pays a commitment fee on the unused commitment ranging from .15% to
.375% based on the debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31, 1994, the
Company's debt to capitalization ratio was in the range of .50 to 1.0 resulting
in a commitment fee rate of .30%.  Beginning with the quarter ended March 31,
1995, the rate will increase to .375%.

TERM LOAN FACILITY.  The Company also has a Term Loan Facility with four banks
for $50 million which bears interest at 9.87%.  Payments on the Term Loan
Facility of $25 million, $12.5 million and $12.5 million are due in September
1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  The $25 million payment due on the Term Note
in September 1995 has been classified as long-term debt as the Company intends 
to fund this payment from amounts available under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

The agreement governing the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
(the "Credit Facilities Agreement") is subject to certain mandatory prepayment
terms.  If funded debt of the Company exceeds five times the sum of the
Company's last four quarters' cash flow (as defined in the agreement) less
preferred stock dividends, the overage must be repaid in no more than six
monthly payments commencing 90 days from notification.  This mandatory
prepayment threshold will be reduced to 4.0 to 1.0 at September 1, 1995 and 3.50
to 1.0 at September 1, 1998.  At December 31, 1994, the Company had
approximately $99.8 million of available borrowing capacity.

The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities are unsecured.  The Company is
required to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 (as defined in the
Credit Facilities Agreement), a tangible net worth at December 31, 1994 of at
least $403.2 million, a debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 60% through
October 31, 1995 and 55% thereafter and an EBITDA to interest ratio of not less
than 3.25 to 1.0 through October 31, 1995 and 3.75 to 1.0 thereafter.  The
Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends that exceed the sum of
$35 million plus 50% of consolidated net income earned after March 31, 1994 plus
50% of the cumulative net proceeds in excess of the Redemption Limit (as defined
in the Credit Facilities Agreement) received from the sale of any equity
securities sold after March 31, 1994. At December 31, 1994, this threshold
amounted to approximately $38.2 million.  The Company generally utilizes excess
daily funds to reduce any outstanding revolving credit balances to minimize
interest expense and intends to continue such practice. The $8.7 million cash
balance at December 31, 1994 is an overnight investment necessitated by the
timing of cash receipts.

MASTER SHELF AGREEMENT.  In December 1991, the Company entered into a Master
Shelf Agreement (the "Master Shelf") with The Prudential Insurance Company of
America ("Prudential") pursuant to which Prudential agreed to quote, from time-
to-time, an interest rate at which Prudential or its nominee would be willing to
purchase up to $100 million of the Company's senior promissory notes (the
"Master Notes").  Any such Master Notes must mature in no more than 12 years,
with an average life not in excess of 10 years, and will be unsecured.  On
October 27, 1992, the Company sold $25 million of 7.51% Master Notes due 2000
and $25 million of 7.99% Master Notes due 2003.   Principal payments on the $50
million of Master Notes of $8.3 million will be due on October 27 of each year
from 1998 through 2003.  On September 22, 1993, the Company sold $25 million of
6.77% Master Notes due in a single payment on September 22, 2003 and on December
27, 1993, the Company sold $25 million of 7.23% Master Notes due in a single
payment on December 27, 2003.  The Master Shelf contains certain financial
covenants which conform with those contained in the Credit Facilities Agreement,
as restated.  In July 1993, Prudential and the Company amended the Master Shelf
to provide for an additional $50 million of borrowing capacity (for

                                       19
<PAGE>
 
a total borrowing capacity of $150 million) and to extend the term of the Master
Shelf to October 31, 1995.  On October 27, 1994, the Company sold $25 million of
9.05% Master Notes due in a single payment on October 27, 2001 and $25 million
of 9.24% Senior Notes due in a single payment on October 27, 2004. At December
31, 1994, the Master Shelf Agreement, as amended, was fully utilized.

SENIOR NOTES.  On April 28, 1993 the Company sold $50 million of 7.65% Senior
Notes due 2003 to a group of insurance companies led by Connecticut General Life
Insurance Company.  Principal payments on the $50 million of Senior Notes of
$7.1 million will be due on April 30th of each year from 1997 through 2002, with
any remaining principal and interest outstanding due on April 30, 2003.  The
Senior Notes contain certain financial covenants which conform with those
contained in the Credit Facilities Agreement, as restated.

ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS. The Company anticipates entering into an agreement with
Receivables Capital Corporation ("RCC"), as administered by Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association ("BA"), to sell an undivided interest in
the Company's trade receivables for a maximum borrowing of $75 million bearing
interest at RCC's commercial paper rate plus .375%. Specific terms of this
agreement have not yet been negotiated; however, the Company anticipates
completion of this agreement in April 1995. On September 2, 1994, in advance of
completing the agreement with RCC, BA entered into a Master Note Agreement
("Short-Term Note") with the Company and advanced the Company $75 million
bearing interest at the Eurodollar rate plus .50% which resulted in an interest
rate of 6.625% at December 31, 1994. The $75 million received under the Short-
Term Note was used to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
has been included in short-term borrowings on the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheet at December 31, 1994. The Company anticipates repaying the Short-Term Note
with proceeds from RCC.

COVENANT COMPLIANCE.  At December 31, 1994, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants in its loan agreements.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS.  The Company has entered into various interest
rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.  The
transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest
payment obligations or the exchange of foreign and U.S. currencies, without the
exchange of the underlying principal amounts.  The net effect of interest rate
swap activity is reflected as an increase or decrease in interest expense.  Any
gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements and the effects of foreign
currency positions that were marked to market are included in other income.  At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, the total notional principal amount of outstanding
interest rate swap agreements was $50 million.  In addition to the financial
risk that will vary during the life of these swap agreements in relation to the
maturity of the underlying debt and market interest rates, the Company is
subject to credit risk exposure from nonperformance of the counterparties to the
swap agreements.  The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the
counterparties.

The following table summarizes the results of the Company's interest rate swap
and foreign currency positions for the three years ended December 31, 1994
(000s):

The Company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the
Revolving Credit Facility together with cash provided from operations, will
provide it with sufficient financing to connect new reserves, maintain its
existing facilities and complete its current capital improvement projects.  The
Company also believes that cash provided from operations will be sufficient to
meet its debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements and redemption
requirements, if any.

   Environmental

The construction and operation of the Company's gathering lines, plants and
other facilities used for the gathering, transporting, processing, treating or
storing of residue gas and NGLs are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, including those that can impose obligations
to clean up hazardous substances at the Company's facilities or at facilities
to which the Company sends wastes for disposal.  In most instances, the
applicable regulatory requirements relate

                                       20
<PAGE>
 
to water and air pollution control or solid waste management procedures.  The
Company employs seven environmental engineers to monitor environmental
compliance and potential liabilities at its facilities.  Prior to consummating
any major acquisition, the Company's environmental engineers perform audits on
the facilities to be acquired.  In addition, on an ongoing basis, the
environmental engineers perform systematic environmental assessments of the
Company's existing facilities.  The Company believes that it is in substantial
compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations.
Environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, designing,
constructing and operating the Company's facilities.  The Company believes that
the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have
not had and will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position
or results of operation.

In 1990, the Congress enacted the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean
Air Act") which impose more stringent standards on emissions of certain
pollutants and require the permitting of certain existing air emissions sources.
Many of the regulations have not been promulgated and until their promulgation,
the Company cannot make a final assessment of the impact of the Clean Air Act.
However, based upon its preliminary review of the proposed regulations, the
Company does not anticipate that compliance with the Clean Air Act will require
any material capital expenditures, although it will increase permitting costs in
1995 and may increase certain operating costs on an on-going basis.  The Company
does not believe that such cost increases will have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

The Company believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend in
environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter
standards.  The Company is unaware of future environmental standards that are
reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations, but cannot rule out that
possibility.

The Company is in the process of voluntarily cleaning up non-hazardous
substances at facilities that it operates.  In addition, the former owner of
certain facilities that the Company acquired in 1992 is conducting cleanups at
those facilities pursuant to contractual obligations.  The Company's
expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities
have not been significant in relation to the results of operations of the
Company and totaled approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1994.  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company paid an aggregate of
approximately $550,000 in air emissions fees to the states in which it operates.
Although the Company anticipates that such air emissions fees will increase over
time, the Company does not believe that such increases will have a material
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K are the responsibility of management.  The financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles appropriate in the circumstances and include amounts that are based
on management's informed judgments and estimates.

Management relies on the Company's system of internal accounting controls to
provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions
are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's
authorization.  The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal accounting
control and that the cost of such systems should not exceed the benefits to be
derived.  The internal accounting controls in place during the periods presented
are considered adequate to provide such assurance.

The Company's financial statements are audited by Price Waterhouse LLP,
independent accountants.  Their report states that they have conducted their
audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  These standards
include an evaluation of the system of internal accounting controls for the
purpose of establishing the scope of audit testing necessary to allow them to
render an independent professional opinion on the fairness of the Company's
financial statements.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of directors who
are not employees of the Company, reviews the Company's financial reporting and
accounting practices.  The Audit Committee meets periodically with the
independent accountants and management to review the work of each and to ensure
that each is properly discharging its responsibilities.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of cash flows, of operations, and of changes in
stockholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Western Gas Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
1994 and 1993, and the results of their cash flows and their operations for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                        
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS
------------------------------------------------------------

Western Gas Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent gas
gatherer, processor and marketer with operations in major oil and gas-producing
basins in the Rocky Mountain, Gulf Coast and Southwestern regions of the United
States.  Western Gas Resources, Inc. owns and operates natural gas gathering,
processing and storage facilities and markets and transports natural gas and
natural gas liquids ("NGLs").

Western Gas Resources, Inc. was formed in October 1989 to acquire a majority
interest in Western Gas Processors, Ltd. (the "Partnership") and to assume the
duties of WGP Company, the general partner of the Partnership.  The Partnership
had been a Colorado limited partnership formed in 1977 to engage in the
gathering and processing of natural gas.  The reorganization was accomplished in
December 1989 through an exchange for common stock of partnership units held by
the former general partners of WGP Company (the "Principal Stockholders") and an
initial public offering of Western Gas Resources, Inc. common stock.  On May 1,
1991, a further restructuring of the Partnership and Western Gas Resources, Inc.
(together with its predecessor, WGP Company, collectively, the "Company") was
approved by a vote of the security holders. The combinations were
reorganizations of entities under common control and have been accounted for at
historical cost in a manner similar to poolings of interests.  The Company has
restated all historical financial information to reflect the restructuring.

In October 1991, the Company issued 400,000 shares of 7.25% cumulative perpetual
convertible preferred stock ("7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock"), with a
liquidation preference of $100 per share to an institutional investor.

In November 1991, the Company issued 4,115,000 shares of common stock at a
public offering price of $18.375 per share.

In November 1992, the Company issued 1,400,000 shares of $2.28 cumulative
preferred stock ("$2.28 Cumulative Preferred Stock"), with a liquidation
preference of $25 per share, at a public offering price of $25 per share.

In February 1994, the Company issued 2,760,000 shares of $2.625 cumulative
convertible preferred stock ("$2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock"), with a
liquidation preference of $50 per share, at a public offering price of $50 per
share.

SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

   Oasis

Effective December 1, 1994, the Company acquired the West Texas gathering and
treating assets of Oasis Pipe Line Company ("Oasis") for approximately $26.0
million.  The Oasis purchase included 14 gathering systems in the Permian Basin
comprising approximately 600 miles of pipeline and two treating facilities.  In
addition, the Company has entered into a long-term agreement with Oasis for 100
MMcf per day of firm transportation service on its intrastate pipeline.  The
Company will install a 200 MMcf per day pipeline interconnection between this
pipeline and the Katy Facility.

   Mountain Gas

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the stock of Mountain Gas
Resources, Inc. ("Mountain Gas") from Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II,
L.P. for total consideration of approximately $168.2 million, including the
payment of certain transaction costs and the assumption and repayment of $35
million of long-term debt of Mountain Gas.

Mountain Gas owns the Red Desert and Granger facilities, both located near the
Company's Lincoln Road gas processing plant and gathering system.  The 22%
interest in the Granger facility previously not owned by Mountain Gas was
purchased by the Company in two separate transactions in November and December
1993 for an aggregate of $27.7 million.  At the date of acquisition, the Red
Desert facility consisted of a cryogenic plant and the Granger plant consisted
of a refrigeration unit and a cryogenic unit.  In December 1993, the Company
completed construction of an additional cryogenic processing plant at Granger,
at a total additional cost of approximately $4.8 million.

                                       29
<PAGE>

                         WESTERN GAS RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED)
 
In December 1993, a fire at the Granger facility's NGL tank farm required the
facility to be shut down for one week.  The new cryogenic processing plant as
well as the smaller existing cryogenic unit were also damaged.  Construction of
a new tank farm and repairs to the cryogenic units were completed and fully
operational in August 1994. Claims for physical damage to the Company's
facilities totaled approximately $6.7 million, of which $1.8 million had been
received through December 31, 1994.  In addition, the Company has recorded $3.3
million as other revenue for losses covered under its business interruption
insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 1994.  The Company believes
that insurance will cover, subject to certain deductibles, the remaining amounts
outstanding for physical damage, business interruption and third-party property,
and for bodily injury claims, if any.  The Company does not expect uninsured
losses, if any, to be material.

   Black Lake

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company purchased the Black Lake gas processing
plant and related reserves ("Black Lake") from Nerco Oil & Gas, Inc. ("Nerco")
for approximately $136.2 million. The acquisition included a 68.9% working
interest in the Black Lake field in Louisiana and a gas processing plant.  The
purchase also included 50% of the stock of Black Lake Pipeline Company, which
owns a 240 mile liquids pipeline extending from Cotton Valley, Louisiana to Mont
Belvieu, Texas and transports NGLs for Black Lake and three unaffiliated gas
processing plants.  In May 1994, the Company sold its 50% of the stock in Black
Lake Pipeline Company for approximately $5.4 million.  The difference of
approximately $2.5 million between the recorded book value and the sales price
was treated as a purchase price adjustment.

   Westana Joint Venture

Effective August 1, 1993, the Company formed Westana Gathering Company
("Westana"), a general partnership, with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Corporation
("PEPL").  Westana provides gas gathering and processing services in the
Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and markets residue gas and NGLs for producers
connected to its system.  The Company is the principal operator with each
partner holding a 50% ownership interest.

The Company contributed its Chester gas processing plant and gathering system,
with a net book value of $13.8 million, to Westana. Westana also operates PEPL's
400 mile gathering system, which will be contributed to Westana after
abandonment approval by the FERC.  The FERC issued a ruling on March 15, 1995
which the Company is evaluating.  The Company also made additional contractual
partnership contributions of $8.3 million through December 31, 1994 for
necessary modifications to the gathering system.  This contribution is to be
recouped by the Company through preferential partnership distributions.

   Midkiff/Benedum System

Effective October 1, 1992, the Company sold a 20% undivided interest in the
Midkiff and Benedum gas processing plants to the major producer in the area of
the plant for $22 million, resulting in an increase to net income of $2.9
million, or $.11 per share of common stock.  At December 31, 1994 this
percentage approximated 22% and will increase or decrease based upon changes in
throughput volumes at the facilities.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and the Company's
wholly owned subsidiaries are presented here to assist the reader in evaluating
the financial information contained herein. The Company's accounting policies
are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

     Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company's interest in certain
investments is accounted for by the equity method.

                                       30
<PAGE>
 
                          WESTERN GAS RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED)
 
     Revenue Recognition

Revenue for sales or services is recognized at the time the natural gas or NGLs
are sold or at the time the service is performed.

     Reclassification

Certain prior years' amounts in the consolidated financial statements and
related notes have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in
1994.

     Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

Earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income available
to shares of common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding.  Net income available to shares of common stock is net income
less dividends declared on the 7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock,  $2.28
Cumulative Preferred Stock and the $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock . The
computation of fully diluted earnings per share of common stock for the three
years ended December 31, 1994 was not dilutive; therefore, only primary earnings
per share of common stock is presented.

     Inventories

Product inventory includes $47.5 million and $15.5 million of residue gas and
$3.5 million and $5.2 million of NGLs at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Prior to 1992, the cost of residue gas and NGL inventories was determined by the
weighted average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods, respectively,
on a location by location basis. Effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed
its method of accounting for NGL inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method.  The effect of this change was not material to the Company's results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1992.  Residue inventory covered by
hedging contracts is accounted for on a specific identification basis.

     Property and Equipment

Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful life of each facility which ranges from three to 45 years. Useful lives
are determined based on the shorter of the life of the equipment or the reserves
serviced by the equipment. The cost of certain gas purchase contracts is
amortized using the units-of-production method.

Interest incurred during the construction period of new projects is capitalized
and amortized over the life of the associated assets.  Such capitalized interest
was $1.5 million, $4.9 million and $2.1 million,  respectively, for the three
years ended December 31, 1994.

     Oil and Gas Properties and Equipment

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
exploration and production activities. Acquisition costs, development costs and
successful exploration costs are capitalized. Exploratory dry hole costs, lease
rentals and geological and geophysical costs are charged to expense as incurred.
If the undiscounted future net revenue of all proved developed properties does
not exceed the net book value of such properties, a charge for impairment would
be made against income of the period affected. Upon surrender of undeveloped
properties, the original cost is charged against income. Producing properties
and related equipment are depleted and depreciated by the units-of-production
method based on estimated proved reserves for producing properties and proved
developed reserves for lease and well equipment.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED)
 
     Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes for the three years ended December 31, 1994 reflect the
impact of "temporary differences" between amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws.  These
temporary differences are determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and are
more inclusive in nature than "timing differences" as determined under
previously applicable accounting principles.

     Hedging Activities

The Company enters into futures, swaps and option contracts to hedge against a
portion of the price risk associated with natural gas and NGLs. Gains and losses
on hedges of product inventory are included in the carrying amount of the
inventory and are ultimately recognized in sales when the related inventory is
sold. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or
anticipated transactions also are deferred and are recognized in sales when the
hedged transaction occurs.

     Interest Rate Swap Agreements

The Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage
exposure to changes in interest rates. The transactions generally involve the
exchange of fixed and floating interest payment obligations without the exchange
of the underlying principal amounts. In addition to the financial risk that will
vary during the life of these swap agreements in relation to the maturity of the
underlying debt and market interest rates, the Company is subject to credit risk
exposure from nonperformance of the counterparties to the swap agreements.

     Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable.  The risk is
limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer
base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies.  At
December 31, 1994, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The aggregate fair value of all of the Company's financial instruments
approximates the aggregate carrying value.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes all cash balances and highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

     Supplementary Cash Flow Information

Interest paid was $32.8 million, $16.4 million and $12.5 million,  respectively,
for the three years ended December 31, 1994.

Income taxes paid were $1.1 million, $10.2 million and $12.5 million,
respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 1994.

In February 1994, the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company,
surrendered 25,016 shares of the Company's common stock, which were valued at
$31.50 per share based upon the February 22, 1994 closing price, as repayment of
a loan and all accrued interest of approximately $788,000.

In 1994, the Company exchanged its Pyote Treating Facility for the Jayhawk
gathering system in a transaction valued at approximately $800,000.  In 1993,
the Company exchanged its Fairview Gas Processing Plant for various gas
gathering and processing equipment located in Montana and Kansas in a
transaction valued at approximately $3.7 million.

Payments for business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 1993
include the following payments for working capital and other liabilities assumed

NOTE 2 - RELATED PARTIES
------------------------

The Company purchases a significant portion of production from  Williston Gas
Company ("Williston") and Westana for resale to unrelated third parties. Such
purchases from Williston included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
were $8.2 million, $8.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for the three
years ended December 31, 1994.  Purchases from Westana totaled $12.2 million and
$5.3 million, respectively, for the two years ended December 31, 1994.

The Company performs various operational and administrative functions for
Williston and Westana and allocates the actual expenses incurred in performing
the services to each Company.  Such charges for Williston totaled $1.4 million,
$2.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the three years ended December
31, 1994.  Charges to Westana totaled $239,000 and $933,000 for the two years
ended December 31, 1994.

In July 1990, the Company loaned Bill M. Sanderson, President, Chief Operating
Officer and a Director, approximately $748,000 to purchase 294,524 shares of
Common Stock in the Company.  In February 1994, the loan and all accrued
interest was repaid in full by Mr. Sanderson through surrender of 25,016 shares
of the Company's Common Stock, which were valued at $31.50 per share based upon
the February 22, 1994 closing price.

The Company has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan to
certain key employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options as each
portion of their options vests under the Key Employees' Incentive Stock Option
Plan and the Employee Option Plan (See Note 7). The Company will forgive the
loan and accrued interest if the employee has been continuously employed by the
Company for periods specified under the agreements. As of December 31, 1994 and
1993 loans totaling $1.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, were
outstanding to key employees under these programs. The loans are secured by the
common stock issuable upon exercise of the options and are accounted for as a
reduction of stockholders' equity. During 1994, the Board of Directors approved
the forgiveness of loans to a key employee totaling approximately $130,000 after
his resignation and prior to satisfaction of the continuous service requirements
of the loan agreement.

NOTE 3 - RISK MANAGEMENT
------------------------

Natural Gas and NGL Hedges

The Company enters into futures, swaps and option contracts to hedge against a
portion of the price risk associated with natural gas and NGLs.  Gains and
losses on hedges of product inventory are included in the carrying amount of the
inventory and are ultimately recognized in residue and NGL sales when the
related inventory is sold.

                                       33
<PAGE>
 
                          WESTERN GAS RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED)
 
Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated
transactions also are deferred and are recognized in residue and NGL purchases
or sales when the hedged transaction occurs. Margins from the Company's forward
fixed price hedges and physical sales for 1995 are expected to more than offset
the related $6.1 million of losses deferred at December 31, 1994.

At December 31, 1994, 2,257 contracts (net) (10,000 Mcf per contract) for the
sale of residue gas in January 1995 through January 1996 at prices ranging from
$1.55 per Mcf to $2.38 per Mcf were outstanding.  At December 31, 1993, 296 such
contracts were outstanding at prices ranging from $1.87 per Mcf to $2.56 per
Mcf.  No such contracts were outstanding for NGLs at December 31, 1994 or
December 31, 1993.

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage
exposure to changes in interest rates. The transactions generally involve the
exchange of fixed and floating interest payment obligations or the exchange of
foreign and U.S. currencies, without the exchange of the underlying principal
amounts. The net effect of interest rate swap activity is reflected as an
increase or decrease in interest expense. Any gains on termination of interest
rate swap agreements and the effects of foreign currency positions that were
marked to market are included in other income. At December 31, 1994 and 1993,
the total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap agreements
was $50 million. In addition to the financial risk that will vary during the
life of these swap agreements in relation to the maturity of the underlying debt
and market interest rates, the Company is subject to credit risk exposure from
nonperformance of the counterparties to the swap agreements. The Company does
not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

and foreign currency positions for the three years ended December 31, 1994

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED)
 
   FINANCING FACILITIES

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  The Company's variable rate Revolving Credit
Facility, as restated on September 2, 1994, and subsequently amended, with a
syndicate of eight banks, provides for a maximum borrowing base of $325 million,
of which $168.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 1994.  The commitment
decreases to $300 million on January 1, 1995.  If the facility is not renewed
on January 1, 1997, any outstanding balance thereunder converts to a four-year
term loan during which such balance will be repaid in equal quarterly
installments.  The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's
option, at certain spreads over the Eurodollar rate, the Federal Funds rate plus
.50% or at the agent bank's prime rate.  The interest rate spreads are adjusted
based on the Company's debt to capitalization ratio.  At December 31, 1994, the
spread was 1.0% for the Eurodollar rate resulting in an interest rate of 7.17%.

The Company pays a commitment fee on the unused commitment ranging from .15% to
.375% based on the debt to capitalization  ratio.  At December 31, 1994, the
Company's debt to capitalization ratio was in the range of .50 to 1.0 resulting
in a commitment fee rate of .30%.

TERM LOAN FACILITY. The Company also has a Term Loan Facility with four banks
for $50 million which bears interest at 9.87%. Payments on the Term Loan
Facility of $25 million, $12.5 million and $12.5 million are due in September
1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. The $25 million payment due on the Term Note
in September 1995 has been classified as long-term debt as the Company intends
to fund this payment from amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Company's agreement governing the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
(the "Credit Facilities Agreement") is subject to certain mandatory prepayment
terms.  If funded debt of the Company exceeds five times the sum of the
Company's last four quarters' cash flow (as defined in the agreement) less
preferred stock dividends, the overage must be repaid in no more than six
monthly payments commencing 90 days from notification.  This mandatory
prepayment threshold will be reduced to 4.0 to 1.0 at September 1, 1995 and 3.50
to 1.0 at September 1, 1998.  At December 31, 1994, the Company had
approximately $99.8 million of available borrowing capacity.

The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities are unsecured.  The Company is
required to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 (as defined in the
Credit Facilities Agreement), a tangible net worth at December 31, 1994 of at
least $403.2 million, a debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 60% through
October 31, 1995 and 55% thereafter and an EBITDA to interest ratio of not less
than 3.25 to 1.0 through October 31, 1995 and 3.75 to 1.0 thereafter.  The
Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends that exceed the sum of
$35 million plus 50% of consolidated net income earned after March 31, 1994 plus
50% of the cumulative net proceeds in excess of the Redemption Limit (as defined
in the Credit Facilities Agreement) received from the sale of any equity
securities sold after March 31, 1994. At December 31, 1994, this threshold
amounted to approximately $38.2 million.  The Company generally utilizes excess
daily funds to reduce any outstanding revolving credit balances to minimize
interest expense and intends to continue such practice. The $8.7 million cash
balance at December 31, 1994 is an overnight investment necessitated by the
timing of cash receipts.

MASTER SHELF AGREEMENT.  In December 1991, the Company entered into a Master
Shelf Agreement (the "Master Shelf") with The Prudential Insurance Company of
America ("Prudential") pursuant to which Prudential agreed to quote, from time-
to-time, an interest rate at which Prudential or its nominee would be willing to
purchase up to $100 million of the Company's senior promissory notes (the
"Master Notes").  Any such Master Notes must mature in no more than 12 years,
with an average life not in excess of 10 years, and will be unsecured.  On
October 27, 1992, the Company sold $25 million of 7.51% Master Notes due 2000
and $25 million of 7.99% Master Notes due 2003.   Principal payments on the $50
million of Master Notes of $8.3 million will be due on October 27 of each year
from 1998 through 2003.  On September 22, 1993, the Company sold $25 million of
6.77% Master Notes due in a single payment on September 22, 2003 and on December
27, 1993, the Company sold $25 million of 7.23% Master Notes due in a single
payment on December 27, 2003.  The Master Shelf contains certain financial
covenants which conform with those contained in the Credit Facilities Agreement,
as restated.  In July 1993, Prudential and the Company amended the Master Shelf
to provide for an additional $50 million of borrowing capacity (for a total
borrowing capacity of $150 million) and to extend the term of the Master Shelf
to October 31, 1995.  On October 27,

                                       35

1994, the Company sold $25 million of 9.05% Master Notes due in a single payment
on October 27, 2001 and $25 million of 9.24% Master Notes due in a single
payment on October 27, 2004. At December 31, 1994, the Master Shelf Agreement,
as amended, was fully utilized.

SENIOR NOTES.  On April 28, 1993 the Company sold $50 million of 7.65% Senior
Notes due 2003 to a group of insurance companies led by Connecticut General Life
Insurance Company.  Principal payments on the $50 million of Senior Notes of
$7.1 million will be due on April 30th of each year from 1997 through 2002, with
any remaining principal and interest outstanding due on April 30, 2003.  The
Senior Notes contain certain financial covenants which conform with those
contained in the Credit Facilities Agreement, as restated.

ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS. The Company anticipates entering into an agreement with
Receivables Capital Corporation ("RCC"), as administered by Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association ("BA"), to sell an undivided interest in
the Company's trade receivables for a maximum borrowing of $75 million bearing
interest at RCC's commercial paper rate plus .375%. Specific terms of this
agreement have not yet been negotiated; however, the Company anticipates
completion of this agreement in April 1995. On September 2, 1994, in advance of
completing the agreement with RCC, BA entered into a Master Note Agreement
("Short-Term Note") with the Company and advanced the Company $75 million
bearing interest at the Eurodollar rate plus .50% which resulted in an interest
rate of 6.625% at December 31, 1994. The $75 million received under the Short-
Term Note was used to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
has been included in short-term borrowings on the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheet at December 31, 1994. The Company anticipates repaying the Short-Term Note
with proceeds from RCC.

COVENANT COMPLIANCE.  At December 31, 1994, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants in its loan agreements.

Approximate future maturities of long-term debt at the date indicated are as
follows (in 000s):

NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
----------------------------------------------- 

   Mountain Gas

On January 26, 1995, Green River and Mountain Gas entered into an agreement with
Cabot Oil & Gas Production Corporation, as successor to Washington Energy
Exploration, Inc. ("Cabot") settling all claims (both known and unknown) between
the parties relating to events that occurred prior to January 1, 1995, including
claims raised in the case of Green River Gathering Company and Mountain Gas
                             ----------------------------------------------
Resources, Inc. v. Washington Energy Exploration, Inc., Case No. 93CV2696,
------------------------------------------------------                    
District Court, Arapahoe County, Colorado.  As part of the settlement, Mountain
and Cabot have entered into a long-term Gas Gathering Agreement.

On July 28, 1994, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Mountain Gas filed
a complaint in United States District Court, Denver, Colorado, against Morgan
Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P., Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund
II, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporated and certain former directors and
officers of Mountain Gas seeking monetary damages.  The complaint alleges
certain acts and omissions that violated federal and state securities laws by
the defendants in connection with the Company's July 1993 purchase of the stock
of Mountain Gas from Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P.  The acts and
omissions set forth in the complaint relate primarily to defendants' failure to
disclose adequately the nature and scope of the dispute between Mountain Gas and
Washington Energy.  In addition, the Company and Mountain Gas have raised fraud,
misrepresentation and breach of contract claims against certain of the
defendants.

   Katy Condemnation

Commencing in March 1993 and continuing through July 1993, Western Gas Resources
Storage, Inc. ("Storage"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a
total of 165 condemnation actions in the County Court at Law No. 1 and No. 2 of
Fort Bend County, Texas, to obtain certain storage rights and rights-of-way
relating to its Katy Gas Storage Facility and the related underground reservoir
("Katy").  The County Court appointed panels of Special Commissioners which
awarded compensation to the owners whose rights were condemned.  Condemnation
awards are a capital cost of the Katy project.

A majority of the land and mineral owners involved in the condemnation
proceedings appealed to County Court, seeking a declaration that Storage did not
possess the right to condemn or, in the alternative, that they should be awarded
more compensation than previously awarded by the Special Commissioners.  In all
but one of those appeals, the right to condemn issue has been resolved in favor
of Storage, although factual issues in individual cases remain open as to
whether that right was exercised properly.

In August 1994, in the only appeals in which the compensation issue has been
determined, a jury awarded a landowner adjacent to the 82 acre site where the
compression facilities are located a total of $214,000 and another jury awarded
a landowner within 1,000 feet of the 82 acre site a total of $38,000, for
storage rights and damages to property not taken.  The Court also ruled in those
appeals that Storage had properly exercised the right to condemn.  The Special
Commissioners had previously awarded these landowners a total of approximately
$2,000 and $600, respectively.  The Company does not believe that these jury
verdicts are representative of what will occur in subsequent trials, although
there is no assurance of this.  In addition, the Company believes that several
reversible errors were committed at trial and appeals of the jury verdicts are
now pending in the Texas Court of Appeals.

The Company is involved in various other litigation and administrative
proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of
management, any liabilities that may result from these claims, as well as the
specific claims discussed above, will not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

NOTE 7 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
-------------------------------

A discretionary profit sharing plan exists for all Company employees meeting
certain service requirements. The Company makes annual contributions to the plan
as determined by the Board of Directors. Contributions are made to trust funds
administered by an independent investment manager. Contributions were $1.3
million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the three years ended
December 31, 1994.

The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a Key Employees' Incentive
Stock Option Plan and a Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan that authorize
the granting of options to purchase 250,000 and 20,000 shares of the Company's
common stock, respectively. The Board of Directors has granted options to
purchase 240,000 shares of common stock to certain officers and 20,000 shares of
common stock to non-employee directors of the Company, at exercise prices
ranging from $10.71 to $34.00. Each of these options became exercisable as to
25% of the shares covered by it on the later of January 1, 1992 or one year from
the date of grant, subject to the continuation of the optionee's relationship
with the Company, and became exercisable as to an additional 25% of the covered
shares on the latter of each subsequent January 1 through 1995 or on each
subsequent date of grant anniversary, subject to the same condition. The Company
has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan certain key employees
an amount sufficient to exercise their options as each portion of their options
vests. The Company will forgive the associated loan and accrued interest if the
employee has been continuously employed by the Company for four years after the
date of each loan increment.

In April 1987, the Partnership adopted an employee option plan that authorizes
granting options to employees to purchase 430,000 common units in the
Partnership. Pursuant to the Restructuring, the Company assumed the
Partnership's obligation under the employee option plan. The plan was amended
upon the Restructuring to allow each holder of existing options to exercise such
options and acquire one share of common stock for each common unit they were
originally entitled to purchase. The exercise price and all other terms and
conditions for the exercise of such options issued under the amended plan were
the same as under the plan, except that the Restructuring accelerated the time
after which certain options may be exercised. In February 1994, the Board of
Directors retroactively approved, adopted and ratified approximately 53,000
options which were granted to employees in excess of the 430,000 options
originally authorized.  No additional options may be granted under this plan.
Through December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Board of Directors has granted options
under the plan to purchase shares of common stock at $5.40 per share to
approximately 355 employees.  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, approximately
445,000 and 415,000 options were vested and approximately 375,000 and 325,000
options for shares of common stock had been exercised, respectively.  Options
may be exercised only at the rate of 20% of the shares of common stock subject
to such option for each year of continuous service by the optionee commencing
from the later of July 2, 1987 or the optionee's employment commencement date.
The Company has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan to
certain key employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options, provided
that the Company will not loan in excess of 25% of the total amount available to
the employee in any one year. The Company will forgive any associated loan and
accrued interest on July 2, 1997, if the employee is then employed by the
Company. As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, loans related to 190,373 and 162,998
shares of common stock, totaling $1.5 million and $1.2 million, were extended
under these terms.

The 1993 Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") became effective on May 24, 1993
after approval by the Company's stockholders.  The 1993 Plan is intended to be
an incentive stock option plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The Company has reserved
1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of options under the
1993 Plan.  The 1993 Plan will terminate on the earlier of March 28, 2003 or the
date on which all options granted under the 1993 Plan have been exercised in
full.

The Board of Directors of the Company determines and designates from time to
time those employees of the Company to whom options are to be granted.  If any
option terminates or expires prior to being exercised, the shares relating to
such option shall be released and may be subject to reissuance pursuant to a new
option.  The Board of Directors has the right to, among other things, fix the
price, terms and conditions for the grant or exercise of any option.  The
purchase price of the stock under each option shall be the fair market value of
the stock at the time such option is granted.

Options granted will vest 20% each year or the anniversary of the date of grant
commencing with the first anniversary. The employee must exercise the option
within five years of the date each portion vests.   If an employee's employment
with the Company terminates, the employee may, within the 60 day period
immediately following such termination of employment, but in no event later than
the expiration date specified in the Option Agreement, exercise any options that
have vested as of the date of such termination.  If employment terminates by
reason of death or disability, the employee (in the event of disability) or the
person or persons to whom rights under the option shall pass by will or by the
applicable laws of decent and distribution (in the event of death) shall be
entitled to exercise 100% of the options granted regardless of the employee's
years of service; provided however, that no such option may be exercised after
180 days from the date of death or termination of employment with the Company as
a result of disability.  Through December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Board of
Directors has granted approximately 710,000 and 384,000 options, respectively,
at exercise prices ranging from $18.625 to $35.50 per share of common stock to
approximately 455 employees.  Of the options granted under this plan in 1994,
267,000 options were granted to officers of the Company in December 1994 at an
exercise price of $18.625 per share.  At December 31, 1994 approximately 64,025
options were vested.  No options have been exercised under the 1993 plan.

   Reserve Quantity Information

Reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the
estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future
rates of production and the timing of development expenditures.  The accuracy of
such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering
and geological interpretation and judgement.  Results of subsequent drilling,
testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of previous
estimates.  Further, the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable
fluctuate with changes in prices and operating costs.  Reserve estimates, by
their nature, are generally less precise than other financial statement
disclosures.

The following table sets forth information for the two years ended December 31,
1994 with respect to changes in the Company's proved reserves, all of which are
in the United States.  The Company has no significant undeveloped reserves.

     Standardized Measures of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

Estimated discounted future net cash flows and changes therein were determined
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69.  Certain
information concerning the assumptions used in computing the valuation of proved
reserves and their inherent limitations are discussed below.  The Company
believes such information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment
of the data presented.

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas
relating to the Company's proven reserves to the year-end quantities of those
reserves.  Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by
contractual arrangements, including futures contracts, in existence at year-end.

The assumptions used to compute estimated future net revenues do not necessarily
reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues or costs, nor their
present worth.  In addition, variations from the expected production rate also
could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of the Company's
control, such as unintentional delays in development, changes in prices or
regulatory controls.  The reserve valuation further assumes that all reserves
will be disposed of by production.  However, if reserves are sold in place,
additional economic considerations could also affect the amount of cash
eventually realized.

Future development and production costs are computed by estimating the
expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas
reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions.

Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end
statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated,
to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the Company's proved oil and gas
reserves.  Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and
allowances are recognized.

An annual discount rate of 10% was used to reflect the timing of the future net
cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

Information with respect to the Company's estimated discounted future cash flows
from its oil and gas properties for the two years ended December 31, 1994 is as
follows (000s):

                   ---------------------------------------

     (a) The last sentence of the definition of "Debt to Capitalization Ratio"
contained in Section 1.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended in its

     Indebtedness described in Section 6.2(b)(ix)) plus (2) Excess Working
     Capital Deficit."
 
     (b) The last sentence of the definition of Eurodollar Spread found in
Section 1.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read
as follows:

                                      51                           Exhibit 10.34
<PAGE>
 
     "Each of the above listed Eurodollar Spreads will be reduced (an `interest
     rate reduction') by one-eighth of one percent (.125%) upon the issuance (in
     one or more transactions) by Borrower of either Funded Debt which has a
     maturity in excess of six years or capital stock, which issuance results in
     aggregate proceeds (net of expenses) to Borrower of at least $100,000,000
     (a `triggering event'), provided, however, that in the event, the 7.25%
     Cumulative Senior Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of Borrower is
     redeemed, an interest rate reduction shall not become effective until such
     time as both (a) a triggering event has occurred and (b) Borrower has
     received not less than an amount equal to the Redemption Amount in proceeds
     (net of expenses) from the sale or sales of its common or preferred stock
     made after the Redemption Date (in this section referred to as "New Equity
     Proceeds"). Within ten (10) business days after Borrower provides Agent
     with notice of the occurrence of a triggering event and such supporting
     documents or other information as Agent may reasonably request and provided
     that Agent concurs with Borrower that a triggering event has occurred and,
     if applicable, that New Equity Proceeds in the amount of the Redemption
     Amount have been received by Borrower, Agent shall notify Borrower and
     Lenders of the effective date of the reduction of such Eurodollar Spreads
     which shall be the date on which Borrower provided Agent with such notice."

     (c) The following definition of "Redemption Amount" is hereby added to

   Borrower to the holder of the 7.25% Cumulative Senior Perpetual Convertible
   Preferred Stock of Borrower in connection with the redemption of such stock."

     (d) The following definition of "Redemption Date" is hereby added to
Section 1.1 of the Original Agreement immediately following the definition of
"Redemption Amount":

        "Redemption Date" means the date on which any portion of the 7.25%
         ---------------

   Borrower to its stockholders which are permitted under the following

   7.25% Cumulative Senior Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of Borrower, or
   cause or permit any reduction or retirement of the capital stock of or
   partnership interest in any of Borrower and its Subsidiaries.  Borrower may
   make any of the payments, distributions, capital contributions or purchases
   described above in this Section 6.2(a), so long as (I) no Default or Event of
   Default has occurred and is continuing at the time such dividends are

   (zero percent, if negative); plus (C) fifty percent (50.0%) of the cumulative
                                ----                                            
   net proceeds, in excess of the Redemption Amount, received by Borrower and
   its Subsidiaries at any time after March 31, 1994 from the sale of any equity
   securities issued by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries."
