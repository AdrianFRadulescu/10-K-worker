ITEMS 1 AND 2.  BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General Development of the Business

Western Gas Resources, Inc. (the "Company") is an independent gas gatherer and
processor with operations located in major oil and gas-producing basins in the
Rocky Mountain, Gulf Coast and Southwestern regions of the United States. The 
Company owns and operates natural gas gathering, processing and storage 
facilities and markets and transports natural gas and natural gas liquids
("NGLs"). The Company provides necessary services to the producers of natural
gas and NGLs by connecting producers' wells to the Company's gathering system
for delivery to its processing plants, processing the gas to remove NGLs and
by-products and marketing the gas and NGLs throughout the United States. Most
of the natural gas processed by the Company is associated gas from oil wells.
The Company also owns certain producing properties primarily in Louisiana and
Texas.

The Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed in October 1989 to serve as 
general partner of Western Gas Processors, Ltd. (the "Partnership"). The 
Company's initial public offering occurred in December 1989 when the Company 
sold 3,527,500 shares of common stock and used the net proceeds along with 
other assets to acquire a 52% interest in the Partnership. Substantially all 
business activities were conducted through the Partnership. In order to create
a more efficient operating structure and a more liquid publicly-held security,
the Company and the Partnership were merged in May 1991 (the "Restructuring").
In the Restructuring, the Company acquired all the limited partner units it 
did not already own in exchange for 10.2 million shares of newly issued Common
Stock of the Company, all of the Partnership's assets were transferred to the 
Company's direct ownership by operation of law and the Partnership ceased to 
exist. The Restructuring was a reorganization of entities under common control
and has been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling
of interests. The Company has restated all historical financial information to
reflect the Restructuring.

In October 1991, the Company issued 400,000 shares of 7.25% cumulative 
perpetual convertible preferred stock ("7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock") 
with a liquidation preference of $100 per share to an institutional investor.

In November 1991, the Company issued 4,115,000 shares of common stock at a 
public offering price of $18.375 per share.

In November 1992, the Company issued 1,400,000 shares of $2.28 cumulative 
preferred stock ("$2.28 Cumulative Preferred Stock"), with a liquidation 
preference of $25 per share, at a public offering price of $25 per share.

On November 12, 1993, the Company's registration statement filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration") on

                                      3
<PAGE>
 

Form S-3 (Registration No. 33-66516) was declared effective.  The Registration
provides for the sale of up to $200 million of debt securities and preferred 
stock and up to 4 million shares of common stock.  On February 28, 1994, the 
Company sold, pursuant to the Registration, 2,760,000 shares of $2.625 
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("$2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock")
for net proceeds of $133.5 million, which have been used to repay a portion of
the debt incurred under the Company's Revolving Credit facility to acquire 
Mountain Gas Resources, Inc. ("Mountain Gas") and the Black Lake gas 
processing plant and related reserves ("Black Lake").

The Company's principal offices are located at 12200 N. Pecos Street, Denver, 
Colorado 80234-3439, and its telephone number is (303) 452-5603.

Growth, Acquisitions and Dispositions

Since the Company's formation in 1977, its strategy has been to expand through
acquisitions and internal project development.  During 1993, the Company 
continued this expansion by completing a series of acquisitions, forming a 
joint venture and completing the development of the Katy Gas Storage Facility.
These activities have strengthened the Company's position in several major 
producing basins and expanded its access to multiple natural gas markets, 
including East Coast markets which the Company had not previously serviced.  
The table below describes the Company's growth from December 31, 1992 to 
December 31, 1993:

(1)   Pro Forma to give effect only to the Mountain Gas and Black Lake 
      acquisitions described below as if such acquisitions had been completed on
      January 1, 1993.


The Company's major projects, acquisitions and dispositions since January 1, 
1991 are:

  Mountain Gas

On July 29, 1993, effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the stock of 
Mountain Gas from Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P. for total 
consideration of approximately $168.2 million, including the payment of certain 
transaction costs and the assumption and repayment of $35 million of long-term 
debt of Mountain Gas.

                                       4


<PAGE>
 
  Mountain Gas owns the Red Desert and Granger facilities, both located near the
  Company's Lincoln Road gas processing plant and gathering system.  The 22%
  interest in the Granger facility previously not owned by Mountain Gas was
  purchased by the Company in two separate transactions in November and December
  1993 for an aggregate of $27.7 million.  At the date of acquisition, the Red
  Desert facility consisted of a cryogenic plant and the Granger plant consisted
  of a refrigeration unit and a cryogenic unit.  In December 1993, the Company
  completed construction of an additional cryogenic processing plant at Granger,
  at a total cost of $15.2 million.

  In December 1993, a fire at the Granger facility's NGL tank farm required the
  facility to be shut down for one week.  The new cryogenic processing plant as
  well as the smaller existing cryogenic unit were also damaged.  Gas throughput
  at the facility has since reached levels experienced before the fire, and the
  Company expects it to be fully operational in May 1994 when the construction
  of a new tank farm and repairs to the cryogenic units are expected to be
  completed.  The Company believes that insurance will cover, subject to certain
  deductibles, substantially all of the costs related to rebuilding the NGL tank
  farm and the other affected facilities, the interruption of business and
  third-party claims, if any.

    Black Lake

  On September 27, 1993, effective January 1, 1993, the Company purchased Black
  Lake from Nerco Oil & Gas, Inc. for approximately $136.2 million. The
  acquisition includes a 68.9% working interest in the Black Lake field in
  Louisiana and a gas processing plant.  The purchase also included 50% of the
  stock of Black Lake Pipeline Company, which owns a 240 mile liquids pipeline
  extending from Cotton Valley, Louisiana to Mont Belvieu, Texas and transports
  NGLs for Black Lake and three unaffiliated gas processing plants.

    Westana Joint Venture

  Effective August 1, 1993, the Company formed Westana Gathering Company
  ("Westana"), a general partnership, with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
  Corporation ("PEPL").  Westana provides gas gathering and processing services
  in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and markets natural gas and NGLs for
  producers connected to its system.  The Company is the principal operator with
  each partner holding a 50% ownership interest.

  The Company contributed its Chester gas processing plant and gathering system,
  with a net book value of $13.8 million, to Westana. Westana also operates
  PEPL's 400 mile gathering system, which will be contributed to Westana, after
  abandonment approval by the FERC.  The Company is committed to provide an
  additional partnership contribution of $8.3 million, of which $4.8 million was
  contributed through December 31, 1993, for necessary modifications to the
  gathering system.  This contribution will be recouped by the Company through
  preferential partnership distributions.

                                       5

    Katy Gas Storage Facility

  The Company has completed the construction of the Katy Gas Storage Facility
  located approximately 20 miles from Houston, Texas.  Lease acquisition and
  construction costs incurred through December 31, 1993, including pad gas,
  approximate $90 million and excludes capitalized pre-operating costs.  The
  Katy Gas Storage Facility commenced operations in January 1994.  The complex
  consists of a partially depleted natural gas reservoir with over 17 Bcf of
  working gas and the capability to deliver up to 400 MMcf/D of natural gas as
  well as a pipeline header system currently connecting seven pipelines with the
  capability to connect six additional pipelines.

    UTP System

  On November 1, 1991, the Company purchased the gas processing division of
  Union Texas Products Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Texas Petroleum
  Holdings, Inc. (collectively referred to as the "UTP system"). The total
  consideration was $142.7 million. The acquisition included 12 plants in Texas,
  Oklahoma and Louisiana.

     Midkiff/Benedum System

  Effective October 1, 1992, the Company sold a 20% undivided interest (which
  interest may increase based upon future expansion of the plants to accommodate
  increased gas volumes) in the Midkiff and Benedum gas processing plants to the
  major producer in the area of the plant for $22 million.

  Description of Operations

  Historically, the Company has derived over 90% of its revenues from the sale
  of natural gas and NGLs. Set forth below are the Company's revenues by type of
  operation ($000s):

  Gas Gathering and Processing

  The Company contracts with producers to gather raw natural gas from individual
  wells located near its plants.  Once a contract has been executed, the Company
  connects wells to gathering lines through which the natural gas is delivered
  to a processing plant.  At the plant, the natural gas is compressed,
  unfractionated NGLs are extracted, and the remaining dry residue gas is
  treated to meet pipeline quality specifications.  Ten of the Company's
  processing plants can further separate, or fractionate, the mixed NGL stream

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
  into ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline to obtain higher value for
  the NGLs.  In addition, the Reno Junction Isomerization facility converts
  normal butane into iso-butane.  Seven of the Company's plants are able to
  process and treat natural gas containing hydrogen sulfide or other impurities
  which require removal prior to transportation.

  The Company continually acquires additional natural gas supplies to maintain
  or increase throughput levels to offset natural production declines in
  dedicated volumes.  Such natural gas supplies are obtained by purchasing
  existing systems from third parties or by connecting additional wells.  The
  opportunity to connect new wells to existing facilities is primarily affected
  by levels of drilling activity near the Company's gathering systems.  The
  Company believes it has expanded into areas which present significant
  potential for new drilling or purchases of existing systems.  Historically,
  the Company has connected additional reserves which more than offset
  production from reserves dedicated to existing facilities.  However, certain
  individual plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves.  In 1993,
  excluding reserves acquired in the Mountain Gas and Black Lake acquisitions
  and including reserves associated with Westana, the Company connected new
  reserves to its gathering systems replacing 118% of 1993 production.  On a
  Company-wide basis, dedicated reserves, including certain proved undeveloped
  properties, totaled approximately 1.95 Tcf at December 31, 1993.

  Substantially all natural gas flowing through Company facilities is supplied
  under long-term contracts providing for the dedication for purchase or
  processing of such natural gas for periods ranging from 5 to 20 years.  Under
  the typical natural gas purchase contract, the Company is responsible for
  arranging the transportation and marketing of the natural gas and NGLs after
  processing.  However, some contracts are structured as natural gas processing
  arrangements in which gathering and processing services are performed for a
  fee and the producer retains marketing responsibility for the natural gas.

  In most of its gathering areas, the Company's policy is to structure natural
  gas purchase contracts on a percentage-of-proceeds basis under which it is
  entitled to a specified percentage of the net proceeds received from the
  resale of residue gas and NGLs along with ancillary fees for treating,
  compression and marketing services.  Percentage-of-proceeds contracts provide
  for the Company and producers to share proportionally in price changes.  The
  Company's existing contracts typically entitle it to retain the same
  percentage, typically between 20% to 40%, of the net proceeds from the resale
  of residue gas and NGLs.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, percentage-of-
  proceeds contracts accounted for approximately 85% of natural gas throughput
  (exclusive of straddle plants).

  Under its gas processing contracts, the Company collects fees based on the
  volume of natural gas processed or receives a predetermined percentage,
  ranging from 40% to 85%, of the NGLs produced.  For the year ended December
  31, 1993, natural gas processing contracts

                                       7

  accounted for 13% of natural gas throughput and other fee-based contracts
  accounted for 2% of natural gas throughput (exclusive of straddle plants).

  Approximately 70% of the natural gas processed at the recently acquired
  Mountain Gas facilities is subject to contracts that combine gathering and
  compression fees with "keep whole" arrangements.  Typically, the producer is
  charged a gathering and compression fee of $.10 to $.33 per Mcf of natural gas
  gathered and delivered to the processing facility.  In addition, the Company
  retains the NGLs recovered at the processing facility and keeps the producer
  whole by returning to the producer at the tailgate of the plant an amount of
  residue gas equal on a Btu basis to the raw natural gas received at the plant
  inlet.  The fixed nature of the gathering and compression fees reduces the
  Company's exposure to the margin volatility of residue gas and NGLs typically
  experienced in pure "keep-whole" arrangements.  The remaining 30% of contracts
  at the Mountain Gas facilities consists of either percentage-of-proceeds or
  fee-based contracts.

  Marketing

    Natural Gas

  The Company markets residue gas produced at its plants and purchased from
  third parties to end-users, local distribution companies ("LDCs"), pipelines
  and other marketing companies throughout the United States.  The Company's
  success in obtaining markets for residue gas has been an important factor in
  maintaining production levels for its producers and throughput levels for its
  gas plants.  No production behind the Company's facilities has been shut-in or
  curtailed as a result of the Company's failure to perform under its marketing
  agreements.

  In recent years, the Company has significantly increased its marketing
  capabilities.  Increased third party sales and sales attributable to new
  plants have primarily accounted for the increase in average daily gas sales
  from 442 MMcf/D for the year ended December 31, 1992 to 755 MMcf/D for the
  year ended December 31, 1993.  While continuing to increase sales to end-users
  and to achieve greater market penetration close to its facilities, the Company
  has expanded into new markets throughout the United States.

  Most of the Company's current sales contracts are short-term, ranging from a
  few days to one year.  At December 31, 1993, the Company's commitment under
  long-term contracts, several of which have an annual redetermination of prices
  and several of which are rebid prior to expiration, was approximately 170
  MMcf/D.

  The Company intends to maintain its residue gas marketing and third party
  sales to ensure a market for its products.  Third party sales and residue gas
  storage, combined with the stable supply from Company facilities, enable the
  Company to respond quickly to changing market conditions and to take greater
  advantage of seasonal price variations and peak demand periods.  This creates
  an opportunity for the Company to obtain a higher price on average for its
  delivered residue gas than the price obtained by other marketers or brokers.
  The Company customarily stores residue gas in underground storage facilities
  to assure an adequate supply for long-term sales contracts and for resale
  during periods when prices are favorable.  At December 31, 1993, the Company
  held approximately 7.9 Bcf of residue gas inventory in underground storage at
  an average cost of $1.97 per Mcf ($1.81 per MMbtu).  From time to time, the
  Company hedges a portion of its residue gas volumes and requirements under
  residue gas sales contracts on the futures market.

  In order to meet the peaking demand for residue gas in certain markets, the
  Company designed and constructed the Katy Gas Storage Facility.  The ability
  to withdraw gas from the Katy Gas Storage Facility on short notice positions
  the Company to market residue gas to LDCs and other customers that need a
  reliable yet variable

                                       11

  supply of residue gas.  The Katy Gas Storage Facility will also allow the
  Company to bypass transportation bottlenecks and enhance flexibility in its
  marketing operations.  The complex consists of a partially depleted natural
  gas reservoir with over 17 Bcf of working gas and the capability to deliver up
  to 400 MMcf/D of residue gas as well as a pipeline header system currently
  connecting seven  pipelines with the capability to connect six additional
  pipelines.  The pipeline header system, together with the Black Lake
  acquisition, provides access to markets in the Midwest and on the East Coast
  not previously serviced by the Company.

  In December 1993, the Company entered into a three-year winter-peaking gas
  purchase and sales agreement with a major utility in East Texas which
  designates the Katy Gas Storage Facility as the primary delivery point.  Under
  the agreement, the utility has the right to purchase, during each year of the
  contract, up to approximately 30,000 MMBtu of gas per day in November and
  March and 70,000 MMBtu of gas per day in December, January and February,
  determined daily, at the Houston Ship Channel Index Price plus a demand
  charge.  The agreement calls for minimum delivery of three million MMBtu of
  natural gas per year.

  As part of its strategy to penetrate East Coast markets and to utilize Black
  Lake and the Katy Gas Storage Facility more effectively, in July 1993 the
  Company acquired the assets of Citizens National Gas Company which was
  headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  This acquisition provides the company
  with an established East Coast marketing operation which sold an average of
  approximately 350 MMcf/D of natural gas during the first six months of 1993.

  During the year ended December 31, 1992, the Company sold residue gas to
  approximately 150 end-user, pipeline, LDC and other customers.  As a result of
  the Citizens acquisition, the number of residue gas customers increased to
  approximately 315 for the year ended December 31, 1993, further reducing the
  Company's reliance on any single customer.  No single customer accounted for
  more than 10% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993.

    NGL Marketing

  The Company markets NGLs (ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, natural
  gasoline, and condensate) produced at its plants and purchased from third
  parties to the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions.  A
  majority of the Company's production of NGLs now moves to the Gulf Coast area,
  which is the largest NGL market in the United States.  Through the development
  of end-use markets and distribution capabilities, the Company ensures that
  production from the plants moves on a reliable basis and avoids curtailment of
  production.

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
  The volatility of NGL prices over the past years has caused the Company to
  move to short-term contracts, with no prices set on a firm basis for more than
  a 30-day period.  Although some contracts do commit the Company for periods as
  long as a year, prices are redetermined on a market-related basis.  Storage
  space is leased at the major trading locations, near Houston and in central
  Kansas, in order to store products so that they can be sold at higher prices
  on a seasonal basis.  At December 31, 1993, approximately 17.3 million gallons
  of NGLs were in storage at an average cost of $.30  per gallon.  The Company
  generally intends that stored liquids turn over on an annual basis.

  For the year ended December 31, 1993, NGL sales averaged 2,941 MGal per day,
  an increase from 2,400 MGal per day in 1992.  Sales were made to approximately
  170 different customers and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of
  the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993.
  Revenues are also derived from marketing fees charged to some producers for
  NGL marketing services.  At December 31, 1993, such fees were less than 1% of
  the Company's consolidated revenues.

  Producing Properties

  Revenues derived from the Company's producing properties comprised
  approximately 3.4% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993.  The
  producing properties are primarily working interests in a unit operated by the
  Company in the Black Lake field in Louisiana which provides production to the
  Black Lake plant and 20 gas units/wells producing from the Smackover formation
  of the East Texas Basin which provide production to the Edgewood plant. Eight
  of these units/wells are operated by the Company. The Company also has working
  interests in six units in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming and
  three gas wells in the San Juan Basin in southwest Colorado.

  Competition

  The Company competes with other companies in the gathering, processing,
  marketing and transmission business both for supplies of residue gas and for
  customers to which to sell its residue gas and NGLs. Competition for residue
  gas supplies is primarily based on efficiency, reliability, availability of
  transportation and ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producers'
  residue gas. Competition for customers is primarily based upon reliability
  and/or price of deliverable residue gas and NGLs.  For customers that have the
  capability of using alternative fuels, such as oil and coal, the Company also
  competes based primarily on price against companies capable of providing such
  alternative fuels.

  Environmental Matters

  The construction and operation of the Company's gathering lines, plants and
  other facilities used for the gathering, transporting, processing, treating or
  storing of residue gas and NGLs are subject to federal, state and local
  environmental laws and regulations, including those that can impose
  obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the Company's facilities or at
  facilities to which the Company sends wastes for disposal.  In most instances,
  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution
  control or solid waste management procedures.  The Company believes that it is
  in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and
  regulations.  Environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning,
  designing, constructing and operating the Company's facilities.  The Company
  believes that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and
  regulations have not and will not have a material effect on the Company's
  results of operation.

  In 1990, the Congress enacted the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean
  Air Act") which impose more stringent standards on emissions of certain
  pollutants and require the permitting of certain existing air emissions
  sources.  Many of the regulations have not been promulgated and until their
  promulgation, the Company cannot make a final assessment of the impact of the
  Clean Air Act.  However, based upon its preliminary review of the proposed
  regulations, the Company does not anticipate that compliance with the Clean
  Air Act will require any material capital expenditures, although it will
  increase permitting costs in 1994 and 1995 and may increase certain operating
  costs on an on-going basis.  The Company does not believe that such cost
  increases will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.

  The Company believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend in
  environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter
  standards.  The Company is unaware of future environmental standards that are
  reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the
  Company's results of operations, but cannot rule out that possibility.

  The Company is in the process of cleaning up certain releases of non-hazardous
  substances at facilities that it operates.  In addition, the former owner of
  certain facilities that the Company acquired in 1992 is conducting cleanups at
  those facilities pursuant to contractual obligations.  The Company's
  expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing
  facilities have not been significant in relation to the results of operations
  of the Company and totaled approximately $1.4 million for the year ended
  December 31, 1993.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company paid an
  aggregate of approximately $565,000 in air emissions fees to the states in
  which it operated.  Although the Company anticipates that such air emissions
  fees will increase over

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
  time, the Company does not believe that such increases will have a material
  effect on the Company's results of operations.

  The Company employs six environmental engineers to monitor environmental
  compliance and potential liabilities at its facilities.  Prior to consummating
  any major acquisition, the Company's environmental engineers perform audits on
  the facilities to be acquired.  In addition, on an on-going basis, the
  environmental engineers perform informal environmental assessments of the
  Company's existing facilities.  To date, the Company has not found any
  material environmental noncompliance or cleanup liabilities, the costs of
  which would reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a material
  effect on the Company's results of operations.

  Regulation

  The purchase and sale of natural gas and the fees received for gathering and
  processing by the Company have generally not been subject to regulation, and
  therefore, except as constrained by competitive factors, it has considerable
  pricing flexibility.  Many aspects of the gathering, processing, marketing and
  transportation of natural gas and NGLs by the Company, however, are subject to
  federal, state and local laws and regulations which can have a significant
  impact upon the Company's overall operations.

  As a processor and marketer of natural gas, the Company is dependent on the
  transportation and storage services offered by various interstate pipeline
  companies to enable the delivery and sale of its own gas supplies as well as
  those it processes and/or markets for others.  Both the performance of
  transportation and storage services by interstate pipelines, and the rates
  charged for such services, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
  Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the
  "NGA") and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the "NGPA").  The availability
  of interstate transportation and storage service necessary to enable the
  Company to make deliveries and/or sales of residue gas can at times be pre-
  empted by other system users in accordance with FERC-approved methods for
  allocating the system capacity of "open access" pipelines.  Moreover, the
  rates charged by pipelines for such services are often subject to negotiation
  between shippers and the pipelines within certain FERC-established parameters
  and will periodically vary depending upon individual system usage and other
  factors.  An inability to obtain transportation and/or storage services at
  competitive rates can hinder the Company's processing and marketing operations
  and/or affect its sales margins.

  During the past ten years the FERC has implemented a nondiscriminatory blanket
  transportation program which initially authorized, and ultimately mandated,
  interstate natural gas pipelines to perform "open access," self-implementing
  (i.e., not
  -----     

                                       15

  generally requiring case-specific certificate authorization) transportation
  services.  Order Nos. 636, et seq., which constitute the FERC's most recent
                             -------                                         
  issuances in this program, promulgated regulations that substantially
  restructure the services provided by interstate pipelines by "unbundling"
  (i.e. separating) and separately pricing pipeline gathering, transportation,
  -----                                                                       
  storage and sales activities in an effort to enable non-pipeline merchants to
  compete with pipelines for gas purchasers on an equal basis.  These
  regulations have largely been implemented by all interstate transporters
  utilized by the Company (as well as by the Company's own non-major interstate
  pipeline located in Wyoming) in numerous individual pipeline restructuring and
  rate proceedings.  The conversion of pipelines from natural gas merchants to
  primarily transporters of gas through implementation of the FERC's open access
  transportation and restructuring programs has caused the pipelines to incur
  significant producer take-or-pay costs and other transition costs resulting
  from their abandonment of gas purchasing and sales activities.  The FERC has
  allowed, and indicated in Order Nos. 636, et seq. that it will continue to
                                            ------                          
  allow, the recovery of some or all of these and related costs from current
  shippers of gas.  Pipeline flow-through of many of these costs is subject to
  the outcome of administrative and appellate proceedings in individual pipeline
  rate and restructuring cases, and Order No. 636, et seq. themselves are
                                                   ------                
  currently the subject of numerous petitions for appellate review presently
  pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
  Circuit.  The outcome of these proceedings could affect the Company's
  operations and the costs of transporting and selling gas.

  FERC Order Nos. 490, et seq. issued in 1988, provide for the abandonment of
                       ------                                                
  certain sales and purchases of natural gas previously dedicated to interstate
  commerce under the NGA without receiving case-specific abandonment authority,
  under certain circumstances where such is contractually permissible.  Although
  the Company has utilized the regulations promulgated by these orders to
  terminate and/or modify certain of its gas purchases and sales contracts,
  judicial review of such orders has been sought in proceedings pending before
  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  Vacation of these orders
  could result in a finding that certain of the Company's contracts had been
  improperly terminated; however, subsequent legislative and administrative
  decontrol of wellhead prices of natural gas would have the effect of limiting
  any potential adverse impact upon the Company which might ultimately result
  from such an appellate holding.

  Pursuant to the Section 1(b) of the NGA, production and gathering activities
  are exempt from the FERC's jurisdiction; however, judicial precedent has held
  that where gathering is performed largely in connection with the delivery of
  gas in interstate commerce, such gathering can be considered merely an
  extension of the jurisdictional transportation of such gas and thus subject to
  NGA rate regulation itself.  Recently, primarily as a result of the

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
  aforementioned unbundling of interstate pipeline gathering services required
  by Order No. 636, et seq., the FERC has undertaken an administrative inquiry
                    ------                                                    
  into the questions of whether and to what degree the gathering activities of
  providers of these services (particularly those with interstate pipeline
  affiliates) can and should be regulated under the NGA.  The Company engages
  extensively in natural gas gathering activities in conjunction with its
  operations of gas processing facilities and elsewhere, and it could be
  affected by the FERC's final determination of the questions being examined.
  At this initial stage, however, the probable outcome and impact of these FERC
  inquiries is too speculative to predict.

  Employees

  At December 31, 1993, the Company employed 825 full-time employees, none of
  whom was a union member.  The Company considers relations with employees to be
  excellent.

  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    Toca

  On March 4, 1993, the Company filed a complaint against Warren Petroleum
  Company, Arco Oil & Gas Co., Conoco Inc., Trident NGL, Inc. and other owners
  of the Yscloskey Gas Plant located in Louisiana (the "Owners") in the United
  States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging various
  violations by the defendants of the federal anti-trust laws in connection with
  a Hydrocarbon Fractionation Agreement at its Toca plant between the Company
  and the Owners of the Yscloskey plant.  The Company also filed a companion
  state-court action involving the same parties in Civil District Court for the
  Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, which the defendants removed to United
  States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  The Company and
  Warren Petroleum Company (in its capacity as the designated Operator for the
  Yscloskey Plant) have recently negotiated a new Hydrocarbon Fractionation
  Agreement, which has been executed by substantially all of the Owners of the
  Yscloskey Plant.  The new 15-year agreement provides for a reduced
  fractionation fee of 9.25% and eliminates the uncertainty regarding uneconomic
  performance of the Yscloskey plant.  The Company anticipates dismissing the
  various complaints with prejudice.

    Edgewood

  On January 16, 1991, problems at the Company's Edgewood Plant relating to both
  equipment that removes hydrogen sulfide from unprocessed natural gas and the
  monitoring equipment owned by the purchaser of the residue gas, Enserch
  Corporation, doing business as Lone Star Gas Company ("Lone Star"), allowed
  residue gas containing hydrogen sulfide to enter Lone Star's transmission line
  supplying residue gas to Emory, Texas.

  The Company has been named as a co-defendant, along with Lone Star, in the
  following complaints relating to the incident: Gary Prather, et al. v. Enserch

  ---------------                            

  All the cases have been filed in the District Court, Rains County, Texas,
  354th Judicial District, and make similar claims, asserting, among other
  things, that the defendants breached an implied

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
  warranty of merchantability, falsely represented that the residue gas was
  safe, were negligent and are liable under a strict liability theory.  The
  plaintiffs have alleged a variety of respiratory and neurological illnesses
  and are seeking treble damages, exemplary damages and attorneys' fees.  Prior
  to the filing of the complaints, the Company received demand letters from the
  plaintiffs that sought, in the aggregate, approximately $36 million.  Damages
  claimed in the lawsuits are in excess of $13.5 million.

  The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims and
  intends to defend vigorously against any such claims.  The Company is
  currently conducting extensive pre-trial discovery.  The underwriters of the
  Company's general liability insurance policy have indicated preliminarily that
  such policy appears to cover the types of claims that have been asserted,
  subject to their right to deny coverage based upon, among other things, final
  determination of causation and the exact nature of the damages.

    Granger

  On December 6, 1993, Green River Gathering Company ("Green River") and
  Mountain Gas filed a complaint against Washington Energy Exploration, Inc.
  ("Washington Energy") in District Court in Arapahoe County, Colorado seeking
  the payment of certain outstanding receivables from Washington Energy and a
  declaratory judgment that the gathering agreement between Washington Energy
  and Green River is in full force and effect.  Mountain Gas is a wholly-owned
  subsidiary of the Company and Green River is a partnership owned by the
  Company and Mountain Gas.  Washington Energy is the operator of wells
  producing approximately 33% of the natural gas transported through the Green
  River Gathering system to Mountain Gas' Granger facility.

  On December 27, 1993, Washington Energy filed an answer, counterclaim,
  crossclaim and request for trial by jury, denying  the substance of the
  allegations and asserting certain affirmative defenses.  Washington Energy has
  also made certain counterclaims seeking monetary damages relating to Green
  River's performance under the gathering agreement and under a processing
  agreement between the parties, along with a declaratory judgment that both
  agreements have been terminated.  In addition, Washington Energy has made a
  crossclaim against two unaffiliated entities, each of which owned a portion of
  Green River during a portion of the period in question.

  The Company believes that Green River is in compliance with the gathering
  agreement and the processing agreement and that both are in full force and
  effect.  The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the
  counterclaims and intends to defend vigorously against any such claims.  The
  Company is currently conducting extensive pre-trial discovery.

     Katy

  Commencing in March 1993 and continuing through July 1993, Western Gas
  Resources Storage, Inc. ("Storage"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
  filed a total of 165 condemnation actions in the County Court at Law No. 1 and
  No. 2 of Fort Bend County, Texas to obtain certain storage rights and rights-
  of-way relating to its Katy Gas Storage Facility.  The County Court appointed
  panels of Special Commissioners that have awarded compensation to the owners
  whose rights were condemned.  Certain of the land and mineral owners are
  seeking in County Court a declaration that Storage does not possess the right
  to condemn, or, in the alternative, that they should be awarded more
  compensation than previously awarded by the Special Commissioners.  The
  Company believes that the outcome of such proceedings will not materially
  affect operation of the Katy Gas Storage Facility.  The likelihood of any
  particular result, however, cannot be determined because the condemnation law
  under which the proceedings are being brought has never been interpreted by
  the courts.

    Woods/Moncrief

  In February 1994, the United States Appeals Court for the Tenth Circuit
  affirmed a district court judgment against the Company in the amount of $2.9
  million, including interest, in Western Gas Processors Ltd. v. Woods Petroleum
                                  ----------------------------------------------
  Corporation and W.A. Moncrief, Jr., d/b/a Moncrief Oil Company, which related
  --------------------------------------------------------------               
  to claims by certain producers that they had been underpaid.  The Company has
  taken a charge to litigation reserves in the year ended December 31, 1993, in
  the amount of $2.4 million, as a result of the appellate court decision.  The
  Company will not take any further action.

  The Company paid annual dividends on the Common Stock aggregating $.20 per
  share during the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992.  The Company has
  declared a dividend of $.05 per share of common stock for the quarter ending
  March 31, 1994 to holders of record as of such date.  Declarations of
  dividends are within the discretion of the Board of Directors and are
  dependent upon various factors, including the earnings, cash flow, capital
  requirements and financial condition of the Company. In addition, the
  Company's ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in its
  credit facilities including a prohibition on declaring or paying dividends
  that exceed, in the aggregate, the sum of $25 million plus 50% of the
  Company's consolidated net income earned after March 31, 1993 plus 50% of the
  cumulative net proceeds received from the sale of any equity securities sold
  after March 31, 1993.  At December 31, 1993, this threshold amounted to $39
  million, or $106 million subsequent to the issuance of 2,760,000 shares of
  $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock in February 1994.

  Net income decreased $1.6 million and net cash provided by operating
  activities increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1993
  compared to the same period in 1992.

  Revenues from the sale of residue gas increased $284.1 million for the year
  ended December 31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992 due to an increase
  in residue gas prices of $.30 per Mcf and an increase in sales volumes of 315
  MMcf per day.  Of this volume increase, 246 MMcf per day is attributable to an
  increase in the sale of residue gas purchased from third parties, in part due
  to the acquisition of Citizens.   The remaining volume increase is the result
  of increased production volumes at the Company's facilities, primarily due to
  the Mountain Gas and Black Lake acquisitions as well as new well hookups at
  the Midkiff/Benedum and Giddings facilities.

                                       24
<PAGE>
 
  Revenues from the sale of NGLs increased $43.7 million for the year ended
  December 31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992 due to an increase in
  NGL  sales volumes of 545  MGal  per day which was somewhat offset by a $.01
  per gallon decrease in the price of NGLs. Of the volume increase, 377 MGal per
  day is attributable to an increase in the sale of NGLs purchased from third
  parties.  The remaining volume increase is the result of increased production
  volumes at the Company's facilities,  primarily due to the Mountain Gas and
  Black Lake acquisitions as well as new well hookups at the Midkiff/Benedum and
  Giddings facilities.

  Other revenues increased approximately $1 million for the year ended December
  31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992 due to the termination of certain
  hedging transactions and interest rate swap agreements in 1993 which resulted
  in an increase of approximately $5.5 million compared to the same period in
  1992.  This increase was offset by the sale in 1992 of a 20% undivided
  interest in the Midkiff/Benedum gas processing plants to the major producer in
  the area of the plant for a pre-tax gain of approximately $4.5 million.

  Historically, product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales
  from the Company's plant production approximated 70%.   Product purchases as a
  percentage of residue gas and NGL sales from third-party purchases is
  substantially higher than the historical percentage and approximates 95%.  The
  increase in the Company's combined percentage is primarily due to a
  significantly larger increase in the sales volume of products purchased from
  third parties compared to the sales volume sold from the Company's facilities.
  As a result, total  product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL
  sales increased approximately  6.3% to 81.5% for the year ended December 31,
  1993 compared to the same period in 1992.

  Plant operating expense increased $7.3 million for the year ended December 31,
  1993 compared to the same period in 1992 primarily due to the Mountain Gas and
  Black Lake acquisitions and an increase in repair and maintenance charges
  incurred at facilities acquired from UTP.

  Selling and administrative expense increased $4.2 million as a result of
  higher payroll and benefit charges and professional fees resulting from the
  Company's growing operations and its preparation for the Katy Gas Storage
  Facility, a litigation reserve established for the Woods/Moncrief lawsuit and
  franchise taxes resulting from the Company's expansion into states which do
  not charge income taxes, somewhat offset by increased overhead capitalized to
  the Company's construction projects.  In 1993, overhead capitalized to the
  Company's construction projects increased approximately $3.3 million when
  compared to the same period in 1992.  Amounts capitalized to such projects in
  1994 are expected to decline due to

                                       25
<PAGE>
 
  the completion of several major projects and fewer projects currently under
  construction by the Company.

  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $17.5 million for
  the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to the same period in 1992 is
  primarily due to the Mountain Gas and Black Lake acquisitions.  In January
  1994, the Katy Gas Storage Facility commenced operations and, as a result,
  depreciation, depletion and amortization expense associated with the Katy Gas
  Storage Facility will be approximately $3.0 million per year.

  Interest expense increased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1993
  compared to the same period in 1992 due to higher average long-term debt
  outstanding.  In 1993, interest incurred and capitalized during the
  construction period of new projects increased approximately $2.8 million when
  compared to the same period in 1992.  Amounts capitalized to such projects in
  1994 are expected to decline due to the completion of several major projects
  and fewer projects currently under construction by the Company.  This increase
  will be more than offset by a reduction in interest expense related to the
  application of the net proceeds of $133.5 million from the sale of 2,760,000
  shares of $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock in February 1994 against the
  Company's Revolving Credit Facility.

  In 1993, the corporate income tax rate was increased from 34% to 35%.  This
  rate increase resulted in an increase in deferred income taxes of
  approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1993.

 
Year ended December 31, 1992 compared to year ended December 31, 1991.

  Net income and net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.8
  million and $58.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1992
  compared to the same period in 1991.

  Average gas prices increased $.13 per Mcf and average NGL prices decreased
  $.04 per gallon for the year ended December 31, 1992 compared to the same
  period in 1991, while average gas sales increased 132 MMcf per day and average
  NGL sales increased 1,303 MGal per day.  Revenues from the sale of residue gas
  and NGLs increased $99.3 million and $140.0 million, respectively, for the
  year ended December 31, 1992 compared to the same period in 1991.  These
  increases were primarily the result of increased production from Company
  facilities due to the acquisition of 12 plants from UTP in November 1991 and
  an increase in the sale of products purchased from third parties.  Other
  revenues increased $6.0 million, primarily as a result of a $4.5 million gain
  on the sale of a 20% interest in the Midkiff and Benedum facilities in the
  fourth quarter of 1992.

  Product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and NGL sales increased 1.3%
  to 75.2% in 1992 compared to 1991.  Product purchases as a percentage of
  residue gas and NGL sales of production from the Company's facilities is
  approximately 70%.  Increasing the historical percentage are purchases of
  third party products which typically have a lower profit margin.  The increase
  in plant operating expense for the year ended December 31, 1992 compared to
  the same period in 1991 was primarily due to the acquisition of the UTP
  facilities.  Selling and administrative expense increased $8.7 million for the
  year ended December 31, 1992 compared to the same period in 1991 primarily due
  to higher salary and benefit costs, insurance and other administrative
  expenses related to the Company's acquisition of the UTP facilities.  In
  addition, selling and administrative expenses increased as a result of
  additional franchise taxes due to increased operations in Texas and increased
  costs related to the Company's ongoing evaluation of potential acquisitions.

  The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1992
  compared to the same period in 1991 was primarily due to the acquisition of
  the UTP facilities.  Effective January 1, 1992, the Company reviewed the
  economic useful lives of its plant assets.  As a result of this review, the
  lives of certain of these assets were changed to reflect more closely their
  remaining economic useful lives.  The effect of this change was not material
  to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1992.  The
  decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1992 compared to
  the same period in 1991 was due to lower bank rates on variable rate
  borrowings and lower average long-term debt outstanding.

                                       27

  The decrease in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income
  before taxes resulted from a reduction in the deferred income tax rate as
  prescribed by SFAS No. 109.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources

  The Company's sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have
  been net cash provided by operating activities, funds available under its
  financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities.  In the
  past, these sources have been sufficient to meet the needs and finance the
  growth of the Company's business.  Net cash provided by operating activities
  has been primarily affected by product prices, the Company's success in
  increasing the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of
  natural gas processed by such facilities and the margin on third party residue
  gas purchased for resale.  The Company's continued growth will be dependent
  upon success in the areas of additions to dedicated plant reserves,
  acquisitions, new project development and marketing.

  In the three years ended December 31, 1993, the Company's total sources of
  funds aggregated $823.9 million and was comprised of net cash provided by
  operating activities of $233.4 million, net borrowings under its credit
  agreement of $426.7 million, net proceeds received from the exercise of common
  stock options of $1.3 million, net proceeds from the issuance of the $2.28
  Cumulative Preferred Stock of $33.4 million, net proceeds from the issuance of
  the 7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock of $38.2 million, net proceeds from the
  issuance of Common Stock of $71.3 million and net proceeds received from the
  disposition of property and equipment of $19.6 million.   During the same
  period, the Company's use of such funds aggregated $819.5 million which were
  used primarily to make capital investments of $793.9 million, to pay dividends
  to holders of Common Stock of $12.3 million, to pay dividends to holders of
  7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock and $2.28 Cumulative Preferred Stock of $9.1
  million and to make distributions to minority interest holders in predecessor
  company of $4.2 million.

  On November 12, 1993, the Registration on Form S-3 (Registration No. 33-66516)
  was declared effective.  The Registration provides for the sale of up to $200
  million of debt securities and preferred stock and up to 4 million shares of
  common stock.  On February 28, 1994, the Company sold, pursuant to the
  Registration, 2,760,000 shares of $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock for net
  proceeds of $133.5 million, which have been used to repay a portion of the
  debt incurred under the Company's Revolving Credit facility in the Mountain
  Gas and Black Lake acquisitions.

  The Company has been successful overall in replacing production with new
  reserves.  However, volumes of natural gas dedicated to some of the Company's
  plants have declined during recent years because additions to dedicated plant
  reserves have not fully offset

                                       28
<PAGE>
 
  production.  In 1993, excluding reserves acquired in the Mountain Gas and
  Black Lake acquisitions and including reserves associated with Westana, the
  Company connected new reserves to its gathering systems replacing 118% of 1993
  production.  On a Company-wide basis, dedicated reserves, including certain
  proved undeveloped properties, totaled approximately 1.95 Tcf at December 31,
  1993.

  An additional source of liquidity to the Company is volumes of residue gas and
  NGLs in storage facilities.  The Company stores volumes of residue gas and
  NGLs primarily to assure an adequate supply for long-term sales contracts and
  for resale during periods when prices are favorable.  At December 31, 1993,
  the Company held in storage approximately 17.3 million gallons of NGLs at an
  average cost of $.30 per gallon and 7.9 Bcf of residue gas at an average cost
  of $1.97 per Mcf ($1.81 per MMbtu).

  From time to time, the Company contracts on the futures market for the
  purchase and/or sale of stored residue gas and NGL products as a hedge against
  price changes.  At December 31, 1993, 296 net contracts (10,000 MMbtus per
  contract) for the sale of residue gas in February 1994 through March 1995 at
  prices ranging from $1.87 per Mcf to $2.56 per Mcf were outstanding.  At
  December 31, 1993, no such contracts for NGLs were outstanding.

     Capital Investment Program

  Between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 1993, the Company expended
  approximately $793.9 million on new projects and currently has authorized an
  additional $94.0 million for 1994.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the
  Company expended $491.4 million on the Mountain Gas and Black Lake
  acquisitions, the construction of the Katy Gas Storage Facility, connection of
  new reserves, acquire consolidating assets for existing systems and upgrades
  to existing and newly acquired facilities.  For the year ended December 31,
  1992, the Company expended a total of $68.4 million on the Katy Gas Storage
  Facility, the acquisition of gathering systems connecting new reserves to
  existing systems and upgrades to newly acquired facilities.  For the year
  ended December 31, 1991, the Company expended a total of $234.1 million for
  the acquisition, construction and development of various facilities, including
  the UTP, Edgewood and Midkiff systems and the Reno Junction Isomerization
  facility, and the acquisition of producing gas wells.  The Company financed
  the UTP acquisition by the private placement of $40 million of Convertible
  Preferred Stock with an institutional investor and with $100 million of long-
  term debt from its existing bank group.  This long-term debt was subsequently
  reduced with the net proceeds of $71.3 million received from a common stock
  offering in November 1991.

  The Company has completed the construction of the Katy Gas Storage Facility.
  Lease acquisition and construction costs incurred through December 31, 1993,
  including pad gas, approximate $90 million and

                                       29
<PAGE>
 
  excludes capitalized pre-operating costs.  The Katy Gas Storage Facility
  commenced operations in January 1994.  The complex consists of a partially
  depleted natural gas reservoir with over 17 Bcf of working gas and the
  capability to deliver up to 400 MMcf/D of natural gas as well as a pipeline
  header system currently connecting seven pipelines with the capability to
  connect six additional pipelines.

  In order to maintain the volumes of natural gas dedicated to or processed by
  the Company's existing facilities, future capital expenditures for gathering
  systems needed to connect new reserves, acquire consolidating assets and to
  maintain existing facilities are anticipated to be approximately $25 million
  to $30 million per year.  The availability of new reserves at existing
  facilities is somewhat affected by the price of crude oil or natural gas
  (depending on whether the natural gas is associated gas or gas well gas) which
  in turn stimulates new drilling at higher price levels.  The Company
  anticipates spending an additional $64 million to $69 million on other capital
  projects.

  Depending on the timing of the Company's future projects, it may be required
  to seek additional sources of capital.  The Company's ability to secure such
  capital is restricted by its credit facilities, although it may request
  additional borrowing capacity from the banks, seek waivers from the banks to
  permit it to borrow funds from third parties, seek replacement credit
  facilities from other lenders or issue additional equity securities.  While
  the Company believes that it would be able to secure additional financing, if
  required, no assurance can be given that it will be able to do so or as to the
  terms of any such financing.

     Financing Facilities

  Revolving Credit Facility.  In August 1993, the Company renegotiated a
  Revolving Credit Facility with its agent bank, and in September 1993 the agent
  bank completed the syndication of the facility with seven additional banks.

  The Company's variable rate Revolving Credit Facility provides for a maximum
  borrowing of $400 million, of which $345 million was outstanding at December
  31, 1993, and, if not renewed, on August 31, 1996 any outstanding balance
  thereunder converts to a four-year term during which such balance will be
  repaid in equal quarterly installments.  At the Company's option, the
  Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at certain spreads over the
  Eurodollar rate or at the agent bank's prime rate.  The interest rate spreads
  were adjusted based on the Company's earnings ratio (earnings before interest
  and taxes divided by interest expense).  At December 31, 1993, the spread was
  1.0% for the Eurodollar rate resulting in an interest rate of 4.13% at
  December 31, 1993.

                                       30
<PAGE>
 
  The Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused commitment of .25% if the
  earnings ratio is greater than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0 or .375% if the ratio is
  less than 4.5 to 1.0.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company's
  earnings ratio was approximately 4.4 to 1.0.

  Term Loan Facility.  The Company also has a Term Loan Facility with four banks
  for $50 million which bears interest at 9.87%.  Payments on the Term Loan
  Facility of $25 million, $12.5 million and $12.5 million are due in September
  1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.

  The Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities are subject to certain
  mandatory prepayment terms.  If funded debt under these facilities exceeds
  four times the sum of the Company's last four quarters' cash flow (as defined
  in the agreement), the overage must be repaid in no more than six monthly
  payments commencing 90 days from notification.  This mandatory prepayment
  threshold will be reduced to 3.75 to 1.00 at December 31, 1994 and 3.50 to
  1.00 at December 31, 1995.

  The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility are unsecured.  The
  Company is required to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0, a
  tangible net worth of at least $247 million, a debt to capitalization ratio of
  no more than 65% through March 31, 1994, 60% from April 1, 1994 through
  October 31, 1995 and 55% thereafter and an earnings ratio of not less than 2.0
  to 1.0.  The Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends that
  exceed the sum of $25 million plus 50% of consolidated net income earned after
  March 31, 1993 plus 50% of the cumulative net proceeds received from the sale
  of any equity securities sold after March 31, 1993. At December 31, 1993, this
  threshold amounted to $39 million, or $106 million subsequent to the issuance
  of the 2,760,000 shares of $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock in February
  1994.  The Company generally utilizes excess daily funds to reduce any
  outstanding revolving credit balances to minimize interest expense and intends
  to continue such practice.

  Master Shelf Agreement.  In December 1991, the Company entered into a Master
  Shelf Agreement (the "Master Shelf") with The Prudential Insurance Company of
  America ("Prudential") pursuant to which Prudential agreed to quote, from
  time-to-time, an interest rate at which Prudential or its nominee would be
  willing to purchase up to $100 million of the Company's senior promissory
  notes (the "Senior Notes").  Any such Senior Notes must mature in no more than
  12 years, with an average life not in excess of 10 years, and will be
  unsecured.  On October 27, 1992, the Company sold $25 million of 7.51% Senior
  Notes due 2000 and $25 million of 7.99% Senior Notes due 2003.   Principal
  payments on the $50 million of Senior Notes of $8.3 million will be due on
  October 27 of each year from 1998 through 2003.  On September 22, 1993, the
  Company sold $25 million of 6.77% Senior Notes due in a single payment on
  September 22, 2003 and on December 27, 1993, the Company sold $25 million of
  7.23%

                                       31
<PAGE>
 
  Senior Notes due in a single payment on December 27, 2003.  The Master Shelf
  contains certain financial covenants which conform with those contained in the
  Revolving Credit Facility.  In July 1993, Prudential and the Company amended
  the Master Shelf to provide for an additional $50 million of borrowing
  capacity (for a total borrowing capacity of $150 million) and to extend the
  term of the Master Shelf to October 31, 1995.

  Senior Notes.  On April 28, 1993 the Company sold $50 million of 7.65% Senior
  Notes due 2003 to a group of insurance companies led by Connecticut General
  Life Insurance Company.  Principal payments on the $50 million of Senior Notes
  of $7.1 million will be due on April 30th of each year from 1997 through 2002
  with any remaining principal and interest outstanding due on April 30, 2003.
  The Senior Notes contain certain financial covenants which conform with those
  contained in the Revolving Credit Facility.

  Covenant Compliance.  At December 31, 1993, the Company was in compliance with
  or has obtained necessary waivers related to all of its debt covenants.

  Interest Rate Swap Agreements.  From time to time, the Company enters into
  interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
  The transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest
  payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
  In 1993, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements,
  totaling $175 million of notional principal amount, resulting in a pre-tax
  gain of approximately $3.6 million.

  The Company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the
  Revolving Credit Facility and the Master Shelf together with cash provided
  from operations, will provide it with sufficient financing to connect new
  reserves, maintain its existing facilities and complete its current capital
  improvement projects.  The Company also believes that cash provided from
  operations will be sufficient to meet its debt service and preferred stock
  dividend requirements.

     Miscellaneous

  The construction and operation of the Company's gathering lines, plants and
  other facilities used for the gathering, transporting, processing, treating or
  storing of residue gas and NGLs are subject to federal, state and local
  environmental laws and regulations, including those that can impose
  obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the Company's facilities or at
  facilities to which the Company sends wastes for disposal.  In most instances,
  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution
  control or solid waste management procedures.  The Company believes that it is
  in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and
  regulations.  Environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning,

                                       32
<PAGE>
 
  designing, constructing and operating the Company's facilities.  The Company
  believes that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and
  regulations have not and will not have a material effect on the Company's
  results of operation.

  In 1990, the Congress enacted the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean
  Air Act") which impose more stringent standards on emissions of certain
  pollutants and require the permitting of certain existing air emissions
  sources.  Many of the regulations have not been promulgated and until their
  promulgation, the Company cannot make a final assessment of the impact of the
  Clean Air Act.  However, based upon its preliminary review of the proposed
  regulations, the Company does not anticipate that compliance with the Clean
  Air Act will require any material capital expenditures, although it will
  increase permitting costs in 1994 and 1995 and may increase certain operating
  costs on an on-going basis.  The Company does not believe that such cost
  increases will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations,
  but cannot rule out that possibility.

  The Company believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend in
  environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter
  standards.  The Company is unaware of future environmental standards that are
  reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the
  Company's results of operations.

  The Company is in the process of cleaning up certain releases of non-hazardous
  substances at facilities that it operates.  In addition, the former owner of
  certain facilities that the Company acquired in 1992 is conducting cleanups at
  those facilities pursuant to contractual obligations.  The Company's
  expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing
  facilities have not been significant in relation to the results of operations
  of the Company and totaled approximately $1.4 million for the year ended
  December 31, 1993.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company paid an
  aggregate of approximately $565,000 in air emissions fees to the states in
  which it operated.  Although the Company anticipates that such air emissions
  fees will increase over time, the Company does not believe that such increases
  will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.

  The Company employs six environmental engineers to monitor environmental
  compliance and potential liabilities at its facilities.  Prior to consummating
  any major acquisition, the Company's environmental engineers perform audits on
  the facilities to be acquired.  In addition, on an on-going basis, the
  environmental engineers perform informal environmental assessments of the
  Company's existing facilities.  To date, the Company has not found any
  material environmental noncompliance or cleanup liabilities, the costs of
  which would reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a material
  effect on the Company's results of operations.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

  The financial statements and other financial information included in this
  Annual Report on Form 10-K are the responsibility of management.  The
  financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and include amounts
  that are based on management's informed judgments and estimates.

  Management relies on the Company's system of internal accounting controls to
  provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions
  are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's
  authorization.  The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the
  recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal
  accounting control and that the cost of such systems should not exceed the
  benefits to be derived.  The internal accounting controls in place during the
  periods presented are considered adequate to provide such assurance.

  The Company's financial statements are audited by Price Waterhouse,
  independent accountants.  Their report states that they have conducted their
  audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  These
  standards include an evaluation of the system of internal accounting controls
  for the purpose of establishing the scope of audit testing necessary to allow
  them to render an independent professional opinion on the fairness of the
  Company's financial statements.

  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of directors
  who are not employees of the Company, reviews the Company's financial
  reporting and accounting practices.  The Audit Committee meets periodically
  with the independent accountants and management to review the work of each and
  to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities.

  To the Board of Directors and
  Stockholders of Western Gas Resources, Inc.

  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
  consolidated statements of cash flows, of operations, and of changes in
  stockholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
  position of Western Gas Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
  1993 and 1992, and the results of their cash flows and their operations for
  each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
  with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are
  the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
  express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We
  conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
  auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
  material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
  the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
  and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
  our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

  NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS
  -------------------------------------------------------------
                              
  Western Gas Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent gas
  gatherer and processor with operations in major oil and gas-producing basins
  in the Rocky Mountain, Gulf Coast and Southwestern regions of the United
  States.  Western Gas Resources, Inc. owns and operates natural gas gathering,
  processing and storage facilities and markets and transports natural gas and
  natural gas liquids ("NGLs").

  Western Gas Resources, Inc. was formed in October 1989 to acquire a majority
  interest in Western Gas Processors, Ltd. (the "Partnership") and to assume the
  duties of WGP Company, the general partner of the Partnership.  The
  Partnership had been a Colorado limited partnership formed in 1977 to engage
  in the gathering and processing of natural gas.  The reorganization was
  accomplished in December 1989 through an exchange for common stock of
  partnership units held by the former general partners of WGP Company (the
  "Principal Stockholders") and an initial public offering of Western Gas
  Resources, Inc. common stock.  At December 31, 1990, Western Gas Resources,
  Inc. held a 51.8% partnership interest in the Partnership and the Principal
  Stockholders owned 65.7% of Western Gas Resources, Inc.'s common stock and a
  40.2% direct interest in the Partnership.  The remaining 8.0% of the interest
  in the Partnership was owned by public holders of the Partnership's $1.80
  cumulative participating preference units ("PPUs") (including 7.8% of the PPUs
  held by the Principal Stockholders).

  On May 1, 1991, a further restructuring of the Partnership and Western Gas
  Resources, Inc. (together with its predecessor, WGP Company, collectively, the
  "Company") was approved by a vote of the security holders.  As a result of the
  affirmative vote on the restructuring, the Partnership prepaid the remaining
  preference distributions to the PPU holders in the second quarter of 1991 and
  the Company acquired all of the remaining limited partner units in exchange
  for 10.2 million shares of newly issued common stock of the Company, all of
  the Partnership's assets were transferred to the Company by operation of law
  as a result of the merger, the Company directly owned all assets and was
  subject to all obligations of the Partnership, and the Partnership ceased to
  exist.

  The combinations described above were reorganizations of entities under common
  control and have been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to
  poolings of interests.  The Company has restated all historical financial
  information to reflect the restructuring.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)


  In October 1991, the Company issued 400,000 shares of 7.25% cumulative
  perpetual convertible preferred stock ("7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock")
  with a liquidation preference of $100 per share to an institutional investor.

  In November 1991, the Company issued 4,115,000 shares of common stock at a
  public offering price of $18.375 per share.

  In November 1992, the Company issued 1,400,000 shares of $2.28 cumulative
  preferred stock ("$2.28 Cumulative Preferred Stock"), with a liquidation
  preference of $25 per share, at a public offering price of $25 per share.

  On November 12, 1993, the Company's registration statement filed with the
  Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration") on Form S-3
  (Registration No. 33-66516) was declared effective.  The Registration provides
  for the sale of up to $200 million of debt securities and preferred stock and
  up to 4 million shares of common stock.  On February 17, 1994, the Company
  filed a Prospectus Supplement under the Registration for the sale of 2,760,000
  shares of $2.625 cumulative convertible preferred stock ("$2.625 Convertible
  Preferred Stock").  On February 25, 1994 the Company closed the offering
  providing for net proceeds of $133.5 million.

  Significant Business Acquisitions and Dispositions

    Mountain Gas

  On July 29, 1993, effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the stock of
  Mountain Gas Resources, Inc. ("Mountain Gas") from Morgan Stanley Leveraged
  Equity Fund II, L.P. for total consideration of approximately $168.2 million,
  including the payment of certain transaction costs and the assumption and
  repayment of $35 million of long-term debt of Mountain Gas.

  Mountain Gas owns the Red Desert and Granger facilities, both located near the
  Company's Lincoln Road gas processing plant and gathering system.  The 22%
  interest in the Granger facility previously not owned by Mountain Gas was
  purchased by the Company in two separate transactions in November and December
  1993 for an aggregate of $27.7 million.  At the date of acquisition, the Red
  Desert facility consisted of a cryogenic plant and the Granger plant consisted
  of a refrigeration unit and a cryogenic unit.  In December 1993, the Company
  completed construction of an additional cryogenic processing plant at Granger,
  at a total cost of $15.2 million.

                          WESTERN GAS RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)


  In December 1993, a fire at the Granger facility's NGL tank farm required the
  facility to be shut down for one week.  The new cryogenic processing plant as
  well as the smaller existing cryogenic unit were also damaged. Gas throughput
  at the facility has since reached levels experienced before the fire, and the
  Company expects it to be fully operational in May 1994 when the construction
  of a new tank farm and repairs to the cryogenic units are expected to be
  completed.  The Company believes that insurance will cover, subject to certain
  deductibles, substantially all of the costs related to rebuilding the NGL tank
  farm and the other affected facilities, the interruption of business and
  third-party claims, if any.

    Black Lake

  On September 27, 1993, effective January 1, 1993, the Company purchased Black
  Lake gas processing plant and related reserves ("Black Lake") from Nerco Oil &
  Gas, Inc. ("Nerco") for approximately $136.2 million. The acquisition includes
  a 68.9% working interest in the Black Lake field in Louisiana and a gas
  processing plant.  The purchase also includes 50% of the stock of Black Lake
  Pipeline Company, which owns a 240 mile liquids pipeline extending from Cotton
  Valley, Louisiana to Mont Belvieu, Texas and transports NGLs for Black Lake
  and three unaffiliated gas processing plants.

  Pro forma condensed results of operations for the years ended December 31,
  1993 and 1992 give effect to the acquisition and financing of Mountain Gas and
  Black Lake and the issuance and sale by the Company of 2,760,000 shares of
  $2.625 Convertible Preferred Stock assuming that each transaction occurred on
  January 1 for each year presented below. The pro forma results have been
  prepared for comparative purposes only and are not indicative of the results
  of operations which actually would have resulted had the acquisitions occurred
  on the dates indicated, or which may result in the future (in $000s).

     Westana Joint Venture

  Effective August 1, 1993, the Company formed Westana Gathering Company
  ("Westana"), a general partnership, with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
  Corporation ("PEPL").  Westana provides gas gathering and processing services
  in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and markets residue gas and NGLs for
  producers connected to its system.  The Company is the principal operator with
  each partner holding a 50% ownership interest.

  The Company contributed its Chester gas processing plant and gathering system,
  with a net book value of $13.8 million, to Westana. Westana also operates
  PEPL's 400 mile gathering system, which will be contributed to Westana, after
  abandonment approval by the FERC.  The Company is committed to provide an
  additional partnership contribution of $8.3 million, of which $4.8 million was
  contributed through December 31, 1993, for necessary modifications to the
  gathering system.  This contribution will be recouped by the Company through
  preferential partnership distributions.

    UTP System

  On November 1, 1991, the Company purchased the gas processing division of
  Union Texas Products Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Texas Petroleum
  Holdings, Inc. (collectively referred to as the "UTP system"). The total
  consideration was $142.7 million. The acquisition included 12 plants in Texas,
  Oklahoma and Louisiana.

    Edgewood System

  Effective January 1, 1991, the Company purchased the Edgewood Gas Processing
  Plant and a majority interest in the related production (collectively called
  the "Edgewood system") from Amoco Production Company for $36 million.  The
  Edgewood system includes a gas processing plant and a sulfur recovery unit.
  Effective July 1, 1991, the Company also acquired an approximate 80% working
  interest in three producing gas wells in the Fruitvale field behind the
  Edgewood plant.

    Midkiff/Benedum System

  Effective October 1, 1992, the Company sold a 20% undivided interest (which
  interest may increase based upon future expansion of the plants to accommodate
  increased gas volumes) in the Midkiff and Benedum gas processing plants to the
  major producer in the area of the plant for $22 million, or an increase to net
  income of $2.9 million, or $.11 per share of common stock.

    Accounting Policies

  The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and the Company's
  wholly-owned subsidiaries are presented here to assist the reader in
  evaluating the financial information contained herein. The Company's
  accounting policies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting
  principles.

   Principles of Consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
  the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
  transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company's interest in
  certain investments is accounted for by the equity method.

   Revenue Recognition

  Revenue for sales or services is recognized at the time the gas or NGLs are
  sold or at the time the service is performed.

   Reclassification

  Certain prior years' amounts in the consolidated financial statements and
  related notes have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in
  1993.

   Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

  Earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net income
  available to shares of common stock by the weighted average number of shares
  of common stock outstanding.  Net income available to shares of common stock
  is net income less dividends declared on the 7.25% Convertible Preferred Stock
  and $2.28 Cumulative Preferred Stock. The computation of fully diluted
  earnings per share of common stock for the years ended December 31, 1993 and
  1992 was antidilutive, therefore, only primary earnings per share of common
  stock is presented.

   Inventories

  Product inventory includes $15.5 million and $11.6 million of residue gas and
  $5.2 million and $5.4 million of NGLs at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
  respectively.

  Prior to 1992, the cost of residue gas and NGL inventories was determined by
  the weighted average cost and the first-in, first-out

                                       47

  (FIFO) methods, respectively, on a location by location basis. Effective
  January 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of accounting for NGL
  inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  The effect of this
  change was not material to the Company's results of operations for the year
  ended December 31, 1992.

  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. At
  December 31, 1991, NGL inventories were written down to reflect market value,
  resulting in a $1.4 million reduction in inventory value and a related charge
  to earnings.

  Property and Equipment

  Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method based on the estimated
  useful life of each facility which ranges from three to 45 years. Useful lives
  are determined based on the shorter of the life of the equipment or the
  reserves serviced by the equipment. The cost of certain gas purchase contracts
  is amortized using the units-of-production method. Effective January 1, 1992,
  the Company reviewed the economic useful lives of its plant assets. As a
  result of this review, the lives of certain of these assets were changed to
  reflect more closely their remaining economic useful lives.  The effect of
  this change was not material to the results of operations for the year ended
  December 31, 1992.

  The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and
  gas exploration and production activities. Acquisition costs, development
  costs and successful exploration costs are capitalized. Exploratory dry hole
  costs, lease rentals and geological and geophysical costs are charged to
  expense as incurred. If the undiscounted future net revenue of all proved
  developed properties does not exceed the net book value of such properties, a
  charge for impairment would be made against income of the period affected.
  Upon surrender of undeveloped properties, the original cost is charged against
  income. Producing properties and related equipment are depleted and
  depreciated by the units-of-production method based on estimated proved
  developed reserves of oil and gas.

  Interest incurred during the construction period of new projects is
  capitalized and amortized over the life of the associated assets.  Such
  capitalized interest was $4.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.3 million,
  respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 1993.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)


    Income Taxes

  In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement
  of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income
  Taxes", retroactive to January 1, 1992.  SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition
  of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
  consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements
  or income tax returns.  Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets
  are determined based on the difference between the financial statement
  carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
  rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
  Adoption of SFAS No. 109 did not have a material effect on the Company's
  results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1992.  Prior years'
  financial statements have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS
  No. 109.

  Deferred income taxes for 1993 and 1992 reflect the impact of "temporary
  differences" between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
  purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws.  These temporary
  differences are determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and are more
  inclusive in nature than "timing differences" as determined under previously
  applicable accounting principles.

  A pro forma provision for income taxes has been provided in the financial
  statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 1991 for
  comparability to its taxable status after the restructuring.  Prior to the
  restructuring, the Predecessor Company was not subject to Federal income tax
  since the tax effects of its activities accrued to its partners.

   Futures Contracts

  The Company, from time to time, enters into futures contracts to hedge against
  a portion of the price risk associated with residue gas and NGLs.  Changes in
  the market value of futures contracts are accounted for as additions to or
  reductions in inventory.  Gains and losses resulting from changes in the
  market value of futures contracts are recognized when the related inventory is
  sold.  At December 31, 1993, 296 such contracts (net) (10,000 MMbtus per
  contract) for the sale of residue gas in February 1994 through March 1995 at
  prices ranging from $1.87 per Mcf to $2.56 per Mcf were outstanding.  At
  December 31, 1993, no such contracts for NGLs were outstanding.

   Interest Rate Swap Agreements

  The Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage
  exposure to changes in interest rates. The transactions generally involve the
  exchange of fixed and floating interest payment obligations without the
  exchange of the underlying principal amounts. At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
  the total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap
  agreements was $50 million.  In addition to the financial risk that will vary
  during the life of these swap agreements in relation to the maturity of the
  underlying debt and market interest rates, the Company is subject to credit
  risk exposure from nonperformance of the counterparties to the swap
  agreements.

   Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash and cash equivalents includes all cash balances and highly liquid
  investments with a maturity of three months or less.

   Supplementary Cash Flow Information

  Interest paid was $16.4 million, $12.5 million and $12.9 million,
  respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 1993.

  Income taxes paid were $10.2 million, $12.5 million and $6.6 million,
  respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 1993.

  Payments for business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 1993
  include the following payments for working capital and other liabilities

 NOTE 2-RELATED PARTIES

  The Company purchases a significant portion of the Williston Gas Company
  ("Williston") and Westana production for resale to unrelated third parties.
  Such purchases from Williston included in the Consolidated Statement of
  Operations were $8.6 million, $4.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for
  the three years ended

  December 31, 1993.  Purchases from Westana totaled $5.3 million for the year
  ended December 31, 1993.

  The Company performs various operational and administrative functions for
  Williston and Westana and allocates the actual expenses incurred in performing
  the services to each Company.  Such charges for Williston totaled $2.4
  million, $3.2 million, and $4.0 million, respectively, for the three years
  ended December 31, 1993.  Charges to Westana totaled $933,000 for the year
  ended December 31, 1993.

  During the year ended December 31, 1990, an officer and director of the
  Company borrowed $748,000 from the Company for the purpose of exercising
  options to purchase 294,524 shares of common stock in the Company. Interest is
  accrued at a rate equal to the interest rate paid by the Company on its
  Revolving Credit Facility and is payable annually on December 31 during the
  term of the note with all unpaid principal and accrued interest due and
  payable on January 1, 1996.  The note is secured by the common stock and is
  accounted for as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

  The Company has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan to
  certain key employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options as each
  portion of their options vests under the Key Employees' Incentive Stock Option
  Plan and the Employee Option Plan. The Company will forgive the loan and
  accrued interest if the employee has been continuously employed by the Company
  for periods specified under the agreements. As of December 31, 1993 and 1992
  loans totaling $1.2 million and $730,000, respectively, were outstanding to
  key employees under these programs. The loans are secured by the common stock
  and are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

  Financing Facilities

  Revolving Credit Facility.  In August 1993, the Company renegotiated a
  Revolving Credit Facility with its agent bank, and in September 1993 the agent
  bank completed the syndication of the facility with seven additional banks.

  The Company's variable rate Revolving Credit Facility provides for a maximum
  borrowing of $400 million, of which $345 million was outstanding at December
  31, 1993, and, if not renewed, on August 31, 1996 any outstanding balance
  thereunder converts to a four-year term during which such balance will be
  repaid in equal quarterly installments.  At the Company's option, the
  Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at certain spreads over the
  Eurodollar rate or at the agent bank's prime rate.  The interest rate spreads
  were adjusted based on the Company's earnings ratio (earnings before interest
  and taxes divided by interest expense).  At December 31, 1993, the spread was
  1.0% for the Eurodollar rate resulting in an interest rate of 4.13% at
  December 31, 1993.

  Term Loan Facility.  The Company also has a Term Loan Facility with four banks
  for $50 million which bears interest at 9.87%.  Payments on the Term Loan
  Facility of $25 million, $12.5 million and $12.5 million are due in September
  1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.

  The Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused commitment of .25% if the
  earnings ratio is greater than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0 or .375% if the ratio is
  less than 4.5 to 1.0.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company's
  earnings ratio was approximately 4.4 to 1.0.

  The Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities are subject to certain
  mandatory prepayment terms.  If funded debt under these facilities exceeds
  four times the sum of the Company's last four quarters' cash flow (as defined
  in the agreement), the overage must be repaid in no more than six monthly
  payments commencing 90 days from notification.  This mandatory prepayment
  threshold will be reduced to 3.75 to 1.00 at December 31, 1994 and 3.50 to
  1.00 at December 31, 1995.

  The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility are unsecured.  The
  Company is required to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0, a
  tangible net worth of at least $247 million, a debt to capitalization ratio of
  no more than 65% through March 31, 1994, 60% from April 1, 1994 through
  October 31, 1995 and 55% thereafter and an earnings ratio of not less than 2.0
  to 1.0.  The Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends that
  exceed the sum

  of $25 million plus 50% of consolidated net income earned after March 31, 1993
  plus 50% of the cumulative net proceeds received from the sale of any equity
  securities sold after March 31, 1993. The Company generally utilizes excess
  daily funds to reduce any outstanding revolving credit balances to minimize
  interest expense and intends to continue such practice.

  Master Shelf Agreement.  In December 1991, the Company entered into a Master
  Shelf Agreement (the "Master Shelf") with The Prudential Insurance Company of
  America ("Prudential") pursuant to which Prudential agreed to quote, from
  time-to-time, an interest rate at which Prudential or its nominee would be
  willing to purchase up to $100 million of the Company's senior promissory
  notes (the "Senior Notes").  Any such Senior Notes must mature in no more than
  12 years, with an average life not in excess of 10 years, and will be
  unsecured.  On October 27, 1992, the Company sold $25 million of 7.51% Senior
  Notes due 2000 and $25 million of 7.99% Senior Notes due 2003.  Principal
  payments on the $50 million of Senior Notes of $8.3 million will be due on
  October 27 of each year from 1998 through 2003.  On September 22, 1993, the
  Company sold $25 million of 6.77% Senior Notes due in a single payment on
  September 22, 2003 and on December 27, 1993, the Company sold $25 million of
  7.23% Senior Notes due in a single payment on December 27, 2003.  The Master
  Shelf contains certain financial covenants which conform with those contained
  in the Revolving Credit Facility.  In July 1993, Prudential and the Company
  amended the Master Shelf to provide for an additional $50 million of borrowing
  capacity (for a total borrowing capacity of $150 million) and to extend the
  term of the Master Shelf to October 31, 1995.

  Senior Notes.  On April 28, 1993 the Company sold $50 million of 7.65% Senior
  Notes due 2003 to a group of insurance companies led by Connecticut General
  Life Insurance Company.  Principal payments on the $50 million of Senior Notes
  of $7.1 million will be due on April 30th of each year from 1997 through 2002
  with any remaining principal and interest outstanding due on April 30, 2003.
  The Senior Notes contain certain financial covenants which conform with those
  contained in the Revolving Credit Facility.

  Covenant Compliance.  At December 31, 1993, the Company was in compliance with
  or has obtained necessary waivers related to all of its debt covenants.

  Interest Rate Swap Agreements.  From time to time, the Company enters into
  interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
  The transactions generally involve the

  During the year ended December 31, 1991, deferred income taxes principally
  were provided for significant timing differences in the recognition of revenue
  and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes.  These items
  principally consisted of the excess of tax depreciation, depletion and
  amortization over that deducted for financial reporting purposes.

  NOTE 5-COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

    Toca

  On March 4, 1993, the Company filed a complaint against Warren Petroleum
  Company, Arco Oil & Gas Co., Conoco Inc., Trident NGL, Inc. and other owners
  of the Yscloskey Gas Plant located in Louisiana (the "Owners") in the United
  States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging various
  violations by the defendants of the federal anti-trust laws in connection with
  a Hydrocarbon Fractionation Agreement at its Toca plant between the Company
  and the Owners of the Yscloskey plant.  The Company also filed a companion
  state-court action involving the same parties in Civil District Court for the
  Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, which the defendants removed to United
  States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  The Company and
  Warren Petroleum Company (in its capacity as the designated Operator for the
  Yscloskey Plant) have recently negotiated a new Hydrocarbon Fractionation
  Agreement, which has been executed by substantially all of the Owners of the
  Yscloskey Plant.  The new 15-year agreement provides for a reduced
  fractionation fee of 9.25% and eliminates the uncertainty regarding uneconomic
  performance of the Yscloskey plant.  The Company anticipates dismissing the
  various complaints with prejudice.

    Edgewood

  On January 16, 1991, problems at the Company's Edgewood Plant relating to both
  equipment that removes hydrogen sulfide from unprocessed natural gas and the
  monitoring equipment owned by the purchaser of the residue gas, Enserch
  Corporation, doing business as Lone Star Gas Company ("Lone Star"), allowed
  residue gas containing hydrogen sulfide to enter Lone Star's transmission line
  supplying residue gas to Emory, Texas.

  The Company has been named as a co-defendant, along with Lone Star, in the
  following complaints relating to the incident: Gary Prather, et al. v. Enserch

                        -------------------------------                      
  1994.

  All the cases have been filed in the District Court, Rains County, Texas,
  354th Judicial District, and make similar claims, asserting, among other
  things, that the defendants breached an implied warranty of merchantability,
  falsely represented that the residue gas was safe, were negligent and are
  liable under a strict liability theory.  The plaintiffs have alleged a variety
  of respiratory and neurological illnesses and are seeking treble damages,
  exemplary damages and attorneys' fees.  Prior to the filing of the complaints,
  the Company received demand letters from the plaintiffs that sought, in the
  aggregate, approximately $36 million.  Damages claimed in the lawsuits are in
  excess of $13.5 million.

  The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims and
  intends to defend vigorously against any such claims.  The Company is
  currently conducting extensive pre-trial discovery.  The underwriters of the
  Company's general liability insurance policy have indicated preliminarily that
  such policy appears to cover the types of claims that have been asserted,
  subject to their right to deny coverage based upon, among other things, final
  determination of causation and the exact nature of the damages.

    Granger

  On December 6, 1993, Green River Gathering Company ("Green River") and
  Mountain Gas filed a complaint against Washington Energy Exploration, Inc.
  ("Washington Energy") in District Court in Arapahoe County, Colorado seeking
  the payment of certain outstanding receivables from Washington Energy and a
  declaratory judgment that the gathering agreement between Washington Energy
  and Green River is in full force and effect.  Mountain Gas is a wholly-owned
  subsidiary of the Company and Green River is a partnership owned by the
  Company and Mountain Gas.  Washington Energy is the operator of wells
  producing approximately 33% of the natural gas transported through the Green
  River Gathering system to Mountain Gas' Granger facility.

  On December 27, 1993, Washington Energy filed an answer, counterclaim,
  crossclaim and request for trial by jury, denying  the substance of the
  allegations and asserting certain affirmative defenses.  Washington Energy has
  also made certain counterclaims seeking monetary damages relating to Green
  River's performance under the gathering agreement and under a processing
  agreement between the parties, along with a declaratory judgment that both

                                       57

  agreements have been terminated.  In addition, Washington Energy has made a
  crossclaim against two unaffiliated entities, each of which owned a portion of
  Green River during a portion of the period in question.

  The Company believes that Green River is in compliance with the gathering
  agreement and the processing agreement and that both are in full force and
  effect.  The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the
  counterclaims and intends to defend vigorously against any such claims.  The
  Company is currently conducting extensive pre-trial discovery.

    Katy

  Commencing in March 1993 and continuing through July 1993, Western Gas
  Resources Storage, Inc. ("Storage"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
  filed a total of 165 condemnation actions in the County Court at Law No. 1 and
  No. 2 of Fort Bend County, Texas to obtain certain storage rights and rights-
  of-way relating to its Katy Gas Storage Facility.  The County Court appointed
  panels of Special Commissioners that have awarded compensation to the owners
  whose rights were condemned.  Certain of the land and mineral owners are
  seeking in County Court a declaration that Storage does not possess the right
  to condemn, or, in the alternative, that they should be awarded more
  compensation than previously awarded by the Special Commissioners.  The
  Company believes that the outcome of such proceedings will not materially
  affect operation of the Katy Gas Storage Facility.  The likelihood of any
  particular result, however, cannot be determined because the condemnation law
  under which the proceedings are being brought has never been interpreted by
  the courts.

    Woods/Moncrief

  In February 1994, the United States Appeals Court for the Tenth Circuit
  affirmed a district court judgment against the Company in the amount of $2.9
  million, including interest, in Western Gas Processors Ltd. v. Woods Petroleum
                                  ----------------------------------------------
  Corporation and W.A. Moncrief, Jr., d/b/a Moncrief Oil Company, which related
  --------------------------------------------------------------               
  to claims by certain producers that they had been underpaid.  The Company has
  taken a charge to litigation reserves in the year ended December 31, 1993, in
  the amount of $2.4 million, as a result of the appellate court decision.  The
  Company will not take any further action.

  NOTE 6-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

  A discretionary profit sharing plan exists for all Company employees meeting
  certain service requirements. The Company makes annual contributions to the
  plan as determined by the Board of Directors. Contributions are made to bank
  trust funds administered by an independent investment manager. Contributions
  were $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in the three
  years ended December 31, 1993.

  The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a Key Employees' Incentive
  Stock Option Plan and a Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan that authorize
  the granting of options to purchase 250,000 and 20,000 common shares of the
  Company, respectively. The Board of Directors has granted options to purchase
  240,000 common shares to certain officers and 15,000 common shares to three
  non-employee directors of the Company, at exercise prices ranging from $10.71
  to $34.00. Each of these options became exercisable as to 25% of the shares
  covered by it on the later of January 1, 1992, or one year from the date of
  grant, subject to the continuation of the optionee's relationship with the
  Company, and became exercisable as to an additional 25% of the covered shares
  on each subsequent January 1 through 1995 or on the later of each subsequent
  date of grant anniversary, subject to the same condition. The Company has
  entered into agreements committing the Company to loan certain key employees
  an amount sufficient to exercise their options as each portion of their
  options vests. The Company will forgive the loan and accrued interest if the
  employee has been continuously employed by the Company for four years after
  the date of the loan.

  In April 1987, the Partnership adopted an employee option plan that authorizes
  granting options to employees to purchase 430,000 common units in the
  Partnership. Pursuant to the Restructuring, the Company assumed the
  Partnership's obligation under the Employee option plan. The plan was amended
  upon the Restructuring to allow each holder of existing options to exercise
  such options and acquire one share of common stock for each common unit they
  were originally entitled to purchase. The exercise price and all other terms
  and conditions for the exercise of such options issued under the amended plan
  were the same as under the plan, except that the Restructuring accelerated the
  time after which certain options may be exercised.  Through December 31, 1993
  and 1992, the Board of Directors has granted options under the plan to
  purchase shares of common stock at $5.40 per share to approximately 355 and
  350 employees, respectively.  As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, approximately
  415,000 and 390,000 options were vested and

                                       59
<PAGE>
 
                          WESTERN GAS RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)


  approximately 325,000 and 240,000 options for common shares had been
  exercised, respectively. In February 1994, the Board of Directors
  retroactively approved, adopted and ratified approximately 53,000 options
  which were granted to employees in excess of the 430,000 options originally
  authorized.  No more options may be granted under this plan.  Options may be
  exercised only at the rate of 20% of the common shares subject to such option
  for each year of continuous service by the optionee commencing from the later
  of July 2, 1987 or the optionee's employment commencement date. The Company
  has entered into agreements committing the Company to loan to certain key
  employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options, provided that the
  Company will not loan in excess of 25% of the total amount available to the
  employee in any one year. The Company will forgive any loan and accrued
  interest on July 2, 1997, if the employee is then employed by the Company. As
  of December 31, 1993 and 1992, loans related to 162,998 and 98,297 options,
  totaling $1.2 million and $730,000, were extended under these terms.

  The 1993 Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") became effective on May 24, 1993
  after approval by the Company's stockholders.  The 1993 Plan is intended to be
  an incentive stock option plan in accordance with the provisions of Section
  422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The Company has
  reserved 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of
  options under the 1993 Plan.  The 1993 Plan will terminate on the earlier of
  March 28, 2003 or the date on which all options granted under the 1993 Plan
  have been exercised in full.

  The Board of Directors of the Company will determine and designate from time
  to time those employees of the Company to whom options are to be granted.  If
  any option terminates or expires prior to being exercised, the shares relating
  to such option shall be released and may be subject to reissuance pursuant to
  a new option.  The Board of Directors has the right to, among other things,
  fix the price, terms and conditions for the grant or exercise of any option.
  The purchase price of the stock under each option shall be the fair market
  value of the stock at the time such option is granted.

  Options granted will vest 20% a year after the date of grant. The employee
  must exercise the option within five years of the date each portion vests.
  If an employee's employment with the Company terminates, the employee may,
  within the 60 day period immediately following such termination of employment,
  but in no event later than the expiration date specified in the Option
  Agreement, exercise any options that have vested as of the date of such

  termination.  If employment terminates by reason of death or disability, the
  employee (in the event of disability) or the person or persons to whom rights
  under the option shall pass by will or by the applicable laws of decent and
  distribution (in the event of death), shall be entitled to exercise 100% of
  the options granted regardless of the employee's years of service; provided
  however, that no such option may be exercised after 180 days from the date of
  death or termination of employment with the Company as a result of disability.
  Through December 31, 1993, the Board of Directors has granted approximately
  384,000 options at exercise prices ranging from $28.25 to $35.50 per share of
  common stock to approximately 455 employees.  No options granted under the
  1993 Plan have vested.

   Reserve Quantity Information

  Reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the
  estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future
  rates of production and the timing of development expenditures.  The accuracy
  of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of
  engineering and geological interpretation and judgement.  Results of
  subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward or
  downward revisions of previous estimates.  Further, the volumes considered to
  be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating
  costs.  Reserve estimates, by their nature, are generally less precise than
  other financial statement disclosures.

    Standardized Measures of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

  Estimated discounted future net cash flows and changes therein were determined
  in accordance with SFAS No. 69.  Certain information concerning the
  assumptions used in computing the valuation of proved reserves and their
  inherent limitations are discussed below.  The Company believes such
  information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data
  presented.

  Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas
  relating to the Company's proven reserves to the year-end quantities of those
  reserves.  Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by
  contractual arrangements in existence at year-end.

  The assumptions used to compute estimated future net revenues do not
  necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues or costs,
  nor their present worth.  In addition, variations from the expected production
  rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of the
  Company's control, such as unintentional delays in development, changes in
  prices or regulatory controls.  The reserve valuation further assumes that all
  reserves will be disposed of by production.  However, if reserves are sold in
  place additional economic considerations could also affect the amount of cash
  eventually realized.

  Future development and production costs are computed by estimating the
  expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas
  reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming
  continuation of existing economic conditions.

  Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end
  statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already
  legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the Company's
  proved oil and gas reserves.  Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax
  credits and allowances are recognized.

  An annual discount rate of 10% was used to reflect the timing of the future
  net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

  Information with respect to the Company's estimated discounted future cash
  flows from its oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 1993 is
  as follows (in $000s):

(1) In July 1990, the Company loaned Mr. Sanderson $748 to purchase 294,524
    shares of the Company's common stock. Interest is accrued at a rate equal to
    that paid by the Company on its Revolving Credit Facility, which was 4.1%,
    4.4% and 5.9% at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. Interest
    is payable annually on December 31 during the term of the note with all
    unpaid principal and accrued interest due and payable on January 1, 1996.
    The note is secured by the common stock and is accounted for as a reduction
    of stockholders' equity.

(2) In 1991, the Company entered into agreements committing the Company to loan
    to certain key employees an amount sufficient to exercise their options,
    provided that the Company will not loan in excess of 25% of the total amount
    available to the employee in one year. The Company will forgive the loan and
    accrued interest on July 2, 1997,if the employee is then employed by the
    Company or four years after the date of the loan, depending on the option
    exercised. The interest on each loan is based on the Applicable Federal Rate
    on the date the loan is made.

       Lenders or to other Senior Creditors of Borrower in an amount which will

       prepayment to other Senior Creditors or (B) give written notice to
       Lenders or certain of Borrower's other Senior Creditors (and a copy of

       consecutive monthly installment on the first day of each calendar month
       within such period until and including the first date of such sixth
       calendar month (if applicable) and shall provide Agent with written
       evidence of each such prepayment; provided that if the Mandatory
       Prepayment Ratio exceeds the applicable Test Amount more than once during
       any two consecutive Fiscal Quarters (as used in this section, each an
       "Additional Deficiency"), Borrower must pay the Prepayment Amount of each

       Date, Borrower does not recalculate the Mandatory Prepayment Ratio in
       accordance with the terms hereof, Agent may recalculate the Mandatory
       Prepayment Ratio at such time, and from time to time thereafter until
       Borrower does recalculate the Mandatory Prepayment Ratio in accordance
       with the terms hereof and deliver the same to Agent, based upon
       information available to it at that time, which calculation shall be
       binding upon Borrower.  As used in this section, the term "Test Amount"

       the Preferred Stock or any subordinated notes which may have been issued
       in exchange for

                     ------------------------------------------              
     induce each Lender to enter into this Amendment, Borrower represents and
     warrants to each Lender that:

            (a)  The representations and warranties contained in each subsection
       of Section 5.1 of the Original Agreement are true and correct at and as
       of the time of the effectiveness hereof.

            (b)  Borrower is duly authorized to execute and deliver this
       Amendment and is and will continue to be duly authorized to borrow monies
       and to perform its obligations under the Loan Agreement.  Borrower has
       duly taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the execution and
       delivery of this Amendment and to authorize the performance of the
       obligations of Borrower hereunder and thereunder.

            (c)  The execution and delivery by Borrower of this Amendment, the
       performance by Borrower of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
       of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not conflict with
       any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation or of the articles of
       incorporation and bylaws of Borrower, or of any material agreement,
       judgment, license, order or permit applicable to or binding upon
       Borrower, or result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance
       upon any assets or properties of Borrower.  Except for those which have
       been obtained, no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court
       or governmental authority or third party is required in connection with
       the execution and delivery by Borrower of this Amendment or to consummate
       the transactions contemplated hereby.

            (d)  When duly executed and delivered, this Amendment and the Loan
       Agreement will be a legal and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable
       in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
       or similar laws of general application relating to the enforcement of
       creditors' rights and by equitable principles of general application.

            (e)  The audited annual Consolidated financial statements of
       Borrower dated as of December 31, 1992 and the unaudited quarterly
       Consolidated financial statements of Borrower dated as of December 31,
       1993 fairly present Borrower's Consolidated financial position at such
       dates and the Consolidated results of Borrower's operations and changes
       in Borrower's Consolidated cash flow for the respective periods thereof.
       Copies of such financial statements have heretofore been delivered to
       each Lender.  Since December 31, 1993, no material adverse change has
       occurred in the financial condition or businesses or in the Consolidated
       financial condition or businesses of Borrower.

                     --------------------------                            
     hereby amended and each other Loan Document affected hereby are ratified
     and confirmed in all respects.  Any reference to the Loan Agreement in any
     Loan Document shall be deemed to be a reference to the Original Agreement
     as hereby amended.  The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this
     Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a
     waiver of any right, power or remedy of Agent or Lenders under the Loan
     Agreement or any other Loan Document nor constitute a waiver of any
     provision of the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, including but
     not limited to violations of Section 6.2(o) which occur after December 31,
     1993.  The consent by Lenders to Borrower's issuance of the Preferred
     Shares shall not operate as a consent by Lenders to the issuance of any
     other security or instrument, it being expressly agreed by all parties
     hereto that any subsequent issuance of securities or instruments by
     Borrower must be approved by Lenders or be expressly permitted under the

     delivery of this Amendment and the performance hereof, including without
     limitation the making or granting of the Loans, and shall further survive
     until all of the Obligations are paid in full.  All statements and
     agreements contained in any certificate or instrument delivered by Borrower
     or any Related Person hereunder or under the Loan Agreement to any Lender
     shall be deemed to constitute representations and warranties by, and/or
     agreements and covenants of, Borrower under this Amendment and under the
     Loan Agreement.

       Section 5.3.  Loan Documents.  This Amendment is a Loan Document, and all

     provisions in the Loan Agreement pertaining to Loan Documents apply hereto.

     each of which when so executed shall be deemed to constitute one and the
     same Amendment.

       Section 5.6.    Reservation of Rights.  Borrower acknowledges and agrees
                       ---------------------                                   
     that neither Agent's or Lenders' forbearance in exercising their rights and
     remedies in connection with the violations of Section 6.2 (o) of the
     Original Agreement nor the execution and delivery by Agent and Lenders of
     this Amendment, shall be deemed to (i) create a course of dealing or
     otherwise obligate Agent or Lenders to forbear or execute similar waivers
     in the future, or (ii) waive, relinquish or impair any right of Agent or
     Lenders to receive any indemnity or similar payment from any Person as a
     result of any indemnity or similar payment from any person or entity as a
     result of any matter arising from or relating to such violations.

                ------------------------ 

  The first paragraph of Section 2.5(a) of the Original Agreement is hereby
amended in its entirety to read as follows:

       "(a)  Mandatory Prepayment Ratio.  Borrower shall calculate the Mandatory
             --------------------------                                         
  Prepayment Ratio in accordance with the terms of the definition of "Mandatory
  Prepayment Ratio" on each Prepayment Calculation Date and shall deliver notice
  of such recalculated Mandatory Prepayment Ratio (together with a certificate
  signed by the chief financial officer, treasurer or controller of Borrower
  certifying as to the accuracy of such calculation) to Agent and Lenders within
  45 days after each Prepayment Calculation Date which falls on the last day of
  a Fiscal Quarter and on each other Prepayment Calculation Date.  If on any
  Prepayment Calculation Date the Mandatory Prepayment Ratio exceeds the
  applicable Test Amount (as defined below), Borrower shall, within ten Business
  Days after Agent on behalf of Majority Lenders gives written notice of such
  fact to Borrower, either (A) make a prepayment of Indebtedness owing by it to
  Lenders or to other Senior Creditors of Borrower in an amount which will bring
  Borrower into compliance with the Test Amount then in effect (the "Prepayment
  Amount") and provide Agent written evidence of such prepayment to other Senior
  Creditors or (B) give written notice to Lenders or certain of Borrower's other
  Senior Creditors (and a copy of any such notice to Agent) electing to prepay
  the Prepayment Amount in no more than six (6) equal monthly installments
  beginning no later than ninety (90) days from the date Borrower was sent such
  deficiency notice by Agent, and Borrower shall thereafter make such prepayment
  in equal consecutive monthly installment on the first day of each calendar
  month within such period until and including the first date of such sixth
  calendar month (if applicable) and shall provide Agent with written evidence
  of each such prepayment; provided that if the Mandatory Prepayment Ratio
  exceeds the applicable Test Amount more than once during any two consecutive
  Fiscal Quarters (as used in this section, each an "Additional Deficiency"),
  Borrower must pay the Prepayment Amount of each Additional Deficiency in full
  or begin making monthly installments with respect to the Prepayment Amount of
  each Additional Deficiency no later than thirty (30) days from the date
  Borrower was sent a deficiency notice with respect to such Additional
  Deficiency by Agent.  If, on any Prepayment Calculation Date, Borrower does
  not recalculate the Mandatory Prepayment Ratio in accordance with the terms
  hereof, Agent may recalculate the Mandatory Prepayment Ratio at such time, and
  from time to time thereafter until Borrower does recalculate the Mandatory
  Prepayment Ratio in accordance with the terms hereof and deliver the same to
  Agent, based upon information available to it at that time, which calculation
  shall be binding upon Borrower.  As used in this section, the term "Test
  Amount" means (i) 4.0 to 1.0 at any time after the date hereof until and
  including December 31, 1994, (ii) 3.75 to 1.0 at any time from and including

  the surviving entity immediately becomes a Guarantor if required to do so
  pursuant to the terms of Section 6.3 hereof.  Except as expressly provided
  below in this subsection, no Related Person will, after the Closing Date,
  issue partnership interests, stock, or other securities other than shares of
  common or preferred stock issued to Borrower nor will any Subsidiary of
  Borrower allow any diminution of Borrower's interest (direct or indirect)
  therein.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower may not
  issue any shares of its preferred stock without the express written consent of
  Lenders (including without limitation any Preferred Stock or Additional
  Preferred Stock) after the Closing Date but may issue shares of (A) up to
  2,760,000 of the Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock of Borrower to be
  underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Donaldson, Lufkin &
  Jenrette Securities Corporation strictly in accordance with the terms of that
  certain prospectus of Borrower dated as of November 12, 1993 and that certain
  prospectus supplement of Borrower dated as of February 17, 1994 and (B) its
  common stock if (I) such issue is pursuant to the conversion or exchange of
  previously issued Preferred Stock or the conversion of the 7.25% Convertible
  Subordinated Notes into which the Preferred Stock is exchangeable by Borrower
  or (II) immediately after the issuance thereof no Change in Control has
  occurred and no event has occurred nor will any event occur as a result of
  such issuance of Borrower's common stock which would require Borrower to
  redeem for cash the Preferred Stock or any subordinated notes which may have
  been issued in exchange for the Preferred Stock or which gives the holders of
  the Preferred Stock or any subordinated notes which may have been issued in
  exchange for the Preferred Stock the right to demand such redemption."
