                      UNC INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
                      ---------------------------------

Item 1.     Business

      The Company is a leading supplier of products and services to the
aviation industry.  The Company's primary business is the aviation
aftermarket, which accounts for approximately 90% of its revenues.  These
operations include the overhaul and repair of aircraft engines and
accessories, the repair and remanufacturing of engine components, and the
provision of training and maintenance services to the United States and
foreign military.  Approximately 10% of the Company's revenues in 1995 were
derived from manufacturing engine and airframe parts for original equipment
manufacturers.

      The Company has over 8,000 customers including:  business aircraft
operators; major, national, regional, foreign, charter and package/cargo
airlines; engine and airframe OEMs; and the United States and foreign
military.  The Company operates sixteen facilities and performs services at
approximately 80 government sites.

                          ENGINE OVERHAUL DIVISION

      UNC Engine Overhaul Division is comprised of three operations, UNC
Airwork, UNC Engine & Engine Parts and UNC Metcalf.  Together these three
operations perform turbine engine overhaul and maintenance, provide parts
provisioning for business and helicopter operators and regional airlines, and
provide industrial power packages for land based industrial use.

      UNC Airwork is a leading independent provider of turbine engine overhaul
services.  UNC Airwork overhauls and repairs over 40 different engine models
for a wide range of corporate and commercial customers.  In 1994, the
auxiliary power unit repair capabilities of UNC Accessory Services were
transferred to UNC Airwork operations in Millville, New Jersey.  Also in 
1994, the small engine overhaul operations conducted at Pacific Airmotive in
Burbank, California were consolidated into UNC Airwork's facilities in
Millville, New Jersey and Miami, Florida.  This consolidation places all major
engine overhaul capabilities in two strategic locations, making for a more
cost effective use of each unit's capabilities.

      UNC Engine and Engine Parts provides parts and accessory support for
small gas turbine engines, as well as industrial packages.  Specializing in
the support of the PT6 engine manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, this unit has
also expanded capabilities to meet the needs of PT6T Twin Pac, JT15D, Allison
250 and APU operators.  UNC Engine and Engine Parts maintains an inventory of
PT6 spare engines and also has one of the largest PT6 inventories of parts and
accessories in the industry.

      Acquired in 1993, UNC Metcalf specializes in the overhaul and repair of
industrial turbine engine, particularly the Solar Centaur and Saturn models. 
UNC Metcalf provides support services that extend into all areas of operations
including engineering, installation, maintenance, parts repair and rebuild. 
Additionally, UNC Metcalf has developed certain proprietary repair processes
which provide customers with a low cost alternative to parts replacement.  UNC
Metcalf also provides complete "turnkey" service including on site contract
maintenance and operations.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     4
      Revenues of the Engine Overhaul Division were $130.6 million in 1995
(24.5% of the Company's 1995 revenues).

                         ACCESSORY SERVICES DIVISION

      UNC Accessory Services consists of four certified FAA repair station
facilities providing accessory overhaul, repair and test services to aircraft
operators, including business aircraft operators, major airlines,
international airlines, national airlines, regional airlines and package and
freight carriers. Services are also provided to independent aircraft engine
overhaul facilities and aftermarket distributors.  UNC Accessory Services
supports over fifty categories of aircraft accessories, covering more than
thirty thousand different parts.  The items serviced include landing gear,
constant speed drives, radar components, generators, transponders, pneumatic
valves, cooling turbines, flight control actuators, propellers, fuel system
components, hydraulic system components, and anti-skid brake system
components.  New capabilities for regional turbo-prop aircraft and newer
generation turbine aircraft continue to be added.

      UNC Accessory Services was founded in 1951 and acquired by the Company
in 1989.  UNC Accessory Services is an authorized service center for leading
original equipment manufacturers, including Allied Signal Aerospace Products,
APPH and Chandler Evans.  The Company believes it to be the largest
independent supplier of accessory support.

      Revenues of the Component Services Division were $45.6 million in 1994
(8.5% of the Company's 1995 revenues).

                                MANUFACTURING

      UNC's Manufacturing Division supplies turbine engine and airframe
component parts for the prime engine and aircraft original equipment
manufacturers and the military.  UNC Manufacturing provides advanced
capabilities from design to production that result in high technology, precise
tolerance and advanced alloy parts.  This Division consists of UNC Johnson
Technology, UNC Tri-Manufacturing, UNC Tri-Remanufacturing, UNC Artex and UNC
Aerostructures.

      UNC Johnson Technology, founded in 1963 and acquired by the Company in
July 1993, provides high technology turbine nozzles and vane manufacturing and
repair, and specialized non-conventional machining of super alloys such as
electro-chemical deep hole drilling, laser drilling, and electrical-discharge
machining.  Customers include Pratt & Whitney, the Department of Defense, and
General Electric.

      UNC Tri-Manufacturing, founded in 1955 and acquired by the Company in
1988, is a leading manufacturer of precision components, aircraft parts and
assemblies for turbine engines for commercial and military aviation
applications.  Primary customers include General Electric, Pratt & Whitney and
the Department of Defense.

      UNC Aerostructures, founded in 1965 and acquired by the Company in 1993,
is an experienced manufacturer of structural components and sheet metal sub-
assemblies for major aircraft manufactures such as Boeing.  UNC Aerostructures
provides a wide manufacturing capability serving virtually all major airframe
and aerospace companies, leading industrial subcontractors and the U.S.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     5
Military.  Customers include, Boeing, Northrop, Vought, Bell Helicopter,
Lockheed and Grumman.

      UNC Tri-Remanufacturing, which was started by the Company in 1991,
reconditions engine components to serviceable condition.  The remanufacturing
business is supported by market driven repair development and customers'
desires to lower repair and overhaul costs.  UNC Tri-Remanufacturing's
customers are the commercial airlines who perform their own engine overhauls,
OEM engine overhaul shops and the military.  These customers generally lack
the expertise, the ability to develop approved repairs, and the volume of work
on each different part to justify in-house performance of this work.

      UNC Artex, founded in 1957 and whose assets were acquired by the Company
in April 1993, expands the Company's repair and remanufacturing capabilities
through highly specialized repairs of components including engine gearboxes
and cases, as well as aircraft component housings and other engine and
aircraft parts and accessories.  UNC Artex's primary customers are the major
commercial airlines.  

      Revenues for the Manufacturing Division were $103.6 million in 1995 (19%
of the Company's 1995 revenues).

                              AVIATION SERVICES

      UNC Aviation Services Division is a market leader in the provision of
aircraft maintenance, overhaul, logistics support, aviation training services
and systems integration to the U.S. military, as well as to domestic and
foreign government agencies.  The Division has over 63 years of cumulative
experience with an unblemished record of distinguished contract performance. 
The Division has three operating units, UNC Federal Services, UNC Contract
Field Services and UNC International Services.  Work is performed at military
aviation and ground training sites throughout the United States.  Contracts
are both fixed price and time and materials for multiple years with options. 
This business is managed centrally from the Company's Annapolis, Maryland
headquarters.

      UNC Federal Services is a recognized leader of aircraft maintenance and
air-crew training to the U.S. military.  The market for these military
contract services results from the Department of Defense turning to the
private sector to obtain services for less than they would cost if they were
performed by government personnel.  Awards of these contracts are generally
based on best value to the government.  As a result, success in obtaining the
awards of these contracts requires both high technical rating and low price.

      In 1995, Aviation Services Division won a contract for Contractor
Logistics Support of a four-service fleet of VIP C-20 aircraft at four
locations:  Andrews AFB, Maryland; Kaneoe NAS and Hicham Field, Hawaii; and
Ramstein AFB, Germany.  They also were awarded a U.S. Army
Communications/Electronics Command Omnibus Contract, which provides systems
integration services for development and installation of avionics and
communications equipment in aircraft and ground vehicles at Lakehurst, New
Jersey and Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.  The Division also won the Air Education and
Training Commands Contract to provide instructors for flight simulation
instruction at six bases:  Randolph AFB, Texas; Reese AFB, Texas; Sheppard
AFB, Texas; Columbus AFB, Mississippi; Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Vance AFB,
Oklahoma.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     6
      UNC Contract Field Services has for 35 years provided depot level and
below depot level maintenance, repair and logistical services for virtually
every Department of Defense weapon system.  Through the Contract Field Teams
(CFT) program, the Company serves the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, NASA and
Coast Guard.  In 1995, Field Teams began a major new effort at the Army's
Strategic Mobility Logistics Base, Charleston, South Carolina.  Here the
Division is the Army's major support contractor for maintenance and upgrade
of war reserve equipment aboard prepositioned ships deployed around the world.

      UNC International Services provides maintenance program management and
logistical services to customers worldwide.  The Company is the largest U.S.
service contractor to the Royal Saudi Air Force providing F-5 technical and
logistical support, C-130 logistical support and other services.  The Division
also holds a major contract with the Royal Saudi Naval Forces to provide
technical support at Jeddah and Jubail shipyards, with a support element in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

      The Aviation Services Division had revenues of $251.2 million in 1995
(47% of the Company's 1995 revenues).

                              TRADING DIVISION

      During 1993, the Company established a Trading Division for the purpose
of expanding its business in the airframe and engine parts market and
generating revenues from other aircraft and engine related transactions.  In
addition the Company is consolidating its engine and accessory marketing
within this Division located in Miami, Florida.  In 1993 the Division acquired
a Boeing DC-10-30 aircraft under a leverage lease which it subsequently sold
in 1994.  In addition, the Division acquired a Boeing 767 aircraft in 1994
which it has disassembled and is refurbishing or repairing, as required, and
disposing of in the aftermarket through sale, lease or the creation of
exchange pools or similar transactions.

      Revenues for the Trading Division in 1995 were $5.2 million (1% of the
Company's 1995 revenues).

COMPETITION

      The businesses and markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive.

      The Company's engine overhaul operations competes primarily with, and
largely at the discretion of, the aircraft OEMs including Allied Signal,
General Electric, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.  These operations also face
significant competition from a large number of other domestic and foreign
entities such as Aviall, Standard Aero, National Airmotive, BizJet, KC
Aviation (an aviation services subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark), Bombardier,
Duncan Aviation and others.  The Company's overhaul operations also compete
with sales of used engines.  

      The Company's accessory services operations compete with a large number
of smaller service facilities and with certain OEMs that provide aftermarket
services for their products.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     7
      Quality and reliability of service, prompt turn-around time, price and
customer service are major competitive factors in the engine overhaul and
accessory services businesses.

      In providing contract aviation services to the military, the Company's
major competitors are Dyncorp, Reflectone, Serv-Air, Northrop, Raytheon,
Grumman and Lockheed.  The Division is one of only four companies holding a
recurring contract under the Contract Field Team program.  The program allows
these companies to provide maintenance services to the Government on an as
needed basis through individual orders.  Other CFT contracts are held by
DynCorp, Lockheed, and Raytheon (Serv-Air).

      With respect to the Company's manufacturing operations, UNC Tri-
Manufacturing's principal competitors are The Barnes Group, Ketema and
Chemtronics, and UNC Johnson Technology's  competition exists in the form of
OEM in-house capabilities and Chromalloy, Meyer Tool, Howmet and Walbar.  UNC
Aerostructures competes with Ace Clearwater, Dynabil Industries, Monitor
Aerospace, AeroChem and ChemFab.  UNC Tri-Remanufacturing and UNC Artex's
principal competitors are Windsor Airmotive, Chromalloy, NORDAM PSD and
Pyromet.  Price, quality and customer service are major competitive factors
in this business.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; PATENTS:

      The Company does not currently have any employees who are engaged full-
time in research and development activities; however, certain employees from

ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Continuing Operations

Overview

      The Company's operations are conducted in one business segment which
includes: the overhaul of aircraft engines, industrial gas turbine engines and
aircraft accessories, the manufacture and remanufacture of jet engine and
aircraft components and providing maintenance and training, repair and
logistical contract services.

1995 Compared with 1994
- -----------------------
      Revenues were $536.2 million in 1995 compared with $525.8 million in
1994, an increase of $10.4 million (2%).  This increase in revenues was a
result of an increase of $25.7 million (29%) in international sales, offset
by a reduction in revenues due primarily to the closing of the overhaul
facility located in Burbank, California and the sale of two operating
divisions in connection with the Company's restructuring program.  Operating
income was $22.4 million in 1995 compared with an operating loss of $61.0
million in 1994.  Included in the 1994 results were a restructuring provision
of $58.7 million, a one-time charge of $9.6 million for adjustments described
below and a $14.0 million multi-employer pension withdrawal adjustment.  See
1994 Compared with 1993 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of the Company's restructuring program.  Without
these adjustments operating income would have been $21.3 million in 1994.

      Revenues for the Engine Overhaul Division in 1995 increased $1.5 million
(1%) to $130.6 million.  The higher revenues are due to an increase in small
engine overhauls for international customers and in the overhaul and repair
of industrial turbine engines.  These revenue increases were partially offset
by the loss of revenue resulting from the closing of the engine overhaul
facility in Burbank, California, at the end of 1994, as part of the Company's
restructuring program.  Operating income in 1995 was $7.6 million compared
with an operating loss of $8.0 million in 1994.  Included in the 1994 results
was a $14.0 million non-recurring charge for the withdrawal from a multi-
employer pension plan (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) and a one-time charge of $1.0 million for an increase in the
allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables related to litigation and the
bankruptcy of certain customers.  Without these adjustments operating income
would have been $7.0 million in 1994 compared with $7.6 million in 1995.

      Revenues of the Accessory Services Division in 1995 increased $3.9
million (9%) to $45.6 million principally due to increased volume from
international customers.  Operating income decreased $1.3 million in 1995
principally due to lower volume on domestic business which was replaced with
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     12
increased international business at lower margins due to increased competitive
actions by original equipment manufacturers ("OEM").  The 1994 period included
one-time charges of approximately $0.2 million for an increase in the
allowance for doubtful accounts.

      The Company's Manufacturing Division revenues in 1995 decreased $2.8
million (3%) to $103.6 million compared with 1994.  The decrease in revenues
is due to lower volume at the Company's engine components manufacturing
facility in Indiana and to a reduction in revenues generated by the Company's
chemical milled aircraft and engine components facility in Texas which was
sold in June 1995, as part of the Company's restructuring strategy.  These
decreases were partially offset by higher volume at the Company's Michigan
engine components manufacturing facility due to increased activities on U.S.
government programs and higher volume at other manufacturing facilities,
principally due to new orders at the aerostructures manufacturing facility in
the State of Washington.  Operating income was $10.7 million in 1995 compared
with $6.6 million in 1994.  The 1994 period included a one-time charge of $3.5
million for an adjustment to cost estimates on long-term manufacturing
contracts.  This charge resulted from a reevaluation of total cost to be
incurred under long-term production contracts with OEM customers, necessitated
by a reduced level of orders and the impact of recent price concessions that
were provided to the OEMs under these contracts.  As a result of these events,
it was determined that the increasing overhead rates, resulting in higher
overhead charges to the contracts, in conjunction with higher production
costs, resulting from these lower volumes required an adjustment to the
carrying value of inventory under the contracts.

      Aviation Services Division revenues of $251.2 million increased $5.1
million (2%) in 1995.  The increase in 1995 is due in part to higher revenues
generated on U.S. government contracts for pilot training and contract field
teams services, and for activities on an international contract that was
awarded in the latter part of 1994.  These increases in revenues were
partially offset by a reduction in aircraft maintenance activities on U.S.
government contracts and the sale of UNC Helicopter in December 1994, as part
of the Company's restructuring strategy.  Operating income decreased $1.9
million (17%) to $9.6 million in 1995 due to a reduction in volume of flying
hours and one-time increases during the previous year.

      In December 1994, the Company's Trading Division purchased a used Boeing
767 aircraft for $5.0 million, of which $1.0 million was paid in 1994 and $4.0
million in 1995.  The aircraft was disassembled and the parts are being
refurbished or repaired, as required, and are being disposed of in the
aftermarket through sale, lease or the creation of exchange pools or similar
transactions.  During 1995 the Division generated revenues of $3.3 million and
operating income of $1.1 million from parts sales.  Also, included in 1995
revenues and operating income is $2.0 million for services provided to the
Mohegan Indians in connection with the sale of property in Connecticut.  The
1994 period includes $2.6 million of revenues and operating income from the
leveraged lease of a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft which was sold in
December 1994.

      Selling, general and administrative expenses in 1995 were $57.0 million
or 10.6% of sales compared with $69.8 million or 13.3% of sales in 1994.  The
decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 1995 is due to the
closing of the Burbank engine overhaul facility, the sale of UNC Helicopter
in December 1994, the sale of the Texas chemical milled aircraft and engine
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     13
components facility in June 1995, and other cost savings resulting from the
restructuring program initiated in the second quarter of 1994.  Also included
in 1994 was a one-time charge of approximately $6.1 million for an increase
in the allowance for doubtful notes and accounts (included in this amount are
the allowance adjustments described above) and the write-off of expenses
incurred in connection with an acquisition that was not consummated.  Selling
general and administrative cost also includes an investment for increased
international marketing efforts by the Company's international offices located
in Singapore, The Netherlands and Miami, Florida, serving Latin America.  As
a result, international sales have increased $25.7 million (29%) and $27.9
million (47%) in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  See Note 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

      Interest expense increased $1.0 million (5%) in 1995, principally due
to higher average debt levels.

      The income tax provision for 1995 of $1.0 million results from the
Company reporting $3.0 million in earnings before income taxes and
extraordinary item.  In 1994, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of
$13.5 million as a result of incurring a loss before income taxes and
extraordinary item of $81.4 million.  See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax
rate to the Company's effective tax rate.
      
      The decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance of $1.3 million in
1995 was due to the realization of current income tax benefits resulting from
the reversal of temporary differences against financial statement income.  The
amount of deferred tax valuation allowance is determined based upon
management's evaluation of the net realizability of the future income tax
benefits, considering expiration of net operating losses, predictability of
future income, including the impact of the Company's restructuring program,
and the timing of reversal of temporary differences.

      The Defense Department is continuing to close various military bases. 
A portion of the workload of these bases is being relocated to bases where the
Company already performs aircraft maintenance functions.  Further
consolidation of military training and maintenance contracts is expected as
bases are eliminated and other defense cuts reduce the value of individual
contracts.  However, the Company expects that continued pressures on defense
spending could increase the outsourcing of services currently being provided
by military and other government personnel to lower cost providers such as the
Company.  Additional opportunities for work from Army, Air Force and Navy
depots may result from the recommendations made by the Congressionally-
mandated Department of Defense Industry Depot Maintenance Task Force on which
UNC is represented.  In May 1995, the Company was awarded a major delivery
order under its Contract Field Teams contract to develop the plans, procedures
and processes to implement the U.S. Army's Strategic Mobility Logistics
Program at Charleston, South Carolina.  Also in May, the Company was awarded
a one year contract with four one-year options by the U.S. Army's
Communications and Electronics Command at Ft. Monmouth, N.J. with a potential
value of approximately $105 million.  In July 1995, the Company was awarded
a $38 million seven year subcontract for maintenance and supply support of the
Air Force's worldwide C-20 Gulfstream VIP aircraft fleet, and in August, the
Company was awarded a one year contract with four one-year options aggregating
approximately $38 million to provide flight simulator instruction at six Air
Education and Training Command bases.  
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     14
      The Company's Manufacturing Division continues to receive pricing
pressure from certain customers, principally OEMs, as these OEMs continue to
significantly reduce the number of suppliers and their own procurement staffs. 
The Company remains a part of the reduced OEM supplier base and has obtained
new contracts that may not have been available when the base of suppliers was
larger.  The Division has provided price concessions to its principal OEM
customers during each of the past four years in anticipation of continuing to
receive future orders and to maintain OEM business relationships.  As a result
of the depressed conditions in the industry over the past several years, the
additional orders have not been sufficient to offset the declining volume of
business.  The Company has instituted on-going productivity enhancements and
cost reduction programs, in an effort to mitigate the effect of these price
concessions and reduced volumes.  However, as a result of the impact that
these concessions and reduced volumes have had on the cost structure of the
Division, the Company adjusted the carrying value of certain inventories
related to these long-term manufacturing agreements by $3.5 million in 1994. 
The OEM customers continue to apply pricing pressure on all suppliers, and the
Company expects continuing pressures from these OEM customers on future
pricing.

      Continued effort on the part of the U.S. government to reduce defense
spending is affecting the demand for military aircraft engines and could also
have an impact on the Company's manufacturing operations.  This trend is being
offset by the Defense Department bypassing OEMs and placing orders directly
with subcontractors such as the Company.  Recently, the Company has been
awarded contracts to produce T56, F10 and F404 High Pressure Turbine Nozzle
Segments valued at $16 million, $9 million and $7 million, respectively.  The
Company's manufacturing operations will capitalize on the opportunities in the
military market while focussing its efforts on building the commercial market. 
During the second half of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, the Company
expanded its commercial contract backlog as well as its customer base by
acquiring the contract backlog of two financially pressured competitors.  The
inventory and production related to these contracts were transferred to
existing Company facilities.

1994 Compared with 1993
- -----------------------
      The Company took steps in 1994 to reduce its cost structure and asset
base in light of the continuing depressed economic conditions in the aviation
industry.  The Company's analysis of industry market conditions indicates that
the soft industry cycle will continue through 1996 and that many of our
markets will see little real growth during this period.  As a result in the
second quarter of 1994 the Company recorded a $58.7 million provision for
restructuring which includes the shutting down of a marginal operation, an
allowance for the sale and disposition of two other businesses, the
consolidation and downsizing of other operations, and the write down of
inventory and under utilized property, plant and equipment that had been
identified for sale to generate additional cash flow.  The provision for
restructuring consists of $42.3 million to cover the closing of a facility,
the sale and disposition of two other businesses, the consolidation of two
plants and the downsizing of other facilities.  The Company has closed its
engine overhaul facility in Burbank, California and consolidated its engine
overhaul business principally at its facilities in Millville, New Jersey, and
Miami, Florida.  The Company positioned for sale and disposition its chemical
milled aircraft and engine components facility in Weatherford, Texas, which
was sold in 1995, and its helicopter overhaul and refurbishment facility in
Ozark, Alabama, which was sold in December 1994.  These actions were taken due
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     15
to the under utilization of the Weatherford facility caused by the depressed
market condition being experienced by OEM's in connection with the
construction of new aircraft and a sharp reduction in the number of military
helicopter overhauls that were expected in the foreseeable future at the Ozark
facility.  The Company has also consolidated two of its accessory overhaul
plants located in Long Island, New York into one facility.  The balance of the
provision of $16.4 million relates principally to the write down to estimated
realizable value of certain inventory and under utilized property, plant and
equipment that has been identified for sale on the open market.  When fully
implemented the restructuring program is expected to generate $85.0 million
of cash, net of restructuring expenses.

      During the first six months of this restructuring program the Company
closed its engine overhaul operations in Burbank, California and transferred
these operations to its Millville, New Jersey and Miami, Florida facilities
and sold its helicopter overhaul and refurbishment business.  In addition, the
Company began liquidating the assets identified for sale under this program
and generated approximately $10 million of cash, net of restructuring
expenses.  The Company completed the auction of certain fixed assets at its
Pacific Airmotive subsidiary in January 1995, generating approximately $2.6
million in cash.

      At year end the Company's employee head count was 5,410, down slightly
more than 1,000 employees compared with the beginning of the year, reflecting
the results of improved cost controls and restructuring efforts.  

      Revenues were $525.8 million in 1994 compared with $438.3 million in
1993, an increase of $87.5 million (20%) and operating income for 1994
reflects a loss of $61.0 million compared with income of $23.4 million in
1993.  Included in the 1994 results were a restructuring provision of $58.7
million, a one-time charge of $9.6 million for adjustments related to the
carrying value of certain long-term manufacturing contracts, increases in
allowance for doubtful accounts as well as other operating items described
below, and a $14.0 million fourth quarter 1994 multi-employer pension
withdrawal adjustment.  Without these adjustments operating income would have
been $21.3 million in 1994.

      Revenues for the Engine Overhaul Division in 1994 decreased $24.9
million (16%) to $129.1 million.  The reduction in revenues is principally due
to decreases in JT8 overhauls, resulting from the Company's decision to
withdraw from the JT8 overhaul business in late 1993.  The JT8 reductions were
partially offset by a revenue increase of $3.1 million generated by UNC
Metcalf acquired in the third quarter of 1993.

      Operations of the Engine Overhaul Division generated a loss of
$8.0 million in 1994 compared with income of $4.2 million in 1993.  Included
in the 1994 results is a $14 million non-recurring charge for the withdrawal
from a multi-employer pension plan (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) and a one-time charge of $1.0 million for an increase
in the allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables related to litigation
and the bankruptcy of certain customers.  Without these adjustments operating
income would have been $7.0 million in 1994.

      Revenues for the Accessory Services Division in 1994 decreased $8.3
million (17%) to $41.7 million, principally due to increased pricing pressures
from existing competition in the accessory services markets.  Operating income
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     16
was $1.3 million in 1994 and $6.5 million in 1993.  Included in the 1994
results was a one-time charge of $0.2 million for an increase in the allowance
for doubtful accounts related to the settlement of certain receivables. 
Without this adjustment income would have been $1.5 million in 1994.  The
decrease in operating income in 1994 is principally due to the reduction in
volume.

      The Company's Manufacturing Division revenues for 1994 of $106.4 million
increased $15.6 million (17%) compared with 1993.  The increase in 1994
revenues is principally due to revenues generated by UNC Johnson Technology
and UNC Aerostructures, Washington acquired in the third quarter of 1993,
offset by lower volume at the Company's other manufacturing facilities. 
Operating income was $6.6 million in 1994 compared with $12.6 million in 1993. 
The 1994 period includes a one-time charge of $3.5 million for an adjustment
to cost estimates on long-term manufacturing contracts.  This charge resulted
from a reevaluation of total cost to be incurred under these long-term
production contracts with OEM customers, necessitated by a reduced level of
orders and the impact of recent price concessions that were provided the OEMs
under these contracts.  As a result of these events, it was determined that
the increasing overhead rates, resulting in higher overhead charges to the
contracts, in conjunction with higher production cost, resulting from these
lower volumes, required an adjustment to the carrying value of inventory under
these contracts.  Without this adjustment operating income would have been
$10.1 million in 1994.

      Aviation Services Division revenues of $246.1 million increased $103.9
million in 1994.  The increase in revenues is principally due to revenues
contributed by UNC Lear Siegler acquired in October 1993 and consolidated into
the Aviation Services Division.  Operating income increased $5.0 million after
adjusting for a $2.0 million nonrecurring claim against the U.S. government
(for costs incurred prior to 1993) which was recorded in the first quarter of
1993.  The increase in operating income is principally due to earnings
contributed from the acquisition of UNC Lear Siegler and resulting savings
from the consolidation of its operations.

      In December 1994, the Company's Trading Division sold its McDonnell
Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft that was acquired in September 1993 under a
leveraged lease.  Revenues and operating income from the leveraged lease in
1994 and 1993 were $2.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively.

      Selling, general and administrative expenses in 1994 were $69.8 million
or 13.3% of sales compared with $54.0 million or 12.3% of sales in 1993.  The
increase in selling, general and administrative expense in 1994 is due to
expenses of the companies acquired during 1993 and increased international
marketing efforts.  Additionally, included in the 1994 period is a one-time
charge of approximately $6.1 million related to increases in allowances for
doubtful notes and accounts (included in this amount are the allowance
adjustments described above) and the write-off of expenses of $0.7 million
incurred in connection with an acquisition that was not consummated.  Without
this one-time charge selling, general and administrative expenses would have
been approximately 12.2% of sales in 1994.

      Interest expense increased $4.7 million in 1994 principally due to
higher average debt levels resulting from acquisitions made in 1993, the full
year effect of the Senior Notes issued in July 1993 and higher interest rates.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     17
      The income tax benefit for 1994 of $13.5 million was $9.7 million higher
than the $3.8 million benefit for 1993.  This increase is due to the
recognition of income tax benefits, net of allowances, on the pre-tax losses
incurred in 1994.  See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for a reconciliation of the statuary federal income tax rate to the Company's
effective tax rate.

      The increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance of $13.7 million
in 1994 was due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from net
operating losses and certain tax assets generated by the 1994 restructuring
provision, the provision for the withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan
and other one-time charges.  The amount of deferred tax valuation allowance
is determined based upon management's evaluation of the net realizability of
the future income tax benefits considering expiration of net operating losses,
predictability of future income, including the impact of the Company's
restructuring program, and the timing of reversal of temporary differences.
      
Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------
      Net cash flows from investing activities provided $25.9 million in 1995,
of which $33.6 million was generated by the sale of assets, principally those
identified in the restructuring program, including $25.0 million from the sale
of the Company's Connecticut property, $4.9 from the sale of other property
and equipment and $3.7 million from the sale of inventories included in the
restructuring program.  The funds generated by the investing activities were
used to fund $6.8 million in capital expenditures, $0.9 million in payments
to the former owners of an acquired business under the terms of an earn-out
agreement, $9.2 million reduction of debt and $17.8 million of operating
activities.  The use of funds in operating activities consisted of $15.9
million generated by earnings after adjusting for non-cash items, offset by
a $24.6 million investment in additional working capital and $9.1 million used
primarily to reduce noncurrent liabilities.

      Many of the Company's restructuring goals have been achieved since the
program was implemented in June 1994.  The Company has generated $47.8 million
from the sale of assets, including $25.0 million from the sale of the
Company's Connecticut property, $12.0 million from the sale of other under
utilized property and equipment, $10.8 million from the sale of other assets,
including its helicopter overhaul and refurbishing business in Ozark, Alabama
and its chemical milled aircraft and engine component business in Weatherford,
Texas.  In addition, the Company has closed its JT8 engine overhaul facility
in Burbank, California and consolidated the engine overhaul business at its
facilities in Millville, New Jersey, and Miami, Florida.  Two accessory
services facilities in Long Island, New York, have also been consolidated. 
The disposal of these assets and consolidation of operations, along with
implementation of productivity enhancements and staff reductions, have
resulted in a reduced cost structure for the Company.

      In addition to the cash described above, since June 30, 1994 the Company
generated approximately $7.9 million of proceeds from the collection of
certain disputed receivables and notes that were written down at the time of
the restructuring in connection with efforts made by the Company to accelerate
the collection of these troubled receivables and generate additional cash.

      Since the restructuring program was implemented, the Company has
incurred $16.6 million of cash expenditures against its restructuring accrual.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     18
These cash expenditures include employee severance and related costs of $2.5
million, $14.1 million of costs associated with the sale, closing and
consolidations of businesses and operations, including $3.8 million of third-
party costs associated with the shutdowns, consolidations and sales programs. 
The Company believes that the remaining restructuring accrual of $3.9 million
should be adequate to complete the program.

      Capital expenditures in 1995 amounted to $6.8 million compared with
$10.3 million in 1994.  It is anticipated that capital expenditures in 1996
will be on a level comparable with the 1994 expenditures, excluding the impact
of the acquisition of Garrett Aviation Services, and will be financed from
internally generated funds, lease arrangements and, if necessary, revolving
credit borrowings.

      The Company has approximately $34.6 million of net operating loss
carryforwards that can be applied against future taxable income. 
Consequently, the Company does not expect to pay significant federal income
taxes for the next couple of years.

      In May 1995, the Company entered into a new revolving credit agreement
which provides for a five-year credit line through May 2000, with a borrowing
capacity of up to $90 million, subject to borrowing base limitations as
defined in the agreement and reduced by outstanding letters of credit.  The
Company's unused availability under the facility was $33.0 million at December
31, 1995.  The $9.2 million debt reduction in 1995 includes the purchase in
the open market and the retirement of approximately $3.6 million of 7 1/2%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2006 to satisfy, in part, the first
annual sinking fund payment of $4.2 million, which commences in March 1996,
the reduction of the Revolving Senior Bank Debt by $2.8 million, and other
debt by $2.8 million.  In January 1996, the Company purchased in the open
market an additional $0.6 million of the 7 1/2% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures to satisfy the balance of the 1996 sinking fund requirement.  The
Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 1995, was 67.2%
compared with 68.4% at December 31, 1994.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's
working capital was $124.1 million, with a current ratio of 2.3 to 1 compared
with $100.2 million, with a current ratio of 1.7 to 1 at December 31, 1994.

      In October 1995, the Company reached an agreement with Gildea Investment
Company ("Gildea") and other investors to provide up to $25 million of equity
financing on an as needed basis to assist in financing future acquisitions. 
The equity investment will be in the form of senior cumulative convertible
preferred stock ("the Preferred") issued by the Company.  The Preferred will
be issued at $100 per share with an annual cumulative dividend rate of 8.5%,
with no mandatory redemption, and will be convertible to common stock at a
price of $7 per share.  The Company will have the option to pay dividends in
the form of a pay-in-kind cumulative preferred stock.  Under the terms reached
with Gildea, the Company will only issue the new equity on an as needed basis
for prospective acquisitions.  Gildea has the option to invest up to $10
million if a like amount of the Preferred has not been issued by the Company
by April 4, 1996.

      On January 15, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire
substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Garrett Aviation
Services, a leading provider of aviation services in the business aviation
aftermarket.  The purchase price is approximately $145 million which the
Company intends to finance through the issuance of $125 million of long-term
senior subordinated notes and $25 million of 8.5% cumulative convertible
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     19
Preferred Stock.  In addition, borrowings under the Company's Revolving Senior
Bank Debt will be necessary to the extent the purchase price plus transaction
cost exceeds the amount of funds generated from the issuance of the notes and
Preferred Stock described above.  The acquisition is contingent upon, among
other things, receiving certain governmental approval and financing on terms
that are satisfactory to the Company.  The Company is currently soliciting the
holders of its 9 1/8% Senior Notes to amend certain covenants in order to
permit additional borrowings and amend the restrictions on the payment of cash
dividends.  As of February 23, 1996, the Company received consent from the
required majority of note holders to amend the covenants.  It is anticipated
that the acquisition will be completed in the latter part of April 1996.  The
Company may be required to pay a break-up fee of up to potentially $5.0
million if, under certain circumstances such as a breach of the agreement, the
acquisition is not consummated.  See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

      The Company discontinued its minerals and offshore products and services
operations in 1984, its telecommunications operation in 1988 and its submarine
propulsion unit manufacturing operation and its environmental services
operation in 1990.  In connection with these actions, the Company has
approximately $15.7 million accrued to cover the cost of certain long-term
remediation activities, wind-down and final closure of certain long-term U.S.
government contracts, resolution of certain litigation and disposition of
remaining properties.  The Company anticipates that these activities will be
completed over the next three years.

Environmental
- -------------
      The Company's operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the environment.  The Company believes
that its facilities are operated substantially in compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations on an overall basis.  However, as described
below, some areas require remedial action.

      A subsidiary of the Company, United Nuclear Corporation, has been
involved in environmental reclamation of a former uranium mill and mill
tailings facility since 1988.  The reclamation plan has been approved by the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and reclamation activities are proceeding on schedule.  Site
reclamation under this plan is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1997. 
The cost of this remediation was $2.1 million in 1995, $2.2 million in 1994
and $1.7 million in 1993.  It is anticipated, based on the approved
reclamation plan, that the cost of future remediation through 1997 will be
approximately $4.0 million.  Such cost has been accrued as part of the
discontinued operation.

      The Company sold one of its manufacturing facilities, Chemical Dynamics,
Inc., in June 1995 to the former owner of the subsidiary.  Under the terms of
the agreement, the former owner assumed, among other things, all known
environmental risks related to the operations of the business.

      During 1993, the State of New Mexico passed the New Mexico Mining Act
("Act"), which imposes certain reclamation and other regulatory obligations
on operators of existing and new mining operations.  A number of mines
operated by the Company's subsidiary, United Nuclear Corporation, at various
times during the period 1970 through 1982, may be covered by the Act. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     20
However, it is impossible to determine, based on the provisions of the Act and
regulations issued by the State, the extent to which these mines may be
covered by the Act and, if covered, to estimate the cost of remediation or the
timing and extent of remedial action which may be required.

      Lockheed-Martin Corporation ("Lockheed") began an action in United
States District Court of the Central District of California under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
("CERCLA") in August 1994.  In that action, Lockheed seeks to have owners and
operators of property situated above the San Fernando Valley aquifer
contribute to the costs incurred or to be incurred by Lockheed to clean up
contaminated groundwater constituting the aquifer.  A subsidiary of the
Company, Pacific Airmotive Corporation ("PAC"), was made one of the defendants
in the action.  The Company and a second subsidiary, Airwork Corporation, were
added as defendants in December 1995.  Based on several series of soil tests
conducted on PAC's property and consultants' reports since approximately 1989,
the Company concluded, and continues to conclude, that there is no
demonstration that contaminants of concern identified in the groundwater by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been transmitted from the
surface of PAC's property to the underlying groundwater approximately 200 feet
below ground surface.  PAC is also pursuing alternative remedies against Purex
Industries, Inc. which owned and operated the property prior to 1985.  The
Company and Airwork have filed motions to dismiss the action as to them on the
grounds, among others, that they did not own or operate PAC's property, or
control PAC's operations.  The Company is not able to determine whether it or
a subsidiary of the Company will be held liable as a result of the Lockheed
action, or to establish a range of loss.

      Based on the Company's assessment of the matters described above, the
Company believes that these and other environmental matters will not have a
material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.  For further details with respect to environmental
matters, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impact of Inflation
- -------------------
      The Company believes that inflation did not have a material effect on
the results of operations or financial condition in 1995.

New Accounting Standards
- ------------------------
      During 1995 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 - "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."  This statement becomes effective in 1996 and encourages,
rather than requires, companies to recognize compensation expense based on the
estimated fair value of employee stock options and other equity instruments
issued to employees at the date the instruments are granted.  Companies that
choose to continue to follow the measurement guidance in APB Opinion No. 25 -
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees will be required to disclose pro
forma net income and earnings per share as if the accounting method in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 had been applied. 
Management will continue to follow the measurement guidance in APB Opinion No.
25 when accounting for stock issued to Company employees.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     21
      Also issued in 1995 was Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
121 - "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of."  This statement becomes effective in 1996 and
requires that assets to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset in question may not be recoverable.  Companies will have to estimate
future cash flows expected from using the asset and its eventual disposition. 
If this amount is less than the carrying amount of the asset, there is an
impairment loss.  The impairment loss is measured by the difference between
the asset's fair value and its carrying amount.  Assets to be disposed of,
with certain exceptions, would be reported as the lower of cost or fair value
less the cost to sell the asset.   The Company currently follows the
provisions of this Standard.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
      ------------------------------------------
      (a) Basis of Presentation.  The accompanying financial statements
include the accounts of UNC Incorporated and its Subsidiaries ("the Company")
after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

      (b) Long-Term Contracts.  Revenues under fixed-price production
contracts are primarily recognized under the percentage-of-completion method
and are measured principally on a cost-to-cost basis.  Cost estimates are
reviewed periodically as the work progresses, and adjustments are reflected
in the period in which revisions to such estimates are deemed necessary. 
Revenues under fixed rate per hour service contracts are recognized as
services are performed based on actual hours incurred under the contracts. 
Performance award fees incorporated in certain government contracts are
recognized when there is sufficient information to assess expected contract
performance.  Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are recorded when
identified.

      (c) Inventories.  Valuation of inventories is at the lower of cost or
market, utilizing the first-in, first-out and average cost methods.

      (d) Depreciation and Amortization.  The Company's property, plant and
equipment are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives by
the straight-line method, using periods ranging from 10 to 30 years for
buildings and improvements and from 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.

      (e) Cost in Excess of Net Assets of Acquired Companies.  The excess of
acquisition cost over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible
net assets of acquired companies at date of acquisition is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 40 years.  The Company
assesses the recoverability of cost in excess of net assets of acquired
companies by determining whether the amortization of this intangible asset
over its remaining life can be recovered through estimated future undiscounted
operating cash flows.  If it is not recoverable, the carrying value of the
cost in excess of net assets of acquired companies will be reduced by the
estimated shortfall of discounted cash flows.

      (f) Pension Plans and Post-retirement Benefits.  Substantially all non-
union employees of the Company are covered under defined contribution plans. 
The cost of these plans is a fixed percentage of the participants' eligible
compensation.  In addition, the Company provides benefits to a limited number
of active and retired employees under an unfunded contributory defined benefit
post retirement health care plan.  Also, the Company participates in multi-
employer defined benefit pension plans for certain active and retired union
employees.  The Company's policy is to fund these benefits in accordance with
the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements.

      (g) Income Taxes.  Deferred income taxes are provided on a liability
method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary
differences and operating loss and credit carryforwards, and deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary
differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax basis.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     28
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on
the date of enactment.

      (h)  Environmental Liabilities.  The Company accrues environmental costs
on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  To the extent such costs
are covered by U.S. government contracts, these costs are treated as contract
cost and recognized as incurred.

      (i) Earnings Per Share.  The calculation of earnings per share of common
stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming
the exercise of stock options where the impact is dilutive.  The weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the years 1995, 1994
and 1993 were 17,666,000, 17,474,000 and 17,356,000, respectively.

      (j)  Use. of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

2.    Restructuring
      -------------
      In the second quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a restructuring
charge of $58.7 million ($47 million after-tax) in connection with a strategic
program to reduce its cost structure and asset base in light of the continuing
depressed economic conditions in the aviation industry.  The restructuring
charge consisted of a $21.8 million non-cash charge applicable to the
writedown of the estimated net realizable value of the assets, including $4.6
million of goodwill, associated with the sale and disposition of two business
units, the closing of a facility and the consolidation of two other plants,
and a $20.5 million provision for cost associated with the sale, closing and
consolidation of two business units and facilities, including severance and
related cost.  The remaining $16.4 million restructuring charge consists of
non-cash charges of $3.0 million related to the writedown of the carrying
value of certain under utilized plant and equipment that were identified for
sale under the restructuring program and a $13.4 million writedown of the
carrying value of inventory that was identified for sale to third party
brokers and others under the restructuring program.  The balance of the
reserve for future expenditures related to restructuring at December 31, 1995,
was $3.9 million.

3.    Acquisitions and Prospective Acquisition
      ----------------------------------------
      On January 15, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire
substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Garrett Aviation
Services, a leading provider of aviation services in the business aviation
aftermarket.  The purchase price is approximately $145 million which the
Company intends to finance through the issuance of $125 million of long-term
senior subordinated notes and $25 million of 8.5% cumulative convertible
Preferred Stock.  In addition, borrowing under the Company's Revolving Senior
Bank Debt will be necessary to the extent the purchase price plus transaction
costs exceeds the amount of funds generated from the issuance of the notes and
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     29
Preferred Stock.  The Company is currently in the process of soliciting the
holders of the 9 1/8% Senior Notes to amend certain covenants in order to
permit the borrowing of additional debt and amend the restrictions on the
payment of cash dividends to permit the payment of dividends on the Preferred
Stock.  As of February 23, 1996, the Company received consent from the
required majority of note holders to amend the covenants.  The acquisition is
contingent upon, among other things, receiving governmental approval under the
Hart Scott Rodino Act and financing on terms that are satisfactory to the
Company.  It is anticipated that the acquisition will be completed in the
latter part of April 1996.  Under certain circumstances, if the acquisition
is not ultimately consummated, the Company may be required to pay a break-up
fee of up to potentially $5.0 million. 

      During 1993, the Company acquired the entities described below, which
were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.  The results of
operations of the acquired companies are included in the Company's statement
of earnings for the periods in which they were owned by the Company.

      In April 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
technology, and assumed certain liabilities of Artex Tool Corporation and
Stockton Enterprises (collectively "Artex") for $5.2 million which was funded
through a borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreement.  Artex is
engaged in the remanufacture and repair of aircraft engine gear box housings,
wheels and other aircraft and engine parts and accessories.  Following its
acquisition this operation was renamed UNC Artex.  Under the terms of the
purchase agreement, the Company may be required to make additional payments
of up to $1.2 million, contingent upon Artex achieving certain profit levels
during the three year period ending May 1, 1996.  The excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable
intangible net assets acquired is amortized over a period of twenty-five years
using the straight-line method.  Any future amounts earned under the terms of
this agreement will be recorded as additional cost in excess of net assets of
acquired companies.

      In July 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
technology, and assumed certain liabilities of Johnson Technology ("Johnson"),
a division of Freedom Forge Corporation for $14.5 million in cash and $4
million in notes, payable in annual installments through July 1997.  The cash
portion of the purchase price was funded from proceeds received from the sale
of 9 1/8% Senior Notes (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).  Johnson provides proprietary turbine nozzle and vane
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     30
manufacturing and repairs, and specialized non-conventional machining of super
alloys such as electro-chemical deep hole drilling, laser milling, and
electro-discharge machining.  Following its acquisition, this operation was
renamed UNC Johnson Technology.  Under the terms of the purchase agreement,
the Company may be required to make additional payments contingent upon
Johnson achieving certain gross profit levels during a five year period ending
in September 1998 of up to $5 million of which $0.9 million was paid in 1995,
and $1.0 million in 1994.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired is
amortized over a period of forty years using the straight-line method. 
Contingent amounts earned under the terms of this agreement are recorded as
additional cost in excess of net assets of acquired companies.

      In August 1993, the Company acquired the assets and technology and
assumed certain liabilities of All Fab, Inc. ("All Fab"), an aerostructure
supplier for a major airframe manufacturer.  All Fab serves the aviation
industry as a manufacturer of major aircraft structural components and sheet
metal sub-assemblies.  Following its acquisition, this operation was renamed
UNC Aerostructures, Washington.  The purchase price consisted of $2.7 million
in cash and $3.1 million in notes.  The notes consist of a $1.8 million note
bearing interest at 8% and a $1.3 million note bearing interest at the prime
rate plus one half of one percent, payable in variable installments through
December 1998.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value
of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired is amortized
over a period of forty years using the straight-line method.

      In August 1993, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and
technology, and assumed certain liabilities of Metcalf Servicing Company
("Metcalf") for $4.5 million in cash and the Company elected to retire
$1.3 million of bank indebtedness of Metcalf.  Metcalf serves the industrial
turbine engine market with overhauls, parts repair and contract maintenance
services.  Following its acquisition, this operation was renamed UNC Metcalf
Servicing, Inc.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired is
amortized over a period of twenty-five years using the straight-line method.

      In October 1993, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Lear Siegler Management Services Corp. ("Lear
Siegler").  Lear Siegler provides contract services for the operation,
maintenance and repair of aircraft, land vehicles and marine vehicles for the
U.S. Department of Defense and the armed services of foreign governments. 
Following its acquisition, this operation was renamed UNC Lear Siegler.  The
purchase price was $17.4 million.  The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets
acquired is amortized over a period of twenty-five years using the straight-
line method.

      Under the terms of the earn-out provisions of agreements related to
acquisitions prior to 1993, the Company paid $3.7 million in 1994, and $3.7
million in 1993.  The earn-out provisions under these agreements have expired.

4.    Contracts in Progress

</TABLE>

      Amounts billed under contracts in progress and included in accounts
receivable at December 31, 1995 were $3.1 million under U.S. government prime
and subcontracts and $2.4 million under commercial contracts.  At December 31,
1994 these amounts were $3.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively.  

      Also, included in accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994 were
other amounts due from the U.S. government totaling $37.7 million and $42.2
million, respectively, including unbilled amounts of $14.9 million and $18.3
million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

      Unbilled amounts are recoverable from the customer upon shipment of the
product, presentation of bills or completion of the contract.  The Company
believes that a substantial portion (approximately 80%) of these unbilled
amounts will be collected in 1996.

      Included in accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is $2.0
million of cost applicable to a $3.2 million claim for equitable adjustment
filed by the Company under a contract with the U.S. government.  The claim,
which includes direct costs, overhead, general and administrative costs and
profit, arises from constructive change orders on the part of the government,
defective specifications, government caused delays and other issues in
connection with a contract to provide aircraft nozzle segment assemblies to
the U.S. Air Force.  The Company has been advised by outside legal counsel
that a basis for entitlement exists and that recovery of the recorded amount
of the claim is probable.

      Also included in accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is
a claim for $630,000 which the Company believes was improperly withheld by the
U.S. government in connection with a contract to provide aircraft intermediate
level maintenance, repair and overhaul services at six Naval Air Stations. 
The claim arises from the U.S. government unilaterally imposing a previously
undisclosed conversion formula to the determination of the amount earned,
contrary to contract terms.  In December 1993, the Company received a
favorable ruling on the claim from the Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals which overturned the government's previous position and instructed the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     32
government to reconsider the matter.  The Company believes it will prevail in
realizing the amount of the claim that has been recorded in accordance with
the terms of the contract.

6.    Assets Held for Sale
      --------------------
      Assets held for sale, which are stated at their estimated net realizable
value, consist principally of real estate and improvements and inventories of
the Company's former JT8 engine overhaul business that was closed in 1994, and
certain other inventory and underutilized property and equipment that has been
identified for sale under the Company's restructuring program.  Also included
in assets held for sale is real estate of the Company's discontinued minerals
business.  The Company expects to recover the recorded value of these assets
over the next three years.

      In May 1995, the Company entered into a new revolving credit agreement
which provides for a five year credit line through May 2000 with a borrowing
capacity of up to $90 million, subject to borrowing base limitations as
defined in the agreement and reduced by outstanding letters of credit.  The
Company's unused availability under the credit line was $33.0 million at
December 31, 1995.  Interest is payable on the borrowings at a base rate, as
defined in the agreement, or the LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable
margin based upon the Company's performance under certain financial ratios. 
The interest rate at December 31, 1995, was 8.71%.  The Company has agreed to
pay an annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the line at rates
ranging from 1/2 of 1% to 1/4 of 1% dependent on meeting certain financial
ratios.  The revolving credit is collateralized by the Company's accounts
receivable and inventories.  The agreement contains covenants which, among
other things, include provisions for the maintenance of certain financial
ratios and prohibits the payment of cash dividends,except for cash dividends
paid in connection with the senior cumulative convertible preferred stock to
be issued under the October 1995 agreement with Gildea Investment Company. 
See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

      On July 29, 1993 the Company issued $100.0 million of 9 1/8% Senior
Notes due July 15, 2003.  The Notes are redeemable, at the option of the
Company, on or after July 15, 1998 at declining premiums through 2000 and at
their principal amount thereafter.  The debt indenture contains certain
covenants which, among other things, allow additional borrowings based on
certain financial ratios and restrict the payment of cash dividends.  In
connection with the proposed acquisition of Garrett Aviation Services, the
Company is in the process of soliciting current note holders to amend certain
covenants in order to permit additional borrowings and amend the restrictions
on the payment of cash dividends.  As of February 23, 1996, the Company
received consent from the required majority of note holders to amend the
covenants.

      The 7 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2006 are convertible
into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $15.40 per
share and are redeemable (subject to certain restrictions) at the option of
the Company at declining premiums through 1996 and at the principal amount
thereafter.  Annual sinking fund payments of $4.2 million commence in March
1996.  During 1995 the Company purchased approximately $3.6 million face
amount of debentures to satisfy, in part, the March 1996 sinking fund payment. 
In January 1996, the Company purchased in the open market an additional $0.6
million of the 7 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures to satisfy the
balance of the 1996 sinking fund requirement.

      Included in other assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively,
was approximately $3.5 million and $3.9 million of unamortized issue costs
incurred in connection with the issuance of the 9 1/8% Senior Notes and the
7 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures. 

      Annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years are
$1,748,000 in 1996, $5,317,000 in 1997, $4,317,000 in 1998, $4,318,000 in 1999
and $41,381,000 in 2000.

      The estimated fair values of the 7 1/2% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures, and the 9 1/8% Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices, were
approximately $58.2 million and $98.0 million, respectively, at December 31,
1995 and $53.2 million and $89.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 1994. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     34
The Company believes that the carrying value of its remaining debt, which
consists principally of revolving credit, approximates market value based on
interest rates that are available to the Company for the issuance of debt with
similar terms and maturities.

      The Company discontinued its minerals and offshore products and services
operations in 1984, its telecommunications operation in 1988 and its submarine
propulsion unit manufacturing operation and its environmental services
operation in 1990.  In connection with these actions, the Company has
approximately $15.7 million, $12.6 million included in noncurrent liabilities,
accrued to cover the cost of certain long-term remediation activities, wind
down and final closure of certain long-term U.S. government contracts,
resolution of certain  litigation and disposition of remaining properties. 
The Company anticipates that these activities will be completed over the next
three years.

9.    Preferred Stock
      ---------------
      In October 1995, the Company reached an agreement with Gildea Investment
Company ("Gildea") and other investors to provide up to $25 million of equity
financing on an as needed basis to assist in financing future acquisitions. 
The equity investment will be in the form of a senior cumulative convertible
preferred stock ("the Preferred") issued by the Company.  The Preferred will
be purchased at $100 per share with a cumulative annual dividend rate of 8.5%,
with no mandatory redemption, and will be convertible into common stock at a
price of $7 per share.  The Company will have the option to pay dividends in
cash or in the form of a pay-in-kind cumulative preferred stock.  Gildea has
the option to invest $10 million if a like amount of Preferred has not been
issued by the Company by April 4, 1996.

10.   Preferred Stock Purchase Rights
      -------------------------------
      On September 25, 1987, the Board of Directors of the Company declared
a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right for each share of common
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     35
stock outstanding on October 19, 1987.  Each Right entitles the holder to
acquire one one-hundredth of a share of newly created Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $50 per one one-
hundredth of a Preferred Share.  The Rights trade with the common stock and
are not exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock until 10 days
after a person or group acquires, or announces a tender offer for 20% or more
of the Company's outstanding common stock.

      If the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination,
each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's then-current
exercise price, a number of the acquiring company's shares having a market
value at that time of twice the Right's exercise price.  In addition, if
someone acquires 20% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock, each
Right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person) to purchase,
at the Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the Company's common
shares having a market value of twice the Right's exercise price.

      Prior to the acquisition by someone of beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the Company's common stock, the Rights are redeemable for $.01 per
Right either at the option of the Board of Directors or automatically in
connection with the consummation of any tender offer at a cash price per share
equal to or greater than the price approved by stockholders at a special
meeting which would be called under certain circumstances in accordance with
procedures contained in the Rights Plan.  The Rights expire on October 19,
1997.

11.   Litigation and Contingencies
      ----------------------------
      Since 1985 the former Western Union has been seeking recoupment (the
"Claim") from various providers of international telex services ("ITPs") for
interconnect charges with respect to the use of Western Union's domestic telex
network during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Among these ITPs was TRT
Communications, Inc. ("TRT"), which the Company had acquired in September
1985.  As part of the Company's acquisition of TRT, the Company had received
certain representations and warranties from the seller of TRT with respect to
the Claims.  In January 1995, nearly seven years after a 1988 remand from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (the "Appeals Court"),
which had vacated an earlier determination by the FCC with respect to the
Claims, the FCC determined that the Claims were appropriate.  The FCC's
determination was again appealed to the Appeals Court which on February 6,
1996 rendered a judgment upholding the FCC's determination with respect to
these matters.  As a result, TRT may be liable to the former Western Union for
Claims and interest of approximately $5.0 million.  However, the Company sold
its interest in TRT in 1988 and, in connection therewith, the Company provided
the purchaser with certain specific indemnities.  The Company has been
informed that its purchaser has in turn sold TRT to a third party with whom
the Company has no contract for indemnity.  As a consequence, the Company does
not believe that it has any indemnity liability to the current owner of TRT. 
The Company intends to seek a rehearing by the Appeals Court, to assert a
protective claim against the seller of TRT, and to reject any claim by the
current owner of TRT.  Both the Company and its outside legal counsel believe
the Company has meritorious defenses against any claim under its
indemnification agreement.

      Lockheed-Martin Corporation ("Lockheed") began an action in United
States District Court of the Central District of California under the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     36
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
("CERCLA") in August 1994.  In that action, Lockheed seeks to have owners and
operators of property situated above the San Fernando Valley aquifer
contribute to the costs incurred or to be incurred by Lockheed to clean up
contaminated groundwater constituting the aquifer.  A subsidiary of the
Company, Pacific Airmotive Corporation ("PAC"), was made one of the defendants
in the action.  The Company and a second subsidiary, Airwork Corporation, were
added as defendants in December 1995.  Based on several series of soil tests
conducted on PAC's property and consultants' reports since approximately 1989,
the Company concluded, and continues to conclude, that there is no
demonstration that contaminants of concern identified in the groundwater by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been transmitted from the
surface of PAC's property to the underlying groundwater approximately 200 feet
below ground surface.  PAC is also pursuing alternative remedies against Purex
Industries, Inc. which owned and operated the property prior to 1985.  The
Company and Airwork have filed motions to dismiss the action as to them on the
grounds, among others, that they did not own or operate PAC's property, or
control PAC's operations.  The Company is not able to determine whether it or
a subsidiary of the Company will be held liable as a result of the Lockheed
action, or to establish a range of loss.

      The Company during 1995 was involved in litigation with respect to a
promissory note issued by the Company in July 1981 in connection with the
acquisition of Normco Contractors, Inc. ("Normco"), a former subsidiary of the
Company that was discontinued in 1984 and sold in 1985.  The plaintiff, a
former owner of Normco, brought action to obtain payment of $2.2 million
allegedly due under the note.  The Company did not make payment on the note
because the Company believed that, under the terms of the note and the related
purchase agreement, payment was contingent upon Normco attaining certain
operating profit levels that were not achieved.  The plaintiff's motion for
summary judgment was granted in March 1992.  However, in July 1993 the
appellate court reversed and remanded the case for trial.  Following trial in
April 1994, a jury verdict was rendered in plaintiff's favor for the amount
of the note plus interest and attorney's fees.  The Company appealed the
verdict on the grounds of prejudicial conduct by the trial judge as well as
on legal grounds that were essentially the same as those argued in its
previous successful appeal.  The Appellate Court ruled in favor of the
plaintiff, and the Company paid the judgment of approximately $3.5 million in
October 1995.  The Company is currently evaluating seeking recovery of all or
part of the judgment from the legal firm that represented the Company in the
1981 acquisition of Normco.

      In June 1995, the Company sold its chemical milled aircraft and engine
component business located in Weatherford, Texas, Chemical Dynamics, Inc., to
the former owner of the business.  Under the terms of the agreement, the
purchaser assumed, among other things, all known environmental risks related
to the operation of the business.

      The Company and a subsidiary, UNC Airwork Corporation, are defendants
in litigation commenced in New York by Energy Services, Inc. ("ESI") seeking
$3.4 million in alleged contract damages relating to a proposal to provide and
install electrical generating and other related equipment for a third party. 
The Company and Airwork believe they have meritorious defenses to ESI's
claims.  Airwork has filed a counterclaim against ESI and an affiliate, Energy
Maintenance Corporation ("EMC") for more than $3.7 million.  In December 1994,
the trial court granted Airwork's motion for partial summary judgment against
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     37
EMC, on a separate claim, in the amount of $458,000.  The trial court
subsequently awarded $1.5 million of ESI's claims against the Company and
Airwork on a theory of unjust enrichment, based apparently on the opinion that
the Company, Airwork and ESI in 1992 were implementing an agreement between
Airwork and ESI's affiliate dated August 19, 1991.  The Company and Airwork
are preparing for trial on Airwork's claim for more than $3.7 million, and
will appeal the trial court's award to ESI.  The Company believes it is
probable that ESI and an affiliate will be found liable for Airwork's
remaining claims, and that any recovery against the Company and Airwork is not
predictable.  

      During 1993, the State of New Mexico passed the New Mexico Mining Act
("Act"), which imposes certain reclamation obligations on owners and operators
of existing and new mining operations.  The State has asserted that a number
of mines operated by the Company's subsidiary, United Nuclear Corporation
("United Nuclear"), at various times during the period 1970 through 1982 may
be covered by the Act.  Regulations for compliance with the Act were issued
in 1994.  However, the regulations did not clarify the extent to which mines
previously operated by United Nuclear may be covered by the Act.
Consequently, it is impossible to estimate the cost of remediation or the
timing and extent of remedial action that may be required.  The Company has
been advised by outside counsel that United Nuclear's defenses have merit, and
it is contesting the State's assertions.  

      A uranium mill and mill tailings facility of a subsidiary of the
Company, United Nuclear, located in Church Rock, New Mexico was placed on the
National Priorities List by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
in 1982, pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA").  EPA issued an Administrative Order in
1989 requiring remediation of ground water on or adjacent to the site that is
the same as those contained in the reclamation plan submitted to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission ("NRC") in 1988 by United Nuclear in accordance with its
license with the NRC.  United Nuclear has been remediating the site in
accordance with the Administrative Order and the NRC license and has incurred
cost for such remediation of $2.1 million, $2.2 million and $1.7 million in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company has accrued approximately $4.0
million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the balance of
remediation required under the approved reclamation plan.

      The Company's former Naval Products Division has been named under
CERCLA, along with a number of other parties, as a Potentially Responsible
Party at several waste disposal sites.  In each case, the Division has been
named as a de minimus party.  The Company believes that any cost, estimated
to be less than a total of $100,000, that may be assessed to the Division is
recoverable under its U.S. government contracts.

      The Company and its subsidiaries are also parties to various other legal
actions and administrative proceedings and subject to various claims arising
in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that the disposition
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

12.   Income Taxes
      ------------
      During 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109 (SFAS No. 109), "Accounting for
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     38
Income Taxes" which supersedes SFAS No. 96.  Similar to SFAS No. 96, SFAS No.
109 retains an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. 
This standard also requires recognition of income tax benefits for loss
carryforwards, credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences for
which tax benefits have not previously been recorded.  The tax benefits
recognized must be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is more likely
than not that the benefits may not be realized.  The Company adopted SFAS No.
109 as of January 1, 1993.  There was no cumulative effect of this change in
accounting for income taxes on the consolidated financial statements.

      The income tax provision for continuing operations consists of the
following:

</TABLE>

      The decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance of $1,331,000 in
1995 was due to the realization of current income tax benefits resulting from
the reversal of temporary differences against financial statement income.  The
increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance of $13,692,000 in 1994 was
due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from net operating losses
and certain tax assets generated by the 1994 restructuring provision, the
provision for the withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan and other one-
time charges.  The net change in the valuation allowance in 1993 was a
decrease of $10,070,000 of which $2,451,000 resulted from the realization of
tax benefits of temporary differences which reversed during the year and
$7,619,000 resulted from the Company's re-evaluation of the realizability of
future income tax benefit occasioned by various events, including the
acquisition of four new businesses, which resulted in an
<PAGE>
<PAGE>      40
adjustment to goodwill of $1,829,000, the awarding of approximately
$227,000,000 in new contracts and the decision to withdraw from the
unprofitable third-party JT8 engine overhaul product line.  The amount of
deferred tax valuation allowance is determined based upon management's
evaluation of the net realizability of the future income tax benefits,
considering expiration of net operating losses, predictability of future
income, including the impact of the Company's restructuring program, and the
timing of reversal of temporary differences.

      At December 31, 1995 and 1994, other current assets include net deferred
tax assets of approximately $5.7 million and $3.2 million and other noncurrent
assets include net deferred tax assets of approximately $16.9 million and
$21.7 million, respectively.  Also, at December 31, 1995 and 1994, current
liabilities include income taxes payable of $1.4 million and $3.5 million,
respectively.

      At December 31, 1995, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards
of $34,621,000 for income tax reporting purposes of which $8,727,000 expire
in 2008, $19,576,000 expire in 2009, and $6,318,000 expire in 2010.  The
Company also has net operating loss carryforwards of $29,602,000 available for
purposes of federal alternative minimum tax of which $1,454,000 expire in
2008, $22,777,000 expire in 2009 and $5,371,000 expire in 2010.  At December
31, 1995, the Company has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $1,730,000 which are available to reduce future Federal regular
income taxes over an indefinite period.

      In connection with an examination of the Company's federal income tax
returns for the years 1990 through 1992, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
has proposed certain tax adjustments that could result in an additional tax
liability.  The Company disagrees with a large majority of the proposed
adjustments and has asserted certain offsetting tax adjustments in its favor. 
The Company has filed a written protest challenging the proposed adjustments
and supporting its right to the offsetting adjustments.  Management and its
tax counsel are of the opinion that the issues making up most of the
additional tax liability proposed by the IRS are either not factually or
legally supportable and that the Company's offsetting adjustments are
meritorious.  In addition, management is of the opinion that any additional
net tax liability that might ultimately result from the IRS audit would not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
condition, results of operation or liquidity.

13.   Incentive Compensation Plans
      ----------------------------
      The Company has stock plans, approved by the shareholders, which provide
for the granting of options and restricted stock to officers and key
employees.  Options are granted at no less than fair market value on the date
of grant, become exercisable in increments, in some instances partially
conditioned on the attainment of specific performance objectives, and expire
between six and ten years from the date of grant.

      The 1990 Stock Option Plan for Key Employees reserved 1,125,000 shares
of common stock, either previously unissued shares or shares held in treasury,
for issuance upon the exercise of options or as stock appreciation rights or
as restricted stock awards.  The exercise of an option is conditioned upon the
holder, (i) purchasing at fair market value, within ninety days of the grant,
stock equal to twenty-five percent of the number of options granted, and (ii)
continuing as beneficial owner of all such stock through the time of exercise.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>     41
Options are granted at no less than fair market value on the date of grant,
expire in ten years and vest in five annual installments of twenty percent
each January 1 following the date of grant.  The 1985 stock plan for Key
Employees terminated as of December 31, 1994, and no further options will be
granted under that plan.  However, 677,820 options remain outstanding and will
be exercisable in future years in accordance with the terms of the plan.

      As of December 31, 1995, officers and employees eligible under the 1985
and 1990 plans have purchased 234,000 shares of the Company's common stock in
the open market in order to qualify under the terms of these plans and held
outstanding options to purchase an additional 1,597,862 shares.

      A summary of certain plan information related to stock options is as
follows:

14.   Pension Plans and Other Post-retirement Benefits
      ------------------------------------------------
      The Company sponsors defined contribution plans that cover substantially
all of its employees.  Contributions are based upon a percentage of the
employee's compensation.  The cost of these plans was $6,273,000, $4,552,000
and $3,354,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      A defined benefit plan is also maintained for a limited number of former
union personnel of an overhaul facility that the Company closed in 1994.  The
cost of this plan was $98,000 in 1995, $81,000 in 1994 and $193,000 in 1993. 
In connection with the restructuring program in the second quarter of 1994,
the Company recorded a curtailment loss of $460,000 as a result of the closing
of this facility and the termination of the employees who were covered under
this defined benefit plan.  The projected benefit obligation and the fair
value of plan assets at December 31, 1995 were $1,568,000 and $985,000,
respectively.  The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was 7.25% in 1995. 
The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 7.25% in 1995.  Plan
assets consist principally of investments in commercial paper, marketable
securities, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations.  
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     42
      A subsidiary of the Company, UNC Airwork Corporation ("Airwork"), has
been a participating employer in a multi-employer pension plan covering its
hourly employees who are members of United Auto Workers ("UAW") Local 2315.
The plan is administered by trustees appointed by the UAW.  Through December
1994, Airwork has made contributions under the plan on the basis of a portion
of its hourly payroll based on collective bargaining, and has expensed such
contributions on a current basis.  The Company's contribution to the plan, as
required by the union contract, was $383,000 in 1994, and $313,000 in 1993. 
The Company has not made any payments to the plan in 1995 because it withdrew
from the plan in January 1995.

      During 1994, the plan's trustees informed participating employers that
the plan's obligations were substantially underfunded, that funding
deficiencies were incurred in the previous three plan years, and that a
substantial increase in employer contributions would be required.  This
underfunded status of the plan is not a result of Airwork not meeting its
contractual obligations, as Airwork has consistently complied with its funding
responsibilities in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement.  On January 31, 1995, the UAW provided participating employers with
an amendment to their respective collective bargaining agreements that would
have the effect of terminating the plan as to each employer entering into such
an amendment and, by doing so, withdrawing from the plan.  Airwork entered
into such an amendment, recognizing that participating employers not
withdrawing from the plan would be liable for underfunding on an ongoing
basis, that under the circumstances most employers would withdraw from the
plan, and that, as probably the largest participating employer, Airwork's
liability could be substantial.  As a result of the UAW's action, and
confirming Airwork's expectations, employers representing approximately 95%
of the plan participants withdrew from the plan on January 31, 1995.

      Under the rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
regarding multi-employer plans, all employers who participate in an
underfunded multi-employer plan and withdraw are assessed a withdrawal
liability.  Payment of the withdrawal liability is made over future years
while annual funding deficiencies, if not waived by the IRS, would be  paid
at the time the waiver is denied.  As a result of its withdrawal from the
plan, Airwork recognized as a non-recurring expense in 1994 of its portion of
the plan's unfunded liabilities and annual funding deficiencies which it
estimated to be approximately $14.0 million.  The Company is currently
negotiating with the Plan Trustees regarding annual funding payments to the
plan for the withdrawal liability and anticipates payments in an undetermined
amount will begin in 1996.

   The Company also contributes to other multi-employer plans that cover
approximately 566 employees.   The cost of these plans was $630,000, $591,000
and $816,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      The Company has non-qualified unfunded supplemental executive retirement
plans covering certain officers and directors for which the Company has
purchased cost recovery life insurance.  The Company is the sole owner and
beneficiary of such policies.  The amount of coverage is designed to provide
sufficient revenues to recover substantially all costs of the plans if the
assumptions made regarding mortality experience, policy earnings and other
factors are realized.  As of December 31, 1995 and 1994 the projected benefit
obligation was $16,231,000 and $12,972,000, respectively, and the accumulated
benefit obligation was $15,883,000 and $12,640,000, respectively, which is
included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     43
The cost of these plans was $2,095,000, $2,280,000 and $1,232,000 for 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The discount rate used in determining the
pension liabilities was 7.25% at December 31, 1995 and 8% at December 31,
1994.  At December 31, 1995, the additional minimum liability exceeded the
unamortized transition amount by $1,801,000, net of deferred income taxes.
At December 31, 1994, the additional minimum liability exceeded the
unamortized transition amount by $540,000, net of deferred income taxes. 
These amounts have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as reductions in stockholders' equity at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

      Post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits are provided to
a limited number of participating employees who become eligible for benefits
after reaching normal retirement age while employed by the Company.  The plan,
which is an unfunded contributory defined benefit plan, covers approximately
3% of the Company's employees.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." 
SFAS No. 106 requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of such retiree
benefits payments, other than pensions, during the employee's active service
period.  The Company previously expensed the cost of these benefits as claims
were paid.  The Company is amortizing the unrecognized net loss and
unrecognized transition obligation over 20 years.

      The actuarial and recorded liabilities for the post-retirement health
care and life insurance benefits at December 31, were as follows:

</TABLE>

      The net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for 1995 was $350,000 and
included $112,000 of service cost, $152,000 of interest and $86,000
amortization of the transition obligation.  The cost for 1994 was $360,000 and
included $76,000 of service costs, $172,000 of interest and $112,000
amortization of the transition obligation.

      For measurement purposes, a 7.25% and an 8% discount rate was used in
determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Also, a 10% annual rate of increase in the
per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1995; the rate
was assumed to decrease gradually to 6% for 2002 and remain at that level
thereafter.  The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
effect on the amounts reported.  A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     44
trend rates would increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
as of December 31, 1995 by approximately $202,000 and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit
cost for the year then ended by approximately $24,000.

      The Company also contributes in accordance with a union agreement to a
multi-employer health benefit plan.  The cost of this plan was $2,592,000,
$1,865,000 and $959,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

15.   Leases
      ------                                                
      In December 1994 the Company sold a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft
which had previously been covered under a leveraged lease.  The net proceeds
received of $6.8 million approximated the Company's investment in the lease. 
Income from the leveraged lease in 1994 and 1993 was $2.6 million and
$1.3 million, respectively ($1.5 million and $0.8 million net of income taxes
in 1994 and 1993, respectively).

      The Company entered into several agreements for the sale and leaseback
of certain equipment which resulted in gains totaling approximately $2.6
million in 1993.  The gains were deferred and are being amortized as a
reduction to rent expense over the lease terms.  The leases are classified as
operating leases and the rental commitments and rental expenses are included
in the following summary.

      The Company has noncancellable operating leases covering certain real
property and equipment used in its operations.  Minimum rental commitments
under these leases are 1996, $8,290,000; 1997, $7,087,000; 1998, $6,765,000;
1999, $5,943,000; 2000, $4,167,000; and thereafter, $1,769,000.  Rental
expenses for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $9,186,000, $8,720,000, and
$5,702,000, respectively.

16.   Cash Flows
      ----------
      Cash payments for income taxes were $1.2 million, $0.8 million, and $1.8
million  in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In these years, interest
payments were $19.6 million, $17.6 million, and $10.7 million, respectively.

      In connection with the acquisition of companies, the Company assumed
liabilities of $44.5 million in 1993 (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

17.   Business Segment Information
      ----------------------------
      The Company's operations are conducted within one business segment which
includes: the overhaul of aircraft engines, industrial gas turbine engines,
and aircraft accessories, the manufacture and remanufacture of jet engine and
aircraft components and providing maintenance and training, repair and
logistical contract services.

19.   Guarantor Subsidiaries
      ----------------------
      In July 1993, the Company issued $100 million principal amount of 9 1/8%
Senior Notes due 2003 (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).  The notes are guaranteed by all of the Company's subsidiaries
in the manner described below.  The combined guarantors are jointly and
severally liable under the subsidiary guarantees.

      The Company's obligations under the Notes are unconditionally guaranteed
by each of the Company's subsidiaries (the "Guarantees").  Each Guarantee is
a senior unsecured obligation of the subsidiary providing such Guarantee and
ranks pari passu with all senior unsecured indebtedness of such subsidiary. 
The subsidiaries also have guaranteed the indebtedness outstanding under the
Company's revolving credit facility (the "Subsidiary Bank Guarantees").  The
Subsidiary Bank Guarantees are collateralized, in general, by the accounts
receivable and inventory of the subsidiaries and therefore effectively rank
senior to the Guarantees.  The Guarantees are in effect only for as long as
the Subsidiary Bank Guarantees remain in effect.  If the Guarantees are
terminated the Notes will be obligations solely of the Company and will be
effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the
subsidiaries.

Report of Independent Accountants

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
UNC Incorporated:

     We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of UNC Incorporated and Subsidiaries listed in Item 14 to
this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and for the
years then ended.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UNC
Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be included
therein.

                                  KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP


Washington, D.C.

<PAGE>     60
ITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND 
               FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

     KPMG Peat Marwick were previously the principal certifying accountants
for the Company.  Following discussions between KPMG Peat Marwick and
representatives of the Company, the parties determined that KPMG Peat Marwick
would cease to serve as the Company's auditors effective February 22, 1994. 
The Company's Audit Committee was advised of these discussions and approved
of this action.

     In connection with the audits of the Company's consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993, and in the subsequent
interim period through February 22, 1994, there were no disagreements between
the Company and KPMG Peat Marwick on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosures or auditing scope or procedures,
which disagreements, if not resolved to KPMG Peat Marwick's satisfaction,
would have caused them to make reference in connection with their opinion to
the subject of the disagreement.

     The audit report of KPMG Peat Marwick on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for the year ended
December 31, 1993, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or
accounting principles, except that, as required with respect to changes in
accounting principles, the 1993 audit report made reference to the Company's
adoption in 1993 of the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes.

     Members of the management of the Company interviewed four of the "Big 6"
public accounting firms and requested that two of these firms present
proposals to the Audit Committee.  On March 17, 1994, the two firms presented
their proposals to the Audit Committee, which, after due consideration,
recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the firm of Coopers &
Lybrand be appointed as the Company's independent accountants for the year
ending December 31, 1994.  The Board of Directors approved of the appointment
of the firm of Coopers & Lybrand on March 21, 1994, subject to ratification
by the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 29, 1994.

      WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue and sell to the Purchasers, and
the Purchasers desire to purchase from the Company, up to 250,000 shares of
a newly created series of Preferred Stock of the Company, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Purchasers hereby agree as follows:

      1.          PURCHASE AND SALE.
                  -----------------
      1.1         Acquisition Shares.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, if the Company shall consummate one or more
acquisitions of a business or entity meeting the terms and conditions set
forth on Schedule 2 hereto (an "Acceptable Acquisition") on or prior to the
Outside Date (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall have the option (the
"Company Option") to sell to the Purchasers, and each of the Purchasers
agrees, severally and not jointly, to the extent that the Company exercises
the Company Option, to purchase from the Company, on any Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) the number of shares (collectively, the "Acquisition
Shares") of the Company's Series B Senior Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), set forth
opposite the name of each such Purchaser on Schedule 1 hereto under the column
"Acquisition Shares."  The Company Option may be exercised by the Company upon
written notice delivered to each of the Purchasers at least 20 days prior to
any Closing Date.  The Company Option may be exercised by the Company, in
whole or in part, provided, however, that the Company Option may only be
exercised by the Company for a minimum of 50,000 Acquisition Shares in the
aggregate and in integral multiples of 10,000 Acquisition Shares in the
aggregate.  Any sales of Acquisition Shares by the Company pursuant to a
partial exercise of the Company Option by the Company shall be made to the
Purchasers pro rata in proportion to the number of Acquisition Shares set
forth opposite the name of each Purchaser on Schedule 1 hereto.  

      1.2         Firm Shares.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, the Purchasers shall have the option (the "Purchasers'
Option") to purchase from the Company, and the Company agrees to sell to the
Purchasers, to the extent that the Purchasers exercise the Purchasers' Option,
on the Outside Date a number of shares (collectively, the "Firm Shares" and,
together with the Acquisition Shares, the "Shares") of Series B Preferred
Stock equal to the positive difference, if any, between (a) 100,000 and (b)
the aggregate number of Acquisition Shares sold by the Company to the
Purchasers on or prior to the Outside Date.  The Purchasers' Option may be
exercised by the Purchasers, in whole or in part, provided, however, that the
Purchasers' Option may only be exercised by the Purchasers for a minimum of
10,000 Firm Shares in the aggregate and in integral multiples of 10,000 Firm
Shares in the aggregate.  Any purchase of Firm Shares by the Purchasers
pursuant to a partial exercise of the Purchasers' Option by the Purchasers
shall be made by the Purchasers exercising the Purchasers' Option pro rata in
proportion to the number of Acquisition Shares set forth opposite the name of
each Purchaser on Schedule 1 hereto.  The Purchasers' Option may be exercised
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     6
by the Purchasers upon twenty days prior written notice delivered to the
Company on or prior to April 4, 1996. 

      1.3         Terms of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock.  The Series B Preferred Stock shall have such designations,
preferences, qualifications, voting rights, limitations, restrictions and
relative rights as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, Preferences
and Rights attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Series B Certificate of
Designation").  The Series C Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), of the Company issuable as
dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall have such designations,
preferences, qualifications, voting rights, limitations, restrictions and
relative rights as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, Preferences
and Rights attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Series C Certificate of
Designation" and, together with the Series B Certificate of Designation, the
"Certificates of Designation").  

      1.4         Purchase Price.  The purchase price for the Shares shall be
$100 per Share (the "Purchase Price").

      1.5         Closing.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of (a) if
the Purchasers' Option is exercised by the Purchasers, any Firm Shares, and
(b) if the Company Option is exercised by the Company, any Acquisition Shares,
shall take place at the offices of Coudert Brothers, 1114 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10036, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on (i) with
respect to any Acquisition Shares, the date of closing of the Acceptable
Acquisition, and (ii) with respect to the Firm Shares, the Outside Date, or
on such other date and at such other time and place as the parties hereto may
agree (the "Closing Date").  As used in this agreement the term "Outside Date"
shall mean the later of (i) April 4, 1996 or (ii) the date on which the twenty
day notice period with respect to the last Company Option notice or
Purchasers' Option notice delivered on or prior to April 4, 1996 expires.  In
no event shall the Outside Date be later than April 24, 1996.  The Purchasers
agree that any Closing with respect to the purchase and sale of Acquisition
Shares shall occur and the Company Option may be exercised by the Company
(subject to the notice provisions set forth in Section 1.1 hereof) in a manner
such that the Company receives the proceeds from the sale of the Acquisition
Shares as to which the Company Option is exercised immediately prior to or
simultaneous with the Company's consummation of the Acceptable Acquisition. 
At any Closing, the Company shall deliver to each of the Purchasers
certificates representing the number of Shares to be sold to each such
Purchaser hereunder and each such Purchaser shall deliver to the Company by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Purchase
Price for such Shares.  Such Shares shall be delivered to the Purchasers free
and clear of all liens, security interests, options, charges, beneficial
interests, claims and encumbrances of every kind (and free and clear of any
agreement to create any of the foregoing), except for restrictions on transfer
imposed by this Agreement and restrictions on transfer arising under
applicable securities laws.

      1.6         Commitment and Funding Fees.  Simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall pay Network III Holdings, LDC
or its designee ("Network III") a commitment fee in an amount equal to $1.00
multiplied by the aggregate number of Acquisition Shares set forth opposite
the names of all of the Purchasers on Schedule 1 hereto.  At any Closing, the
Company shall pay to Network III an amount equal to $1.75 multiplied by the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     7
aggregate number of Shares purchased by all of the Purchasers at that Closing. 
In the event that the Company does not exercise the Option as to all
Acquisition Shares and the Company shall, within one year of the Outside Date,
consummate the sale of any of its equity securities having terms similar to
the Series B Preferred Stock and on terms similar to the terms set forth
herein, the Company shall pay to Network III upon consummation of the sale of
such equity securities an amount equal to $2.00 multiplied by the difference
between (a) the aggregate number of Acquisition Shares set forth opposite the
names of all of the Purchasers on Schedule 1 hereto and (b) the aggregate
number of Shares sold by the Company to all Purchasers on or prior to the
Outside Date.

      2.          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.  The Company

of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  The Company has
delivered to the Purchaser complete and correct copies of its Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of

obligation or requirement to provide funds for or to make any investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any entity.

      2.7         Offering of Shares.  Neither the Company nor any person
acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action (including, without
limitation, any offering of any securities of the Company under circumstances
which would require the integration of such offering with the offering of the
Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
thereunder) which might subject the offering, issuance or sale of the Shares,
the Conversion Shares or the Dividend Shares to the registration requirements
of Section 5 of the Securities Act or to any similar provision of any
applicable state blue sky law.

      2.8         SEC Reports; Financial Information.  The Company has

(iv) any other reports or registration statements filed by the Company with
the SEC since December 31, 1993.  As of their respective dates, such reports
and statements (including any amendments or supplements thereto) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements

incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice,
since June 30, 1995, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
liabilities or obligations which are material to the Business of the Company

Subsidiary by the Company or any Subsidiary or any split, combination or
reclassification of shares of capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
declared or made by the Company or any Subsidiary; (v) any capital
expenditures or commitments by the Company or any Subsidiary for additions to
property or equipment which in the aggregate exceed $5,000,000 for all such

Senior Credit Facility); (vi) any transaction other than in the ordinary
course of business; (vii) any Shares Acquisition Date or Distribution Date (as

Plan")) or any other event causing the Rights issued thereunder to become
exercisable; and (viii) any agreement, whether in writing or otherwise, to
take any action described in this Section 2.9.

and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  There are no such suits, actions,
claims, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Company, threatened challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court,
governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or arbitrator or,

to the Company or any Subsidiary, which is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Business of the Company and the Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute violations of or
defaults in respect of) any contract (including leases), agreement,
instrument, arrangement or understanding to which it is a party or by which
it is bound and, to the best knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances which would reasonably indicate that the Company or any
Subsidiary will be or may be in violation of or in default in respect of (or
with notice or lapse of time or both would be in violation of or in default
in respect of) any such contract, agreement, instrument, arrangement or
understanding subsequent to the date hereof, except in all cases for such
violations and defaults (and events which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute violations or defaults) which in the aggregate would
not have a material adverse effect on the Business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

      2.13        Compliance with Applicable Law.  The Company and each
Subsidiary currently holds, and is in compliance with the terms of, all
licenses, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses, and has complied with, and, to the best of its
knowledge, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of, or in
default in any respect under, the applicable statutes, ordinances, rules,
regulations, orders or decrees of all federal, state, local and foreign
governmental bodies, agencies and authorities having, asserting or claiming
jurisdiction over it or over any part of its operations or assets, except for

on the date hereof, shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the conversion
of the Company's 7-1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2006 and

Compensation Shares or Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will amend its Certificate of

                  (c)         Except for issuances of up to 2,515,000 shares

<PAGE>
<PAGE>     14
convertible securities, or make any other changes in its equity capital
structure.

                  (d)         The Company will not knowingly and intentionally
(i) breach any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or (ii) cause any
of the representations or warranties of the Company contained herein to be or
become untrue in any material respect.

                  (e)         The Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary, upon reasonable request by any of the Purchasers, to provide the
Purchasers and their respective accountants, counsel and other authorized
representatives full access, during reasonable business hours and under
reasonable circumstances, to any and all premises, properties, contracts,
commitments, books, records and other information (including tax returns filed
and those in preparation) of the Company and each Subsidiary.

      4.2         Confidentiality.  The Purchasers will, and will instruct
their employees and agents to, hold in strict confidence, all Confidential
Information (as hereinafter defined), and will not disclose the same to any
person without the prior consent of the Company, unless compelled to disclose
any such Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process or,
in the opinion of their counsel, by other requirements of law.  If this
Agreement is terminated, the Purchasers will promptly return to the Company
or destroy all documents (including all copies thereof) furnished by the
Company and received by the Purchasers containing such Confidential
Information.  For purposes hereof, "Confidential Information" shall mean all
information of any kind concerning the Company, wherever obtained, except
information (i) ascertainable or obtained from the public or publicly
available information, (ii) received from a third party not known to the
Purchasers to be under an obligation to the Company to keep such information
confidential, (iii) which is or becomes known to the public (other than
through a breach of this Agreement), (iv) which the Purchasers can demonstrate
was in their possession prior to disclosure thereof to the Purchasers in
connection with this Agreement, or (v) which the Purchasers can demonstrate
was independently developed by them.

      4.3         Public Announcements.  The Company, on the one hand, and the
Purchasers, on the other hand, agree to consult promptly with each other prior
to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.

      4.4         Best Efforts.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use its reasonable
efforts promptly to obtain all waivers, permits, consents and approvals and
to effect all registrations, filings and notices with or to third parties or
governmental or public bodies or authorities which are necessary or desirable
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Nothing
contained in this Section 4.4 shall require any party to pay any money to any
third party other than filing fees or similar costs or expenses that may be
required or imposed by governmental authorities.  
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     15
      4.5         Shareholder Rights Plan.  The Company will take all such
action as may be necessary to ensure that each of the Purchasers and all of
the Purchasers together shall not constitute an "Acquiring Person" under the
Shareholder Rights Plan by reason of their acquisition of the Shares, the
Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares.  The Board of Directors of the
Company has determined that, consistent with the objectives of the Shareholder
Rights Plan, the Purchasers should not be considered "Acquiring Persons" under
the Shareholder Rights Plan with respect to their acquisition of the Shares,
the Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares and the transactions
contemplated by the terms of this Agreement.  The Board of Directors of the
Company will take reasonable steps to amend the Shareholder Rights Plan in
order to: (i) confirm, if necessary, that the Purchaser(s) shall not be
Acquiring Persons by reason of their acquisition of the Shares, the Dividend
Shares and the Conversion Shares and (ii) to ensure that, in the event that
rights distributed under the Shareholder Rights Plan become exercisable, each
Purchaser will be provided, with respect to their Shares, with substantially
the same rights that they would have had if such Shares had theretofore been
converted into shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Shareholder Rights
Plan Amendment").  Such Shareholder Rights Plan Amendment shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasers.

      5.          CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE PURCHASERS' OBLIGATIONS.  The
obligations of each of the Purchasers under this Agreement to purchase any
Shares on any Closing Date shall be subject to the satisfaction, or waiver in
writing (it being understood that any waiver of a condition with respect to
any Closing Date shall also constitute a waiver with respect to any remedy
that a Purchaser may otherwise have with respect to the matter or condition
that is the subject of the waiver with respect to Shares purchased on such
Closing Date but not as to any other purchase of Shares occurring prior or
subsequent to such Closing Date), of the following conditions on the Closing
Date.

      5.1         Representations and Warranties of the Company True;
Performance by the Company.  The representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement shall each be true and correct in all material
respects as of the Closing Date and, except for representations and warranties
which speak of a specified date, with the same effect as though made on and
as of that date.  The Company shall have performed and complied in all
material respects with all agreements and conditions required by this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to be performed or complied
with by the Company before or at the Closing Date.  The Purchasers shall have
been furnished with such certificates of officers of the Company, dated the
Closing Date, as the Purchasers may reasonably request, certifying to the
fulfillment of the foregoing conditions.

      5.2         Litigation Affecting Closing. On the Closing Date, no suit,
action or other proceeding shall be pending or threatened before any court or
governmental agency in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit the
consummation or implementation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or to obtain damages or other relief in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and on the Closing
Date, no governmental investigation that might result in any such suit, action
or proceeding shall be pending or, based on a communication from a
governmental official, threatened.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     16
      5.3         Approvals and Consents. (a) All consents, approvals or
authorizations of regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the
Company's or any Subsidiary's business relating to the Company's or any
Subsidiary's business as it is currently conducted or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained
in final and definitive form and shall be in full force and effect.

                  (b)         All additional consents, approvals or
authorizations required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or to preserve for the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to maintain
in full force and effect, all material contracts, leases, instruments and
other agreements to which the Company and its Subsidiaries are a party or by
which any of their respective property or assets are bound, shall have been
obtained and shall be in full force and effect.

      5.4         Opinions of Counsel to the Company.  The Purchasers shall
have been furnished with an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Miles &
Stockbridge, a professional corporation, special counsel to the Company,
satisfactory to the Purchasers, substantially in the following form:

                  (a)         This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Company;

                  (b)         The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will
not result in any violation of, or constitute a default under, and will not
be in conflict with, any terms of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws, in each case as amended to date, or to the knowledge of such
counsel, the terms of any mortgage, note, bond, evidence of indebtedness,
indenture, contract, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the
Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of its
assets or properties may be subject;

                  (c)         Upon payment of the Purchase Price for the
Shares, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser good and valid title to the
Shares free and clear of any liens, security interests, options, charges,
beneficial interests, claims and encumbrances of any kind (and any agreement
to create any of the foregoing) except for restrictions on transfer created
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and applicable securities laws;

                  (d)         The Shares have been duly and validly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, such Shares constitute all
of the issued and outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, and such
Shares are entitled to all of the rights and preferences set forth in the
Certificate of Designation.  The Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares,
when issued in accordance with the terms of the Certificates of Designation,
will be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and non-assessable;

                  (e)         No consents, approvals, authorizations and
orders of any public, governmental or regulatory body, agency or authority
and, to the knowledge of such counsel, of any other party (except such as
shall have been obtained) are necessary for the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the valid sale and delivery
of the Shares to be sold by the Company hereunder;
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     17
                  (f)         The Company has taken all action, legal or
otherwise, necessary to authorize the issuance of and reserve the Dividend
Shares and the Conversion Shares;

                  (g)         The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has full corporate
power to own its property and carry on its business as currently conducted; 


                  (h)         To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, so far as is known
to such counsel after inquiry of the officers of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries which (i) question or challenge
the validity of this Agreement or any action to be taken hereunder or
thereunder or (ii) singly or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                  (i)         The issuance, sale and delivery of the Shares,
the Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares under the circumstances
contemplated by this Agreement are exempted transactions under the
registration provisions of the Securities Act and all applicable state
securities laws, and do not require the registration of the Shares, the
Dividend Shares or the Conversion Shares thereunder; and

                  (j)         The Company is not an "investment company" or
a company controlled by an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

In giving the above opinions, such counsel may assume the genuineness of the
signatures of the officers of the Company and may rely, as to factual matters,
without independent check or verification, upon the representations and
warranties made in this Agreement, the documents delivered in connection
herewith and certificates of the officers of the Company.  Miles & Stockbridge
may also rely upon opinions given or expressed by Richard H. Lange, Esquire,
General Counsel to the Company, provided that such firm has no reason to
believe that it is unreasonable to so rely on such opinions and provided
further that counsel for the Purchasers consent to such reliance (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

      5.5         The Shares.  The Company shall issue and deliver to the
Purchasers certificates representing the Shares registered in the name of the
Purchasers.

      5.6         No Material Adverse Change.  Prior to any Closing Date,
there shall be no material adverse change in the Business of the Company, and
the Company shall have delivered to the Purchaser a certificate, dated the
Closing Date, to such effect.  

      5.7         No Adverse Events Under Shareholder Rights Plan.  The
Shareholder Rights Plan Amendment shall have become effective or the Company
and the Purchasers shall have agreed to other satisfactory arrangements with
respect to the Shareholders Rights Plan.  No "Shares Acquisition Date" or
"Distribution Date" (as defined in the Shareholder Rights Plan) or any other
event causing the Rights issued under the Shareholder Rights Plan to become
exercisable shall have occurred and there shall have been no amendment or
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     18
modification to the Shareholder Rights Plan other than the Shareholder Rights
Plan Amendment.
      
      6.          CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AT
THE CLOSING.  The obligations of the Company under this Agreement to sell the
Firm Shares and the Acquisition Shares on any Closing Date shall be subject
to the satisfaction, or waiver in writing (it being understood that any waiver
of a condition with respect to any Closing Date shall also constitute a waiver
with respect to any remedy that the Company may otherwise have with respect
to the matter or condition that is the subject of the waiver with respect to
Shares acquired on such Closing Date but not as to any other sale of Shares
occurring prior or subsequent to such Closing Date), of the following
conditions on the Closing Date:

      6.1         Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers True;
Performance by the Purchasers.  The representations and warranties of the
Purchasers contained in this Agreement shall each be true and correct in all
material respects as of the Closing Date, with the same effect as though made

      6.3         Opinion of Counsel to the Purchaser.  The Company shall have
been furnished with an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Coudert Brothers,
special counsel for the Purchasers, satisfactory to the Company, substantially
in the following form:

                  (a)         Upon execution and delivery, this Agreement
shall constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Purchasers; 

                  (b)         The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Purchasers and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
do not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions
of, or constitute a default under, any of the constitutive documents of any
of the Purchasers or to the knowledge of such counsel any mortgage, note, bond
or other evidence of indebtedness or indenture, contract, lease or other
agreement known to such counsel to which any of the Purchasers is a party; 

                  (c)         To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or threatened against
the Purchasers which question or challenge the validity of this Agreement or
the purchase by the Purchasers of the Shares hereunder; and

                  (d)         No consents, approvals, authorizations and
orders of any public, governmental or regulatory body, agency or authority
(except such as shall have been obtained) are necessary for the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchasers of this Agreement and
the purchase of the Shares to be purchased by the Purchasers hereunder;
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     19
In giving the above opinions, such counsel may assume the genuineness of the
signatures of the Purchasers and their officers or other authorized
representatives and may rely, as to factual matters, without independent check
or verification, upon the representations and warranties made in this
Agreement, the documents delivered in connection herewith and certificates of
the Purchasers and their officers or other authorized representatives.  

      6.4         Litigation Affecting Closing.  On the Closing Date, no suit,
action or other proceeding shall be pending or threatened before any court or
governmental agency in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit the
consummation or implementation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or to obtain damages or other relief in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and on the Closing
Date, no governmental investigation that might result in any such suit, action
or proceeding shall be pending or, based on a communication from a
governmental official, threatened.

      6.5         Approvals and Consents.  (a)  All consents, approvals or

Company's or any Subsidiary's business relating to the Company's or any

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained
in final and definitive form and shall be in full force and effect.

                  (b)  All additional consents, approvals or authorizations

respective properties or assets are bound, shall have been obtained and shall
be in full force and effect.  

      7.          REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

      7.1         Restrictive Legend.  Each certificate representing the
Shares, the Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares shall bear legends
substantially in the following form:

      THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
      REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY
      STATE SECURITIES ACT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE
      ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT PERTAINING THERETO
      UNDER SAID ACT AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE LAWS, OR AN
      OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH
      REGISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE ARE NOT REQUIRED.

      THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT
      TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON
      TRANSFERABILITY.  THE COMPANY WILL FURNISH ANY STOCKHOLDER UPON
      REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE A STATEMENT OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON
      TRANSFERABILITY WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
      BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY AND PURCHASERS SIGNATORY THERETO DATED
      AS OF OCTOBER 4, 1995.  THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THAT STOCK
      PURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE BINDING UPON TRANSFEREES AND PURCHASERS OF
      THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IN CERTAIN
      CIRCUMSTANCES.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     20
      7.2         Required Registrations.  If at any time the Company shall
be requested by any of the Purchasers (or the successors and assigns of any
of the Purchasers, who for purposes of this Section 7 shall be deemed to be
included within the term Purchaser) who holds, or upon the conversion of
Shares held by the Purchaser would hold, in the aggregate, at least the number
of Conversion Shares that would be issuable upon the conversion of 50% of the
Shares held in the aggregate by the Purchasers (including the Dividend
Shares), to effect the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares,
the Dividend Shares or the Conversion Shares, the Company shall notify in
writing all Purchasers of the receipt of the registration request within 10
days of said receipt and shall use its reasonable  efforts promptly to effect
the registration under the Securities Act of such Shares, Dividend Shares and
Conversion Shares as were covered by the original request or as may be
requested to be registered in one or more writings delivered to the Company
within 30 days after the giving of notice by the Company to all Purchasers,
for disposition in accordance with the intended method or methods of
disposition specified by the Purchaser requesting registration of such Shares,
Dividend Shares and Conversion Shares, as well as to effect any notification,
registration or qualification under any state securities laws which shall be
reasonably necessary to permit the sale of such Shares, Dividend Shares and
Conversion Shares.  The registration statement filed by the Company with the
SEC for the registration of such Shares, Dividend Shares and Conversion Shares
shall be kept effective for such period as may be requested in the
registration request, including any period then permitted under Rule 415 under
the Securities Act (it being understood that in no case, however, shall the
Company be required to keep any registration hereunder effective for a period
of more than two years in the aggregate, not including any period in which
sales of Shares, Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares cannot be made
thereunder).  Any obligation of the Company to register Shares, Dividend
Shares or Conversion Shares shall be deemed satisfied when a registration
statement covering the Shares, Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares shall
be declared effective and shall have remained effective for the period
specified above.  All expenses of any registration and offering under this
paragraph (including, without limitation, registration fees and fees and
disbursements of the Company's counsel) shall be borne by the Company, except
that the Company shall not bear underwriting discounts or commissions
attributable to Shares, Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares, fees and
expenses of any separate counsel for the Purchasers selling Shares, Dividend
Shares or Conversion Shares or any related transfer taxes.  The Company shall
only be required to file two registration statements covering the Shares,
Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares pursuant to the terms of this Section
7.2.

      7.3         "Piggy-Back" Registrations.  If at any time the Company
shall determine to register any of its Common Stock or securities convertible
into Common Stock under the Securities Act, whether in connection with a
public offering by the Company, a public offering by shareholders, or both,
including, without limitation, by means of any shelf registration pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any similar rule or regulation, but other
than a registration to implement an employee benefit or dividend reinvestment
plan, the Company shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Purchasers
who shall be registered holders of Shares or Conversion Shares and shall use
its reasonable efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of
such Conversion Shares as may be requested in a writing delivered to the
Company within 30 days after such notice by the Purchasers as well as to
include such Conversion Shares in any notifications, registrations or
qualifications under any state securities laws which shall be made or obtained
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     21
with respect to the securities being registered by the Company; provided,
however, that (a) any distribution of Conversion Shares pursuant to such
registration shall be managed by the investment banking firm, if any, managing
the distribution of the securities being offered by the Company on the same
terms as all other securities to be registered, and (b) the Company shall not
be required under this Section 7.3 to include Conversion Shares in any
registration of securities if the Company shall have been advised by the
investment banking firm managing the offering of the securities proposed to
be registered by the Company or others that the inclusion of Conversion Shares
in such offering would substantially interfere with the orderly sale of such
securities which the Company or others propose to register; provided, however,
that in making any determination under this subparagraph (b) as to the
inclusion of the Conversion Shares in any such offering, (i) a first priority
shall be given to the registration of 1,750,000 Conversion Shares, (ii)
thereafter, a second priority shall be given to all remaining Conversion
Shares over any other securities as to which the Company has granted or may
in the future grant registration rights that were (or will be) issued by the
Company in any merger transaction or similar business combination transaction
and (iii) with respect to circumstances not addressed in clauses (i) and (ii),
Conversion Shares shall be registered on a pro-rata basis with any other
securities as to which the Company has granted or may in the future grant
registration rights.  All expenses of any registration and offering of
Conversion Shares pursuant to this Section 7.3 (including, without limitation,
registration fees and fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel) shall
be borne by the Company, except that the Company shall not bear underwriting
discounts or commissions attributable to Conversion Shares, the fees of any
separate counsel for the holders of Conversion Shares or related transfer
taxes.

      7.4         Registration Procedures.  1. In connection with any
registration pursuant to Sections 7.2 or Section 7.3 hereof, the Company will
prepare and file with the SEC, a registration statement, and any amendments
and supplements thereto, on any form for which the Company then qualifies or
which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate, and use its reasonable
efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; provided
that before filing with the SEC a registration statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto, the Company will (i) furnish to counsel
selected by the Purchasers copies of all such documents proposed to be filed,
which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel, and (ii) notify
the Purchasers of any stop order issued or threatened by the SEC and take all
reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to
remove it if entered.  The Company will also (i) promptly notify each
Purchaser of the effectiveness of such registration statement, (ii) furnish
to each Purchaser such number of copies of such registration statement, and
each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in such
registration statement and such other documents as such Purchaser may
reasonably request; (iii) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify
such securities to be registered under such other securities or blue sky laws
of such jurisdictions as any Purchaser reasonably requests; (iv) use its
reasonable efforts to cause all such securities to be registered to be listed
on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company
are then listed, and to provide a transfer agent and registrar for such
securities to be registered no later than the effective date of such
registration statement; (v) enter in to such customary agreements (including
an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such other actions
as the Purchasers or the underwriters retained by the Purchasers, if any,
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     22
reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
securities to be registered, including customary indemnification; and (vi)
otherwise use its reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC.  The terms of this Section 7.4 shall not require the
Company to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities or
to execute or file any general consent to service of process under the laws
of any such jurisdiction where it is not so subject.  

                  (b)         The Company shall be entitled to postpone, for
up to 60 days, the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to
be prepared and filed by it pursuant to this Agreement if, at the time it
receives a request, the Company would be required to prepare any financial
statements other than those it customarily prepares or the Company determines
in its reasonable business judgment that such registration and offering would
interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization
or other material corporate transaction or development involving the Company
and the Company promptly gives the Purchaser written notice of such
determination.  If the Company shall so postpone the filing of a registration
statement, the Purchaser shall have the right to withdraw the request by
giving written notice to the Company within 30 days after the receipt of the
notice of postponement and, in the event of such withdrawal, the request which
was withdrawn shall not be deemed to have been made.

                  (c)         In connection with any effective registration
statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will immediately
notify each Purchaser participating in the distribution to which such
registration statement relates of the happening of any event as a result of
which the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and will promptly
prepare and furnish to each such Purchaser a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances then existing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company
determines in its reasonable business judgment that an amendment or supplement
to any such prospectus would interfere with any material financing,
acquisition, corporate reorganization, or other material corporate transaction
or development involving the Company, the Company may delay the preparation
and filing of such amendment or supplement for a period of up to 60 days in
order to complete or make a public announcement with respect to such material
transaction or development (it being understood that the Company shall be
obligated to extend the period of time it is required to maintain in effect
any such registration statement to take into account the period of time that
the Purchasers are unable to offer or sell Shares, Dividend Shares or
Conversion Shares by reason of this Section 7.4(c)).  

                  (d)         In the event that the Company conducts an
underwritten public offering of Common Stock or securities convertible into
Common Stock during the term of this Agreement, the Purchasers covenant and
agree that, except for sales of Shares, Dividend Shares or Common Shares
pursuant to such underwritten public offering, they shall not offer or sell
any of the Shares, Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares for a period of 120
days following the date on which the Company's underwritten public offering
is consummated.  Except for sales of Shares, Dividend Shares or Common Shares
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     23
pursuant to such underwritten public offering, the Purchasers shall be
obligated to perform the covenants contained in this Section 7.4(d)
irrespective of whether or not some or all of the Purchasers' Shares, Dividend
Shares or Conversion Shares are included in the underwritten public offering
or are then included in a registration statement that has been filed pursuant
to Section 7.2 of this Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall
be obligated to extend the period of time it is required to maintain in effect
any registration statement that has been filed pursuant to Section 7.2 of this
Agreement at the time an underwritten public offering is consummated to take
into account the period of time that the Purchasers are unable to offer or
sell Shares, Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares by reason of this Section
7.4(d)).

      7.5         Indemnification; Contribution.  (a)  Indemnification by the
Company.  In connection with each registration effected by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
each holder of Shares, Dividend Shares and Conversion Shares participating
therein (a "Selling Shareholder"), its officers, directors, agents and
Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) and each underwriter of Shares, Dividend
Shares and Conversion Shares (an "Underwriter") registered and each person who
controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any
of them may be subject under the Securities Act or any other statute or the
common law, and to reimburse them for any legal or other expenses incurred by
them in connection with investigating any claims and defending any actions,
insofar as any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out
of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact contained in the registration statement relating to the sale
of such Shares, Dividend Shares and Conversion Shares, or any post-effective
amendment thereof, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus,
if used prior to the effective date of such registration statement or
contained in the prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall
have filed with the SEC any amendment thereof or supplement thereto), if used
within the period during which the Company is required to keep the
registration statement to which such prospectus relates current pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein (if so used) a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that the indemnification agreement contained
in this subparagraph (a) shall not apply to such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or actions arising out of, or based upon, any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged
omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Selling Shareholders or such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the
registration statement or any preliminary prospectus or prospectus contained
in the registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement
thereto.

                  (b)         Indemnification By Selling Shareholders and
Underwriters. Each request that registration be effected by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement (and each notice of any Purchaser to the effect
that such holder wishes to join in any such request) shall be accompanied by
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     24
an agreement of each party making such request, and shall be accompanied or
followed by an agreement of each Underwriter, to indemnify and hold harmless,
which indemnity, as to the Purchasers, shall be several and not joint and in
proportion to the offering price of the securities sold by each of the
Purchasers, in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in
subparagraph (a) of this Section 7.5, the Company and each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act,
the directors of the Company or any such person and those officers of the
Company who shall have signed any such registration statement with respect to
any statement in or omission from such registration statement or any post-
effective amendment thereof or any preliminary prospectus (as amended or as
supplemented, if amended or supplemented as aforesaid) contained in such
registration statement, if such statement or omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company
by any such holder or underwriter specifically for inclusion in such
registration statement or any preliminary prospectus or prospectus contained
in such registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement
thereto.  

                  (c)         If the indemnification provided for in this
Section 7.5 is unavailable other than in accordance with its terms to an
indemnified party under subparagraph (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions referred
to in subparagraph (a) or (b) above in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the
Selling Shareholders and Underwriters on the other from the offering of the
Shares, Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares.  If, however, the allocation
provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable
law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Selling Shareholders and Underwriters on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on
the one hand and the Selling Shareholders and Underwriters participating in
the offering on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (i)
the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received
by the Company bear to (ii) the total net proceeds from the offering (before
deducting expenses) received by the Selling Shareholders and the total
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.  The
relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters or by the Selling Shareholders
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The
amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or actions referred to above in this subparagraph (c)
shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any
action or claim which is the subject of this subparagraph (c). 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph (c), no Selling
Shareholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which the total price at which the Shares, Dividend Shares and Conversion
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     25
Shares sold by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public
exceeds the amount of any damages which such Selling Shareholder has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of the Selling Shareholders in
this subparagraph (c) to contribute are several in proportion to the
respective number of Shares, Dividend Shares and Conversion Shares sold by
them and not joint.

      8.          EXPENSES.  Each of the parties hereto will pay its own legal
fees and other expenses relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Company agrees to pay to the Purchasers
their reasonable legal fees and up to $10,000 of other expenses incurred by
the Purchasers in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement.

      9.          SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNITIES. 
(a)  The representations and warranties included or provided for in this
Agreement shall survive for a period of two years from the Closing Date;
provided that such survival shall continue during the pendency of any suit,
action, claim or other proceeding brought in respect of such representations
and warranties prior to the termination of such two-year period; and provided,
further, that the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.5
shall survive the Closing indefinitely.  The Company agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Purchasers, their respective permitted successors
and assigns and the respective affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of such Purchasers and such respective
permitted successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified
Parties") from and against and in respect of any demand, action, damage,
deficiency, liability, loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation,
reasonable counsel fees incurred in litigation or otherwise) to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising out of any breach of representation or warranty
or nonfulfillment by it of any agreement or covenant contained herein
(collectively "Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses"); provided, however, that
the Company's indemnification obligations under this Section 9(a) shall arise
only in the event that the accumulated amount of all Purchaser Indemnified
Party Losses, in the aggregate, shall exceed $100,000.  If the accumulated
amount of all Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses in the aggregate exceeds
$100,000, the Company shall then be liable on a dollar for dollar basis for
the full amount of all Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses.  The Purchasers and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
with respect to any claim under the foregoing provisions of this Section 9 as
to which notice shall not have been given by a Purchaser Indemnified Party to
the Company within two years of the date of occurrence of the events giving
rise to such claim, or, with respect to indemnification for claims arising out
of the breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.5,
within two years from the date of discovery of the breach by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.  
                  (b)         Each of the Purchasers agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company from and against and in respect of any
demand, action, damage, deficiency, liability, loss, cost or expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees incurred in litigation
or otherwise) to the Company arising out of any material breach of any
representation or warranty or nonfulfillment by such Purchaser of any
agreement or covenant contained herein (collectively "Company Losses");
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     26
provided, however, that each Purchaser's indemnification obligations under
this Section 9(b) shall arise only in the event that the accumulated amount
of all Company Losses attributable to all Purchasers shall exceed $100,000 in
the aggregate.  If the accumulated amount of all Company Losses in the
aggregate exceeds $100,000 each Purchaser shall then be liable on a dollar-
for-dollar basis for the full amount of all Company Losses attributable to
such Purchaser.  The Company shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any claim under the foregoing provision of this Section 9 as to
which notice shall not have been given by the Company to such Purchaser within
two years of the date of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such
claim.  

                  (c)         Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
under this Agreement of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action,
the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against the indemnifying party under Section 7.5 or Section 9 hereof, notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that
action.  If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. 
After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 7.5 or Section 9
hereof for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Purchasers shall have the
right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Purchasers and their
respective controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of
any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Purchasers
against the Company under Section 7.5 hereof if, in the reasonable judgment
of the Purchasers, it is advisable for the Purchasers and such controlling
persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company.

      10.         CERTAIN AGREEMENTS.

      10.1        Standstill.  (a) For so long as a Purchaser shall hold
Shares and/or Conversion Shares, such Purchaser will not (i) acquire, or make
any offer to acquire or announce any intention to acquire, additional
ownership (including beneficial ownership) of any of the shares of the voting
securities of the Company, or other securities of the Company convertible into
voting securities, or the right or option to acquire any such securities,
except for the Shares, the Dividend Shares and the Conversion Shares, (ii)
participate in any "group," as that term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act, with respect to the voting securities of the Company, other than
any group comprised of the Purchasers and their respective affiliates, (iii)
make or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in any material
respect in any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the
proxy rules of the SEC), whether before or after the formal commencement of
any such solicitation, or any solicitation of shareholder written consents,
in opposition to, or designed to influence the management of the Company, (iv)
execute any written consent or initiate any shareholder proposal for action
by shareholders, (v) except as provided in the Certificates of Designation
seek to place more than one representative on the Board of Directors of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     27
Company, seek the removal of any member of the Board of Directors of the
Company, or seek to have called any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, (vi) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to
control or influence in any material respect the management, Board of
Directors or policies of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (vii)
request, the Company (or its directors, officers, employees or agents) to
amend or waive any provision of this Section 10.1(a), (viii) knowingly and
intentionally sell or otherwise transfer Shares or Conversion Shares
representing in the aggregate beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the then
outstanding Common Stock to any person, entity or "group", as that term is
defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, (ix) knowingly and
intentionally sell or otherwise transfer any Shares or Conversion Shares to
any person, entity or "group", as that term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act, as to which person, entity or group the Purchasers have
received notice from the Company of such person, entity or group's intention
to seek to take, assist or participate in any of the actions set forth in
clauses (iii) through (vi) above, and (x) assist, participate in, encourage
or solicit in any material respect any effort or attempt by any other person
or group to do or seek to do any of the foregoing.  Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 10.1(a) to the contrary, the Purchasers shall have the right
to (i) make or effect open-market sales of any Shares or Conversion Shares
through a broker-dealer, without any duty of inquiry as to the identity of any
purchaser of Shares or Conversion Shares (in the absence of actual knowledge
that the purchaser of Shares or Conversion Shares in the open market from the
Purchasers is a person, entity or group of the type specified in clause (ix)
above) and (ii) make or effect transfers to their affiliates, other persons
with respect to whom the Purchaser has investment authority with respect to
any Shares or Conversion Shares to be transferred to any such person or any
person under common investment management with such Purchaser (collectively,
"Permitted Transferees") and other Purchasers and their Permitted 
Transferees.

                  (b)         During the period in which the Purchasers shall
hold Shares and/or Conversion Shares which represent, in the aggregate, 5% of
the shares of the Company's Common Stock issued and outstanding after giving
effect to the pro forma conversion of all outstanding shares into Conversion
Shares and ending on the date on which a Change in Control occurs, each
Purchaser covenants and agrees that he shall not sell, transfer or dispose,
in any three-month period, in the aggregate, Shares or Conversion Shares
which, when aggregated with any sale, transfer or disposal of Shares or
Conversion Shares of any other Purchaser during any such three month period,
represent beneficial ownership of more than the greater of (i) 1,000,000
shares of the Common Stock then issued and outstanding, or (ii) the volume of
Shares and Conversion Shares saleable under Rule 144(e) promulgated under the
Securities Act.  The Purchasers shall have the right to make or effect sales,
transfers or other dispositions to their Permitted Transferees and to other
Purchasers and their Permitted Transferees, without regard to the limitations
set forth in this Section 10.1(b), subject to compliance with all applicable
securities laws.

      10.2        Agreement Respecting Board Representation.  From and after
the exercise of the Company Option by the Company and the purchase of the
Acquisition Shares by the Purchasers (but only for so long as the Purchasers
shall hold Shares and/or Conversion Shares which represent, in the aggregate,
10% of the shares of the Company's Common Stock issued and outstanding after
giving effect to the pro forma conversion of all outstanding Shares into
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     28
Conversion Shares), the Company shall take all action necessary, including,
without limitation, increasing the number of directors constituting the entire
Board of Directors of the Company, to cause one person (the "Purchasers'
Nominee") nominated by the Purchasers holding a majority of the Conversion
Shares issued or issuable upon conversion of the Shares to be nominated for
election to the Board of Directors of the Company, at any regular or special
meeting of stockholders of the Company called for the purpose of filling
positions on the Board of Directors of the Company, or in any written consent
executed in lieu of such a meeting of stockholders, and to recommend the
Purchasers' Nominee for election to the Board of Directors in the same manner
as all other nominees of the Company for election as director.  Not fewer than
20 days after receipt of a written notice from the Company requesting such
information, the Purchasers shall notify the Secretary of the Company of the
identity of the Purchasers' Nominee and provide such information concerning
the Purchasers' Nominee as may be required by Regulation 14A under the
Exchange Act.  The Company shall have the right to reject any particular
Purchasers' Nominee if the Company determines in its reasonable business
judgement that the election as a director of such Purchasers' Nominee would
materially impair the Company's reputation in the business and financial
community.  Consistent with the foregoing, the Company will advise the
Purchasers promptly of  the non-approval of any proposed nominee so that an
alternative can be selected by the Purchasers.  In the event of non-approval,
the Purchasers and the Company's Organization Committee will meet and use
their best efforts to agree upon an acceptable nominee.  It is hereby agreed
by the Company that John W. Gildea shall be an acceptable nominee.  If, prior
to his election to the Board of Directors of the Company, the Purchasers'
Nominee shall, be unable or unwilling to serve as a director of the Company,
the Purchasers who nominated such Purchasers' Nominee shall be entitled to
nominate a replacement who (subject to the procedures set forth in the
preceding sentences with respect to unacceptable nominees) shall then be the
Purchasers' Nominee for purposes of this Section 10.2.  If, following election
to the Board of Directors of the Company, any Purchasers' Nominee shall resign
or be removed or be unable to serve for any reason prior to the expiration of
his term as a director of the Company, the Purchasers who nominated such
Purchasers' Nominee shall within 30 days of such event, notify the Board of
Directors of the Company in writing of a replacement Purchasers' Nominee and
the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all action necessary (subject
to the procedures set forth herein with respect to unacceptable nominees) to
cause such replacement Purchasers' Nominee to be elected or appointed to fill
the unexpired term of such Purchasers' Nominee and to recommend the
replacement Purchasers' Nominee for election to the Board of Directors in the
same manner as all other nominees of the Company for election as director at
any subsequent annual or special meeting of shareholders or pursuant to any
written consent in lieu of such a meeting.  For purposes of this Section 10.2,
the term Purchasers shall refer to the Purchasers' signatory hereto, persons
with respect to whom a Purchaser signatory has investment authority with
respect to any Shares transferred to any such person and any other person
which is under common investment management with any Purchaser signatory.

      10.3        No redemptions or cash payments.  The Company hereby
covenants and agrees that, whenever any share of the Series C Preferred Stock
is issued and outstanding, it shall not (i) make or pay any cash dividends,
distributions or other cash payments of any type on or with respect to any
Junior Security (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) redeem for cash (in whole or
in part) any Junior Security.  For purposes of this agreement, the term
"Junior Security" shall mean any security constituting part of a class of
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     29
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
Series B and Series C Preferred Stock.

      11.         NOTICES, ETC.  All notices, requests, demands or other com-
munications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been

      12.         GENERAL.

      12.1        Amendment and Waiver.  Neither this Agreement nor any term
hereof may be changed, waived, amended or terminated orally, but only by
written act of the Purchasers and the Company (or, in respect of a waiver, the
waiving party or parties).

      12.2        Assignment.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and legal
representatives, but shall not be assignable by any party without the written
consent of the other party; provided, however, that the rights and obligations
of any Purchaser may be assigned to one or more of its affiliates or other
persons or entities with respect to whom such Purchaser has investment
authority with respect to any Shares transferred to such affiliate or other
person or entity or which is under common investment management with any
Purchaser, if such affiliate or other person or entity agrees in writing to
be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The terms of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 9 and Section 10.1
hereof, shall be binding upon any person or entity who acquires Shares,
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     30
Dividend Shares or Conversion Shares from a Purchaser hereunder unless such
Shares are acquired at least three years from the date such Shares were
issued, in an underwritten public offering or in unsolicited broker's
transactions effected in compliance with all of the terms and provisions of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

      12.3        Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard
to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.

      12.4        Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one and the same instrument.

      12.5        Headings.  The section and paragraph headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning and interpretation of this Agreement.

      12.6        Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereto hereby waive any
provision of law which renders any provision hereof prohibited or
unenforceable in any respect.

      12.7        Termination.  Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated by either the Purchasers or
the Company, upon written notice to the other, if the Closing of the purchase
and sale of any Shares shall not have occurred on or prior to the Outside
Date.  This Agreement may also be terminated by mutual consent of the
Purchasers and the Company.  After termination, the Purchasers and the Company
shall have no liability or further obligation to the other under this
Agreement, other than their respective obligations under Sections 1.6, 4.2,
4.3, 8, 9, 10 and Section 12 hereof.

                              UNC INCORPORATED

                   CERTIFICATE OF THE DESIGNATION, POWERS,
          PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF THE SERIES B SENIOR CUMULATIVE
                         CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

                          PAR VALUE $1.00 PER SHARE

                   Pursuant to Section 151 of the General
                  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

      The following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board of Directors
of UNC Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), pursuant to
the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, on September 29, 1995 at a meeting of the Board of Directors at
which there was at all times present and acting a quorum of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation:

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is authorized, within
the limitations and restrictions stated in the Certificate of Incorporation,
to fix by resolution or resolutions the designation of each series of
Preferred Stock and the powers, preferences and relative participating,
optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof, including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such provisions
as may be desired concerning voting, redemption, dividends, dissolution or the
distribution of assets, conversion or exchange, and such other subjects or
matters as may be fixed by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; and

      WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
pursuant to its authority as aforesaid, to authorize and fix the terms of a
series of such Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such
series:

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:

      (1)  Designation and Number of Shares.  The designation of said series
of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Series Preferred Stock"),
authorized by this resolution shall be "Series B Senior Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock" (the "Series B Preferred Stock").  The number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock authorized hereby shall be 250,000 and no more,
except as provided herein.

      (2)  Rank.  The Series B Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend
rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution, rank (a) on a
parity with the Series C Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00
per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), and (b) prior to any other equity
securities of the Corporation, whether currently authorized or hereafter
created, including any other series of Series Preferred Stock and the Common
Stock, par value $.20 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock", all
of such equity securities of the Corporation to which the Series B Preferred
Stock ranks prior, including any other series of Series Preferred Stock and
the Common Stock, are referred to herein collectively as the "Junior
Securities").
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     35
      (3)  Dividends. (a) (i)  The holders of the shares of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of
Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends,
cumulative dividends at the annual rate (subject to adjustment as set forth
in subparagraph (iv) below) of $8.50 per share in equal quarterly payments on
the last business day of each calendar quarter (each of such dates being a
"Dividend Payment Date"), commencing with the last day of the calendar quarter
in which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are issued, in preference to
dividends on the Junior Securities.  Such dividends shall be paid to the
holders of record at the close of business on the date which is ten (10)
business days prior to the Dividend Payment Date.  Each of such quarterly
dividends (whether payable in cash or in stock) shall be fully cumulative and
shall accrue (whether or not declared), without interest, from the Date of
Issuance.  Subject to subparagraph (iii) below, any dividend payments due with
respect to the Series B Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date shall be
made by issuing fully paid and non-assessable shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, valued as set forth below (a "PIK Dividend"); provided, however, that
in lieu of issuing shares of Series C Preferred Stock, dividends may be paid,
in the sole discretion of the Corporation, in cash or any combination of cash
and Series C Preferred Stock.  The issuance of such shares or the issuance of
such shares together with payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of any
shares shall constitute full payment of such dividend.

      (ii)  Shares of Series C Preferred Stock used for the purpose of paying
dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will be valued at $100.00 per share.

      (iii)  In the event that the Corporation is no longer a party to any
Restrictive Agreement (as defined below) prohibiting the payment of cash
dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, dividend payments with respect to
the Series B Preferred Stock shall be made in cash.  "Restrictive Agreement"
shall mean any agreement to which the Corporation is a party on the date
hereof (including as modified, amended, extended, refinanced or replaced)
which by its terms restricts the Corporation's ability to (A) pay dividends
in cash with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock or (B) redeem the Series
B Preferred Stock, excluding any such agreement which has been substantially
assigned to a party which is not a party thereto on the date hereof.

      (iv)  In the event that the Corporation shall make a PIK Dividend at any
time after the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series B
Preferred Stock (the "Date of Issuance"), the annual rate of PIK Dividends
payable thereafter with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock shall be
increased to $9.50 per share.  In the event that the Corporation shall make
a PIK Dividend at any time after the fourth anniversary of the Date of
Issuance, the annual rate of PIK Dividends payable thereafter with respect to
the Series B Shares shall be increased to $10.50 per share.  In the event that
the Corporation shall make a PIK Dividend at any time after the fifth
anniversary of the Date of Issuance, the annual rate of PIK Dividends payable
thereafter with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock shall be increased to
$11.00 a share.  Any adjustment to the annual rate of PIK Dividends payable
with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this subparagraph
(iv) shall be effective after the date of the applicable PIK Dividend and the
dividend payment in fully paid non-assessable shares of Series C Preferred
Stock with respect to the next following date of PIK Dividend shall be
adjusted to reflect the applicable increased annual rate.  Dividend payments,
or any portion thereof, with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock to be
paid in cash will be at annual rate of $8.50 per share.  
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     36
      (b)  All dividends paid with respect to shares of Series B Preferred
Stock pursuant to paragraph (3)(a) shall be paid pro rata to the holders
entitled thereto.

      (c)  No full cash dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for
payment on the Series C Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative
cash dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such
payment on the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods
terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative
dividends.  If any cash dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, all cash
dividends declared upon shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of cash
dividends declared per share on the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series
C Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that
accrued cash dividends per share on the Series B Preferred Stock and the
Series C Preferred Stock bear to each other.  No interest, or sum of money in
lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or
payments on the Series B Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.

      (d)  (i)  Whenever dividends or distributions payable on the Series B
Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 3 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not
declared, on shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been
paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

            (A)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions,
on any Junior Securities (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up); or

            (B)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
shares of any Junior Securities (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up), provided that the Corporation may at any time
redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such Junior Securities in
exchange for shares of any other Junior Securities.

      (ii)  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, the Board
of Directors may declare, and the Corporation may pay or set apart for
payment, dividends and other distributions on any of the Junior Securities,
and may purchase or otherwise redeem any of the Junior Securities or any
warrants, rights or options exercisable for or convertible into any of the
Junior Securities, and the holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to share therein.

      (4)  Liquidation Preference.  (a)  In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders an amount in cash equal to
$100.00 for each share outstanding, plus an amount in cash equal to all
accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, before any payment shall be made or any assets
distributed to the holders of any of the Junior Securities.  If the assets of
the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation payments
payable to the holders of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     37
Series C Preferred Stock, then the holders of all such shares shall share
ratably in such distribution of assets in accordance with the amount which
would be payable on such distribution if the amounts to which the holders of
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
are entitled were paid in full.

      (b)  The liquidation payment with respect to each fractional share of
Series B Preferred Stock outstanding or accrued but unpaid shall be equal to
a ratably proportionate amount of the liquidation payment with respect to each
outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock.

      (c)  For the purposes of this Section 4, neither the voluntary sale,
conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities
or other consideration) of all or substantially all the property or assets of
the Corporation or the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or
more other corporations shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, voluntary or involuntary, unless such voluntary sale, conveyance,
lease, exchange or transfer shall be in connection with a dissolution or
winding up of the business of the Corporation.

      (5)  Redemption.  Commencing after the Effective Date (as defined
below), the Corporation at its option may redeem, to the extent funds are
legally available therefor, the Series B Preferred Stock, at any time in whole
or from time to time in part, at the per share redemption price equal to
$100.00 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for
redemption, without interest (the "Redemption Price").  "Effective Date" shall
mean, the last day of any ninety (90) consecutive calendar day period that
occurs after the fourth anniversary of the Date of Issuance in which the last
reported sales price regular way for the Common Stock of the Corporation on
the New York Stock Exchange (or any other national securities exchange or
NASDAQ on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted) on all trading days in
that period is at least equal to 200% of the Conversion Price (as defined in
Section 7).

      (b)  The Corporation shall not optionally redeem the Series B Preferred
Stock, in whole or in part, without first redeeming, all outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock  at the Redemption Price for the Series C
Preferred Stock.  

      (c)  Unless the Corporation is prohibited by the terms of any
Restrictive Agreement from redeeming any shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
in the event of any Change in Control (as defined below) with respect to the
Corporation, each holder of the Series B Preferred Stock may, from time to
time, require the Corporation to, and the Corporation shall, redeem any number
of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by it for the Redemption Price
upon thirty (30) days prior written notice.  "Change in Control" shall mean
(A) any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation) which will result in
the Corporation's stockholders immediately prior to such transaction not
holding (by virtue of such shares or securities issued solely with respect
thereto) at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving or
continuing entity, (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, unless the Corporation's stockholders immediately prior to such
sale will, as a result of such sale, hold (by virtue of securities issued as
consideration for the Corporation's sale) at least fifty percent (50%) of the
voting power of the purchasing entity, or (C) during any period of two
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     38
consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute
the entire Board of Directors shall cease for any reason to constitute a
majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the
Corporation's stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at
least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at
the beginning of the period.

      (d)  Shares of Series B Preferred Stock which have been issued and
reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed or exchanged,
shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State
of Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class
of Series Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series, and may be redesignated
and reissued as part of any series of the Series Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Corporation; provided, however, that no such issued
and reacquired shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be reissued or sold
as Series B Preferred Stock.

      (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, unless
the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock shall have been paid or contemporaneously are declared and paid for all
past dividend periods, none of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall
be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise
acquire (except pursuant to Section 6 hereof) any shares of Series B Preferred
Stock; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase
or acquisition of shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase
or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares
of Series B Preferred Stock.

      (6)  Procedure for Redemption.  (a)  In the event that fewer than all
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the
number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board of Directors
and the shares to be redeemed shall be determined by lot or pro rata as may
be determined by the Board of Directors.  

      (b)  In the event the Corporation shall redeem shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first class mail,
postage prepaid, mailed not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty
(60) days prior to the date of redemption (the "Redemption Date"), to each
holder of record of the shares to be redeemed at such holder's address as the
same appears on the stock register of the Corporation; provided, however, that
no failure to mail such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the
validity of the proceeding for the redemption of any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock to be redeemed except as to the holder to whom the Corporation
has failed to mail said notice or except as to the holder whose notice was
defective.  Each such notice shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the
number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than
all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed from such holder, the
number of shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price;
(iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the
shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date.

      (c)  Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the
Redemption Date (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in providing
money for the payment of the Redemption Price of the shares called for
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     39
redemption) dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall cease to accrue, and said shares shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares
of Preferred Stock, unclassified as to series, and shall not be reissued as
shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and all rights of the holders thereof as
stockholders of the Corporation with respect to said shares (except the right
to receive from the Corporation the Redemption Price) shall cease. Upon
surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any shares
so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of
Directors of the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state),
such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price
aforesaid.  In case fewer than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the
unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.

      (7)  Conversion.  (a)  Subject to and upon compliance with the
provisions of this Section 7, unless previously redeemed by the Corporation,
the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the right, at
such holders' option, at any time and from time to time, to convert such
shares into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation.  The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be equal to $100.00 divided
by the Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) in effect at the time of
conversion, determined as hereinafter provided.  The price at which shares of
Common Stock shall be delivered upon conversion (the "Conversion Price") shall
initially be $7.00 (subject to the adjustments set out in this Section 7). 
The right to convert shares called for redemption pursuant to this Section 7
shall terminate at the close of business on the date fixed for such redemption
unless the Corporation shall default in making payment of the amount payable
upon such redemption.

      (b)  The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the close of
business on a dividend payment record date shall be entitled to receive the
dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date
notwithstanding the conversion thereof or the Corporation's default in payment
of the dividend due on such Dividend Payment Date. However, shares of Series
B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion during the period between the
close of business on any dividend payment record date and the opening of
business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date must be accompanied by
payment of an amount equal to the dividend payable on such shares on such
Dividend Payment Date.  A holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock on a
dividend payment record date who (or whose transferee) surrenders any of such
shares for conversion into shares of Common Stock on a Dividend Payment Date
will receive the dividend payable by the Corporation on such shares of Series
B Preferred Stock on such date, and the converting holder need not include
payment in the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock for conversion.  Except as provided above, the Corporation
shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in
arrears, on converted shares or for dividends on the shares of Common Stock
issued upon such conversion.

      (c)  (i)  In order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holders of
each share of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted shall surrender the
certificate representing such share at the office of the transfer agent for
the Series B Preferred Stock, appointed for such purpose by the Corporation,
with the Notice of Election to Convert on the back of said certificate
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     40
completed and signed.  Unless the shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion are to be issued in the same name in which such share of Series B
Preferred Stock is registered, each share surrendered for conversion shall be
accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the holder or such holder's duly authorized
attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax.

      (ii)  As promptly as practicable after the surrender of the certificates
for shares of Series B Preferred Stock as aforesaid, the Corporation shall
issue and shall deliver at such office to such holder, or on his written
order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7, and any fractional interest in respect of a
share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion shall be settled as
provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 7.

      (iii)  Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately
prior to the close of business on the date on which the certificates for
shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been surrendered and such notice
received by the Corporation as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose
name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall
be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or
holders of record of the shares represented thereby at such time on such date,
unless the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall be closed on that
date, in which event such person or persons shall be deemed to have become
such holder or holders of record at the close of business on the next
succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, and such notice
received by the Corporation.  All shares of Common Stock delivered upon
conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock will upon delivery be duly and
validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable, free of all liens and
charges and not subject to any preemptive rights.

      (d)  The Conversion Price in effect at any time and the number and kind
of securities issuable upon the conversion of each share of Series B Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of
certain events, as follows:

            (i)  In the event that the Corporation shall make a PIK Dividend
      pursuant to Section 3 hereof after the third anniversary of the Date of
      Issuance, then the Conversion Price shall be reduced by five percent
      (5%); provided that a reduction in the Conversion Price pursuant to this
      subparagraph (i) shall be made only once. 

            (ii)  In case the Corporation shall hereafter (A) pay a dividend
      or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its Common
      Stock, (B) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock, (C) combine its
      outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (D) issue
      any shares by reclassification of its Common Stock (including any such
      reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which
      the Corporation is the continuing corporation), the Conversion Price in
      effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution
      or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or
      reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder
      of any share of Series B Preferred Stock converted after such date shall
      be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of Common
      Stock which, if such share of Series B Preferred Stock had been
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     41
      converted immediately prior to such record date or effective date, he
      would have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive upon
      such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or
      reclassification.

            (iii) In case the Corporation shall hereafter issue rights or
      warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them (for a period
      expiring within 45 days after the record date mentioned below) to
      subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities
      convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a
      conversion price per share) less than the Conversion Price in effect on
      the record date with respect to such issuance, the Conversion Price
      shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by
      multiplying the Conversion Price in effect by a fraction, of which the
      numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on
      such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock
      which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of
      Common Stock so offered (or the aggregate conversion price of the
      convertible securities so offered) would purchase at the Conversion
      Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance, and of
      which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
      outstanding on the record date for determination of the Stockholders
      entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the number of
      additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase
      (or into which the convertible securities so offered are then
      convertible).  Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such
      rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately
      prior to the date of such issuance; and to the extent that shares of
      Common Stock are not delivered (or securities convertible into Common
      Stock are not delivered) after the expiration of such rights or
      warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion
      Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the
      issuance of such rights or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery
      of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible
      into Common Stock) actually delivered.

            (iv)  In case the Corporation shall hereafter distribute to all
      holders of its Common Stock shares of stock other than Common Stock or
      evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or
      distributions out of retained earnings and dividends or distributions
      referred to in subparagraph (ii) above) or rights or warrants (excluding
      those referred to in subparagraph (iii) above), then in each such case
      the Conversion Price in effect thereafter shall be determined by
      multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date
      of such distribution by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the
      total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock multiplied by the
      Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such
      distribution, less the then fair market value (as determined in good
      faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors, irrespective of the
      accounting treatment thereof, whose determination shall be described in
      a certified Board Resolution) of said shares of stock, assets or
      evidences of indebtedness so distributed or of such rights or warrants,
      and of which the denominator shall be the total number of outstanding
      shares of Common Stock multiplied by the Conversion Price in effect
      immediately prior to the date of such distribution.  Such adjustments
      shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become
      effective immediately prior to the date of such distribution.  
<PAGE>
<PAGE>    42
            (v)  In case the Corporation shall hereafter issue shares of its
      Common Stock (excluding shares issued (A) in any of the transactions
      described in subparagraph (ii) above, (B) upon conversion or exchange
      of securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or upon
      conversion of rights or warrants issued to the holders of Common Stock,
      for which an adjustment has already been made pursuant to subparagraph
      (iii) above, (C) by grant to or upon exercise of options granted or to
      be granted to employees or directors pursuant to any employee benefit
      plan or program of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries in
      existence on the Date of Issuance or subsequently approved by the
      Corporation's stockholders, (D) upon conversion of shares of Series B
      Preferred Stock, (E) to shareholders of any corporation which merges
      into the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation in proportion
      to their stockholdings of such corporation immediately prior to such
      merger, upon such merger, (F) in a bona fide public offering pursuant
      to a firm commitment underwriting, or (G) pursuant to any stockholders
      rights plan of the Corporation) for a consideration per share of Common
      Stock less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date the
      Corporation fixes or has fixed the offering, conversion, exchange or
      exercise price of such additional shares, the Conversion Price shall be
      adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the
      Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto by a fraction, of
      which the numerator shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
      outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares
      plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
      consideration received (determined as provided in subparagraph (vii)
      below) for the issuance of such additional shares would purchase at the
      Conversion Price in effect on the date the Corporation fixes or has
      fixed the offering, conversion, exchange or exercise price of such
      additional shares, and of which the denominator shall be the number of
      shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of
      such additional shares.  Such adjustment shall be made successively
      whenever such an issuance is made and shall become effective immediately
      prior to the date of such issuance.

            (vi)  In case the Corporation shall hereafter issue any securities
      convertible into or exchangeable for its Common Stock (excluding
      securities issued (A) in transactions described in subparagraphs (iii)
      and (iv) above or (B) pursuant to any stockholders rights plan of the
      Corporation) for a consideration per share of Common Stock initially
      deliverable upon conversion or exchange of such securities (determined
      as provided in subparagraph (vii) below) less than the Conversion Price
      in effect on the issuance date of such securities, the Conversion Price
      shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by
      multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date
      of such issuance by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the
      number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
      issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate
      consideration received (determined as provided in subparagraph (vii)
      below) for such securities would purchase at the Conversion Price prior
      to any adjustment pursuant hereto, and of which the denominator shall
      be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
      to such issuance plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock of
      the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for such
      securities at the initial conversion or exchange price or rate.  Such
      adjustment shall be made successively whenever such an issuance is made
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     43
      and shall become effective immediately prior to date of issuance of such
      securities.

            (vii)  For purposes of any computation respecting consideration
      received pursuant to subparagraphs (v) and (vi) above, the following
      shall apply:

            (A)  in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for
      cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that
      in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts
      or other expenses incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting of
      the issue or otherwise in connection therewith;

            (B)  in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for a
      consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration
      other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as
      determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
      (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof), whose determination
      shall be conclusive and described in a certified Board Resolution; and

            (C)  in the case of the issuance of securities convertible into
      or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, the aggregate consideration
      received therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by
      the Corporation for the issuance of such securities plus the additional
      minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation upon
      the conversion or exchange thereof (the consideration in each case to
      be determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (A) and (B) of
      this subparagraph (vii)).

            (viii)  In case the Corporation is a participant in a
      consolidation, merger or combination with another corporation (other
      than with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation and other than
      a merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion,
      exchange or cancellation of the Common Stock) or in case of any sale or
      transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation,
      as a result of which holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to
      receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash)
      with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or any share
      exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities or
      property of the Corporation, then as a condition to the consummation of
      such transaction, lawful and adequate provision shall be made so that
      the holder of each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding
      shall have the right, with respect to such shares of Series B Preferred
      Stock, to receive stock, other securities or property or assets
      (including cash) or any combination thereof, having a value equal to the
      value of the stock, other securities, property and assets (including
      cash) which such holder would have been entitled to receive upon such
      consolidation, merger, combination, sale or transfer, or exchange, if
      such holder had held the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
      such shares of Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
      consolidation, merger, combination, sale or transfer, or exchange. 

            (ix)  No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required
      unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least
      ten cents ($0.10) in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments
      not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account
<PAGE>
<PAGE>    44
      in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this paragraph
      7(d) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-thousandth
      of a share, as the case may be.

            (x)  Anything in this paragraph 7(d) to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Corporation shall be entitled, but shall not be
      required, to make such changes in the Conversion Price, in addition to
      those required by this paragraph 7(d), as it in its discretion shall
      determine to be advisable in order that any dividend or distribution in
      shares of Common Stock, subdivision, reclassification or combination of
      shares of Common Stock, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase
      Common Stock or distribution of shares of stock other than Common Stock,
      evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than distributions in cash
      out of retained earnings) referred to hereinabove in this paragraph
      7(d), hereafter made by the Corporation to the holders of the Series B
      Preferred Stock shall not be taxable to them.

            (xi)  Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted, as herein
      provided, the Corporation shall promptly cause a notice setting forth
      the adjusted Conversion Price and adjusted number of shares issuable
      upon conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock to be mailed
      to the holders, at their last addresses appearing in the Series B
      Preferred Stock share register.  The certificate setting forth the
      computation shall be signed by the chief financial officer of the
      Corporation.

            (xii)  In the event that at any time, as a result of any
      adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the holder of any share
      of Series B Preferred Stock thereafter shall become entitled to receive
      any shares of the Corporation, other than Common Stock, thereafter the
      number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any share
      of Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to
      time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the
      provisions with respect to the Common Stock contained in subparagraphs
      (i) to (ix) inclusive, above.

      (e)  The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and
keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or its issued shares of Common
Stock held in its treasury, or both, for the purposes of effecting conversions
of the Series B Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock not theretofore converted.  For purposes of this paragraph
(e), the number of shares of Common Stock which shall be deliverable upon the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were
held by a single holder.

      (f)  The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the
provisions of this Section 7 and in the taking of all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock against impairment.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     45
      (8)  Voting Rights.  The holders of record of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights except as
hereinafter provided in this Section 8 or as otherwise provided by law.

      (a)  Whenever dividends are in arrears and remain unpaid for six (6) or
more Dividend Payment Dates, the holders of the then outstanding Series B
Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall have the exclusive right to appoint
one additional director to the Board of Directors of the Corporation (in
addition to any rights to appoint or have nominated any director pursuant to
any contractual agreement between the Corporation and any holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock) until such time as all accrued and unpaid dividends
shall have been paid in full, at which time the term of office of such
director shall terminate.

      (b)  So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding,
the Corporation will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, voting as a class (i) create, authorize or issue any shares of any
other class of senior or parity dividend stock or senior or parity liquidation
stock or having class voting rights except as required by the Delaware General
Corporation Law or voting rights in excess of one vote per share, (ii) amend,
alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation if the amendment, alteration or
repeal materially and adversely affects the powers, preferences or special
rights of the Series B Preferred Stock, or (iii) declare any reverse stock
dividend with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock or otherwise reduce the
number of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock other than pursuant
to Section 4, 5 or 7 hereof; provided, however, that the approval of not less
than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting
as a class, shall be required to amend, alter, or repeal any of the provisions
of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation that would adversely
affect the dividend provisions, liquidation rights, conversion terms, or
voting rights of the Series B Preferred Stock or the holders thereof.

      (c) A special meeting of holders of the Series B Preferred Stock (or a
request for a vote by written consent without a meeting) to approve or
disapprove any action of the Corporation on which the holders of the Series
B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as a separate class by law or pursuant
to this Section 8 may be called by the Secretary of the Corporation or by the
holder(s) of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock on written notice to the address of each holder
thereof as it appears on the records of the Corporation deposited in the U.S.
mail, all charges prepaid, at least ten  (10) but no more than sixty (60) days
prior to the applicable vote.  The record date for determination of the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock entitled to vote by written consent
or at a meeting shall be set by the Corporation's Board of Directors, and only
holders who are holding of record on the stock book of the Corporation on that
date will be entitled to participate in such vote.  At any time at which any
share of Series B Preferred Stock has been issued and is outstanding, no
proposal for the Corporation to take any action described in paragraph (b)
shall be adopted, nor shall the Corporation be authorized to take any such
action, unless the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares
of Series B Preferred Stock voting as a separate class vote in favor of such
proposal.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     46
      (d)  Copies of all notices sent to the holders of Common Stock shall be
simultaneously sent to each holder of the Series B Preferred Stock.

      (e)  In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section 8, each
share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share.

      (f)  No consent of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, except
to the extent such holders are entitled to vote together with the holders of
the Series Preferred Stock or Common Stock, shall be required for (i) the
creation, authorization or issuance of any indebtedness of any kind of the
Corporation, (ii) the creation, authorization or issuance of any other class
of stock of the Corporation subordinate as to dividends and upon liquidation
to the Series B Preferred Stock, (iii) any increase or decrease in the amount
of authorized Common Stock or Series Preferred Stock or any increase, decrease
or change in the par value thereof, or (iv) any increase in the amount of the
Series C Preferred Stock for the purpose of paying dividends in shares of
Series C Preferred Stock as provided herein, and none of the foregoing shall
be deemed to affect adversely the powers, special rights or preferences of
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, UNC Incorporated caused this certificate to be
signed by its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and attested
by its Secretary this 5th  day of October, 1995.

                   CERTIFICATE OF THE DESIGNATION, POWERS,
          PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF THE SERIES C SENIOR CUMULATIVE
                               PREFERRED STOCK

                          PAR VALUE $1.00 PER SHARE

                   Pursuant to Section 151 of the General
                  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware


      The following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board of Directors
of UNC Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), pursuant to
the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, on September 29, 1995 at a meeting of the Board of Directors at
which there was at all times present and acting a quorum of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation:

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is authorized, within
the limitations and restrictions stated in the Certificate of Incorporation,
to fix by resolution or resolutions the designation of each series of
Preferred Stock and the powers, preferences and relative participating,
optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof, including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such provisions
as may be desired concerning voting, redemption, dividends, dissolution or the
distribution of assets, conversion or exchange, and such other subjects or
matters as may be fixed by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; and

      WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
pursuant to its authority as aforesaid, to authorize and fix the terms of a
series of such Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such
series:

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:

      (1)  Designation and Number of Shares.  The designation of said series
of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Series Preferred Stock"),
authorized by this resolution shall be "Series C Senior Cumulative Preferred
Stock" (the "Series C Preferred Stock").  The number of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock authorized hereby shall be 250,000 and no more, except as
provided herein.

      (2)  Rank.  The Series C Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend
rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution, rank (a) on a
parity with the Series B Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00
per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), and (b) prior to any other equity
securities of the Corporation, whether currently authorized or hereafter
created, including any other series of Series Preferred Stock and the Common
Stock, par value $.20 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock", all
of such equity securities of the Corporation to which the Series C Preferred
Stock ranks prior, including any other series of Series Preferred Stock and
the Common Stock, are referred to herein collectively as the "Junior
Securities").
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     48
      (3)  Dividends. (a) The holders of the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of
Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends,
cumulative dividends at the annual rate of $8.50 per share in equal quarterly
payments on the last business day of each calendar quarter (each of such dates
being a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing with the last day of the calendar
quarter in which the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued, in
preference to dividends on the Junior Securities.  Such dividends shall be
paid to the holders of record at the close of business on the date which is
ten (10) business days prior to the Dividend Payment Date.  Each of such
quarterly dividends shall be fully cumulative and shall accrue (whether or not
declared), without interest, from the Date of Issuance.  Any dividend payments
due with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date
shall be made in cash.

      (b)  All dividends paid with respect to shares of Series C Preferred
Stock pursuant to paragraph (3)(a) hereof shall be paid pro rata to the
holders entitled thereto.

      (c)  No full cash dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for
payment on the Series B Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative
dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and
a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the
Series C Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or
prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends.  If any cash
dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, all cash dividends declared upon
shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be
declared pro rata so that the amount of cash dividends declared per share on
the Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall in all cases
bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the
Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock bear to each other.  No
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of
any dividend payment or payments on the Series C Preferred Stock which may be
in arrears.

      (d) (i)  Whenever dividends or distributions payable on the Series C
Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 3 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not
declared, on shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been
paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

          (A)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on
      any Junior Securities (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
      dissolution or winding up); or

          (B)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
      shares of any Junior Securities (either as to dividends or upon
      liquidation, dissolution or winding up), provided that the Corporation
      may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such
      Junior Securities in exchange for shares of any other Junior Securities.

      (ii)  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, the Board
of Directors may declare, and the Corporation may pay or set apart for
payment, dividends and other distributions on any of the Junior Securities,
and may purchase or otherwise redeem any of the Junior Securities or any
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     49
warrants, rights or options exercisable for or convertible into any of the
Junior Securities, and the holders of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to share therein.

      (4)  Liquidation Preference.  (a)  In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders an amount in cash equal to
$100.00 for each share outstanding, plus an amount in cash equal to all
accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, before any payment shall be made or any assets
distributed to the holders of any of the Junior Securities.  If the assets of
the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation payments
payable to the holders of outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock, then the holders of all such shares shall share
ratably in such distribution of assets in accordance with the amount which
would be payable on such distribution if the amounts to which the holders of
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
are entitled were paid in full.

      (b)  The liquidation payment with respect to each fractional share of
Series C Preferred Stock outstanding or accrued but unpaid shall be equal to
a ratably proportionate amount of the liquidation payment with respect to each
outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock.

      (c)  For the purposes of this Section 4, neither the voluntary sale,
conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities
or other consideration) of all or substantially all the property or assets of
the Corporation or the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or
more other corporations shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, voluntary or involuntary, unless such voluntary sale, conveyance,
lease, exchange or transfer shall be in connection with a dissolution or
winding up of the business of the Corporation.

      (5)  Redemption.  (a) The Corporation at its option may redeem, to the
extent funds are legally available therefor, the Series C Preferred Stock, at
any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the per share redemption
price equal to $100.00 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the
date fixed for redemption, without interest (the "Redemption Price").

      (b)  The Corporation shall not optionally redeem the Series B Preferred
Stock, in whole or in part, without first redeeming all outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock at the Redemption Price.  

      (c)  Unless the Corporation is prohibited by the terms of any
Restrictive Agreement (as defined below) from redeeming any shares of Series
C Preferred Stock, in the event of any Change in Control (as defined below)
with respect to the Corporation, each holder of the Series C Preferred Stock
may, from time to time, require the Corporation to, and the Corporation shall,
redeem any number of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by it for the
Redemption Price upon thirty (30) days prior written notice.  "Restrictive
Agreement" shall mean any agreement to which the Corporation is a party on the
date hereof (including, as modified, amended, extended, refinanced or
replaced) which by its terms restricts the Corporation's ability to (A) pay
dividends in cash with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock or (B) redeem
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     50
the Series C Preferred Stock, excluding any such agreement which has been
substantially assigned to a party which is not a party thereto on the date
hereof.  "Change in Control" shall mean (A) any transaction or series of
related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization,
merger or consolidation) which will result in the Corporation's stockholders
immediately prior to such transaction not holding (by virtue of such shares
or securities issued solely with respect thereto) at least fifty percent (50%)
of the voting power of the surviving or continuing entity, (B) a sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, unless the
Corporation's stockholders immediately prior to such sale will, as a result
of such sale, hold (by virtue of securities issued as consideration for the
Corporation's sale) at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
purchasing entity, or (C) during any period of two consecutive years,
individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the entire Board
of Directors shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof
unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Corporation's
stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-
thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the
beginning of the period.

      (d)  Shares of Series C Preferred Stock which have been issued and
reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed or exchanged,
shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State
of Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class
of Series Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series, and may be redesignated
and reissued as part of any series of the Series Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Corporation; provided, however, that no such issued
and reacquired shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be reissued or sold
as Series C Preferred Stock.

      (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, unless
the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall have been paid or contemporaneously are declared and paid for all
past dividend periods, none of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise
acquire (except pursuant to Section 6 hereof) any shares of Series C Preferred
Stock; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase
or acquisition of shares of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase
or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock.

      (6)  Procedure for Redemption.  A.  In the event that fewer than all the
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number
of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board of Directors and the
shares to be redeemed shall be determined by lot or pro rata as may be
determined by the Board of Directors.

      (b)  In the event the Corporation shall redeem shares of Series C
Preferred Stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first class mail,
postage prepaid, mailed not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty
(60) days prior to the date of redemption (the "Redemption Date"), to each
holder of record of the shares to be redeemed at such holder's address as the
same appears on the stock register of the Corporation; provided, however, that
no failure to mail such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the
validity of the proceeding for the redemption of any shares of Series C
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     51
Preferred Stock to be redeemed except as to the holder to whom the Corporation
has failed to mail said notice or except as to the holder whose notice was
defective.  Each such notice shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than
all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed from such holder, the
number of shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price;
(iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the
shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date.

      (c)  Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the
Redemption Date (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in providing
money for the payment of the Redemption Price of the shares called for
redemption) dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall cease to accrue, and said shares shall no longer be deemed
to be outstanding and shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares
of Preferred Stock, unclassified as to series, and shall not be reissued as
shares of Series C Preferred Stock (unless reissued as a stock dividend on
Series C Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock), and all rights of the
holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation with respect to said shares
(except the right to receive from the Corporation the Redemption Price) shall
cease. Upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for
any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the
Board of Directors of the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall
so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption
Price aforesaid.  In case fewer than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the
unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.

      (7)  Voting Rights.  The holders of record of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights except as
hereinafter provided in this Section 7 or as otherwise provided by law.

      (b)  So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding,
the Corporation will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, voting as a class (i) create, authorize or issue any shares of any
other class of senior or parity dividend stock or senior or parity liquidation
stock or having class voting rights except as required by the Delaware General
Corporation Law or voting rights in excess of one vote per share, (ii) amend,
alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation if the amendment, alteration or
repeal materially and adversely affects the powers, preferences or special
rights of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (iii) declare any reverse stock
dividend with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock or otherwise reduce the
number of outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock other than pursuant
to Section 4 or 5 hereof; provided, however, that the approval of not less
than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, voting
as a class, shall be required to amend, alter, or repeal any of the provisions
of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation that would adversely
affect the dividend provisions, liquidation rights, conversion terms, or
voting rights of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders thereof.

      (c)  A special meeting of holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (or
a request for a vote by written consent without a meeting) to approve or
disapprove any action of the Corporation on which the holders of the Series
C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as a separate class by law or pursuant
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     52
to this Section 7 may be called by the Secretary of the Corporation or by the
holder(s) of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock on written notice to the address of each holder
thereof as it appears on the records of the Corporation deposited in the U.S.
mail, all charges prepaid, at least ten (10) but no more than sixty (60) days
prior to the applicable vote.  The record date for determination of the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock entitled to vote by written consent
or at a meeting shall be set by the Corporation's Board of Directors, and only
holders who are holding of record on the stock book of the Corporation on that
date will be entitled to participate in such vote.  At any time at which any
share of Series C Preferred Stock has been issued and is outstanding, no
proposal for the Corporation to take any action described in this paragraph
(b) shall be adopted, nor shall the Corporation be authorized to take any such
action, unless the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock voting as a separate class vote in favor of such
proposal.

      (d) Copies of all notices sent to the holders of Common Stock shall be
simultaneously sent to each holder of the Series C Preferred Stock.

      (e) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section 7, each
share of Series C Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share.

      (f) No consent of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, except
to the extent such holders are entitled to vote together with the holders of
the Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock, shall be required for (i) the
creation, authorization or issuance of any indebtedness of any kind of the
Corporation, (ii) the creation, authorization or issuance of any other class
of stock of the Corporation subordinate as to dividends and upon liquidation
to the Series C Preferred Stock, or (iii) any increase or decrease in the
amount of authorized Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or any increase,
decrease or change in the par value thereof,  and none of the foregoing shall
be deemed to affect adversely the powers, special rights or preferences of
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock.

      (8)  Business Combinations.  In case the Corporation is a participant
in a consolidation, merger or combination with another corporation (other than
with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation and other than a merger
which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or
cancellation of the Common Stock) or in case of any sale or transfer of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, as a result of which
holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or
other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for
such Common Stock, or any share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities or property of the Corporation, then as a condition to
the consummation of such transaction, lawful and adequate provision shall be
made so that the holder of each share of Series C Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall have the right, with respect to such shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, to receive stock, other securities or property or assets
(including cash) or any combination thereof, having a value equal to the
product of (a) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $100 plus all accrued and
unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, on the Series C Preferred Stock by
(y) the then Existing Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Stock (as
adjusted to give effect to such transaction), and (b) the value of the stock,
other securities, property and assets (including cash) which each holder of
one share of Common Stock is entitled to receive upon such consolidation,
merger, combination, sale or transfer, or exchange.

                  (c)  Excluded Liabilities.  For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Excluded Liabilities" shall mean and include (i) the obligations and
liabilities of Seller in respect of borrowed money, current portions of long-
term bank financing, and long-term bank financing, (ii) any of the Sellers'
liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or any of the Exhibits hereto,
(iii) any of the Sellers' liabilities for expenses or fees incurred by the
Sellers in connection with the negotiation, preparation, approval and
authorization of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any of the
Collateral Agreements or the consummation of any the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, (iv) except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.8, any
liabilities or obligations (including Taxes) of a Seller which arise in
connection with or relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (v) liabilities, amounts or obligations payable by Jet
Center to CFC, Garrett or any Affiliate thereof; or (vi) amounts or
obligations payable by Garrett to Jet Center, CFC or any Affiliate thereof;
provided, however, that an amount or obligation identified in clauses (v) and
(vi) shall not constitute an Excluded Liability to the extent that it
represents an amount payable by a Seller to the other Seller and an equal
offsetting asset in respect of such amount is set forth on the Closing Balance
Sheet.

      Section 2.4.  Adjustments to Cash Consideration.

                  (a)  Personal Property Lease Obligations.  The Cash
Consideration shall be reduced at the Closing by an amount equal to certain
liabilities assumed by Buyer at the Closing in respect of certain lease
obligations of each of the Sellers.  The amount of the Purchase Price
reduction shall be determined on the basis set forth on Schedule 2.4 to this
Agreement.

                  (b)  Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet.

                              (i)  As promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall deliver to Buyer (a) the Closing Balance Sheet, which shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and on a basis
consistent with the principles, methods and policies used in the preparation
of the combined balance sheet of Sellers at December 31, 1994 included in the
Financial Statements and the Balance Sheet (to the extent that such
principles, methods, and policies are consistent with and proper under GAAP),
accompanied by a favorable audit opinion of Ernst & Young, and (b) a statement
of the Net Asset Value of Seller shown on the Closing Balance Sheet.

                              (ii)  Each Seller shall provide, and shall cause
Ernst & Young to provide, Buyer (and its employees, accountants and other
representatives) with full, complete and contemporaneous access to the work
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     16
papers, schedules or other documents prepared by or on behalf of the Seller
in connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements, the Balance
Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet.  Each Seller also shall permit Buyer (and
its employees, accountants and other representatives) to consult with the
Seller (and its employees), and shall cause Ernst & Young to permit Buyer (and
its employees, accountants and other representatives) to consult with Ernst
& Young and its employees, on a contemporaneous basis in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet.  Each Seller (and its employees,
accountants and representatives) shall cooperate fully with Buyer in
furnishing all information and documents reasonably requested by Buyer (or its
employees, accountants or representatives) in connection with the preparation
of the Closing Balance Sheet, and shall consult with Buyer (and its employees,
accountants or representatives) in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet.

                              (iii)  In the event that Buyer disputes the
correctness of the Closing Balance Sheet or the statement of the Net Asset
Value of the Sellers provided by the Sellers, Buyer shall notify the Sellers
in writing of its objections within 20 business days after its receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and shall describe, in reasonable detail, the reasons
for Buyer's objections.  If Buyer fails to deliver a notice of objection to
the Sellers within such 20-day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted
the Closing Balance Sheet and the statement of the Net Asset Value of Seller
provided to Buyer by Sellers.  If, however, Buyer delivers a notice of
objection to the Sellers within such 20-day period, Buyer and Sellers shall
endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed items within 10 business days
after the date of Sellers' receipt of Buyer's notice of objection.  In the
event that Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any items in dispute
relating to the Closing Balance Sheet and the statement of Net Asset Value
provided to Buyer by Sellers, Buyer and Sellers shall select a nationally
known independent accounting firm (the "Independent Accountants")
to resolve all items remaining in dispute, and the determination of the
Independent Accountants in respect of such items shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties.  The Independent Accountants shall be instructed by
Sellers and Buyer to prepare and deliver to Sellers and Buyer, after resolving
any items in dispute between Sellers and Buyer, a balance sheet of Sellers as
of the Closing Date reflecting its resolution of all issues in dispute and a
statement of the Net Asset Value of Sellers shown thereon.

                              (iv)  The Net Asset Value of the Sellers as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) (whether by failure of
Buyer to deliver a notice of objection to Sellers, by the agreement of the
parties or by the final determination of the Independent Accountants) shall
be deemed to be, and shall be referred to herein as, the "Final Net Asset
Value."

                              (v)  Sellers shall bear, and be solely
responsible for, all of their costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, that Seller
shall not be responsible for costs and expenses associated with individuals
who become and remain Buyer's employees following Closing.  The Sellers and
Buyer shall each bear, and be responsible for, the costs and expenses incurred
by each of them (including the fees and expenses of their respective
accounting firms) in connection with their review of the Closing Balance
Sheet.  If the Independent Accountants are engaged, the fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants will be paid (i) by the Sellers in the event the
review of the Independent Accountants results in a negative variance of more
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     17
than ten percent (10%) in the disputed item or the aggregate of the disputed
items from the amount(s) represented by the Sellers and favorable to the
Buyer; and (ii) by Buyer in the event the review of the Independent
Accountants does not reveal such a variance.

                              (vi)  Buyer acknowledges that from and after the
Closing Date the employees of Sellers shall be the employees of Buyer and the
Assets, including books and records of the Sellers shall be the property of
Buyer.  Accordingly, Buyer shall make each of Sellers' former employees who
accepts employment with Buyer and Sellers' books and records acquired by Buyer
available to the Sellers, its advisors and representatives and to Ernst &
Young at such time and from time to time as shall be necessary to allow each
Seller to comply with its obligations under this Section 2.4(b) and elsewhere
in this Agreement and its obligations under any Applicable Law with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date.

                  (c)  Final Net Asset Value Adjustment.

                              (i)  If the Final Net Asset Value is less than
$47,075,000, then the Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal
to the difference between $47,075,000 and the Final Net Asset Value, and the
amount of such difference shall be paid by Sellers to Buyer as provided in
this Section 2.4(c).

                              (ii)  If the Final Net Asset Value is greater
than $47,575,000, then the Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount
equal to the difference between the Final Net Asset Value and $47,575,000, and
the amount of such difference shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers as provided
in this Section 2.4(c).

                              (iii)  All payments contemplated by this
Section 2.4(c) shall be made within three (3) business days of the date on
which the Final Net Asset Value is finally determined.  All payments shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the party entitled to receive any such payment.  Sellers shall
retain not less than $2 million to cover their obligations under this Section
2.4(c) and shall not distribute such funds to any Affiliates until the Final
Net Asset Value has been finally determined.  CFC covenants and agrees that
it shall contribute capital to Sellers following Closing to the extent that
the $2 million amount is not sufficient to satisfy Sellers' obligations
hereunder.

      Section 2.5.  Closing Holdback.  On the Closing Date, upon satisfaction
of all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer which are set
forth in Article VII that have not been waived in writing by Buyer, Buyer
shall deliver the Closing Holdback to the Escrow Agent, as escrow agent for
the benefit of the Sellers and Buyer, by wire transfer to an account
designated by the Escrow Agent prior to the Closing Date.  The Closing
Holdback shall be administered and disbursed by the Escrow Agent as provided
in the Escrow Agreement.

      Section 2.6.  Instruments of Transfer.  On the Closing Date, upon
satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Sellers which are set forth in Article VIII that have not been waived in
writing by Sellers, Sellers shall execute and deliver to Buyer such warranty
bills of sale, warranty deeds, assignments, certificates of title, and other
documents and instruments of transfer and title, individually or in bulk as
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     18
Buyer may reasonably request, in such form as may be required by the laws of
any jurisdiction which may be applicable thereto, all as may be requested by
Buyer in order to evidence the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the
Assets to Buyer at the Closing.  The Sellers also shall, without the payment
of any further consideration by Buyer, execute and deliver from time to time
after the Closing, such further warranty bills of sale, warranty deeds,
assignments, certificates of title, and other documents of title and transfer
as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in order to evidence more effectively
or fully the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Assets to Buyer
at the Closing.

      Section 2.7.  Allocation of Purchase Price.  The Purchase Price shall
be allocated among each of the Sellers' and the Assets as set forth in
Schedule 2.7 to this Agreement.  Buyer and each of the Sellers agree that the
allocation of the Purchase Price has been negotiated between them and is
consistent with the value of the Assets.  Buyer and each of the Sellers
further agree that the allocation of the Purchase Price may be adjusted
following the Closing to reflect the adjustments to the Cash Consideration
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, but that any such adjustment
shall be reflected by a ratable adjustment to each category of Assets set
forth in the allocation of the Purchase Price on Schedule 2.7.  Buyer and each
of the Sellers further agree that the allocation of the Purchase Price, as
finally adjusted, shall be used consistently by each of them in any Tax
Returns filed by either of them following the Closing, including any filings
required by Section 1060 of the Code.

      Section 2.8.  Transfer Taxes and Costs.  Buyer on the one hand and the
Sellers on the other hand shall pay one-half of all Taxes (including sales
taxes), stamp duties, notarial, registration and recording fees resulting from
or relating to the transfer of the Assets to Buyer at the Closing (other than
Income Taxes and Taxes on, relating to or measured by income or gains which
shall be the sole and exclusive obligation and liability of the Sellers and
CFC and borne exclusively by the Sellers and CFC or their Affiliates).  Buyer
shall prepare all sales tax returns and provide them to Seller five business
days prior to the filing of such returns.  Buyer shall consult in good faith
with Seller in the preparation of the sales tax returns.  Seller shall pay to
Buyer 50% of the tax due at least one full business day prior to the date such
tax must be remitted.

      Section 2.9.  Assignment of Contracts and Rights.  This Agreement shall
not constitute an agreement to purchase or assign any Asset or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted
assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto, would
adversely affect the rights of Buyer thereunder.  Each of the Sellers and the
Buyer will use their reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the other
parties to the assignment of any such Asset or any claim or right to any
benefit arising thereunder as Buyer may reasonably request.  If such consent
is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective
or would adversely affect the rights of a Seller or Buyer thereunder so that
Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, the affected Seller and Buyer
will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement for a period of up to 90
days following Closing under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume
the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which the
affected Sellers would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming
such Seller's obligations, any and all rights of such Seller against the other
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     19
party thereto.  Sellers will promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies
received by either Seller under any Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder.  

      Section 2.10.  Compliance with Bulk Transfer Laws.  Prior to, at and
after the Closing, the Sellers and Buyer shall duly and timely take all
actions and execute all instruments necessary to comply fully with the
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code Bulk Transfers and similar laws
which may be applicable in various jurisdictions in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      Section 2.11.  Escrow Agreement.  At the Closing, Buyer and each Seller
shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement.

      Section 2.12.  Schedules to Agreement.  Sellers have delivered to Buyer
Schedules 3.3; 3.4; 3.6; 3.7; 3.8; 3.12; 3.13; 3.15; 3.17; 3.18; 3.22 and 3.26
to this Agreement.  As soon as practicable, but in no event later than the
last to occur of (i) the date which is ten (10) days after the date of this
Agreement, or (ii) January 31, 1996, the Sellers shall provide to Buyer the
remaining Schedules referenced in Article III of this Agreement (or which are
otherwise contemplated to be prepared and delivered by the Sellers) and any
updates to the Schedules as originally delivered (such Schedules and updates
to the previously delivered Schedules shall be referred to collectively as the
"Remaining Schedules").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be
entitled to update Schedule 3.13(a) (except is response to the last sentence
of Section 3.13(a)) or 3.13(d) during such period.  The Remaining Schedules
shall be responsive to the matters to be disclosed on the particular Schedules
and shall be accompanied by a notice from the Sellers to Buyer stating that
the Remaining Schedules are in final form.  Buyer shall review the Remaining
Schedules and determine, in its sole but reasonable discretion, the adequacy
and the acceptability to Buyer of the disclosures and the content and
substance of the matters set forth or referenced in the Schedules.  Buyer
shall provide notice to the Sellers, within ten (10) days of receiving the
Schedules, of its acceptance or rejection of the Remaining Schedules (it being
understood that Buyer shall be entitled to reject the Remaining Schedules in
the event that a reasonable Buyer would determine not to purchase the Assets
at all or to materially reduce the Purchase Price based on the disclosures or
the content and substance of the matters set forth in or referenced on the
Remaining Schedules).  In the event that Buyer does not provide a notice of
acceptance or rejection to the Sellers within such ten (10) day period, Buyer
shall be deemed to have accepted the Remaining Schedules.

                                 ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER
                  ----------------------------------------
      In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each Seller
hereby jointly and severally makes the following representations and
warranties to Buyer (all of which are made only with respect to the Knowledge
of each Seller and are subject to the limitations expressed in Sections 11.3
and 11.4 hereof):

      Section 3.1.  Organization and Good Standing.  Garrett is a limited

<PAGE>
<PAGE>     20
State of Delaware.  Each of the Sellers has full power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties, and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted.  Each Seller is qualified as a foreign partnership or limited
liability company, as appropriate, and is in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the affected Seller. 
Each Seller has delivered to Buyer a complete and correct copy of its
certificate of limited partnership, partnership agreement, articles of
organization, management agreement and/or operating agreement, as the case may
be, and the charter and bylaws of CFC, none of which has been amended or
repealed since delivery to Buyer, and each of which is in full force and
effect.

      Section 3.2.  Execution and Effect of Agreement.  Each Seller and CFC
has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and each of the
Collateral Agreements and to perform their obligations hereunder and
thereunder.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and of each of the
Collateral Agreements by each of the Sellers and CFC, the consummation by each
Seller and CFC of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
performance by each Seller and CFC of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
partnership, member or corporate action on the part of each Seller and CFC,
respectively.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
Seller and CFC and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Seller and CFC, fully enforceable against each Seller and CFC in accordance
with its terms.

      Section 3.3.  Restrictions.  The execution and delivery of this Agree-
ment and the Collateral Agreements by each Seller and CFC, the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by each Seller and CFC,
and the performance of the obligations of each Seller and CFC hereunder and
thereunder will not (a) violate any of the provisions of the certificate of
limited partnership or partnership agreement of Garrett, the articles of
organization or operating agreement of Jet Center, or the charter or by-laws
of CFC or (b) except as set forth in Schedule 3.3, (i) violate or conflict
with the provisions of any Applicable Laws or any order, award, judgment or
decree of any Governmental Authority applicable to a Seller or CFC, (ii)
result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the Assets, or
(iii) conflict with, violate any provisions of, result in a breach of or give
rise to a right of termination, modification or cancellation of, constitute
a default of, or accelerate the performance required by, with or without the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both, or require any consent,
waiver or approval of a third party under the terms of (x) any Contract set
forth on Schedule 3.12 or (y) any agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, lease, contract, note, bond, license, permit, authorization or other
instrument to which a Seller is a party or to which a Seller or any of the
Assets are subject (except in the case of the items referenced in this clause
(y) where such conflict, violation or breach would not have a Material Adverse
Effect).

      Section 3.4.  Consents.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.4, and except
for the Required Consents and filings, approvals, consents, waivers and
approvals under the H-S-R Act, no filing with, or consent, waiver, approval
or authorization of, or notice to, any Governmental Authority is required to
be made or obtained by a Seller or CFC in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Collateral Agreements or any instrument
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     21
contemplated hereby or thereby, the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any of their respective
obligations hereunder or thereunder.

      Section 3.5.  Financial Statements.

                  (a)  Attached hereto as Exhibit E are true and correct
copies of (i) the audited combined financial statements of the Sellers as of
December 31, 1994, and for the six-month period then-ended, and (ii) the
unaudited combined financial statements of the Sellers as of and for the ten-
month period ended October 31, 1995 (including the Balance Sheet)
(collectively, the "Financial Statements").  The Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with each other
and the books and records of each Seller, and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition,  results of operations and cash flow of the
Sellers at and for the dates and for the periods indicated therein (it being
understood that, with respect to the ten month period ended October 31, 1995,
such statements do not include footnotes required by GAAP and are subject to
normal year-end adjustments which are not material).  If footnotes were
presented with respect to the October 31, 1995 financial statements, no
footnote would be required disclosing events of an extraordinary or non-
recurring nature that are not reflected in the footnotes to the Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 1994.  The regular books of account
of each Seller fairly and accurately reflect all transactions involving each
Seller and are true, correct, complete and consistent with the Financial
Statements.  Except as set forth in the notes to the Financial Statements,
there are no special, extraordinary or non-recurring items of income or
expenses reflected in the Financial Statements.  Each Seller has followed and
consistently applied the same accounting policies, principles, methods and
practices since such Seller's inception.

                  (b)  All accounts receivable of the Sellers reflected on the
books and records of the Sellers arose from bona fide, arms-length
transactions in the ordinary course of business for services performed or
goods sold by the Sellers.  

                  (c)  All accounts payable reflected on the books and records
of each Seller (i) arose from bona fide, arms-length transactions in the
ordinary course of business for services performed for or goods sold to the
Seller for which the Seller obtained substantially equivalent value and
(ii) have been incurred in accordance with applicable payment or credit terms
imposed by the vendors of such services or goods.  The Closing Balance Sheet
shall include all accounts payable which must be reflected thereon in
accordance with GAAP.

                  (d)  All inventories (net of reserves) reflected on the
Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet, as the case may be, consist of
materials and supplies of the quality and quantity which are reasonably
believed by the Sellers to be useable or saleable within one year in the
ordinary course of the business of the Sellers as presently conducted and no
such inventories are valued in excess of the lower of cost or net realizable
market value.

      Section 3.6.  Capitalized Lease Obligations.  Schedule 3.6 sets forth
the payment terms and scheduled maturities of all capitalized lease
obligations of each Seller.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     22
      Section 3.7.  No Undisclosed Liabilities.  The Sellers do not have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever, due or to become due,
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not determined or
determinable), including, without limitation, any unfunded obligation under
any Employee Benefit Plan, except for (i) liabilities or obligations set forth
on Schedule 3.7, (ii) obligations to perform (other than obligations arising
by reason of a default, breach or faulty performance of a contract) contracts
entered into in the ordinary course of business and not required to be
reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, (iii)
liabilities or obligations to the extent expressly reflected on or reserved
against in the Balance Sheet, or (iv) liabilities or obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices and levels
since October 31, 1995 which would be required to be reflected on a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and there is no basis for the
assertion of any such liability or obligation against a Seller.  At Closing,
no distributions to any partners or Affiliates of a Seller will be due and
payable by a Seller.

      Section 3.8.  Litigation.  There is no suit, claim, action at law or in
equity, proceeding or governmental investigation or audit pending or
threatened, by or before any court, any Governmental Authority or arbitrator,
against a Seller that reasonably could be expected to prevent the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor is there any basis for any
of the foregoing.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.8, there is no suit,
claim, action at law or in equity, proceeding or governmental investigation
or audit pending or threatened, by or before any arbitrator, court, or other
Governmental Authority, against a Seller or involving any of the Assets or any
Employees, nor is there any basis for the assertion of any of the foregoing. 
Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.8, there are no judgments, orders,
injunctions, decrees, stipulations or awards rendered by any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator against a Seller or any  Employees or Assets.

      Section 3.9.  Subsidiaries; Investments.  Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.9, neither Seller owns any shares of capital stock or equity
securities of, or any interest in any other Person, and each Seller has good,
valid and marketable title, free and clear of all Encumbrances, to all shares
of capital stock or equity securities of, or interests in, other Persons owned
by such Seller.   

      Section 3.10.  Real Properties; Absence of Encumbrances. 

                  (a)  Neither Seller owns any real property.  Schedule 3.10
contains a list and brief description of all of real property leased or
otherwise occupied by a Seller and the basis of such occupation (the
"Properties").  Seller has a valid and existing leasehold interest under each
of the leases for the term set forth with respect thereto on Schedule 3.10.

                  (b)  The Sellers have provided to Buyer true and complete
copies of each of the leases described on Schedule 3.10.

                  (c)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, (i) each Seller
is entitled to and has exclusive possession of the Properties, (ii) the
Properties are not subject to any lease, tenancy or license or any agreement
to grant such lease, tenancy or license, (iii) there is no person in
possession or occupation of or who has or claims any right to possession or
occupation of the Properties, and (iv) there are no easements of any kind in
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     23
respect of the Properties adversely affecting the rights of Seller therein to
use the Properties for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted or
as planned to be conducted by the Sellers.

                  (d)  In respect of each of the Properties:

                              (i)  At the effective date of the lease, the
lessor had good title to the Property covered thereby and all consents neces-
sary for the lessor to execute and deliver the lease were obtained.

                              (ii)  There are no circumstances which would
entitle or require the lessor to exercise any power of entry upon or of taking
possession of any of such Properties.

                              (iii)  Seller is not in default under any of the
terms of the lease.

                              (iv)  No notice of any alleged breach of any of
the terms of the lease has been served on or received by the Seller.

                              (v)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10,
Seller has paid all rents and service charges to the extent such rents and
charges are due and payable.

                  (e)  Each of the Properties is available for immediate use
in the operation of its business and for the purpose for which such property
currently is being utilized.

                  (f)  All improvements on the Properties conform to
Applicable Laws relating to zoning, health and safety and access, including
without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the Properties
are zoned for the purposes for which they are being used by Seller (it being
understood that this representation shall not be deemed to be breached unless
a Seller has knowledge of facts or matters which have caused the relevant
person to actually reach a conclusion or belief with respect to the legal
status or consequences which are the subject of this representation).

                  (g)  Subject to the terms and conditions of the respective
leases and excepting the subleases disclosed on Schedule 3.10, Seller has full
legal rights under the leases to the use and enjoyment of all of the
Properties for the operation of the Business as presently conducted by the
Sellers or as contemplated to be conducted by the Sellers.

                  (h)  Seller has not entered into any commitment (whether
legally binding or not) with any Person who owns or occupies any property
adjacent or near to any of the Properties to do any act or thing or make any
payment to any Person in connection with or relating to any use or occupancy
of the Properties by any Person.

                              (i)  There is no resolution, proposal, order,
act or thing made or done or contemplated for acquisition by condemnation or
otherwise of any of the Properties by any Governmental Authority nor any
outstanding order, notice or other requirement of any such authority that
affects the Properties or the roads abutting them or involves expenditure in
complying with it nor any other circumstances which may result in any such
order or notice being made or served or which may otherwise affect the

<PAGE>     26
Agreement.  Each of the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement and the ASE Operating
Agreement are in full force and effect and, except as set forth on Schedule
3.13(a), the terms set forth in each of those agreements have not been waived,
modified, or otherwise adversely affected by any oral or written communica-
tion, agreement or instrument or any course of dealing between or among any
of the parties thereto.  Nothing has come to Sellers' attention to indicate
that any of the representations and warranties made by AlliedSignal to Garrett
pursuant to the terms of Article IV of the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement
were not true and correct in all material respects on the date of that
Agreement and on June 30, 1994.

                  (b)  Each of the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement and the ASE
Operating Agreement is fully assignable to the Buyer without any consent or
other action required on the part of the parties (other than Garrett's
assignment of each of the agreements to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement) and
Buyer shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of Garrett and its
Affiliates under each of the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement and the ASE
Operating Agreement by reason and as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

                  (c)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(c), no unresolved
disputes or claims exist among any parties to the AlliedSignal Purchase
Agreement or the ASE Operating Agreement with respect to the subject matter
or the terms and conditions of such agreements.  Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.13(c), Garrett and its Affiliates have not made any claims against
AlliedSignal or its Affiliates for indemnification and AlliedSignal and its
Affiliates have not made any claims against Garrett for indemnification under
the terms of the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement, the ASE Operating Agreement
or any other contract.

                  (d)  Subject to the notice and other matters of a procedural
nature contained in the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement, AlliedSignal is
responsible for paying, satisfying, discharging and remediating all of the
conditions and matters specified on Schedule 3.13(d) to this Agreement, and
Buyer does not assume and shall not incur any liability or obligation with
respect to any of such matters.  Sellers have not failed to give AlliedSignal
any notice or have not otherwise failed to comply with any matter of a
procedural nature that would prejudice Buyer's rights to seek indemnification
from AlliedSignal under the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement following Closing. 

                  (e)  The terms of the Operating Agreement, including the
terms relating to the consignment of inventory and the pricing of products
purchased from AlliedSignal pursuant to the ASE Operating Agreement apply with
respect to each site and facility operated presently by each Seller. 
AlliedSignal has not requested Seller to open a facility in Canada or Mexico
and the "Exclusive Territory" is as that term is defined in the ASE Operating
Agreement.

                  (f)  Schedule 3.13(f) sets forth a true and correct
description of the basis on which AlliedSignal is required to sell "General
Products" (as that term is defined in the ASE Operating Agreement) to the

is still pending or a favorable determination letter has been issued by the
IRS and any amendments required for continued qualification under Section 401
of the Code have been timely adopted and there are no facts or events that
could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Pension Plan.

                  (d)  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15, there are no

misleading in any respect.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>     39
accounting records, work papers and other books and records relating to the
AlliedSignal Engine Division for the year 1993 and for the first six months
of 1994, and to cause AlliedSignal to provide Buyer with appropriate audited
financial statements of the "Hangar Business" Seller acquired from Allied
Signal pursuant to the AlliedSignal's Purchase Agreement (as the term "Hangar
Business" is defined in the AlliedSignal Purchase Agreement) for the year
ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended June 30, 1994 (the
"Predecessor Financial Statements").  The Sellers shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause AlliedSignal to agree to consent to the inclusion of the
Predecessor Financial Statements (and to cause AlliedSignal independent public
accountants to agree to consent to the inclusion of their audit reports
thereon) in filings Buyer's Parent may make from time to time with the SEC (or
in any disclosure documents Buyer's Parent may utilize in connection with an
offering of its securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Laws) prior to and following Closing in accordance with applicable
Securities Laws.  Buyer agrees that Buyer shall pay any direct costs and
expenses AlliedSignal may incur in connection with providing the Predecessor
Financial Statements and the other materials referenced above, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of AlliedSignal's independent public accountants. 
Buyer shall also agree to indemnify and hold AlliedSignal harmless from and
against any losses, damages, costs or expenses AlliedSignal may suffer as a
consequence of Buyer's use of the Predecessor Financial Statements.

no later than February 28, 1996.  The Sellers shall consult with and cause
Ernst & Young to consult with and make its workpapers available to Buyer as
the audit progresses.  The Sellers shall deliver their audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1995 (the "1995 Audited
Statements") to Buyer as soon as they become available.  In the event that the
1995 Audited Statements are delivered to Buyer after February 28, 1996 the
provisions set forth in Sections 9.1, 10.1 and 10.2 hereof shall be adjusted
appropriately to take into account Sellers' late delivery of such financial
statements (it being understood that, consistent with the terms of Section
9.4, Buyer shall not be obligated to pay any Delayed Closing Fee to Seller). 
In addition to the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall not be liable to pay the Definitive
Agreement Break-Up Fee to Buyer in any circumstances, in the event Sellers do
not deliver the 1995 Audited Statements to Buyers by the close of business
Phoenix time on March 15, 1996.

                  (c)  In the event that Buyer's Parent determines it is
advisable to include audited and/or unaudited financial statements of the
Seller (including the Financial Statements and the 1995 financial statements
referenced in Section 5.10(b)) in any filings with the SEC (or in any
disclosure documents Buyer's Parent may utilize in connection with an offering
of its securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Laws), the Seller shall provide Buyer's Parent with its audited and
unaudited financial statements for such periods and at such dates as Buyer's
Parent may request.  Such financial statements shall be provided to Buyer's
Parent as soon as is reasonably practicable.  Seller shall also promptly
provide to Buyer's Parent consents from Ernst & Young to the inclusion of its
audit reports in filings with the SEC (or in any disclosure documents Buyer's
Parent may utilize in connection with an offering of its securities in a
transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Laws), "comfort
letters," and such other assurances from Ernst & Young that may be reasonably
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     40
requested by Buyer's Parent or any underwriter, placement agent or purchaser
of Buyer's Parent securities with respect to any financial statements provided
to Buyer's Parent pursuant to this Section 5.10.

      Section 5.11.  Closing Conditions.  Each of the Sellers and CFC shall
cause all of the conditions precedent to Buyer's obligation to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be satisfied.

continuing failure of a Seller or CFC (or their respective officers,
employees, directors, agents or legal counsel) to cooperate reasonably with
Buyer in connection with the Agreement, the preparation and negotiation of the
Collateral Agreements and the other documents, instruments, certificates and
other agreements contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements

                  (a)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1(a), by Buyer or Sellers pursuant to Section 10.1(g), or by

in the manner contemplated by Section 10.2(h), and the covenants contained in
Sections 10.3 and 11.6, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force or effect, and the parties hereto shall have no further
obligation or liability hereunder.

                  (b)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.1(b) and by reason of the knowing and intentional
breach of this Agreement by a Seller or CFC, Buyer shall be entitled to pursue
all legal and equitable remedies available to it against each Seller and CFC
with respect to any and all damages that Buyer may have incurred in connection
with any failure of a Seller or CFC to perform and comply with any covenant
or agreement to be performed or complied with by a Seller or CFC pursuant to
this Agreement prior to or at the Closing; provided, however, in no event
shall Buyer be entitled to claim or receive consequential damages from the
Sellers.

                  (c)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by
Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1(c) solely by reason of the fact that the

except as otherwise provided in Section 10.3, this Agreement shall become null
and void and of no further force or effect and Buyer shall have no further
obligation or liability whatsoever to a Seller or CFC with respect to this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Definitive Agreement Break-Up
Fee shall be payable pursuant to this Section 10.2(c) in the case of a
termination under 10.1(j) if the Buyer would not be obligated to pay any
Delayed Closing Fee to Seller pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 9.4
in the event the Agreement was not being terminated; provided, however, that
if a Delayed Closing Fee would not be payable solely due to the failure of the
Sellers to deliver its 1995 Audited Statements to Buyer by February 28, 1996,
then the Definitive Agreement Break-Up Fee shall still be payable in the event
that the Sellers deliver the 1995 Audited Statements to the Buyer by the close

Phoenix time on March 15, 1996.

                  (d)  In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated
by Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1(c) by reason of the fact that, the

(Representations and Warranties or Seller True), 7.2 (No Default in Covenants
and Agreements by Seller), 7.3 (Seller Certificates), 7.4 (Employment
Agreements), 7.5 (No Material Adverse Change), 7.6 (Seller Consents and
Assurances), 7.8 (No Injunction), 7.9 (Closing Documents), or 7.14 (Seller
Financial Statements) shall not have been satisfied or waived in writing by
Buyer on or before May 31, 1996, then, Buyer's remedy shall be termination of
this Agreement, and Buyer shall not be liable for the Definitive Agreement
Break-Up Fee.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Buyer
from proceeding against the Sellers or CFC pursuant to Section 10.2(b) if
Buyer is entitled to do so.

                  (e)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
Sellers pursuant to Sections 10.1(d) or 10.1(e), Sellers and CFC shall be
entitled to receive a payment from Buyer in an aggregate amount equal to the
Definitive Break-Up Fee plus the Letter of Intent Break-Up Fee, which amount
shall constitute liquidated damages to Sellers and CFC with respect to any and
all damages that one or all of them may have incurred in connection with any
breach, non-performance or misrepresentation by Buyer with respect to any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to or
to be performed or complied with by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement prior to
or at the Closing, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.3, this

Definitive Agreement Break-Up Fee plus the Letter of Intent Break-Up Fee which
amount shall constitute liquidated damages to Sellers and CFC with respect to
any and all damages that one or all of them may have incurred in connection
with any breach, performance or misrepresentation by Buyer with respect to any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to or
to be performed or complied with by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement prior to
or at the Closing, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.3, this
Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect and
Buyer shall have no further obligation or liability whatsoever to Seller or
CFC with respect to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Definitive Agreement Break-Up Fee shall be payable pursuant to this Section
10.2(f) if the Buyer would not be obligated to pay any Delayed Closing Fee to
Seller pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 9.4 in the event the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     50
Agreement was not being terminated; provided, however, that if a Delayed
Closing Fee would not be payable solely due to the failure of the Sellers to
deliver the 1995 Audited Statements to Buyer by February 28, 1996, then the
Definitive Agreement Break-Up Fee shall still be payable in the event that the
Sellers deliver the 1995 Audited Statements to the Buyer by March 15, 1996 and
at least 30 days prior to the dates upon which certain rights to terminate the
Agreement expressed in Section 10.1 of the Agreement have been extended to
take into account the late delivery of the financial statements in the manner
contemplated by Section 5.10 of this Agreement.  No Definitive Agreement
Break-Up Fee will be payable in the event that Sellers have failed to deliver
the 1995 Audited Statements to Buyer by the close of business Phoenix time on
March 15, 1996.
                  
                  (g)  The parties understand and acknowledge that Buyer shall
only be obligated to pay the Delayed Closing Fee or the Definitive Agreement
Break-Up Fee and/or the Letter of Intent Break-Up Fee to Seller and CFC
pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 and Section 10.2 of this Agreement and
that in no circumstances will Seller and CFC be entitled to receive the
Delayed Closing Fees and either or both of the Letter of Intent Break-Up Fee
or the Definitive Agreement Break-Up Fee.  Furthermore, the Delayed Closing
Fee and Break-Up Fee that may be payable to Seller and CFC hereunder shall be
payable to Seller and CFC collectively and in the aggregate such that Buyer
shall not be required to make any payments which aggregate in excess of
$5,000,000 pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 and 10.2 of this Agreement.

                  (h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
but subject to the limitations expressed in Section 10.2(g) above, if this
Agreement is terminated for any reason (other than by Buyer in accordance with
the terms of Section 10.2(b) and in the case of a knowing and intentional
breach of this Agreement by a Seller or CFC) or for no reason, Buyer shall
immediately pay to Seller the Letter of Intent Break-Up Fee.

      Section 10.3.  Survival of Covenants Following Termination. 
Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the provisions of Section 10.2, the
obligations of the parties hereto under Sections 11.6 and 12.2 shall survive

                    POST-CLOSING COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS
                    -------------------------------------
      Section 11.1.  Financial Statements/Preservation of and Access to
Information After Closing.

                  (a)  In the event that Buyer's Parent determines it is
advisable to include audited and/or unaudited financial statements of the
Seller with respect to periods prior to and through Closing (including the
Financial Statements and the 1995 financial statements to be provided to Buyer
pursuant to Section 5.10(b)) in any filings with the SEC (or in any disclosure
documents Buyer's Parent may utilize in connection with an offering of its
securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities
Laws), the Sellers shall provide Buyer's Parent with their audited and
unaudited financial statements for such periods and at such dates as Buyer's
Parent may request.  Such financial statements shall be provided to Buyer's
Parent as soon as is reasonably practicable.  Sellers shall also promptly
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     51
provide to Buyer's Parent consents from Ernst & Young to the inclusion of its
audit reports in filings with the SEC (or in any disclosure documents Buyer's
Parent may utilize in connection with an offering of its securities in a
transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Laws), "comfort
letters," and such other assurances from Ernst & Young that may be reasonably
requested by Buyer's Parent or any underwriter, placement agent or purchaser
of Buyer's Parent securities with respect to any financial statements provided
to Buyer's Parent pursuant to this Section 11.1.

                  (b)  To the extent that a Seller has books and records which
are not to be conveyed to Buyer because such books and records are not Assets
within the meaning of item 5 of Schedule 2.1, from and after the Closing, each
Seller shall preserve all books and records in Seller's possession relating
to the Assets and Properties until Buyer notifies such Seller that all
statutes of limitations relating to Tax periods to which such books and
records relate have expired, and, thereafter, shall not destroy or dispose of
such books and records without giving notice to Buyer of such pending
destruction or disposal and offering Buyer the right and opportunity to copy
such books and records.

                  (c)  Except as prohibited or limited by Applicable Laws,
Buyer shall, from and after the Closing Date, provide each Seller and each
Seller's employees, counsel and independent accountants, full and complete
access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to all properties,
agreements, records and affairs of Buyer relating to the Assets and
Properties, and will provide copies of such information concerning the Assets
and Properties as a Seller may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Returns, or in connection with or in anticipation of
any audit by any federal, state or local Tax Authorities of Seller.  From and
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall preserve all books and records of Buyer
relating to the Assets and Properties in, as the case may be, Buyer's
possession until the Sellers notify Buyer that all statutes of limitations
relating to Tax periods to which such books and records related have expired
and, thereafter, not to destroy or dispose of such books and records without
giving notice to Sellers of such pending destruction or disposal and offering
Sellers the right and opportunity to copy such books and records.

                  (d)  A number of the representations and warranties 
contained in Article III provide Buyer with certain assurances regarding the
payment of obligations and liabilities prior to Closing or the accrual of
amounts in respect of them on the Closing Balance Sheet.  Seller covenants and
agrees that it shall take all actions as may be necessary to pay such amounts
or make accruals with respect to payables and liabilities on the Closing
Balance Sheet in the manner required by GAAP.

      Section 11.2.  Employee Benefit Matters.

                  (a)  Each Seller shall make all contributions (or accrue
such contributions on the Closing Balance Sheet) and shall pay all premiums
(or accrue such premiums on the Closing Balance Sheet) with respect to
liabilities arising under the Benefit Arrangements and Employee Benefit Plans
on or prior to the Closing Date, with respect to liabilities or obligations
which have accrued on or prior to the Closing Date or which will accrue
following the Closing Date in respect of periods prior to and through the
Closing Date.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     52
                  (b)  Each Seller and CFC shall cooperate with Buyer and
provide any assistance reasonably requested by Buyer (whether before or after
the Closing Date) in connection with the employment matters contemplated by
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing all information that
the Buyer deems necessary to determine whether there have been any failures
to comply with the continuation of health care requirements of Section 4980B
of the Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and each Seller and CFC shall
provide all information Buyer deems necessary to correct any such failures.

                  (c)  With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan and each
Benefit Arrangement, such Plan or Arrangement shall be modified to provide
that sponsorship and maintenance thereof shall be transferred to Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer (as Buyer may determine), which shall assume all
obligations of each Seller thereunder.  Each Seller and CFC shall cooperate
fully in effecting the transfer of the sponsorship of each such Plan and
Arrangement as expeditiously as possible.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of the Sellers and CFC shall (i) provide any information
or copies of any documents which may be requested by Buyer and (ii) join in
or participate in any application to or proceeding before any governmental
agency, the purpose of which is to effectuate the agreements contained in this
paragraph.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer shall not assume or be responsible for any of a Seller's
obligations under the Employment Agreements with Messrs. Clemons, Greenslade,
Hokanson, Goldsmith or Roy or John Myers (to the extent John Myers reaches an
agreement with Buyer or Buyer's Parent at Closing) or all of the Executive
Securities Agreements set forth on Schedule 3.12.

      Section 11.3.  Survival.

                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the parties
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing as provided in Section
11.3(c).

                  (b)  Notwithstanding any investigation or audit conducted
by Buyer prior to the Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon the
representations and warranties each of the Sellers which are set forth in this
Agreement, including in any Schedules to this Agreement, or any certificates
delivered by each Seller or CFC pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the
obligations of the parties hereunder, and such representations and warranties
shall not be deemed to have been waived or otherwise affected by any such
investigation or audit or any knowledge attributable to Buyer.

                  (c)  The representations and warranties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement, and the related indemnity obligations of Sellers
set forth in Section 11.4, shall terminate on, and no claim or action with
respect thereto may be brought after, 5:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, on
March 31, 1997 or 5:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, whichever occurs later; provided, however, that such
representations and warranties and the related indemnity obligation of Sellers
with respect thereto, shall not terminate with respect to any claim (whether
or not fixed as to liability or liquidated as to amount) with respect to which
Sellers have been given specific notice with such information as is reasonably
available at the time such claim is submitted to Sellers, prior to the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     53
expiration of such representations and warranties, and related indemnity
obligations as provided herein.

                  (d)  The representations and warranties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement and the related indemnity obligations of Buyer set
forth in Section 11.7 shall terminate on, and no claim or action with respect
thereto may be brought after, 5:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, on March 31,
1997 or 5:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, or the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, which occurs later; provided, however, that such representations
and warranties and the related indemnity obligation of Buyer with respect
thereto, shall not terminate with respect to any claim (whether or not fixed
as to liability or liquidated as to amount) with respect to which Buyer has
been given specific notice with such information as is reasonably available
at the time such claim is submitted to Buyer, prior to the expiration of such
representations and warranties, and related indemnity obligations as provided
herein.

      Section 11.4.  Indemnification by Seller.

                  (a)  From and after the Closing Date, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 11.4, the Sellers shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Group for, from and against all demands,
suits, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages,
liabilities, costs, judgments and expenses, including, without limitation,
interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and expenses,
and reasonable consultants' fees, disbursements and expenses (collectively,
the "Buyer Losses"), based upon, arising out of, asserted against, resulting
from, imposed on, or incurred by any member of the Buyer Group, directly or
indirectly, as a result of (i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty on
the part of a Seller in respect of, or any inaccuracy of or omission from, any
of the representations or warranties of a Seller contained in this Agreement
or any of the Schedules hereto or any certificate furnished or to be furnished
to Buyer hereunder or in connection herewith any of which arise during the
survival period set forth in Section 11.3(c), (ii) any nonfulfillment or
nonperformance by either of the Sellers or CFC or any of their Affiliates of
any agreement, covenant or obligation of either of the Sellers or CFC under
this Agreement, or any breach by a Seller or CFC or any of their Affiliates
of any provision of this Agreement, (iii) the noncompliance by Sellers or
Buyer with any applicable "bulk transfer" or similar provisions of the laws
of the any applicable jurisdiction in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the failure of Sellers to pay, perform
or discharge any of the Excluded Liabilities when and as due for payment,
performance or discharge, or (v) costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer
Group during the first twelve months following Closing pursuant to warranties
provided by the Sellers to their customers in respect of services rendered and
goods sold prior to the Closing to the extent and only to the extent that such
costs and expenses exceed $650,000.

                  (b)  In the event that subsequent to the Closing Date, any
claim is asserted, any event occurs or any proceeding (including governmental
investigations or audits) is instituted relating to any matter as to which any
member of the Buyer Group is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.4(a), as soon as practicable after Buyer receives any notice or otherwise
becomes aware of any such claim, proceeding or event, Buyer shall notify
Sellers in writing; provided, however that the failure of Buyer to so notify
Sellers shall not relieve Sellers from any liability under this Section 11.4,
except to the extent it is proved that the Sellers suffered actual prejudice
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     54
in connection with or in defending against such claim.  In case any  action
is brought against Buyer or a Seller in respect thereof and Buyer notifies
Sellers of the commencement thereof, Sellers shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of such action and, to the extent that Sellers may wish, to
assume sole control over the defense and settlement of such action; provided,
however, that:

                              (i)  the applicable member or members of the
Buyer Group shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action and
to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such action;

                              (ii)  Sellers shall obtain the prior written
      approval of the applicable member of the Buyer Group before entering
      into any settlement of such action (which shall not be unreasonably
      withheld) or ceasing to defend against such action; and

                              (iii)  Sellers shall notify Buyer of its
election to assume control of the defense of any such action within 15 days
after receipt of written notice of the action from a member of the Buyer
Group.

      After written notice by Sellers to the Buyer Group of its election to
assume control of the defense of any such action in accordance with the
foregoing, (i) Sellers shall not be liable to any members of the Buyer Group
for any legal or other expenses (other than expenses of investigation)
subsequently incurred by any of such Persons in connection therewith except
in cases where any member of the Buyer Group shall be advised in writing by
reputable legal counsel that it may have defenses available to it which are
inconsistent with or contrary to the defenses available to Seller in
connection with such action, and (ii) as long as the Sellers are reasonably
contesting such action in good faith, the members of the Buyer Group shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge the
claim underlying such action without Sellers' prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be entitled to assume
sole control over the defense and settlement of any claim, proceeding or
action relating to any matter as to which any member of the Buyer Group may
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.4(a):

                              (i)  if the claim, proceeding or action relates
to, could result in, or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation of any officer or employee of
Buyer;

                              (ii)  if the claim, proceeding or action could
result in or cause a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer;

                              (iii)  if the claim, proceeding or action is one
which seeks principally injunctive or equitable relief against the Buyer or
to the extent that the claims proceeding or action seeks injunctive or
equitable relief and a party has entered a motion seeking such relief;

                              (iv)  the claim, proceeding or action seeks
monetary damages in excess of the amount that Sellers would be required to pay
to Buyer pursuant to Section 11.4, or Buyer determines, in its reasonable
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     55
discretion, that the claim, proceeding or action could result in a judgment
for monetary damages in excess of the amount that Sellers would be required
to pay to Buyer pursuant to Section 11.4, or 

                              (v)  a court, Governmental Authority or other
arbiter of the claim, proceeding or action rules that the Sellers failed or
are failing to adequately protect Buyer's interests, rights or remedies.

      If Sellers do not elect to assume control over the defense or settlement
of an action as provided in this Section 11.4(b) or is not entitled to do so,
any member of the Buyer Group shall have the right to defend the action and
related claims in any reasonable manner as it may deem appropriate and,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.4(c), Sellers shall
indemnify and hold harmless the applicable members of the Buyer Group to the
extent such members are entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.4(a); provided, however, in no event shall Sellers be required to pay
expenses of more than one legal counsel for the Buyer Group.

                  (c)  No member of the Buyer Group shall be entitled to
indemnification under Section 11.4(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) in respect of
any individual claim involving Buyer Losses of less than $40,000 ("De Minimus
Claims") (it being understood that all Losses related to any claims arising
out of the same or similar facts, events, circumstances or matters shall be
considered part of the same claim for purposes of this Agreement), and no
member of the Buyer Group shall be entitled to indemnification under Section
11.4(a) until the aggregate amount of all Buyer Losses incurred by the Buyer
Group, exclusive of De Minimus Claims, exceeds $400,000.  In the event that
the aggregate amount of all Buyer Losses, exclusive of De Minimus Claims,
incurred by the Buyer Group under Section 11.4(a) exceeds $400,000, the Buyer
Group shall be entitled to indemnification only for the amount of the Buyer's
Losses in excess of $400,000.  Sellers shall only be required to pay to the
Buyer Group in the aggregate, and its maximum obligation to provide indemnity
pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to the sum of the Closing
Holdback.

                  (d)  Buyer shall have the right, subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 11.4(c) and the provisions of this Section 11.4(d), to
set-off against the Closing Holdback, the entire amount of any Buyer Losses
for which the Buyer determines in good faith that any member of the Buyer
Group is entitled to indemnification from Sellers under Section 11.4(a).  The
right to set-off described in this Section shall be exercised as follows:

                              (i)  Buyer shall deliver written notice to the
Sellers of each claim for indemnification for which the Buyer desires to
exercise its right to set-off.

                              (ii)  Sellers shall then have fifteen days
(which period may be extended by mutual consent in writing) following receipt
of such notice in which to accept or dispute each such claim, in whole or in
part.  To the extent that any such claim is not disputed in writing by Sellers
within such fifteen day period, such claim shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Sellers, and Buyer shall be entitled to set-off the entire amount
of such claim against the Closing Holdback.

                              (iii)  In the event that Sellers shall dispute
any claim of Buyer, in whole or in part (hereafter a "Contested Claim"), the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     56
Escrow Agent shall be instructed to hold such amount in escrow until the
Contested Claim has been resolved by agreement of the parties or until
otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement.  Upon resolution of the Contested Claim, the
Escrow Agent shall be instructed to promptly disburse the amount of the
Contested Claim to the party entitled thereto (as determined by agreement of
the parties or by order of Court) upon receipt of joint, written instructions
from Buyer and Sellers to that effect or upon presentation of a certified copy
of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction by either party.

      Section 11.5.  Indemnification by Buyer. 
                     -------------------------
                  (a)  From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless Sellers, CFC and any of their Affiliates (collectively, the
"Seller Group") for, from and against all demands, suits, claims, actions or
causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, judgments
and expenses, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys' fees, disbursements and expenses, and reasonable consultants' fees,
disbursements and expenses (collectively "Seller Losses"), based upon, arising
out of, asserted against, resulting to, imposed on, or incurred by the Seller
Group, directly or indirectly, from any misrepresentation or breach of any
warranty contained in or made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or the
breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with
by Buyer after the Closing including, without limitation, Buyer's covenant to
satisfy and discharge the Assumed Obligations.  In addition to the foregoing,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Seller Group harmless from and against any
Losses incurred by the Seller Group which involve claims made by purchasers
or underwriters of Buyer's securities based on the inaccuracy or inadequacy
of disclosure contained in any prospectus or offering circular utilized by
Buyer in connection with an offering of its securities, if the offering
circular or prospectus contains the financial statements of the Sellers.  The
indemnification provided to Buyer in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall not be available if the claim is based in whole or in part on the
Sellers' financial statements (but not including the Predecessor Financial
Statements) and it is determined that such financial statements do not fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flow of the Sellers at and for the dates and periods
presented in the financial statements.  The indemnification contained herein
with respect to covenants made by Buyer (including, without limitation, the
covenant to discharge the Assumed Obligations and the covenant set forth in
this Section relating to indemnification for inaccurate or inadequate
prospectuses or offering circulars of Buyer's Parent) shall survive the
Closing indefinitely.

                  (b)  In the event that subsequent to the Closing Date, any
claim is asserted, any event occurs or any proceeding (including governmental
investigations or audits) is instituted relating to any matter as to which any
member of the Seller Group is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.5(a), as soon as practicable after Sellers receive any notice of or
otherwise becomes aware of any such claim, proceeding or event, the Sellers
shall notify Buyer in writing; provided, however, that the failure of Sellers
to so notify the Buyer shall not relieve the Buyer from any liability under
this Section 11.5, except to the extent it is proved that Buyer suffered
actual prejudice in connection with or in defending against such claim.  In
case any such action is brought against any member of the Seller Group with
respect thereto and Sellers notify the Buyer of the commencement thereof, the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     57
Buyer shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and, to
the extent Buyer may wish, to assume sole control over the defense and
settlement of such action; provided, however, that:

                              (i)  the applicable member or members of the
Seller Group shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action
and to employ counsel at their own expense to assist in the handling of such
action; 

                              (ii)  the Buyer shall obtain the prior written
approval of the applicable member of the Seller Group before entering into any
settlement of such action or ceasing to defend against such action; and

                              (iii)  the Buyer shall notify Seller of their
election to assume control of the defense of any such action within 15 days
of receipt of written notice of the action from a member of the Seller Group.

      After written notice by the Buyer to the Seller Group of its election
to assume control of the defense of any such action in accordance with the
foregoing, (i) Buyer shall not be liable to any members of the Seller Group
for any legal or other expenses (other than expenses of investigation)
subsequently incurred by any of such Persons in connection therewith except
in cases where Seller shall be advised in writing by reputable legal counsel
that they may have legal defenses available to them which are inconsistent
with or contrary to the legal defenses available to the Buyer in connection
with such action, and (ii) as long as the Buyer is reasonably contesting such
action in good faith, the members of the Seller Group shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge the claim
underlying such action without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which
consent may be given or withheld in the sole discretion of the Buyer.

      If the Buyer elects to assume control over the defense or settlement of
an action as provided in this Section 11.5(b), any member of the Seller Group
shall have the right to defend the action and related claims in any reasonable
manner as it may deem appropriate and, subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 11.5(a), the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the applicable
members of the Seller Group to the extent such members are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.5(a).  No member of the Buyer
Indemnification Group shall be liable under this Section 11.5 for any
settlement or compromise effected without its consent (it being understood and
agreed that, in the event no member of the Buyer Indemnification Group elects
to assume control over the defense of the action, the members of the Buyer
Indemnification Group shall not unreasonably withhold or unreasonably delay
any such consent).

      Section 11.6.  Confidentiality.  Each of the parties hereto for
themselves and their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders
and representatives, shall hold in confidence all information, books, records
and documents acquired from any other party hereto prior to, on, or after the
date hereof in the course of negotiation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or pursuant to the provisions hereof and will not disclose the same to
any third party except as required by law, and except to the extent necessary
to (a) respond to lawful process, (b) comply with Applicable Laws, (c)
establish a lawful claim or defense, or (d) obtain reasonably necessary advice
of counsel.  Should the transactions contemplated hereby not be consummated
for any reason, each party shall promptly return to the other all originals
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     58
and copies of such documents and other written information obtained from the
other in the course of such negotiations or pursuant hereto and shall promptly
destroy all evaluations and studies prepared by it or by any of its
representatives on the basis of such information, books, records or documents. 
The foregoing shall not apply to information concerning CFC or a Seller which
was known to Buyer or was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed
to Buyer or which subsequently entered the public domain through no wrongful
act of Buyer.

      Section 11.7.  Restrictive Covenants of Seller and CFC.

                  (a)  Each of the Sellers and CFC hereby covenant and agree,
jointly and severally, that:

"Carlisle Group"), and First Chicago (for purposes of this Section 11.7(b)
only, including Cross Creek Partners III and its individual partners),
covenant and agree that:

                              (i)  for a period of three years following

that the foregoing covenant shall not prevent the members of the Carlisle
Group or First Chicago from acquiring, collectively among the members of each
such group, shares representing less than 5% of the outstanding shares of the
common stock of Buyer's Parent);

                              (iv)  no member of the Carlisle Group nor First

in Section 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), in connection with any of the foregoing
and will not publicly or privately request the Buyer's Parent (its officers,
directors, employees or agents) or publicly disclose any request, directly or
indirectly, to waive any provisions of this Section.

                  (c)  From and after the Closing, neither of the Sellers nor
CFC nor any of their presently existing or hereafter created Affiliates shall
use, or assert any right to use, or take any action inconsistent with Buyer's
right to use, any trademark, logo or tradename related to the Business of
Sellers, including, without intended limitation, the trade names "CFC Aviation
Services" or "Garrett Aviation Services," and shall not use any trademarks,
logos or tradenames that are confusingly similar thereto or that are a
translation or transliteration thereof into any language or alphabet, in
connection with any business that is the same or similar to the Business
engaged in by the Sellers.

                  (d)  Construction.  Each covenant and agreement of this
Section 11.7 shall be read and construed independently of each other and if
any one of them (or portion thereof) is held invalid the others (or others
portions thereof) shall continue to be valid and to apply and the one (or the
portion) held to be invalid shall be read and construed in the most
restrictive manner intended by this Section 11.7 that would permit it to be
held valid and enforceable.  Accordingly, the parties agree that because the
provisions of this Section 11.7 are divisible and separable, if any provision
hereof is held to be unreasonable, unlawful or unenforceable in duration,
geographical scope or character of restriction by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary in
order that any such provision or portion thereof shall be legally enforceable
to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the parties hereto do hereby
expressly authorize any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any such
provision or portion of this Section 11.7 or to modify any such provision or
portion hereof in order that any such provision or portion hereof shall be
enforced by such court to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

                  (e)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.7
to the contrary, the terms and conditions of Sections 11.7(a)(i) and
11.7(a)(ii) shall not be binding upon John R. Myers, George Leisz or Harry
Todd.

      Section 11.8.  Change of Names.  Promptly following the Closing, but in
no event later than 10 days following the Closing, each of the Sellers and CFC
shall take all actions necessary to change the name of the Sellers and CFC to
names which are not confusingly similar to or a translation or transliteration
of "CFC Aviation Services" or "Garrett Aviation Services."  Each Seller and
CFC shall take similar action to modify the names under which they have
qualified to do business in foreign jurisdictions within 30 days of Closing.

      Section 11.9.  Specific Performance and Injunctive Relief. Each Seller
hereby acknowledges and agrees that the damages to Buyer resulting from any
breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement to be complied with or performed by each Seller may be
intangible, in whole or in part, and incapable of being assessed a monetary
value and will result in irreparable harm to, and have a Material Adverse
Effect on, Buyer.  Therefore, each of the Sellers and CFC hereby agree that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with or performed by a
Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance,
injunctive relief to prevent any such breach or the continuation thereof and
other equitable remedies in addition to monetary damages and legal remedies
in respect thereof, together with an award of it's attorney's fees, expenses
and disbursements incurred in connection with seeking such relief.

thereto as Buyer deems advisable; and (iii) to take all actions that Buyer or
its successors or assigns deem proper in order to provide for Buyer and its
successors or assigns the benefits of any of the Assets except that the
foregoing Power of Attorney shall not extend to any such action that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on a Seller or the
Business.  Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing powers are
coupled with an interest and are irrevocable by each Seller.

      Section 12.2.  Expenses.  All legal, accounting and other costs and fees
incurred by a Seller or CFC in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne and paid for solely by such Seller or CFC,
