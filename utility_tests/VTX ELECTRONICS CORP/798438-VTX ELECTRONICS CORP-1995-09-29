ITEM ONE - BUSINESS


THE COMPANY

         VTX Electronics Corp. (the "Company") through its wholly-owned Vertex
Technologies, Inc. subsidiary ("Vertex') is a multi-regional value-added
specialty distributor of electronic components and cable, and a manufacturer of
custom-made electronic cable assemblies used in providing connectivity solutions
which includes system integration for customers operating a wide range of data
communications.  The Company adds value by providing connectivity solutions for
customers.  This includes linking or connecting standard or proprietary
electronic devices and peripheral components from different manufacturers to
provide solutions for various customer requirements and system integration. 
These may include sales of passive or active electronic components and/or the
manufacture of custom-made electronic cable assemblies which the Company designs
specifically to meet individual customer's unique and complete connectivity
requirements.

         Management believes that the Company's technical ability for providing
connectivity solutions between the data system capabilities of many 
manufacturers and the specific connectivity needs of its customers, along with 
its reputation for providing the design and manufacture of custom-made 
electronic cable assemblies that are subject to 100% computerized quality 
control testing will be the principal factors on which the Company will plan its
future growth.

         The Company expects internal growth to be enhanced by what the Company
perceives to be three continuing trends:  (i) the increasing demand for data
communications to provide timely information in the office environment and
factory floor that requires connectivity solutions; (ii) the growing number of
alternatives available to organizations of all sizes in all types of industries
to increase productivity through improved or upgraded computer data
communications; and (iii) increasing number of manufacturers of passive and
active components preferring distributors, such as the Company, who are capable
of offering complete connectivity solutions to the end user.

         The Company's executive offices are located at 61 Executive Boulevard,
Farmingdale, New York 11735 and its telephone number is (516) 293-1610.  Unless
the context requires otherwise, all references herein to the Company and Vertex
mean VTX Electronics Corp. and its subsidiaries.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

         On August 24, 1995, the Company signed a letter of intent in principal
to merge with CPI Aerostructures, Inc. ("CPI"), a publicly-traded company in the
commercial/military aircraft business.  Under the terms of the letter, shares of
the Company's common stock will be converted into shares of CPI common stock at
a conversion rate of one share of CPI common stock for three shares of the
Company's common stock, as adjusted for a price guarantee.  The agreement may be
terminated by the mutual consent of both parties or if a definitive Merger
Agreement has not been executed by October 15, 1995.  In the event either party
unilaterally terminates the letter of intent, the terminating party shall pay to
the other party an amount equal to all of the expenses incurred by the other
party in connection with the contemplated transaction, up to a maximum of
$150,000 in the aggregate, plus a break-up fee of $250,000.  The merger plan is
subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive acquisition agreement,
approval of the respective Board of Directors and stockholder's of the Company
and CPI, and consent of lenders, to the extent required.  Subsequent to the 
signing of the letter of intent, certain developments have occurred that may 
preclude completion of the transaction.


<PAGE>


  On September 15, 1995, the Company's Common Stock was delisted from the
American Stock Exchange. The Company no longer fully satisfies all the financial
guidelines of the American Stock Exchange for continued listing.  The Company's
Common Stock is presently trading on the Over-The-Counter Electronic Bulletin
Board.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

        The Company's business strategy is to develop a value-added distribution
network through internal growth with a focus on connectivity solutions for data
communications.  Management believes it will continue to (i) introduce new
connectivity solutions, (ii) improve operating efficiencies through a more
efficient organizational structure, eliminate duplicated activities, and
integrate manufacturing capabilities between the three separate manufacturing
facilities located in the United States, (iii) derive the benefits of critical
mass through the opportunity to develop stronger relationships with, and obtain
the best terms from, key suppliers, and (iv) derive the benefits of critical
mass through the ability to distribute to and service large national and 
international customers.

        In its relationship with its customers, the Company focuses on providing
connectivity solutions, thus adding significant value to the passive and active
components it distributes.  Such solutions include advising customers on the
options available to meet their specific needs, and manufacturing custom-made
electronic cable assemblies for the customers.  In addition, the Company
continues to service the customers with components and assemblies as the
customer's system grows.  Management believes that manufacturers of products
generally choose to build relationships with distributorships capable of 
offering advisory services, technical support, and other services such as 
manufacturing custom-made electronic cable assemblies.  The Company believes it
is perceived as a value-added distributor by both suppliers and customers as a 
result of its technical skills and knowledge of the marketplace, access to and 
understanding of the product capabilities, and technical design and 
manufacturing capabilities for custom-made electronic cable assemblies.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

     The Company's products and services consist principally of the distribution
of a broad range of passive and active electronic components, and the design and
manufacture of custom-made electronic cable assemblies used as solutions for
connectivity requirements in data communications.  Typically, passive components
carry data signals without any processing or filtering of the data (e.g.,
electronic connectors, electronic wire and cable, cabinets and racks, and patch
panels), while active components generate and/or regenerate and filter data
signals (e.g., hubs, bridge, routers, gateways, and modems).  The Company's
principal product lines focus on connectivity solutions for data communications.

      The Company also designs and manufactures custom-made cable assemblies
tailored to the customer's requirements and offers project management and
installation of structured wiring and network design for data communications. 
The Company employs design, engineering, and technical support personnel to
develop alternative connectivity solutions including system integration and
manufacture custom-made electronic cable assemblies.

         The Company has restructured its operations to improve focus and
productivity, which emphasizes the passive and active component areas of
connectivity solutions, while discontinues hardware and application and 
operating software areas of connectivity solutions.  See "Restructuring Plan" 
and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations".

PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS

         Management believes that the Company is not dependent on any particular
supplier.  The products that the Company distributes are generally characterized
by a large number of products manufactured by a variety of companies.  The
Company deals with preferred suppliers and believes the Company has a good
working relationship with each of its existing strategic suppliers including 
AMP, AT&T, Andrews, Cable Design Technologies, IBM, Madison Wire & Cable, 
Microtest, Novell, Racal Datacom, Siecor, and Synoptics.  For the fiscal year 
ended June 30, 1995, purchases from AT&T accounted for 15.7%.  AT&T and Madison 
Wire & Cable accounted for 10.8% and 12.1%, respectively of purchases in fiscal 
1994.  In fiscal 1993, AT&T and IBM accounted for 15.3% and 10.1%, respectively,
of purchases.  During fiscal 1995, certain plenum cable and wire items were in 
tight industry supply due to a world shortage of fluorinated-ethylene-propylene
(FEP) which is used in the production of plenum products.  Management believes 
the tight supply situation has stabilized and should improve through 1996.

       Through stock rotation rights and price protection arrangements with most
of its major suppliers including AMP, AT&T and IBM, the Company can reduce the
risk of holding obsolete or over-priced product.  Stock rotation rights allow
distributors to return a certain proportion of their purchases in the event that
the product does not sell.  A price protection program gives the distributor a
rebate on purchases during a specified period if the manufacturer subsequently
lowers it prices.  The price protection generally covers any purchases made
within the most recent 60 to 90 day period prior to the manufacturer's price
reduction.

      The Company works off manufacturers' lead times. Deliveries range from one
week to approximately 90 days.  The Company has a fully integrated on-line
computer system that enables it to determine immediate inventory availability of
the Company's entire inventory at its stocking facilities.  The Company monitors
and maintains manufacturers' delivery schedules to ensure "on-time" delivery for
customers and to maintain proper inventory levels for the Company.  The Company
believes that it has adopted more thorough inventory control systems, and
management currently does not believe it will be required to expense any
significant amounts of inventory in the foreseeable future.  However, there can
be no assurance there will not be further inventory writeoffs.

         The Company's objective is to minimize lead times for its customers 
without financing excess stock levels or risking technological obsolescence.  
Several manufacturers have provided the Company an expedited shipping function 
in order to better service the Company's customers.

         The Company has restructured its operations to improve productivity, 
which emphasizes centralized purchasing and establishment of preferred suppliers
including primary and secondary supplier bases.  The Company has written off
approximately $1,200,000 of inventory during fiscal 1993 because of 
technological obsolescence and an additional write-down for discontinued 
products and obsolete inventory was taken during the fiscal year ended June 30, 
1994 of approximately $262,000.

SALES AND MARKETING

         The Company offers a broad range of passive and active electronic
components used as connectivity solutions to end-users, professionals who 
install and service data communications, and original equipment manufacturers 
(OEM's). 

         The Company operates through seven locations in the Northeast, Mid-
Atlantic, and Western regions of the United States, and one location in the
United Kingdom.  All but one of the eight locations operate as a sales office 
and warehouse, whereas the one location is solely a sales office.  In addition,
the Company operates manufacturing operations in the states of New York, 
Maryland and California, plus one operation in the United Kingdom.  These 
operations support the design and manufacture of custom-made and standard cable
assembly requirements for the entire Company.  

         The Company consolidated its operations by closing two facilities and
realigned the organizational structure of the other facilities in order to
improve support of the Company's sales and marketing efforts to better service
the Company's customers.  See "Restructuring Plan".

       In order to effectively meet each customer's needs, the sales force first
gains an understanding of the customer's system connectivity requirements before
recommending one or more possible solutions.  The variety of products offered by
the Company often allows the sales person to add value by providing alternative
solutions or more complete solutions to customers requirements and thereby
gaining add-on sales.  Where necessary, technical support personnel assist sales
people in recommending the most appropriate solution. The Company generally does
not participate in the design of computer application but rather participates in
the design and implementation of the connectivity solutions required for data
communications including system integration.

         The field sales force is supported by inside sales personnel who handle
incoming customer calls, perform sales estimates, provide rapid responses to
customer questions and assist in sales prospecting.  In addition, compensation
policies have been tailored to promote a profit-oriented, rather than a revenue-
oriented, sales philosophy.

        Sales leads are typically generated by ongoing interaction with existing
customers, sales calls to companies not currently customers, referrals from
suppliers, and by advertising and promotional efforts.  The advertising and
promotion program for the Company consists of: (i) exhibits at national and
regional trade shows; (ii) Company sponsored seminars and product demonstrations
in regional areas; (iii) advertisements in trade publications; and (iv) direct
mail campaigns to targeted market niches.

         The Company has recently refocused its sales and marketing strategy to
concentrate its efforts in certain market niches in which it only distributes 
the products of preferred suppliers. These products represent passive components
such as category 5 wiring products, fiber optics, and wireless communication
products, and active components such as bridges, hubs, modems and routers,
included in the design and implementation of structured wiring solutions for
network applications.  The market for the Company's refocused products has
historically remained more stable and has not been affected to the same degree
by technological changes or price fluctuations.  The majority of the products
distributed by the Company are readily adaptable to various end-users in all
industries.

COMPANY LOCATIONS

     The Company's locations, of which the Farmingdale location is owned and all
other locations are leased, are as follows:

                         Elkridge, Maryland    
                         Farmingdale, New York
                         Folcroft, Pennsylvania
                         Marlboro, Massachusetts
                         San Jose, California 
                         Torrance, California
                         Totowa, New Jersey     
                         Corby, United Kingdom

MAJOR CUSTOMER

         The Company has one customer that has accounted for 10% or more of its
sales during the last three fiscal years.  Bloomberg L.P. accounted for
approximately 11.4% of sales in fiscal 1993, approximately 16.3% of sales in
fiscal 1994 and approximately 14.7% of sales in fiscal 1995.  

COMPETITION

         All aspects of the Company's business are highly competitive.  The 
Company competes with several national distributors including Anixter, Inc., a 
subsidiary of Anixter International Inc., and Kent Electronics Corporation, 
which have greater financial and other resources than the Company.  The Company
also competes with numerous distributors and systems integrators operating on a 
local or regional basis.  The Company's principal method of competing with the  
other national distributors is by adding value to the active and passive 
components it sells by assisting its customers in achieving appropriate 
connectivity solutions.  National distributors generally sell components on a 
higher volume driven basis than the Company and, therefore, can sell those 
components at a lower price to customers buying in bulk.  However, such national
distributors generally do not focus on connectivity solutions. 

         The Company also competes with a large number of regional and local
distributors and systems integrators.  These entities generally provide value-
added components to their customers, but frequently cannot provide comparable
volume discounts and the price advantages as the Company is able to provide. The
Company purchases many of the system components on a national scale directly 
from manufacturers and, following the equity financing and repayment of certain 
trade creditors, expects to be able to enhance its ability to obtain these price
advantages. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations".

         The Company believes that its ability to provide value-added specialty
distribution, together with its design and manufacture capability to custom make
electronic cable assemblies as well as making available technical support
differentiates the Company's from its primary competitors and gives the Company
a competitive advantage.  There can be no assurance the Company will be able to
successfully exploit such advantage.

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE

        The Company maintains a comprehensive general liability insurance policy
in the amount of $2,000,000, with an umbrella policy, including products
liability, providing coverage in the aggregate amount of $20,000,000 which it
believes to be adequate coverage.


<PAGE>
EMPLOYEES

         As of September 1, 1995, the Company had 192 full-time employees.  Of
these, 70 are sales and marketing personnel; 7 are design, engineering, and
technical support personnel; 25 are purchasing, warehouse and inventory control
personnel; 62 are cable assembly manufacturing personnel; 9 are quality control
personnel; and 19 are accounting, data processing and other administrative
personnel.  33 employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement in the
Company's Farmingdale facility.  In addition to its employees, the Company uses
other workers on a contract basis, as its needs require.  The Company considers
its relations with its employees to be good.                       

RESTRUCTURING PLAN

      In November, 1993, the Board of Directors retained Mr. Donald W. Rowley as
a consultant to conduct an ongoing analysis of the Company's strategic strengths
and weaknesses, and current operations.  After Mr. Rowley's analysis, he
recommended a restructuring plan including short term, near term and long term
objectives.  The Company's Board of Directors adopted all of Mr. Rowley's
recommendations and plans, and in March 1994, retained him as president to enact
them.


         The Short Term Plan involved the following steps which have been
implemented:

         *       Closing Ohio and Georgia branch operations due to the extended
                 period of time necessary to make these operations profitable.

         *       "Right-sizing" the Maryland and Philadelphia branches through
                 employee reductions of approximately 16 people to improve
                 profitability.

         *       Lowering corporate office operating expenses through employee
                 reductions of approximately 18 people.

         *       Reducing overtime more than 60% since December 1993 by 
                 manufacturing products based on forecasted product demand.


         The Near Term Plan involved the following steps which have been
implemented:             

         *       Implementing a new freight management program throughout the 
                 Company in August 1994.
         
         *       Implementing centralized purchasing.

         *       Establishing standard sales operating procedures for all 
                 branches.

         *       Establishing standard manufacturing and quality control 
                 policies and procedures in order to utilize the separate 
                 manufacturing operations as an integrated/interchangeable 
                 manufacturing resource; and completing ISO-9002 Certification 
                 at the San Jose facility.







<PAGE>
         The Long Term Plan involved the following steps which have been
implemented:

         *       Establishing preferred suppliers including primary and 
                 secondary supplier bases and reducing the number of vendors by
                 more than 35%.

         *       Preparing and communicating to suppliers the Company's strategy
                 of value added component distribution for connectivity 
                 solutions.

         *       Utilizing the equity financing to rebuild financial 
                 relationships with suppliers to finance the Company's 
                 restructuring plan emphasizing products with a greater profit 
                 margin.

         *       Implementing centralized purchasing and eliminating smaller
                 purchases from multiple sources, thereby improving gross 
                 profit margins.


         The Restructuring Plan was initiated in fiscal 1994 and completed 
during fiscal 1995.  Management believes that the completion of the operational 
restructuring plan directs the Company toward profitability by:

         *       Reducing corporate overhead.

         *       Lowering certain branches operating expenses.

         *       Improving operations to enable completion of ISO-9002 
                 Certification.

         *       Increasing end-user sales focus for connectivity solutions.

         *       Improving financial and inventory management to minimize write-
                 off exposure.

         Management believes that the completion of the Restructuring Plan, 
along with improving availability of FEP related products, and improving sales 
force stability and productivity, will enable the Company to return to 
profitability.

ITEM SEVEN - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
             CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 1995 AND 1994

     Net sales for the year ended June 30, 1995 were $34,472,000, as compared to
the year ended June 30, 1994 of $42,864,000, a decrease of 19.6%.  Value-added
distribution sales of electronic components, including systems integration,
decreased by approximately $9,204,000 from $30,605,000 to $21,401,000 (30.1%). 
The decrease was due to tight industry supply of certain cable and wire items 
and lost sales from related items without the "pull through" effect of the items
in tight supply; and turnover of sales personnel and to recently hired sales 
people learning the Company's operation.  During the same period, the aspect of
the Company's business involving the Company's custom-made cable assemblies 
(referred to as manufacturing) increased by approximately $812,000 from 
$12,259,000  to $13,071,000 (6.6%) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 as
compared with the prior fiscal year.  The increase in manufacturing was due to 
value added sales focus which was uninterrupted by any tight industry supply of 
product.  The Company estimates that the profit margins from custom-made cable 
assemblies are slightly higher than value added distribution sales.

     Gross profit decreased by $2,213,000 or 23.6% for the year ended June 30,
1995 to $7,161,000 from $9,374,000 as compared to fiscal 1994.  The decrease was
mainly due to lower sales levels as a result of tight industry supply of certain
cable and wire items, and turnover of sales personnel and to recently hired 
sales personnel learning the Company's operation.  The gross profit percentage 
for the year ended June 30, 1995, 1994, and 1993 was  20.8%, 21.9%, and 19.2%
respectively.  The lower gross profit percentage in fiscal 1995 was due to
product mix change as a result of tight industry supply of certain cable and 
wire items.  The gross profit for the year ended June 30, 1993 was reduced when
compared to June 30, 1992 and June 30, 1994 due to the $1,200,000 write-off of
obsolete and slow moving inventory in the second quarter of fiscal year 1993.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately
$2,907,000 or 27.7% to $7,572,000 for the year ended June 30, 1995 from
$10,479,000 as compared to fiscal 1994.  Selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales were 22% in fiscal 1995 as compared to
24.4% in fiscal 1994.  The decrease was due primarily to the aforementioned 
decrease in sales and the positive effects from the implementation of the 
Company's restructuring plan in the current fiscal year.  Decreased sales in 
the current year resulted in a decrease of approximately $290,000 in sales 
commissions and an $830,000 decrease in general selling expenses.  These 
decreases were partially offset by a $256,000 increase in sales salaries and 
related expenses resulting from additional sales personnel hired during the 
current fiscal year which resulted from significant sales force turnover.
The implementation of the Company's restructuring plan contributed
approximately $637,000 toward the decrease in salaries and related expense of
non-sales personnel,  and other selling, general and administrative expense 
decreases of approximatley $775,000 from improved financial controls over 
spending.  In addition, the prior year expenses included $524,000 of bad debt
expense that was not incurred in the current year as a result of improved credit
and collections management.

     The Company's restructuring activities were completed during fiscal 1995. 
Additional costs of $91,000 were incurred.  Such costs were primarily associated
with final settlements reached in fiscal 1995 for the termination of certain
employment contracts, employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as
additional related legal fees associated therewith.

     Interest expense decreased by $74,000 or 8.2% for the year ended June 30,
1995 to $827,000 from $901,000.  The decrease was due to lower borrowing levels
for most of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 compared to the prior fiscal
year.

<PAGE>
         YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 1994 AND 1993

     Net sales for the year ended June 30, 1994 were $42,864,000, as compared to
the year ended June 30, 1993 of $49,407,000, a decrease of 13.2%.  The aspect of
the Company's business involving the Company's custom-made cable assemblies
(referred to as manufacturing) increased by approximately $174,000 from
$12,085,000  to $12,259,000 (1.4%) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 as
compared with the prior fiscal year.  During the same period, value added
distribution sales of electronic components decreased by approximately 
$6,717,000 from $37,322,000 to $30,605,000 (18.0%) because the Company gave 
priority with respect to the above described manufacturing activities.  The 
Company estimates that the profit margins respecting custom-made cable 
assemblies and value added distribution sales are approximately the same.  This 
allocation of priorities was due to the Company's limited resources during the 
last fiscal year.  Insufficient inventory stocking levels for most of fiscal 
1994 resulted in delayed sales of value added distribution, or lost sales.

     Gross profit decreased by $98,000 or 1% for the year ended June 30, 1994 to
$9,374,000 from $9,472,000 as compared to fiscal 1993.  The decrease was
primarily due to lower sales levels.  The gross profit percentage for the year
ended June 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992 was 21.9%, 19.2%, and 21.9% respectively. 
The gross profit for the year ended June 30, 1993 was reduced when compared to
June 30, 1992 and June 30, 1994 due to the $1,200,000 write-off of obsolete and
slow moving inventory in the second quarter of fiscal year 1993.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 
$68,000 or 0.7% to $10,479,000 for the year ended June 30, 1994 from $10,411,000
as compared to fiscal 1993.  Selling expenses decreased by approximately 
$907,000 mainly as a result of replacing several high fixed salary sales people 
with lower fixed salary plus commission sales people and reducing the number of 
sales people through closing two operations.  A $524,000 provision for doubtful 
accounts was recorded for the year ended June 30, 1994 (which includes $33,000 
for the United Kingdom accounts receivables) versus $255,000 in the prior fiscal
year.  Selling, general and administrative expenses included noncash 
compensation expense attributed to the Common Stock, stock options and warrants 
issued to officers, directors and consultants aggregating $582,000.  Other 
selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $124,000 for the year 
ended June 30, 1994 as compared to fiscal 1993 mainly due to an increase of 
expense associated to recruiting and hiring new sales people, restructuring the 
Philadelphia branch operation, hiring outside programmers for the Bill of
Materials system application, and general provision for employee issues.

    The Company's restructuring activities, which began at the end of the second
quarter of fiscal 1994, are expected to continue through the second quarter of
fiscal 1995.  Certain of these activities, including the implementation of
centralized purchasing, standardized manufacturing and quality control policies
and procedures, and new freight management programs are intended to improve
profitability without increasing expenses.  In addition, the Company's
restructuring plan is designed to realign its corporate headquarters and field
operations (increasing overall profitability through the closing of certain
branches), eliminate marginally profitable product lines and disposing of 
certain assets.  Discontinued product lines included lower margin items such as 
hookup wire and outside plant cable and high technology hardware and software 
items.  Approximately 16 people were terminated from branch closures and 18 
people were terminated from "right-sizing" branch and corporate operations.  

    The restructuring charges of $939,000 consists of provisions for termination
of certain employment contracts, employee severance and benefit settlements of
$264,000, inventory write-downs for discontinued product lines of $321,000, and
abandonment of leased facilities, equipment and other assets of $354,000.

<PAGE>
     Interest expense decreased by $147,000 or 14% for the year ended June 30,
1994 to $901,000 from $1,048,000.  The decrease was due to lower borrowing 
levels for most of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 compared to the prior 
fiscal year.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Working capital as of June 30, 1995 was $4,476,000 as compared with
$5,320,000 as of June 30, 1994.  The $844,000 decline in working capital was
largely a result of a decrease in sales volume for year ended June 30, 1995. 
Accounts receivable decreased by approximately $1,197,000, offset by an increase
in inventory of approximately $157,000 and an increase of current portion of 
long term debt of approximately $83,000 due to the reclassification of an 
equipment note due March 31, 1996.

     During March and April of 1994, the Company completed a series of two 
equity transactions whereby the Company sold 2,500,000 shares of its Common 
Stock together with 2,500,000 common stock purchase warrants for which the 
Company received $1,250,000.  In June 1994, the Company completed the 
registration of the shares of Common Stock underlying the common stock purchase 
warrants aggregating 3,950,000, and received $1,415,000 representing the net 
proceeds from the exercise of these warrants.  The proceeds from these 
transactions were used to reduce outstanding trade accounts payable, purchase 
additional inventory and reduce the revolving credit facility.

     The Company has typically been extended trade credit for its inventory
purchases from suppliers. In normal business practice, a supplier will establish
a credit line and payment terms for the Company.  Suppliers usually require
payment on trade credit between 30 and 60 days.  Generally, the Company has been
able to arrange extended payment terms with its key suppliers and establish
schedules to reduce the trade credit days outstanding with suppliers over an
extended period of time during the past year.  As of June 30, 1995, the Company
had $5,062,000 in accounts payable and accrued expenses which represents about
68 days of trade credit.

     The Company has approximately $654,000 of inventory that is estimated slow
moving, with reserves against this inventory of $535,000.  The Company believes
it will be able to realize the net amount of this inventory through customer
incentive programs and disposals.

     Long term debt as of June 30, 1995 was $5,966,000, a decrease of $372,000
from $6,338,000 at June 30, 1994.  The decrease was mainly due to the Company
exchanging $394,750 of an equipment loan for 789,500 shares of the Company's
common stock.  The Company reclassified the balance of this equipment loan of
$105,250 to current portion of long term.

     The Company currently has a revolving credit facility which provides for
maximum borrowings of $10,000,000 at an interest rate of prime plus 2 3/4% with
an additional commitment fee of 1/2% per annum on the daily average unused
portion of the credit.  Under the terms of the agreement, borrowings are limited
to 80% of eligible accounts receivable (constituting those amounts outstanding
90 days or less) and 50% of eligible accounts receivable outstanding between 91
and 120 days, and 40% of regular inventory and 20% of slow moving inventory.  As
of June 30, 1995 the Company had approximately $5,406,000 availability under the
facility, of which $4,904,000 was outstanding on that date.  The loan is
collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company not otherwise
collateralized.  This credit facility expires on December 31, 1997.  The Company
intends to continue to employ this line of credit to finance inventory and
accounts receivable. 

<PAGE>
     In connection with its revolving credit facility, the Company is subject to
restrictive covenants which impose certain limitations with respect to the 
Company's incurrence of indebtedness, capital expenditures, creation or
recurrence of liens, declaration or payment of dividends or other distribution,
mergers, consolidations and sales or purchases of substantial assets.  In 
general, the Company is not allowed to incur further indebtedness or create 
additional liens on its assets except for unsecured current liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business or liabilities incurred in the ordinary 
course of business secured by purchase money security interests  not to exceed 
an aggregate of $750,000.  The Company is not allowed to make loans or 
investments or provide guarantees or to prepay indebtedness.  The Company is 
prohibited from paying dividends and may not enter into a merger, consolidation 
or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.  Additionally,  the Company 
is required to maintain consolidated net worth of not less than $750,000 and to 
maintain consolidated working capital, defined as current assets less current 
liabilities and debt outstanding under the credit facility, of not less than a 
negative $1.5 million.  The Company is currently in compliance with the 
restrictive covenants and financial tests under the credit facility.

     At June 30, 1995, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for tax
purposes of approximately $6,742,000.  Such net operating loss carryforwards
expire through fiscal year 2010.  The Company's use of its net operating loss
carryforward is limited as the Company is deemed to have undergone an "ownership
change", as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 382, during the fiscal
years ended June 30, 1992 and June 30, 1994.  In connection with such net 
operating loss limitation, the Company must obtain a fair valuation of the
Company as of the date of the ownership change.  Based upon the Company's 
estimate of fair value, approximately $3,504,000 of the Company's total net 
operating loss of $6,742,000 is limited to approximately $715,000 annually
during the carryforward period.


INFLATION

     For the last three fiscal years, the Company has not been significantly
affected by inflation.

Board of Directors and Stockholders
   VTX Electronics Corp.



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VTX Electronics
Corp. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and 1994, and the related 
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1995.  These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of VTX Electronics 
Corp. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and 1994 and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended June 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred
to above, we have also audited Schedule II for each of the three in the period
ended June 30, 1995.  In our opinion, this schedule presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information required to be set forth therein.

                        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993


1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    a.  General - VTX Electronics Corp. and subsidiaries (the "Company") operate
        primarily in one business segment - distribution and assembly of
        electronic wire, cable and related products used primarily for data
        communication.  The consolidated financial statements include the
        accounts of VTX Electronics Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
        Vertex Technologies, Inc.,  Vertex Data Systems, Inc. [inactive] and its
        foreign subsidiary, Vertex Electronics UK, LTD.  All significant
        intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
        consolidation.

        The Company had losses before extraordinary items of $1,316,044,
        $2,934,499 and $2,029,928 for the years ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and
        1993, respectively.  Sales during fiscal 1995 were negatively impacted
        due to tight industry supply of certain cable and wire items and lost
        sales from related items without the "pull through" effect of the items
        in tight supply.  The tight supply situation has stabilized and should
        improve through 1996.  In addition, turnover of sales personnel and
        recently hired sales personnel learning the Company's operation had a
        further negative impact on sales.  Management has increased efforts to
        hire and train new sales personnel.

        Management's plans to continue operating the Company include generating
        sufficient cash flows from operations, primarily through the timely
        liquidation of receivables and careful management of inventory
        purchases, including the respective payments thereof.  In addition, the
        Company completed a financial reorganization and operational
        restructuring during the year ended June 30, 1995, which commenced in
        fiscal 1994.  The financial reorganization included the satisfaction of
        certain lender obligations at a discount during fiscal 1994, and the
        amendment of a long-term revolving credit facility, which was extended
        to December 31, 1997, as described in Note 6a.  The operational
        restructuring included the discontinuance of certain product lines,
        closing of certain branch operations and the termination of certain
        employees (Note 2).  Management believes that the restructuring will
        position the Company toward profitable growth in margins as a result of
        greater specialization and purchasing leverage, and by reducing
        corporate overhead.  Management believes that current levels of working
        capital ($4,476,098 at June 30, 1995) including cash balances of
        $583,388 and excess cash availability of approximately $502,000 from its
        revolving credit facility at June 30, 1995 (Note 6a), will be adequate
        to fund operations for the next fiscal year.

    b.  Inventories - Inventories, consisting principally of products held for
        sale, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
        market.

    c.  Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment are stated
        at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization computed on a
        straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective
        assets.  Building improvements are amortized over the useful life of the
        improvement.  Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and betterments
        which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are
        charged to operations as incurred.  The cost and related accumulated
        depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective
        accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations.

                                        F-6

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993


    d.  Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue on the date the
        product is shipped to the customer.

    e.  Deferred Costs - Costs incurred in connection with debt refinancing
        consisting primarily of loan origination fees, broker's commission,
        legal and other fees have been capitalized and are being amortized on
        a straight-line basis over the term of the loans.  Amounts of
        refinancing costs deferred at June 30, 1995 and 1994 were $171,400 and
        $202,100, respectively.  
            
    f.  Income Taxes - The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (SFAS) No. 109. "Accounting for Income Taxes", as of July 1,
        1993.  SFAS No. 109 requires an asset/liability approach for financial
        accounting and reporting for income taxes.  

    g.  Income (Loss) Per Share - The weighted average shares outstanding
        include common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares
        attributable to outstanding stock options and warrants, if dilutive. 
        The income (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net
        income or (loss) for each year by the weighted average number of common
        and common equivalent shares (if dilutive) outstanding during the
        period.  The weighted average number of shares outstanding includes
        common stock equivalents of 555,527 for the year ended June 30, 1993. 
        For the years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994, the outstanding options and
        warrants were not considered in the determination of the Company's net
        loss per share as their effect was antidilutive. 

    h.  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions - Assets and liabilities
        of the Company's foreign subsidiary are translated at year-end exchange
        rates.  Results of operations are translated using the average exchange
        rates prevailing throughout the year.  Exchange rate changes arising
        from translation are included in the cumulative translation component
        of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign currency
        transactions are included in the net income (loss) for the year.

    i.  Reclassification - Certain amounts in the prior years' financial
        statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
        presentation.

2.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

    The consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 1995
    and 1994 reflect the costs of a fiscal 1994 restructuring plan designed to
    realign the Company's corporate headquarters and field operations to
    increase its overall profitability through the closing of certain branches,
    the elimination of certain marginally profitable product lines and the
    disposal of certain assets.  The fiscal 1994 restructuring charge of
    $939,000 consisted of provisions for termination of certain employment
    contracts, employee severance and benefit settlements of $264,000,
    inventory write-downs for discontinued product lines of $321,000, and the
    abandonment of leased facilities, equipment and other assets of $354,000.
    Additional costs of $91,000 associated with the Company's restructuring
    effort were incurred in fiscal 1995.  Such costs were primarily associated
    with final settlements reached in fiscal 1995 for the termination of
    certain employment contracts, employee severance and benefit arrangements,
    as well as additional related legal fees associated therewith.  As of June
    30, 1995, approximately $127,000 of restructuring charges remain payable
    in accordance with the terms of such settlements.

3.     INVENTORIES

       The Company has recorded a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory

       evaluation of the inventory based on changes in technology and markets.

    a.  On December 31, 1992, the Company entered into a three-year long-term
        revolving credit facility, providing a maximum availability of
        $12,500,000, which replaced a $10,900,000 revolving asset-based loan
        facility (which had an outstanding balance of approximately
        $10,100,000), and restructured a $2,000,000 asset-based term loan.  The
        Company satisfied these outstanding obligations aggregating $12,100,000
        by paying approximately $8,000,000 and converting $1,500,000 to a new
        subordinated term loan collateralized by a second mortgage on its
        corporate headquarters.  The balance of $2,600,000 was forgiven and
        recorded as an extraordinary gain net of related expenses in the
        consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 1993. 
        In connection with this financing, the Company incurred in fiscal 1993
        costs approximating $405,000 which have been accounted for as deferred
        charges and are being amortized through December 31, 1995.  On February
        10, 1995, this credit facility was amended to: (i) extend the expiration
        date to December 31, 1997, (ii) reduce the maximum availability from
        $12,500,000 to $10,000,000, and (iii) provide for termination fees as
        a result of default or early termination of 2%, 1% and .5% of the
        maximum credit if such termination occurs before December 31, 1995,
        December 31, 1996 or December 31, 1997, respectively.  In connection
        with this financing amendment, the Company incurred in fiscal 1995 costs
        approximating $80,000, which have been accounted for as deferred charges
        and are being amortized through December 31, 1997.  Under the terms of
        the credit facility, the Company is required to pay interest at prime
        plus 2 3/4% and a commitment fee of 1/2% per annum on the daily average
        unused portion of the credit.  Under the terms of the agreement,
        borrowings are limited to 80% of eligible accounts receivable
        (constituting those amounts outstanding 90 days or less) and 50% of
        eligible accounts receivable outstanding between 91 and 120 days, and
        40% of regular inventories and 20% of slow moving inventory.  As of June
        30, 1995 and 1994, the Company had $5,406,000 and $5,513,000
        availability under the eligibility terms of the facility, of which
        $4,903,805 and $4,713,180 was outstanding on such dates, respectively. 
        This loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the
        Company not otherwise collateralized.  In connection with its revolving
        credit facility, the Company is subject to restrictive covenants which
        impose certain limitations with respect to the Company's incurrence of

        indebtedness, capital expenditures, creation or recurrence of liens,
        declaration or payment of dividends or other distributions, mergers,
        consolidations and sales or purchases of substantial assets.  In
        general, the Company is not allowed to incur further indebtedness or
        create additional liens on its assets except for unsecured current
        liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or liabilities
        incurred in the ordinary course of business secured by purchase money
        security interest not to exceed an aggregate of $750,000.  The Company
        is not allowed to make loans or investments or provide guarantees or to
        prepay indebtedness.  The Company is prohibited from paying dividends
        and may not enter into a merger, consolidation or sale of all or
        substantially all of its assets.  Additionally, the Company is required
        to maintain consolidated net worth of not less than $750,000 and to
        maintain consolidated working capital, defined as current assets less
        current liabilities and debt outstanding under the credit facility, of
        not less than a negative $1.5 million.  

    b.  On March 31, 1994, the Company satisfied its subordinated asset-based
        term loans and the Industrial Development Agency Bonds aggregating
        $2,080,496 on such date with the $1,200,000 proceeds from a first
        mortgage loan and the issuance of a $100,000 non-interest bearing
        subordinated mortgage loan payable in 24 monthly installments of $4,167
        each commencing March 31, 1994.  As a result of this debt refinancing,
        the Company recorded an extraordinary gain of $747,422 in the
        consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 1994
        net of related expenses of $33,074.
        
       The first mortgage loan is with a group of lenders, and is payable over
       five years in monthly installments of $15,980, inclusive of principal
       and interest at 14%, commencing May 1, 1994, with a final installment
       of principal of $1,033,183 payable on April 1, 1999 and collateralized
       by a first mortgage lien on the Company's corporate headquarters.  In
       connection with such loan, the Company issued to one of the lenders
       250,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable on or before March
       31, 2001 at an exercise price at $.50 per share.  A portion of the
       proceeds of the loan has been allocated to the warrants based on the
       Company's Board of Directors' assessment of their fair value at the time
       of issuance ($.70 per share).  For financial statement purposes, the
       fair value ascribed to the warrants of $175,781 has been deducted from
       the proceeds of the mortgage loan as additional interest expense and is
       being amortized over the term of the mortgage to yield an effective
       interest rate of approximately 20% per annum.  The loans have prepayment
       penalties which are calculated as a percentage of the prepayment amount. 
       The percentage is determined based upon the date of payment as follows:

                   Prepaid                                 Percentage

                Between one and two years                      3%
                Between two and three years                    1%
                Thereafter                                     0%

       The loan contains covenants prohibiting certain types of transactions
       and limiting capital expenditures to $250,000 per annum without the
       prior consent of the lenders.

   c.   On October 18, 1991, the Company received $500,000 in cash from an
        unaffiliated investor group in exchange for a mortgage on certain
        machinery and equipment.  Concurrently, such investor group acquired a
        50.6% interest in the then outstanding issued common stock of the
        Company for $1,000,000 (or $.40 per-share) and was granted a five-year
        warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock for
        $.50 per-share. As described in Note 8n below, such warrants were fully
        exercised in June 1994.  The loan, which bears interest at the rate of
        1-1/4% above the prime lending rate (9.00% and 6.75% at June 30 1995 and
        1994, respectively), was originally due on September 30, 1994; however,
        on April 25, 1994, such due date was extended to September 30, 1995. 
        On December 19, 1994; however, the Company extinguished $394,750 of the
        $500,000 loan balance in exchange for 789,500 shares of the Company's
        common stock.  The Company's Board of Directors and management believe
        based upon a fairness opinion rendered by an independent investment
        banking firm and other analysis, that the fair value of the shares
        exchanged was equal to the carrying amount of the converted portion of
        the loan.  The fairness opinion stated that the exchange was fair to the
        stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view.  The
        remaining $105,250 principal balance of the loan has an amended due date
        of March 31, 1996.  All other terms remain unchanged.

   d.   The Company leases its telephone system under agreements accounted for
        as capital leases.  The obligation for the telephone system requires the
        Company to make monthly payments of $1,963 through December 1997.

   The following is a summary of the aggregate annual maturities of long-term
   debt and capitalized lease obligations:

8.     EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

   a.   In 1989, the Company's Board of Directors approved a non-qualified five-
        year stock option plan under which key employees could be granted
        options to purchase up to an aggregate 115,000 shares of the Company's
        common stock at an option price of $ .10 per share.  Under the terms of
        this plan, options that were cancelled could not be re-issued.  During
        fiscal 1995 and 1993, 10,000 options were cancelled.  In April 1994, the
        plan expired.  During fiscal 1995, 25,000 options were exercised.  As
        of June 30, 1995, options to purchase 12,500 shares of the Company's
        common stock remain outstanding.  These options are held by two ex-
        employees of the Company who exercised such options prior to 
        termination of their employment with the Company.  The Company has not
        issued stock certificates for the exercise of such options because of
        certain disputes between the Company and such ex-employees relating to
        their prior employment with the Company.  The Company can not presently
        determine whether or not the shares underlying such options will be
        issued to such ex-employees.

   b.   In January 1992, the Company's Board of Directors and stockholders
        approved the  1991 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the
        "Plan"), under which current and perspective employees may be granted
        options to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company's
        common stock. The Plan is administered by a committee consisting of
        three members of the Board of Directors.  The committee designates which
        options granted under the Plan are Incentive Options and which are Non-
        Qualified Options. The option price may not be less than the fair market
        value on the date of grant with exceptions required by the Internal
        Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to incentive stock
        options. The shares vest one-third each over three years of employment
        following the date of grant of the option. None of the options issued
        have been exercised.  Under the terms the Plan, options that are
        cancelled may be reissued.  At June 30, 1995, an aggregate of 472,500
        options remain available for grant under the Plan.

            The following is a summary of the activity of the Plan:

   c.   In April 1992, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and issued
        options to purchase an aggregate of 150,000 shares of common stock to
        the members of the Board of Directors at a price of $1.25 per share (the
        fair market value at date of grant) which options expire on May 1, 1997.
        No options have been exercised to date.  During fiscal 1995, 20,000
        options were cancelled upon resignation of a director. As of June 30,
        1995, options to purchase 130,000 shares of the Company's common stock
        remain outstanding.  

   d.   In January 1993, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and issued
        options to purchase an  aggregate of 150,000 shares of the common stock
        to the members of the Board of Directors at a price of $1.13 per share
        (the fair market value at date of grant) which options expire on January
        4, 1998.  No options have been exercised to date.  During fiscal 1995,
        20,000 options were cancelled upon resignation of a director.  As of
        June 30, 1995, options to purchase 130,000 shares of common stock are
        currently outstanding.  

   e.   On February 25, 1993, an officer of the Company purchased 100,000 shares
        of the Company's common stock for $100,000 (representing the fair market
        value at date of purchase) of which $50,000 was paid in cash and $50,000
        in a 6% three-year promissory note.  The interest on this note was
        payable quarterly and the principal of $50,000 was due on February 25,
        1996.  During fiscal 1995, such note was settled for $12,500 and the
        balance was written off.

   f.   On March 4, 1994, the Company completed a series of equity transactions
        whereby the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of its common stock together
        with 2,000,000 common stock purchase warrants for a total of $1,000,000.
        Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock
        for $.50 per-share.  As described in Note 8n below, such warrants were
        fully exercised in June 1994.  One investor who purchased 500,000 shares
        received personal guarantees from members of the Company's Board of
        Directors that in the event the investor would sustain loss from the
        sales of the shares (including the shares obtained through the exercise
        of the warrants) such directors will indemnify the investor at any time
        through February 16, 1996.  Should the guarantors have to perform under
        the terms of the guarantee, the ownership interest in the shares will
        transfer to the guarantors.  During fiscal 1995, such guarantees were
        mutually terminated by the parties thereto.

   g.   On March 28, 1994, pursuant to a consulting/investment banking agreement
        with an underwriter (Note 10b), the Company issued warrants to purchase
        350,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per-
        share (which was not less than the fair market value on such date). 
        Such warrants are fully exercisable and expire five years from date of
        grant.

                            JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993




   h.   On March 31, 1994, pursuant to an employment agreement (Note 10a), the
        Company's president purchased 100,000 shares of the Company's common
        stock for $.50 per-share, representing an amount less than the
        unadjusted quoted market price of the stock on such date.  Consequently,
        the Company recognized compensation expense in the amount of $56,250 for
        the year ended June 30, 1994 representing the difference between the
        unadjusted quoted market price of the stock on such date and the price
        payable per-share.  The shares were purchased by the president with a
        $50,000 non-interest bearing, non-recourse note collateralized by the
        shares issued.

   i.   In March 1994, pursuant to an employment agreement, the Company's
        president was granted an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the
        Company's common stock at an exercise price of $.50 per-share,
        representing an amount less than the unadjusted quoted market price of
        the stock on such date.  The options become exercisable at the rate of
        one-third on each successive anniversary date over three years. 
        Consequently, the Company recorded unearned compensation in the amount
        of $168,750, which will be recognized as compensation expense ratably
        over the employment period of three years: $56,254 and $14,063 have been
        amortized as compensation expense during fiscal 1995 and 1994,
        respectively.  The option expires five years after the date on which the
        options become exercisable.

   j.   On March 31, 1994, in connection with a mortgage refinancing (Note 6b),
        the Company issued 250,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable
        on or before March 31, 2001 at an exercise price of $.50 per share.

   k.   On April 6, 1994, the Company completed additional equity transactions
        by selling 500,000 shares of its common stock together with 500,000
        common stock purchase warrants for a total of $250,000.  Each warrant
        entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock for $.50 per-
        share.  As described in Note 8n below, such warrants were fully
        exercised in June 1994.

   l.   On April 18, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the 1994
        Directors Stock Option Plan.  This plan is intended to assist the
        Company in securing and retaining directors by allowing them to
        participate in the ownership and growth of the Company through the grant
        of stock options.  The persons eligible for the 1994 Directors Stock
        Option Plan are any director who is not a full or part-time employee of
        the Company ("Eligible Director").   The granting of options will give
        the Eligible Directors an additional inducement to remain with the
        Company and will provide them with an increased incentive to work toward
        the Company's success.

        The 1994 Directors Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of up to
        600,000 shares of common stock.  The plan is administered by a committee
        composed of two or more "disinterested" directors of the Company ("Stock
        Option Committee").  The Stock Option Committee has full power and
        authority to designate recipients of the options and to determine the
        terms and conditions of option agreements.  Each option generally vests
        ratably over a three-year period provided such individual continues to 
        serve as a director of the Company, unless such individual no longer 
        serves as a result of his death or disability, in which case the option
        immediately vests.

                               JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993



        On April 18, 1994, three directors of the Company were granted fully 
        exercisable options under this plan to purchase an aggregate of 250,000
        shares of the Company's common stock for a five year period at an 
        exercise price of $.50 per-share representing an amount less than the 
        unadjusted quoted market price of the stock on such date.  Consequently,
        the Company recognized compensation expense in the amount of $156,250 
        for the year ended June 30, 1994 representing the difference between the
        unadjusted quoted market price of the stock on such date and the price 
        payable per share. 

   m.   During November 1993 and April 1994, the Company issued options to
        purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at $1.25 per share (100,000
        options vested immediately and the remaining options vested at the rate
        of 12,500 each month beginning November 1993)  and warrants to purchase
        468,750 shares of common stock at $.50 per share to consultants for
        services provided to the Company.  In connection with these issuances,
        the Company recognized compensation expense in the amount of $369,063
        for the year ended June 30, 1994, representing the estimated relative
        fair market value of the options ($.07 per share) and warrants ($.75 per
        share) on the dates of such issuance as determined by the Company's
        Board of Directors.  As described in Note 8n below, 450,000 of such
        warrants were exercised in June 1994.  The 18,750 unexercised warrants
        expired during fiscal 1995.  The options  expire five years from the
        date of issuance and, as of June 30, 1995, such options are fully
        exercisable.  

   n.   In June 1994, the Company completed the registration of 3,950,000 shares
        of its common stock underlying outstanding common stock purchase
        warrants.  The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale
        of the common stock sold by the selling shareholders.  However, the
        Company did receive $1,415,000 representing the net proceeds from the
        exercise of common stock purchase warrants ($1,975,000 in gross
        proceeds).

   o.   On December 19, 1994, the Company issued 789,500 shares of its common
        stock to extinguish $394,750 of debt (Note 6c).

   p.   On March 31, 1995, the Company issued stock options to the Company's
        president to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
        price of $.50 per share (which amount was not less than the fair market
        value at the date of grant).  Such options are fully exercisable and
        expire on March 31, 2000.  As described in Note 10a below, such options
        were granted in conjunction with the president's employment contract.

9.     INCOME TAXES

       As a result of the Company's fiscal 1995 and 1994 losses and inability to
       realize tax benefits, the Company recorded no tax benefit for the years
       ended June 30, 1995 and 1994.

       Income tax provision (benefit) for the year ended June 30, 1993 consisted
       of the following:

                                                  1993  
                                              ----------

                                                 18,400

                                              ----------
                                              ($  7,600)
                                              ==========



       Deferred taxes recorded in prior years have either reversed or have been
       eliminated by the recognition of net operating losses.

   by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to the loss before taxes
   is as follows:

    The Company anticipates that for the foreseeable future it will continue to
    be required to provide a 100% valuation allowance for the tax benefit of its
    net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences.

    At June 30, 1995, the Company has net operating losses available to
    carryforward of approximately $6,742,000 for tax purposes.  Such net
    operating loss carryforwards expire through fiscal year 2010.  No benefit
    has been recorded for such loss carryforwards since realization cannot be
    assured.

                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                             JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993



    The Company's use of its net operating loss carryforward is limited as the
    Company is deemed to have undergone an "ownership change", as defined in the
    Internal Revenue Code Sec. 382, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1992
    and June 30, 1994. In connection with such net operating loss limitation,
    the Company must obtain a fair valuation of the Company as of the date of
    the ownership change.  Based upon the Company's estimates of fair value,
    approximately $3,504,000 of the Company's total net operating loss of
    $6,742,000 is limited, pursuant to Internal Revenue Sec. 382, to
    approximately $715,000 annually during the carryforward period.


10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
 
    a. Employment agreement

    On March 31, 1994, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its
    newly appointed president which requires total annual minimum compensation
    of $200,000 through March 1997 plus an annual bonus based on a percentage
    of specified levels of achieved net profits.  In addition, the Company's
    president deposited $50,000 with a lender as cash collateral for a portion
    of a loan made to an entity the president previously served as an officer
    and director. The Company had agreed, pursuant to the employment agreement,
    to purchase such cash collateral from its president for $50,000 in the event
    such cash collateral was not released by March 31, 1995 and, in turn, the
    president had agreed to assign to the Company his rights and privileges with
    respect to such cash collateral.  At March 31, 1995, however, the Company
    was released from this guarantee obligation by the president. 
    Contemporaneous with the release, the Company issued to the president stock
    options to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $.50 per
    share (Note 8p).  


    b. Consulting Agreements

    Under the terms of a nonexclusive consulting/investment banking agreement,
    the Company is obligated to pay an underwriter $4,115 per month for 24
    months which commenced in April 1995 for consulting services related to
    investment banking and finance services.
  
    Effective April 1, 1994, the Company entered into a three-year consulting
    agreement with a director for financial/management services.  Under the
    terms of the agreement, the director receives $4,000 per-month.

                              JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993



       c. Leases

       The Company's minimum annual lease commitments under noncancellable
       operating leases for premises at June 30, 1995 are as follows:

         Year ending June 30:
                               1996         $  435,447
                               1997            343,642
                               1998            119,434
                               1999             51,317
                               2000             25,658
                                            ---------- 
                                            $  975,498
                                            ==========
       Rent expense, including related real estate taxes and other operating 
       charges, was approximately $429,230, $541,691 and $736,156 for the years
       ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


11. MAJOR CUSTOMER AND VENDORS

    During fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, one customer accounted for 14.7%, 16.3%
    and  11.4%, respectively, of the net sales of the Company. During fiscal
    1995, one vendor accounted for 15.7% of the Company's product purchases. 
    During fiscal 1994, two  vendors accounted for 10.8% and 12.1% of the
    Company's product purchases.  During  fiscal 1993, two vendors accounted for
    15.3% and 10.1% of the Company's product  purchases.  Although the Company
    believes that it may  be able to obtain competitive products of comparable
    quality from other  suppliers, the loss of certain suppliers could have an
    adverse impact of operations.


12. UNITED KINGDOM OPERATIONS

    The United Kingdom subsidiary was 80% owned by the Company.  On January 10,
    1995, VTX Electronics Corp. purchased the 20% minority shareholder interest
    in Vertex Electronics UK, LTD for approximately $8,400. 


13. EMPLOYEE PENSION, BONUS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

    a. Multi-Employer Pension Plan

    The Company participates in a multi-employer, union-sponsored pension plan
    covering all union employees pursuant to a negotiated labor contract. 
    Pension expense for the defined contribution plan for the years ended June
    30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $61,059, $81,771 and $92,705, respectively.  In
    the event of the Company's withdrawal from the multi-employer, union
    sponsored plan, the Company could be liable for a portion of the plans
    underfunding, if any.

                          JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993



   b. Bonus Plan

   A bonus plan was adopted with respect to fiscal 1993, 1994 and 1995. The
   plan provides additional compensation to senior management employees of the
   Company based on the achievement of specified amounts of pre-tax profits, as
   determined by the Chief Executive Officer with the approval of the Executive
   Committee of the Board of Directors.  No bonuses were awarded for the fiscal
   years ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

   c. Employee Stock Ownership Plan

   In January 1989, the Company began an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
   "Plan").  In October 1993, such plan was cancelled and the assets were
   distributed as stock to the Company.  There were no contributions for the
   years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993.  The Plan covered substantially all
   employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements and who met
   certain service requirements.  The annual contribution to the Plan was
   discretionary as determined by the Company's Board of Directors.  In April
   1995, the underlying stock was sold and distributed to the plan holders.



14. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

    On August 24, 1995, the Company signed a letter of intent in principal to
    merge with CPI Aerostructures, Inc. ("CPI"), a publicly-traded company in
    the commercial/military aircraft business.  Under the terms of the letter,
    shares of the Company's common stock will be converted into shares of CPI
    common stock at a conversion rate of one share of CPI common stock for three
    shares of the Company's common stock, as adjusted for a price guarantee. 
    The agreement may be terminated by the mutual consent of both parties or if
    a definitive Merger Agreement has not been executed by October 15, 1995.  In
    the event either party unilaterally terminates the letter of intent, the
    terminating party shall pay to the other party an amount equal to all of the
    expenses incurred by the other party in connection with the contemplated
    transaction, up to a maximum of $150,000 in the aggregate, plus a break-up
    fee of $250,000.  The merger plan is subject to the negotiation and
    execution of a definitive acquisition agreement, approval of the respective
    Board of Directors and stockholder's of the Company and CPI, and consent of
    lenders, to the extent required.  Subsequent to the signing of the letter of
    intent, certain developments have occurred that may preclude completion of
    the transaction.
