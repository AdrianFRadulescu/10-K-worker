                                    Part I.

Item 1. Business

        Tyco designs and markets, on a worldwide basis, a broad range of toy
        products.

        The Company includes Tyco Toys, Inc. (the Company, Tyco or Tyco Toys)
        and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. Principal
        subsidiaries include Tyco Industries Inc. (Tyco Industries), Tyco (Hong
        Kong) Ltd., Tyco Manufacturing Corp., Tyco Distribution Corp., Tyco
        Manufacturing (Europe) Inc., Tyco Funding I Corp., Tyco Funding II
        Corp., Tyco Toys (UK) Ltd., Matchbox Toys, Ltd., Tyco Toys (France)
        S.A., Tyco Toys (Canada) Inc., Tyco Toys Europe n.v., Tyco Toys
        (Benelux) n.v., Tyco Matchbox (Deutschland) GmbH, Tyco Toys (Espana)
        S.A., Tyco Preschool Toys Inc. (Tyco Preschool), Ensueno-Tyco Toys de
        Mexico, Tyco Services Inc., Universal Product Innovations, Inc., Tyco
        Toys (Switzerland) A.G., Tyco Toys GmbH and Tyco Toys (New Zealand) Pty.
        Ltd.

        Tyco owns a 75% interest in Croner-Tyco Toys Pty., Ltd., an Australian
        Company, and a 50% interest in Rivergate Partnership L.P., an operator
        of warehousing space in Portland, Oregon.

        Tyco also owns interests in foreign joint venture entities including a
        manufacturing entity in Thailand, and three manufacturing entities and
        one tool-making entity in the Peoples Republic of China.

        The Company markets its toys through three separate marketing groups:
        Domestic (Tyco U.S.), International, and Tyco Preschool.

        TYCO U.S.

        In 1995, Tyco's domestic sales rose approximately 3% and the U.S.
        division, which designs and develops most of the toys marketed by the
        Company around the world, improved its operating results for the second
        successive year. An ongoing focus on strengthening the Company's core
        brands and the successful introduction of new toys contributed to the
        improved results of this group in 1995.

        Radio Control
        -------------

        Tyco maintains the largest market share in the radio control toy
        category. In 1995, Tyco's line featured the top selling 6.0V Jet
        Turbo/R/ Rebound 4x4/TM/ and the Harley-Davidson/R/ Radio Control
        Motorcycle. For 1996, Tyco's line will include the 6.0V Jet Turbo
        Dagger/TM/, a three wheeled dragster, the 6.0V Jet Turbo Samurai/TM/
        racing motorcycle, the 9.6V Turbo Mutator/TM/ as well as the return of
        Rebound 4x4/TM/.
<PAGE>
                                                                               2
 
        Matchbox/R/
        -----------

        Matchbox/R/ is among the Company's largest core brands. In 1996, Tyco is
        expanding this line to include Action System/TM/, a new track system
        featuring interconnecting, interchangeable track and traditional
        playsets. In 1995, the line grew by over 5% primarily as a result of the
        Collectibles business and the new Zero G/TM/ action track system. In
        addition, the Company is further developing the Matchbox Collectibles
        business in 1996 by adding new product to the core line of vehicles
        including Peterbilt/TM/ Tractor Trailer replicas and an expansion of its
        fire engine series.

        Large Dolls
        -----------

        The Company is among the market leaders in the large doll category. In
        1996, the Company will market several TV-advertised large dolls
        including a new version of My Newborn Nancy/TM/. Brand new for 1996 are
        the value-priced Baby Wiggles 'n Giggles/TM/, and Milk 'n Cookies
        Baby/TM/. Tyco is also expanding its line of promoted Kenya/R/ African-
        American dolls with Bedtime Kenya/TM/, which comes with a book featuring
        an African-American story, and Hairplay Fun Kenya/TM/, which allows
        girls to create designer hairstyles.

        Magna Doodle/R/
        ---------------

        Magna Doodle/R/ continues to be the number one selling drawing toy
        worldwide. The Company's "try-me" packaging and second year of parent-
        directed advertising helped increase Magna Doodle sales in 1995. In
        1995, the Company also introduced the Magna Doodle/R/ 3-in-1 Play
        Center, a child's table-top desk with three board surfaces for doodling,
        drawing and playing with building blocks. In 1996, the Color
        Doodler/TM/, an erasable color marker board set is being added to the
        line.

        Electric Racing
        ---------------

        Tyco continues to maintain a leading market share in the electric racing
        category. For 1996, the Company will feature 1995's successful Haunted
        Highway/TM/ race set which highlights a monster's rolling eyeball as an
        obstacle and Super Cliff Hangers/TM/ race sets with cars that race up a
        wall, upside down and through a loop. New in 1996 will be Gravity
        Twisting Cliff Hanger/R/ which, along with the existing race sets for
        1996, will offer Tyco's faster Magnum X-3/TM/ cars.

        In 1996 Tyco will be introducing a new concept in racing. Combining
        Tyco's skills in both the radio control and racing categories, the Radio
        Control Speedway/TM/ features two full function radio control trucks and
        a racetrack layout.

        Games   
        -----

        Tyco's core game business growth is based on the continued strength of
        classic games such as Toss Across/R/, Rock em Sock em Robots/R/,
        Jeopardy!/R/, Wheel of Fortune/R/, Magic 8 Ball/R/, Rebound/R/ and
        Kerplunk/R/. In 1996, four new games are being introduced: Pickin
        Chickens/TM/, an action game of collecting chicken eggs; Power Zone/TM/,
        an arcade-like turbo-disk shooting action game; Up for Grabs/TM/, an
        interactive word game; and Game Babies/TM/, a series of action games
        featuring miniature baby-shaped playing pieces.

        View-Master/R/
        --------------

        Tyco's View-Master/R/ line of 3-D viewers continues to hold the dominant
        market share in this category. In 1996, new story reels featuring Disney
        classics like the Hunchback of Notre Dame, 101 Dalmatians and Toy Story,
        along with titles based upon Flipper and Spiderman join the existing
        inventory of titles offered.

        Other Toys
        ----------

        Girls' Toys

        Tyco's line of plush toys has continued to expand in 1995 led by the
        successful introduction of Doodle Bear/TM/. In 1996, Doodle Bear/TM/ is
        further expanded to include Doodle Pets/TM/ and Secret Message Doodle
        Bear/TM/. Two value-priced plush products, Doggie Bag Doggies/TM/,
        little puppies with a unique packaging concept and the Lil' Fursons/TM/
        line of fluffy creatures will be added to the 1996 line. Tyco will also
        offer an electronic talking plush doll in 1996, Real Talkin' Bubba/TM.

        Tyco will be offering a new line of diecast kitchen, food and dining
        miniatures in 1996 called Kitchen Littles/TM/. The line is designed for
        girls' role-playing and is scaled to be compatible with all fashion
        dolls so that the products will also have a place in the fashion doll
        accessory market.

        Activity Toys

        Tyco's Doctor Dreadful/TM/ 'looks gross, tastes great' playsets were
        very successful in 1995, and an expanded line for 1996 will feature the
        new Doctor Dreadful MD/TM/ line of products. A more conventional cooking
        line is also available with Tyco's Betty Crocker/R/ Watch-It Bake/R/
        Oven and 3-Minute Ice Cream Maker/TM/. In addition, Tyco's line of
        science and crafts sets returns in 1996. Fingernail Fun/TM/, which
        provides for fingernail decorating play, and Scrunch 'n Wear Minis/TM/,
        which allows girls to make the latest fashion hairwear, will also be
        joining the Fashion Magic/R/ girls' activity line.

        Children's Electronics

        In 1996, Tyco will be entering a new category, Children's Electronics.
        The Company's proprietary product in this category is TycoVideoCam/TM/,
        a child's video camera. Key features of this product are its $100 retail
        price, which is significantly less than adult video cameras, its point-
        and-shoot, easy-to-use design, and its durability.

        Direct Import

        For 1996, Tyco US will be marketing a line of products offered on a
        letter of credit basis (direct import) which were previously sold by its
        Tyco Playtime division. Certain of the products are lower cost versions
        of Tyco's promoted brand names, for example, Matchbox/R/ or Doodle
        Bear/TM/. In addition, 1996 direct import products will continue to
        include well known dolls from the past, such as Tiny Tears/R/ and Betsy
        Wetsy/R/. A new line of plush toys also will be introduced in 1996 using
        the brand name of the successful direct marketing company, Vermont Teddy
        Bears/TM/.

        TYCO INTERNATIONAL

        In 1996, the Company's International subsidiaries will continue to
        market products developed by the Tyco U.S. business unit as well as, in
        select countries, third-party product. The Company's International
        subsidiaries accounted for approximately 34% of 1995's consolidated
        sales. In order to reduce its operating costs, the Company extensively
        reorganized its International operations in 1995. As part of the
        restructuring, the Company consolidated the marketing and administrative
        functions of its subsidiaries in Germany, France and Benelux into the
        Company's newly created European Headquarters in Belgium. In the United
        Kingdom, the Company consolidated its Tyco and Matchbox operations. The
        Company is also closing its manufacturing facility located in Temse,
        Belgium and its distribution facility located in the United Kingdom.

        TYCO PRESCHOOL

        In 1996, new Sesame Street/R/ toys will be added to the historically
        popular line of Sesame Street products including new plush, talking and
        promotional lines. Tyco Preschool will also expand the product offering
        of its Looney Tunes Lovables/TM/ line, which is based on Warner Bros.'
        characters as toddlers. Two new Sesame Street products, 1-2-3 Melody
        Keys/TM/ and Tickle me Elmo/TM/, will be marketed with television
        advertising in 1996.

        During 1995, the Company also restructured its Tyco Playtime Unit
        whereby its non-preschool products and certain administrative functions
        were consolidated into Tyco U.S. As part of the program, Tyco Playtime
        was renamed Tyco Preschool with its focus on the profitable long-term
        growth of the preschool business, primarily Sesame Street/R/ toy
        products. In connection with this focus, Children's Television Workshop
        (CTW), designated the Company as its primary toy licensee in June 1995.
        Under the terms of the agreement, Tyco will nearly double the number of
        Sesame Street/R/ product categories, including the plush toy category.
        The Company was also awarded the rights to several additional categories
        including pop-up toys, figurines, talking phones, and diecast vehicles.

                                                                               5
        Seasonality and Backlog



        The toy industry is highly seasonal due to heavy consumer demand for toy
        products during the December holiday season. Traditionally, orders
        received by toy manufacturers in the first six months range between 55%
        to 90% of total calendar year orders, while shipments for that period
        represent 30% to 40% of the year's total. Due to these significant
        fluctuations, the results of operations for any quarterly period are not
        necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year.

        The timing of orders is largely influenced by the degree of consumer
        demand for a product line, inventory levels at retailers, marketing
        strategies and overall economic conditions. The Company's fulfillment of
        its order backlog is dependent upon manufacturing capacity and the
        extent to which orders may be received and/or cancelled due to changes
        in consumer demand. There can be no assurance that cancellations will
        not reduce the amount of net sales realized from the fulfillment of
        backlog orders.

        Design and Development

        The Company is engaged in a continuing product development and packaging
        design program. The Company spent $20,740,000, $17,519,000 and
        $19,062,000 in the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
        respectively, for this program. The Company employs its own designers,
        artists, model makers, and product engineers, and also utilizes
        independent inventors who submit their ideas and designs. Typically, the
        Company acquires exclusive rights from inventors to market such items
        under agreements which provide for royalty payments to the designer or
        inventor for varying periods.

        Marketing and Distribution

        The Company markets its products in the United States to large retail
        chains, wholesalers and independent retailers through full-time salesmen
        and several independent sales representative organizations. The Company
        markets its products internationally in various foreign countries
        through its subsidiaries and licensees. International sales accounted
        for approximately 34%, 40% and 41% of the Company's sales in the three
        years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

        For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, approximately 62%,
        59% and 54%, respectively, of the Company's net sales were attributable
        to its ten largest customers. For the years ended December 31, 1995,
        1994 and 1993, Toys "R" Us, Inc. (Toys "R" Us), a chain of retail toy
        stores, accounted for 25%, 27% and 24%, respectively, of Company
        revenues. During the three years ended December 31, 1995, Wal-Mart
        Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), a chain of discount stores, accounted for
        approximately 13%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of net sales. No other
        customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during these periods.
        The Company's business would be adversely impacted in the event that it
        lost either Toys "R" Us or Wal-Mart as a customer. The Company believes,
        however, that its relationships with Toys "R" Us and Wal-Mart are good
        and it has no reason to expect such a development.

        The primary competitive factors with respect to the Company's products
        are consumer identification, price, play-value and quality of
        manufacturing. The Company utilizes a high level of product promotion
        primarily through advertising in order to retain consumer recognition
        of, and commercial success for, its product lines. The Company's
        advertising program is similar to other companies in the toy industry in
        that most of its advertising budget is allocated to children-oriented
        television programming. In 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company's
        expenditures for marketing, advertising and promotion were approximately
        23%, 23% and 25% of net sales, respectively.

        Trademarks

        The Company markets its products under a variety of trademarks, some of
        which are not owned by the Company and for which the Company pays a
        royalty. In 1995, the most important of these were Tyco/R/, View-
        Master/R/, 9.6V Turbo/R/, Matchbox/R/, Doctor Dreadful/TM/, 6.0V Jet
        Turbo Rebound/TM/, Doodle Bear/TM/ and Kenya/R/, all of which are owned
        by the Company, and the licensed trademarks, Sesame Street/R/, Kitty
        Kitty Kittens/R/, Looney Tunes/R/, Magna Doodle/R/ and Harley-
        Davidson/R/.

        License agreements for certain trademarks require minimum guaranteed
        royalty payments over the term of the license. Reference is made to note
        10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

        Competition

        The toy industry is highly competitive. Some of the Company's
        competitors are significantly larger firms which have greater financial
        resources than the Company.

        The Company holds the leading market share in several of its product
        categories, including radio control vehicles, electric racing, drawing
        toys, and 3-D viewers. Other major product categories in which the
        Company holds a significant market share include diecast vehicles, plush
        toys, activity toys, action games and dolls.

        Manufacturing and Suppliers

        Tyco (Hong Kong) Ltd. negotiates with factories throughout the Orient
        for the manufacture of various Tyco products. Products obtained by Tyco
        (Hong Kong) Ltd. are shipped to facilities of the Company or its
        licensees where they are packaged and/or distributed. The Company's
        radio control toy products are manufactured in the Orient exclusively by
        Taiyo Kogyo Co., Ltd., a company in which Tyco holds an 18.5% ownership
        interest. Reference is made to note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
        Financial Statements. The View-Master product line is manufactured in
        Beaverton, Oregon. The Matchbox product line is manufactured primarily
        at joint venture facilities in Thailand and the People's Republic of
        China. The Company's suppliers utilize manufacturing facilities located
        in China, Hong Kong and other Asian countries. The Company could be
        adversely affected by political or economic disruptions affecting
        businesses in or trade
<PAGE>
                                                                               7


        with such countries. The most favored nation (MFN) status for China was
        extended until June 1996. If the United States Congress were to override
        such extension or place significant conditions on MFN status for China
        or if such MFN status should terminate for any other reason, the result
        would be the imposition of burdensome duties on toys made in China and
        imported into the United States. The European Community has also imposed
        limitations on the importation of Chinese products. To date, such
        regulations have not materially affected the Company.

        The Company believes that it has the ability to develop, over a period
        of time, adequate alternative sources for the products obtained from its
        present foreign suppliers should such alternative sources be required.
        However, if the Company is prevented from acquiring products from its
        joint venture partners and suppliers in the Far East, the Company's
        operations would be seriously disrupted, resulting in a significantly
        adverse financial impact. The Company maintains close contact with its
        subcontractors in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan,
        Thailand and Indonesia through its employees in various Far East
        locations.

        Packaging, plastics, and other raw materials essential to the production
        and marketing of toy products are currently in adequate supply. The
        Company does not anticipate shortages of raw materials in the
        foreseeable future.

        Employees

        As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately 2,200
        people, including approximately 1,000 in various foreign countries. In
        the opinion of management, the Company has good working relations with
        its employees.

Item 2. Properties

        The Company leases a total of 1,400,000 square feet for its operations
        and administrative offices. The Company believes that its facilities are
        suitable for its business needs at the present time and for the
        immediate future.

Item 3. Legal

        Reference is made to note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

        No matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of 1995 to a vote of
        security holders through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

        Stockholders

        As of March 15, 1996, the number of shareholders of Tyco common stock
        was approximately 24,500.

        Dividends

        Total cash dividends declared on common stock during 1993 were
        $2,531,000. During 1994 and 1995, the Company was precluded from paying
        cash dividends pursuant to restrictions under its principal credit
        facilities. The new credit facilities entered into with General Electric
        Capital Corporation and affiliates on February 24, 1995 restrict the
        Company's ability to pay cash dividends until the Company achieves a
        defined level of tangible net worth. Reference is made to note 5 of the
        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The terms of the Company's
        6% Series B Voting Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock, 10.125%
        Senior Subordinated Notes and 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes also
        have limitations on the payment of dividends by the Company.

        The Company was required to pay stock dividends on its preferred stock.
        Dividends issued in shares of preferred stock in lieu of cash during
        1995 and 1994 were $3,200,000 and $2,157,000, respectively.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Year Ended December 31, 1995 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1994


The Company markets its toys through three separate groups:  Domestic,
International and Tyco Preschool (certain previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 1995 presentation).  Net sales were $709,109,000
in 1995 compared to $753,098,000 in 1994, a decrease of $43,989,000 or 5.8%.  In
the Company's Domestic unit, sales increased $11,783,000 or 3.1% to
$386,058,000.  Sales of Radio Control products (12.3% increase), led by the new
Rebound/TM/ product, Matchbox products (5.5% increase) particularly Collectibles
and Drawing toys (9.6% increase), contributed to the majority of the sales
growth.  International sales, however, decreased in 1995 to $242,090,000 from
$289,141,000 in the prior year.  This decrease was primarily attributable to
weaker sales in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and
the Benelux Countries, which collectively represented over $50 million in
reduced sales and offset increases in the Company's other International
operations.  The sales decrease in the United Kingdom and Benelux were primarily
attributable to discontinued product lines (e.g. action figures).  In Germany
and France, the weak retail environment, particularly with respect to radio
control and Matchbox products, together with certain inefficiencies resulting
from the Company's restructuring program contributed to the sales declines.
Sales of the Company's Tyco Preschool products were $84,171,000 in 1995, a
$7,208,000 reduction from the 1994 level primarily as a result of reduced sales
of non-Sesame Street(R) products.

                                                                              12

Gross profit was $292,873,000 in 1995 compared to $307,704,000 in 1994, a
decrease of $14,831,000 or 4.8%, primarily due to the reduced sales volume.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased marginally to 41.3% from
40.9% in 1994.  Domestic margins improved by approximately 2% and International
margins remained relatively unchanged.  Preschool margins, however, declined by
approximately 6.0%.  Domestic margins improved for the year primarily as a
result of reduced duty costs.  Reduced margins in the Preschool business reflect
increased tooling and royalty costs coupled with increased vendor costs for
plastic resin.  By year end 1995, resin costs had declined substantially from
mid-year levels.

Total operating expenses in 1995 were $295,155,000, representing an $11,914,000
improvement over the prior year despite a current year restructuring charge of
$8,900,000.  This reduction reflects the Company's continued cost containment
efforts.  On a business unit basis, Domestic operating expenses decreased
slightly.  Internationally, operating expenses were reduced by $12,090,000 over
1994.  Approximately 70% of this reduction reflects volume-related reduced
marketing costs with the remainder attributable to the Company's restructuring
and streamlining initiatives.  In the Preschool business, a $3,758,000 or 16%
reduction in operating expenses was achieved.

During the second quarter of 1995, the Company adopted a restructuring program
focused on reducing the overhead costs of its European, United Kingdom and Tyco
Playtime units.  The restructuring program resulted in a pre-tax charge of
$4,900,000 and is expected to generate annual savings in excess of $10,000,000
through the combined effect of job eliminations, facility consolidations and
streamlined operations.

The program included the elimination in 1995 of approximately 10% of the
Company's worldwide salaried workforce. As part of the restructuring, the
Company consolidated the marketing and administrative functions of its
subsidiaries in Germany, France and Benelux into the Company's European
Headquarters in Belgium. In the United Kingdom, the Company consolidated its
Tyco and Matchbox operations. The restructuring also included a reorganization
of the Tyco Playtime unit whereby its non-preschool products and certain
administrative functions were consolidated into Tyco U.S. As part of the
program, Tyco Playtime was renamed Tyco Preschool with its focus on the
profitable long-term growth of the preschool business, primarily Sesame
Street(R) toy products. The reduction in workforce included the elimination of
72 positions in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and 61 positions at
Tyco Preschool and Tyco U.S. The charge consisted primarily of approximately
$3,000,000 in termination and other employee benefits, $1,300,000 of facility
consolidation costs and lease termination payments, and an approximate $300,000
non-cash write-off of assets. The program was substantially completed as of
December 31, 1995.

During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company adopted an additional
restructuring program to further reduce European operating expenses.  As part of
this restructuring program, the Company will be closing its manufacturing
facility located in Temse, Belgium and its distribution facility located in the
United Kingdom.  The program resulted in a pre-tax charge of $4,000,000 and is
expected to generate annual savings primarily from reduced product costs
resulting from the transfer of production to lower cost sources in the Far East
and Portland.  Approximately 75 positions have been eliminated as a result of
this restructuring.  The program is expected to be substantially completed by
April 1996.  The fourth quarter charge consisted primarily of termination
benefits which totalled $3,500,000.

As of December 31, 1995, $4,434,000 of the 1995 restructuring charges (primarily
termination benefits) were reflected in accrued expenses.

During 1994, the Company recorded a $4,700,000 pre-tax charge related to
additional costs to close its Italian subsidiary, including legal costs
associated with the lawsuit filed by the former managing director of Tyco Italy
against the Company (see note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).

Interest expense decreased $2,887,000 to $28,026,000 in 1995 due to reduced bank
amendment fees and lower average borrowing rates.  Total average borrowings were
$235,909,000 in 1995 with an average borrowing rate of 10.9% compared to average
borrowings of $235,560,000 with an average borrowing rate of 11.6% in 1994.
Excluding long-term debt, average short-term borrowings were $89,501,000 and
$90,015,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively, with maximum seasonal borrowings of
$170,122,000 and $156,971,000, respectively.

Other income in 1995 included a gain of approximately $2,500,000 resulting from
the Company's sale of its distribution rights for Kidsongs music videos.  The
sale was made in conjunction with the Company's increased focus on the continued
development of its core brands.

Realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions were $250,000 in
1995 compared to a loss of $3,138,000 in the prior year which included an
approximate $2,000,000 loss with respect to the December 1994 devaluation of the
Mexican peso.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company had domestic net operating loss
carryforwards of $76,493,000.  These net operating loss carryforwards are
available to reduce the Company's future taxable income and expire in the years
2008 through 2010.  The Company also has net operating loss carryforwards of
$47,500,000 related to preacquisition loss carryforwards of Matchbox.  The
Matchbox net operating losses are subject to an annual limitation and can only
be used to offset taxable income of the Matchbox domestic companies.  These net
operating losses expire during the years 2001 through 2004.

The reconciliation of the Company's loss before taxes for financial statement
purposes to domestic taxable loss for the three years ended December 31, 1995 is

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), the Company is required to record a net deferred tax
asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, as
well as for other temporary differences, if realization of such benefits is more
likely than not.  Based on the weight of available evidence, management has
concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company's future taxable
income (by taxing jurisdiction) will be sufficient in the carryforward period to
realize a tax benefit on certain of its temporary differences.  Accordingly, the
Company has recorded a benefit on that portion of its temporary differences,
including net operating loss carryforwards which will more likely than not be
realized prior to their expiration dates.
<PAGE>
 
                                                                              14

Management believes that the Company's future taxable income will be at a level
sufficient to fully utilize the 1995, 1994, and 1993 domestic net operating loss
carryforwards and other temporary differences.  Annual domestic pre-tax income
(as adjusted for changes in temporary differences, certain permanent items,
nonrecurring charges and other appropriate adjustments) for the four year period
ending December 31, 1995 averaged approximately $2,600,000.  This level of
domestic taxable income, if earned each year over the carryforward period, would
not be sufficient to realize approximately $13,000,000 of the tax benefits
represented by the net domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
and other temporary differences prior to their expiration.  SFAS 109 includes
the consideration of tax planning strategies in the determination of the amount
of valuation allowance needed.  Through the use of an appropriate tax planning
strategy, which management would implement to prevent the expiration of tax
benefits, an additional $3,500,000 of annual domestic taxable income would be
realized.  This additional taxable income, when added to the above average
income, would be sufficient to fully realize the tax benefits represented by the
net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences prior to their
expiration.  If no tax planning strategies were implemented, adjusted average
annual domestic pre-tax income would have to grow at an average annual compound
rate of 8% in order to fully realize the tax benefits prior to their expiration.

Management believes that taxable income over a four-year period represents the
cyclical pattern of the Company's core business.  The Company's core business
includes product lines with lives exceeding three years.  These core products
appear in the Company's product line from year to year in their base form with
some modifications.  During 1995, sales of core products approximated 70% of
sales.

Based on the Company's core product line and expanded non-core or promotional
product line, as well as the Company's prior history of earnings, management
anticipates that the Company will be able to return to profitability.
Management believes that the Company's domestic subsidiaries' royalty
arrangements with its international subsidiaries will contribute to future
domestic profitability.

While management expects the Company to return to profitability, future levels
of operating income are dependent upon general economic conditions, including
competitive pressures on sales and profit margins, and other factors beyond the
Company's control.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that sufficient
taxable income will be generated to allow full utilization of the net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards and other temporary differences.  Management
has considered these factors in reaching its conclusion that it is more likely
than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain net
operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences prior to their
expiration.

Valuation allowances totalling $82,207,000 have been established due to
management's analysis indicating that certain tax credit and net operating loss
carryforwards, the use and life of which are limited under the income tax laws,
may expire prior to their full utilization.  The valuation allowances include
$16,168,000 related to the preacquisition net operating losses of Matchbox.  Any
subsequently recognized benefits related to these net operating losses will be
allocated to reduce goodwill.

The Company also has general business and foreign tax credit carryovers of
$625,000 and $7,101,000, respectively.  The Company's future federal income tax
liability can be reduced by the general business tax credits through the year
2009 and by the foreign tax credits through the year 2000.  These credits expire
as follows (in thousands):

Additionally, the Company's international subsidiaries had, in the aggregate,
approximately $112,143,000 of tax loss carryforwards available at December 31,
1995.  These tax losses are available to reduce the originating subsidiary's
future taxable income and have varying expiration dates.

The Internal Revenue Service has examined the consolidated federal income tax
returns of Tyco Toys, Inc. for the fiscal years ended August 31, 1987 through
August 31, 1990.  The Company reached a settlement that did not materially
affect the results of operations (including realization of net operating losses
and tax credit carryforwards), financial condition or liquidity of the Company.

Additionally, the consolidated federal income tax returns of Tyco Toys, Inc. for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 1990 through December 31, 1992 are presently
being examined by the Internal Revenue Service.  While the final outcome of this
examination is not determinable at this time, management of the Company believes
that any proposed adjustments, if sustained, will not materially affect the
financial condition, results of operations (including realization of net
operating loss carryforwards) or liquidity of the Company.

Year Ended December 31, 1994 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1993

Net sales were $753,098,000 in 1994 compared to $730,179,000 in 1993, an
increase of $22,919,000 or 3.1%.  In the Domestic unit, sales increased
$36,616,000 or 10.8% to $374,275,000.  Sales of activity toys, led by the new
Dr. Dreadful product line, contributed to a majority of the sales increase.  A
more than 30% increase in Matchbox-related product which included the
Collectibles lines, a 50% increase in games sales and a 6% increase in girls'
toys also contributed to the sales growth.  Within the girls' category,
increases in plush product sales offset declines in the large doll and The
Little Mermaid lines.  International sales decreased slightly in 1994 to
$289,141,000 from $295,354,000 in the prior year.  The Company's continued
worldwide focus on development of its core product lines resulted in a 50%
increase in radio control and a 30% increase in View-Master sales
internationally.  These increases offset an approximate $60,000,000 aggregate
decrease in promotional toy lines including The Incredible Crash Dummies, The
Little Mermaid and Thunderbirds.  The 1994 results also included approximately
$20,000,000 of close-out sales as the Company focused on aggressive inventory
reduction.  Sales of the Company's Playtime product lines were $91,379,000 in
1994, a more than $13,000,000 reduction from the 1993 level.  Delays in the
market availability of new products, primarily based upon the popular Sesame
Street license, caused this sales decrease.  However, by the fourth quarter of
1994, these delays were eliminated and sales during that quarter were
approximately 6% above the comparable quarter in 1993.

Gross profit was $307,704,000 in 1994 compared to $293,538,000 in 1993, an
increase of $14,166,000 or 4.8%, primarily due to higher sales volume in 1994.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 40.9% from 40.2% in 1993
as the higher margin Domestic business experienced an approximate 5% increase
which was substantially offset by an approximate 5% decrease in International
margins.  Domestic percentage margins improved primarily as a result of lower
obsolescence provisions reflected in 1994 results compared with higher
obsolescence levels recorded in the prior year.  Also contributing to the margin
improvements was the 1994 introduction of the Dr. Dreadful product line.  In the
International business unit, approximately half of the 5% reduction in gross
profit margin was related to the Company's inventory reduction program.  The
change in the product mix contributed to the remainder of the margin decrease.
Playtime 1994 gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged from
1993.

                                                                              16

Total operating expenses in 1994 were $307,069,000, representing a more than
$43,000,000 improvement over the prior year.  Operating expenses, net of
restructuring and other special charges, decreased by $19,869,000 despite a
$22,919,000 increase in sales.  This reduction reflects the Company's continued
cost containment efforts.  On a business unit basis, Domestic operating expenses
remained virtually unchanged as a 4% increase in marketing, advertising and
promotional costs required to support the 9.7% sales increase was offset by
reduced selling and administrative expenses.  Internationally, continued cost
reduction and streamlining initiatives resulted in an 11% reduction in operating
expenses.  In the Playtime business, a $6,400,000 improvement, or more than 20%,
was achieved through a reduction in all operating expense categories.

During 1994, the Company recorded a $4,700,000 pre-tax charge related to
additional costs to close its Italian subsidiary, including legal costs
associated with the lawsuit filed by the former managing director of Tyco Italy
against the Company (see note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).  In 1994, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with an
Italian distributor to market the Company's products in Italy.  The Company is
entitled to minimum royalty payments in accordance with this agreement.  During
1993, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges aggregating
$28,214,000, of which $22,238,000 were non-cash in nature.  The restructuring
plan was based upon consolidations of Company subsidiaries in Germany and
Australia, the planned sale of the Company's Italian subsidiary, as well as the
integration of the two separate Playtime operations in the U.S. and Hong Kong.
The charges also included severance of $3,721,000 and facility consolidation
costs totalling $2,255,000.  The restructuring program and related cash payments
were completed in 1994.

Interest expense increased $7,426,000 to $30,913,000 in 1994, reflecting
increased bank interest associated with greater utilization of the Company's
credit facilities and the payment of bank amendment fees.  Total average
borrowings were $235,560,000 in 1994 with an average borrowing rate of 11.6%
compared to average borrowings of $218,167,000 with an average borrowing rate of
10.3% in 1993.  Excluding long-term debt, average short-term borrowings were
$90,015,000 and $72,594,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively, with maximum
seasonal borrowings of $156,971,000 and $112,056,000, respectively.

Realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions decreased to
$3,138,000 in 1994 from $3,746,000 in the prior year.  The 1994 loss, however,
included approximately $2,000,000 from the devaluation of the Mexican peso in
December 1994.

Financial Condition and Liquidity
- ---------------------------------

Year Ended December 31, 1995 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1994

For the year ended December 31, 1995, cash and cash equivalents decreased
$2,872,000 to $27,604,000.  Non-cash depreciation and amortization of
$37,021,000 and a significant reduction in receivables ($17,824,000) and
inventories ($16,040,000) more than offset the $27,229,000 net loss and
contributed to $40,219,000 in cash generated from operating activities.  The
cash provided by the Company's operating activities along with available cash
balances were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $15,959,000, to
repay $17,779,000 of short-term debt, and to provide for the fees and expenses
associated with the Company's New Credit Facilities.  The effect of foreign
exchange rate translation for the year ended December 31, 1995 accounted for a
$3,849,000 reduction in cash.

New Credit Facilities

In February and March 1995, the Company entered into $290,000,000 of new credit
facilities (the New Credit Facilities).  The New Credit Facilities consist of
three separate three-year revolving credit facilities with General Electric
Capital Corporation and affiliates in an aggregate amount of $90,000,000 and a

                                                                              17

discussion of these facilities).  Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities
were used to refinance outstanding indebtedness under the prior principal credit
facility with a bank group led by NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A. and
certain other credit facilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.

Under the terms of the New Credit Facilities, the Company and its subsidiaries
are (1) subject to covenants and conditions relating to the maintenance of net
worth, fixed charge coverage and operating income; (2) restricted from incurring
additional indebtedness or certain obligations and from acquiring any other
entities, whether by asset purchase, merger or otherwise; (3) restricted in the
ability to pay cash dividends on capital stock subject to certain limitations;
and (4) permitted to guarantee additional amounts of debt incurred by certain of
its subsidiaries up to an aggregate of $70,000,000.  During the fourth quarter
of 1995, the Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants
under the New Credit Facilities and received waivers from General Electric
Capital Corporation and affiliates.  The Company has amended the New Credit
Facilities to reflect revisions to its financial covenants.  As a result of the
amendment, the interest rate on the facilities was increased by .25% beginning
in 1996.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company have
agreements with various banks which provide for credit extensions of
approximately $35,764,000 and $65,483,000, respectively.  Short-term borrowings
under these facilities were $15,503,000 and $24,216,000, at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.  Borrowings under these agreements are subject to a
variety of terms and conditions, including collateral requirements.  These
subsidiaries also had outstanding letters of credit aggregating $7,826,000 and
$15,534,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The Company has the following sources of liquidity to support the cyclical
working capital requirements of its business:  existing cash balances and
related interest earnings, internally-generated funds, available borrowings
under foreign lines of credit and the credit facilities with General Electric
Capital Corporation, and proceeds from potential equity or debt offerings.  The
Company believes that its existing credit facilities as amended and internally-
generated funds will provide adequate financing for its current and foreseeable
levels of operation.

Dividends

During 1995 and 1994, the Company was precluded from paying cash dividends
pursuant to restrictions under its bank credit facilities.  Dividends declared
on common stock were $2,531,000 in 1993.  The New Credit Facilities restrict the
Company's ability to pay cash dividends until the Company achieves a defined
level of tangible net worth.  Reference is made to note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The terms of the Company's 6% Convertible
Exchangeable Preferred Stock, 10.125% Senior Subordinated Notes and 7%
Convertible Subordinated Notes also have limitations on the payment of dividends
by the Company.

During 1995, the Company was permitted to issue additional shares of Preferred
Stock in lieu of cash dividends.  Preferred Stock dividends valued at $3,200,000
and $2,157,000 were issued in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Commitments

Guaranteed Royalties

The Company markets its products under a variety of trademarks, some of which
are not owned by the Company and for which the Company pays a royalty.  For the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company incurred $33,016,000,
$33,079,000 and $33,036,000 in royalty expense, respectively.  Certain license
agreements require minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of the
license.  At December 31, 1995, the Company is committed to pay total future
minimum guaranteed royalties aggregating $88,204,000 which are payable as
follows:  1996 - $14,726,000; 1997 - $11,660,000; 1998 - $12,067,000; 1999-
$12,292,000; 2000 - $12,897,000, and thereafter - $24,562,000.

Guaranteed Purchases

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into guaranteed
purchase agreements with certain suppliers to ensure the timely delivery and
availability of products.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company was committed
for future purchases aggregating $7,701,000 from its suppliers.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The primary focus of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is
to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.  In accordance with this policy, the Company enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and options as hedges of inventory
purchases, and various other intercompany transactions.  The credit risks
associated with the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
options are controlled through the evaluation and monitoring of the
creditworthiness of the counterparties.  Although the Company may be exposed to
losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, the Company does
not expect such losses, if any, to be significant.

At December 31, 1995, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward
exchange contracts totalling $33,141,000 to purchase U.S. dollars.  In January
1996, the Company entered into an additional $32,432,000 of forward contracts
which primarily provide for the purchase of U.S. dollars with foreign
currencies.  The principal currencies being hedged are the Belgian franc,
British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.  Foreign currency forward
exchange contracts and options expire within twelve months.

Legal Proceedings

Italian Litigation

In 1994, the former managing director of the Company's Italian subsidiary
initiated court action against the Company in Italy, alleging breach of a letter
of intent with the plaintiff for the sale of the subsidiary.  The Company is
awaiting the court's decision in this matter.  In the opinion of management and
its outside counsel, the Company has meritorious legal and factual defenses to
the claims made in this litigation, and the outcome is not likely to have a
material adverse impact on the Company's earnings, financial condition or
liquidity.  The Trustee liquidating the Italian subsidiary has also lodged
claims against the former managing director on behalf of the subsidiary.

U.S. Customs
- ------------

In 1992, the U.S. Customs Service issued a penalty notice of an assessment for
lost duty in the amount of $1,500,000, penalties for gross negligence of
$5,800,000, and penalties for fraud of $5,600,000.  All of the claims arise from
activities of the Company's View-Master subsidiary for periods prior to its
acquisition by the Company in 1989.  Management and the Company's outside
counsel are of the opinion that the Company has legal and factual defenses to
the penalty claims made by the U.S. Customs Service, and that the outcome of the
proceedings relating to these claims, which proceedings may be protracted, are
not likely to have a material adverse impact on the earnings, financial
condition or liquidity of the Company.

Environmental Litigation

Tyco Industries, a subsidiary of the Company, is a party to three matters
arising out of waste hauled by a transporter to various sites, including the
GEMS Landfill.  In litigation relating directly to remediation of the landfill,
Tyco Industries has signed a Consent Order and Trust Agreement and made a
settlement contribution of an amount not material to Tyco Industries.  In
another matter, homeowners near the GEMS Landfill have filed class action claims
against approximately 150 defendants, including Tyco Industries, for various
types of unspecified monetary damages, including punitive damages.  In
management's opinion, there are meritorious factual and legal defenses to these
claims.  In the third matter, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection is asserting claims for remediation expenses at a different site in
Sewell, New Jersey used as a waste transfer station by the same transporter
involved in the other two matters.

In the opinion of management of the Company and its outside counsel, none of
these three matters is likely to have a material adverse impact on the earnings,
financial condition or liquidity of the Company.  In addition, the Company will
receive a contribution from a third party towards certain expenses in these
matters.

Other Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's earnings, financial condition or liquidity.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (SFAS 123), which will be adopted by the Company in 1996 as
required by the statement.  The Company has elected to continue to measure such
compensation expense using the method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS
123.  When adopted, SFAS 123 will not have a significant effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations but will require the Company to
provide expanded disclosure regarding its stock-based-employee compensation
plans.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Tyco Toys, Inc.
Mount Laurel, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco Toys, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 14(a)2.  These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Tyco Toys, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion,
such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)  Summary of Accounting Policies
     ------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
- ----------------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in joint ventures and other
companies are accounted for on the equity method or cost basis depending upon
the level of the investment and/or the Company's ability to exercise influence
over operating and financial policies.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity at the date of
purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Short-term investments
included in cash and cash equivalents primarily represent money market funds at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 and are valued at cost, which approximates market
value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
Inventories, net, consist of (in thousands):

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization.  Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is
provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from
10 to 50 years for buildings, 18 months to 10 years for machinery, equipment and
fixtures, the lease term or life of improvements (whichever is less) for
leasehold improvements and the remaining lease term for assets under capital
leases.  Property and equipment, net, consists of (in thousands):

Goodwill
Costs in excess of net assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis
over forty years.  Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $29,141,000 and
$22,731,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Deferred Costs

Patent and trademark costs are deferred and amortized over a period of eighteen
months.  Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related
indebtedness.

Carrying Value of Noncurrent Assets

The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of noncurrent assets,
including goodwill and other intangible assets.  The determination of potential
impairment in carrying value is based upon current and anticipated undiscounted
operating income which the Company has determined to approximate future
undiscounted cash flows.  Recognition of an impairment occurs when it is
probable that such estimated future operating income will be less than the
current carrying value of the asset being evaluated.  Measurement of the amount
of impairment loss, if any, is based upon the difference between the carrying
value of the asset and its estimated fair market value.  The Company must adopt
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"
(SFAS 121), in 1996.  Adoption of SFAS 121 is not expected to have a significant
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recorded as product is shipped, free on board from point of shipment.
The Company provides for defective returns and other allowances as a percentage
of gross sales, based on historical experience.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into
the U.S. dollar at exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Income, expenses
and cash flows are translated at exchange rates prevailing during the year.  The
resulting currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate
component of stockholders' equity.  The Company enters into foreign currency
forward exchange contracts and options as a  hedge against currency
fluctuations.  Realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are included in earnings when incurred, except for those relating to
intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature which are accumulated
in stockholders' equity.  The Company does not speculate in foreign currencies.

Income Taxes

The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), which requires recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse (see note 8).

The Company does not provide deferred federal income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries since such earnings are not expected to be
remitted to the Company in the foreseeable future.  Federal income taxes are
provided currently on that portion of undistributed foreign earnings required to
be included in accordance with the U.S. tax laws.

Net Loss Per Share

Net loss per share is computed by dividing the loss applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year.  Outstanding options, and the Company's
convertible notes and preferred securities were determined to be anti-dilutive
for the three years ended December 31, 1995, and were therefore excluded from
the per share calculations.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates and
assumptions.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" (SFAS 123), which will be adopted by the Company in 1996 as
required by the statement.  The Company has elected to continue to measure such
compensation expense using the method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS
123.  When adopted, SFAS 123 will not have a significant effect on the

                                      F-8
<PAGE>
 
Company's financial position or results of operations but will require the
Company to provide expanded disclosure regarding its stock-based employee
compensation plans.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
1995 presentation.

(2)  Restructuring and Other Special Charges
     ---------------------------------------
During the second quarter of 1995, the Company adopted a restructuring program
focused on reducing the overhead costs of its European, United Kingdom and Tyco
Preschool (formerly Tyco Playtime) units.  The restructuring program is expected
to generate annual savings through the combined effect of job eliminations,
facility consolidations and streamlined operations.  The pre-tax restructuring
charge of $4,900,000 primarily consisted of approximately $3,000,000 in
termination and other employee benefits; $1,300,000 of facility consolidation
costs and lease termination payments; and an approximate $300,000 non-cash
write-off of assets.  The program was substantially completed by December 31,
1995.

During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company adopted an additional
restructuring program to further reduce European operating expenses.  As part of
the restructuring program, the Company will be closing its manufacturing
facility located in Temse, Belgium and its distribution facility located in the
United Kingdom.  The program resulted in a pre-tax charge of $4,000,000 and is
expected to generate annual savings primarily from reduced product costs
resulting from the transfer of production to lower cost sources in the Far East
and Portland.  Approximately 75 positions will be eliminated as a result of this
restructuring.  The program is expected to be substantially completed by April
1996.  The fourth quarter charge consists primarily of termination benefits
which totalled $3,500,000.

As of December 31, 1995, $4,434,000 of the 1995 restructuring charges (primarily
termination benefits) were reflected in accrued expenses.

During 1994, the Company recorded a $4,700,000 pre-tax charge related to
additional costs to close its Italian subsidiary, including legal costs
associated with the lawsuit filed by the former managing director of Tyco Italy
against the Company (see note 10).  In 1994, the Company entered into a five-
year agreement with an Italian distributor to market the Company's products in
Italy.  The Company is entitled to minimum royalty payments in accordance with
this agreement.

During 1993, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges
aggregating $28,214,000, of which $22,238,000 were non-cash in nature.  The
restructuring plan was based upon consolidations of Company subsidiaries in
Germany and Australia, the planned sale of the Company's Italian subsidiary, as
well as the integration of the two separate Playtime operations in the U.S. and
Hong Kong.  The charges also included severance of $3,721,000 and facility
consolidation costs totalling $2,255,000.  The restructuring program and related
cash payments were completed in 1994.

(5)  Notes and Acceptances Payable
     -----------------------------

In February and March 1995, the Company entered into $290,000,000 of new credit
facilities (the New Credit Facilities).  The New Credit Facilities consist of
three separate three-year revolving credit facilities with General Electric
Capital Corporation and affiliates in an aggregate amount of $90,000,000 and a
$200,000,000 five-year domestic receivables securitization facility arranged by
General Electric Capital Corporation.  Borrowings under the New Credit
Facilities were used to refinance outstanding indebtedness under the Company's
prior principal credit facility (the Prior Facility) and certain credit
facilities of foreign subsidiaries.

The revolving credit facilities consist of up to $35,000,000 for certain
domestic entities (of which up to $10,000,000 may be used for letters of
credit), $20,000,000 for Tyco Canada, and $35,000,000 for the Company's
subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (UK).  Availability under the domestic
revolving credit is based upon inventory, as defined, and availability under the
foreign revolving credits is based upon an aggregate of eligible accounts
receivable and inventory, as defined.  The revolving credit facilities are
secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and are
also guaranteed by certain foreign subsidiaries.  Subject to the maximum
commitment under each of these facilities, borrowings are permitted up to 60% of
eligible inventory and, in the Canadian and UK agreements, up to 80% of eligible
accounts receivable.  Interest rates on borrowings are determined at the option
of the borrower based on various indices, including LIBOR or bankers' acceptance
rate, plus 2.5%.


                                      F-10

Under the securitization facility, Tyco Industries and Tyco Manufacturing
Corporation sell substantially all of their accounts receivable to Tyco Funding
I Corporation (TFC I) and Tyco Funding II Corporation (TFC II).  These companies
are bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of Tyco Industries and are consolidated in
the financial statements of the Company.  TFC I and TFC II purchase the accounts
receivable with proceeds from their borrowings under a commercial paper facility
(limited to a maximum of 75% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined) and
certain deferred payments.  The interest rate on the facility is the market rate
for commercial paper plus 1.30%.  The accounts receivable that are sold are
solely the assets of TFC I or TFC II and are pledged as security for their
borrowings.  In the event of liquidation of TFC I or TFC II, the creditors of
TFC I or TFC II would be entitled to satisfy their claims from the assets of TFC
I or TFC II prior to any distribution to Tyco Industries.

At December 31, 1995, total utilization under the New Credit Facilities was
$51,874,000 which included $45,420,000 in borrowings and $6,454,000 in letters
of credit.

Under the terms of the New Credit Facilities, the Company and its subsidiaries
are (1) subject to covenants and conditions relating to the maintenance of net
worth, fixed charge coverage and income; (2) restricted from incurring
additional indebtedness or certain obligations and from acquiring any other
entities, whether by asset purchase, merger or otherwise; (3) restricted in the
ability to pay cash dividends on capital stock subject to certain limitations;
and (4) permitted to guarantee additional amounts of debt incurred by certain of
its subsidiaries up to an aggregate of $70,000,000.  During the fourth quarter
of 1995, the Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants
under the New Credit Facilities and received waivers from General Electric
Capital Corporation and affiliates.  The Company has amended the New Credit
Facilities to reflect revisions to its financial covenants. As a result of the
amendment, the interest rate on the facilities was increased by .25% beginning
in 1996.

The Prior Facility between a subsidiary of the Company and a group of fifteen
banks led by NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A. matured on February 24, 1995.
The Prior Facility consisted of a $155,000,000 short-term revolving credit
facility and a $55,000,000 term-reducing facility with quarterly installment
payments of $3,400,000 which commenced in September 1993.  During April 1994,
the Company prepaid $14,300,000 of the term-reducing facility with part of the
proceeds from the issuance of its preferred stock.  The Company fully repaid its
outstanding obligations under the Prior Facility at maturity.  The Prior
Facility provided for borrowings at various rates to a maximum of 3% over the
prime rate.  At December 31, 1994, total utilization of the Prior Facility
included approximately $53,615,000 of borrowings ($20,300,000 of which
represented the term-reducing facility) and $2,516,000 in letters of credit.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company have
agreements with various banks which provide for credit extensions of
approximately $35,764,000 and $65,483,000, respectively.  Short-term borrowings
under these facilities were $15,503,000 and $24,216,000, at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.  Borrowings under these agreements are subject to a
variety of terms and conditions, including collateral requirements.  These
subsidiaries also had outstanding letters of credit aggregating $7,826,000 and
$15,534,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

were issued subject to the surrender and cancellation of certain outstanding
stock options.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

During 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Company approved the
establishment of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan for certain senior executive
managers of the Company.  Under the Plan, the Company has the authority to issue
up to 2,000,000 restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Units).  This Plan is
designed to supplement the 1992 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan of the Company
through grants of Restricted Stock Units.  Participants are entitled to receive
a prescribed number of shares of Company stock after seven years of continued
employment.  A participant's vesting of Restricted Stock Units can be
accelerated if total return to shareholders exceeds targeted levels.  During
1995, the Company granted 759,000 Restricted Stock Units to senior executive
managers of the Company pursuant to the Plan.  The market price of the stock on
the date of grant was $5.63.  The aggregate fair market value of the Restricted
Stock Units is being amortized to compensation expense over the restriction
period.  Total compensation expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations for 1995 was $464,000.  During 1995, the Company issued 2,342 shares
of Common Stock pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Preferred Stock

On April 15, 1994, the Company issued $50,000,000 of 6% Series B Voting
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) to an investment
group consisting of Corporate Partners, L.P., Corporate Offshore Partners, L.P.,
and the State Board of Administration of Florida, collectively referred to as
the Purchasers.  The $47,000,000 of net proceeds after issuance costs were used
to reduce net borrowings of the Company and for general corporate purposes.

The Preferred Stock has an annual dividend yield of 6% which may be paid in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock through April 15, 1996.  Dividends
issuable in shares of Preferred Stock in lieu of cash during 1995 and 1994
totalled $3,200,000 and $2,157,000, respectively.  The Preferred Stock has a
liquidation value of $1,050 per share and is convertible into shares of common
stock of the Company at a conversion price of $10 per share.  The Company has
the option, at any time, to exchange the Preferred Stock for 6% Convertible
Subordinated Notes.  The Company, at its option, may redeem the Preferred Stock
at any time after April 15, 1997 at an amount equal to 105.25% of the
liquidation value which reduces annually to 100% of the liquidation value in
2004.  On April 15, 2004, the Company is required to redeem all outstanding
Preferred Stock.  The redemption price shall be paid, at the Company's option,
in cash or in shares of common stock.  The Preferred Stock issued to the
Purchasers entitles the holder to vote (on an as-converted basis) with the
common shares as a single class on all matters on which the Company's common
shareholders vote.

The Registration Agreement, dated April 15, 1994, gives the Purchasers demand
and incidental registration rights, as defined, with respect to the Preferred
Stock, common stock issued upon conversion, or notes issued in an exchange for
such Preferred Stock.

Common Stock Dividends

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company declared common stock
dividends aggregating $2,531,000.  As a result of the dividend restrictions
imposed by its credit facilities, the Company was precluded from paying
dividends for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.  The terms of the
Company's Preferred Stock, 10.125% Senior Subordinated Notes and 7% Convertible
Subordinated Notes also have limitations on the payment of cash dividends.

(8)  Income Taxes
     ------------

The Company adopted SFAS 109 as of January 1, 1993.  There was no cumulative
effect on the deferred tax balances as a result of adopting this pronouncement.

In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred income taxes reflect the impact of
temporary differences between values recorded for assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the values utilized for measurement in
accordance with current tax laws.  SFAS 109 requires the Company to record the
net deferred tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if
realization is more likely than not.

Management believes, considering all available evidence, including the Company's
history of earnings from prior years (after adjustments for nonrecurring items,
restructuring charges, permanent differences, and other appropriate adjustments)
and after considering appropriate tax planning strategies, it is more likely
than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in the
appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of certain net operating
losses and future deductible temporary differences.  The total net deferred tax
assets (both current and noncurrent) have been reduced to the amount management
considers realizable by establishing valuation allowances aggregating
$82,207,000.  Based on the weight of available evidence, management has
concluded that more likely than not, its future taxable income will be
sufficient to support the current recognition of total net deferred tax assets
of $41,568,000.

The valuation allowances have been established due to management's analysis
indicating that certain tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, the use
and life of which are limited under the income tax laws, may expire prior to
their full utilization. The valuation allowances include $16,168,000 related to
the preacquisition net operating losses of Matchbox. Any subsequently recognized
benefits related to these net operating losses will be allocated to reduce
goodwill. The net increase of $25,224,000 in the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets in 1995 relates primarily to foreign net operating loss
carryforwards.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company had domestic net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $76,493,000, exclusive of the
Matchbox net operating loss carryforwards discussed below.  These net operating
loss carryforwards are available to reduce future federal taxable income and
expire in the years 2008, 2009 and 2010.  The Company's international
subsidiaries have, in the aggregate, approximately $112,143,000 of tax loss
carryforwards available at December 31, 1995.  These tax losses are available to
reduce the originating subsidiary's future taxable income and have varying
expiration dates.

The Company has general business and foreign tax credit carryovers of $625,000
and $7,101,000, respectively, at December 31, 1995.  The Company's future
federal income tax liability can be reduced by the general business tax credits
through the year 2009 and by the foreign tax credits through the year 2000.
These credits expire as follows (in thousands):

The Company also has nonexpiring alternative minimum tax credits totalling
$1,412,000.  Additionally, as of the October 2, 1992 acquisition date, the
Matchbox domestic companies have regular and alternative minimum tax net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $47,500,000 which may expire
during the years 2001 to 2004.  These Matchbox loss carryforwards are subject to
an annual limitation and can only be used to offset taxable income of the
Matchbox domestic companies.

Accumulated net undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries
included in accumulated deficit were $104,437,000 at December 31, 1995.  The
Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability of $26,002,000 for the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 since
the Company currently does not expect these earnings to be remitted to the U.S.
in the foreseeable future.  A deferred tax liability will be recognized when the
Company expects that it will recover the undistributed earnings in a taxable
manner, such as through receipt of dividends, a loan of the unremitted earnings
to the Company or one of its U.S. affiliates, or a sale of a foreign
subsidiary's stock.

The Internal Revenue Service has examined the consolidated federal income tax
returns of Tyco Toys, Inc. for the fiscal years ended August 31, 1987 through
August 31, 1990.  The Company reached a settlement that did not materially
affect the results of operations (including realization of net operating loss
carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards), financial condition or liquidity of
the Company.

Additionally, the consolidated federal income tax returns of Tyco Toys, Inc. for
the years ended December 31, 1990 through December 31, 1992 are presently being
examined by the Internal Revenue Service.  While the final outcome of this
examination is not determinable at this time, management of the Company believes
that any proposed adjustments, if sustained, will not materially affect the
financial condition, results of operations (including realization of net
operating loss carryforwards) or liquidity of the Company.

(9)  Lease Commitments
     -----------------

The Company leases facilities and equipment under noncancellable operating
leases with terms of up to ten years.  Most leases contain escalation and
renewal clauses and require the Company to pay real estate taxes and utility
charges.  Aggregate rental expense for operating leases was $15,523,000,
$14,945,000 and $14,836,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

Future minimum lease commitments aggregating $65,375,000 are payable as follows:
1996 - $13,239,000; 1997 - $12,183,000; 1998 - $10,100,000; 1999 - $6,847,000;
2000 - $4,914,000 and thereafter - $18,092,000.


(10)  Commitments and Contingencies
      -----------------------------

Letters of Credit

The Company was contingently liable for open letters of credit of approximately
$14,280,000 at December 31, 1995.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The primary focus of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is
to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.  In accordance with this policy, the Company enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and options as hedges of inventory purchases
and various other intercompany transactions.  The credit risks associated with
the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options are
controlled through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the
counterparties.  Although the Company may be exposed to losses in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties, the Company does not expect such losses,
if any, to be significant.

                                      F-18
<PAGE>
 
At December 31, 1995, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward
exchange contracts totalling $33,141,000 to purchase U.S. dollars.  In January
1996, the Company entered into an additional $32,432,000 of forward contracts
which primarily provide for the purchase of U.S. dollars with foreign
currencies.  The principal currencies being hedged are the Belgian franc,
British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.  Foreign currency forward
exchange contracts and options expire within twelve months.

Guaranteed Royalties

The Company markets its products under a variety of trademarks, some of which
are not owned by the Company and for which the Company pays a royalty.  For the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company incurred $33,016,000,
$33,079,000 and $33,036,000 in royalty expense, respectively.  Certain license
agreements require minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of the
license.  At December 31, 1995, the Company was committed to pay total minimum
guaranteed royalties aggregating $88,204,000 which are payable as follows:
1996 - $14,726,000; 1997 - $11,660,000; 1998 - $12,067,000; 1999 - $12,292,000;
2000 - $12,897,000; and thereafter - $24,562,000.

Guaranteed Purchases

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into guaranteed
purchase agreements with certain suppliers to ensure the timely delivery and
availability of product.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company was committed for
purchases aggregating $7,701,000 from its suppliers.

Legal Proceedings

Italian Litigation

In 1994, the former managing director of the Company's Italian subsidiary
initiated court action against the Company in Italy, alleging breach of a letter
of intent with the plaintiff for the sale of the subsidiary.  The Company is
awaiting the court's decision in this matter.  In the opinion of management and
its outside counsel, the Company has meritorious legal and factual defenses to
the claims made in this litigation, and the outcome is not likely to have a
material adverse impact on the Company's earnings, financial condition or
liquidity.  The Trustee liquidating the Italian subsidiary has also lodged
claims against the former managing director on behalf of the subsidiary.

U.S. Customs

In 1992, the U.S. Customs Service issued a penalty notice of an assessment for
lost duty in the amount of $1,500,000, penalties for gross negligence of
$5,800,000, and penalties for fraud of $5,600,000.  All of the claims arise from
activities of the Company's View-Master subsidiary for periods prior to its
acquisition by the Company in 1989.  Management and the Company's outside
counsel are of the opinion that the Company has legal and factual defenses to
the penalty claims made by the U.S. Customs Service, and that the outcome of the
proceedings relating to these claims, which proceedings may be protracted, are
not likely to have a material adverse impact on the earnings, financial
condition or liquidity of the Company.

Environmental Litigation

Tyco Industries, a subsidiary of the Company, is a party to three matters
arising out of waste hauled by a transporter to various sites, including the
GEMS Landfill.  In litigation relating directly to remediation of the landfill,
Tyco Industries has signed a Consent Order and Trust Agreement and made a
settlement contribution of an amount not material to Tyco Industries.  In
another matter, homeowners near the GEMS Landfill have filed class action claims
against approximately 150 defendants, including Tyco Industries, for various
types of unspecified monetary damages, including punitive damages.  In
management's opinion, there are meritorious factual and legal defenses to these
claims.  In the third matter, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection is asserting claims for remediation expenses at a different site in
Sewell, New Jersey used as a waste transfer station by the same transporter
involved in the other two matters.

In the opinion of management of the Company and its outside counsel, none of
these three matters is likely to have a material adverse impact on the earnings,
financial condition or liquidity of the Company.  In addition, the Company will
receive a contribution from a third party towards certain expenses in these
matters.

Other Litigation

The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's earnings, financial condition or liquidity.

(11)  Disclosure About Fair Value of  Financial Instruments
      -----------------------------------------------------

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using
available market information and appropriate methodologies.  However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a
current market exchange.  The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.  The Company believes that the carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities
are a reasonable estimate of their fair values at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Long-term debt - The fair value of the Company's publicly-issued debt is based

on the quoted market prices for that debt.  Interest rates that are currently
available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities are used to estimate fair value for debt issues not quoted on an
exchange.  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of long-term debt are
as follows (in thousands):

held investments of $5,800,000, and $6,100,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, due to the lack of quoted market prices and the excessive cost
involved in determining such fair value.

Foreign currency forward exchange contracts - The Company had commitments under
- -------------------------------------------                                    
foreign currency forward exchange contracts in various foreign currencies
totalling approximately $33,141,000 and $7,400,000 as of December 31, 1995, and
1994, respectively.  Based on quoted market rates, the carrying amounts of these
items approximated their fair value at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

The fair value estimates presented herein were based on pertinent information
available to management of the Company as of December 31, 1995 and 1994.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would have a significant
adverse effect on the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those
dates and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the
amounts presented herein.

                               LEASE AMENDMENT #7

This Lease Amendment made and entered into this 9th day of January, 1996, by and
between 6000 Midlantic Drive Associates, L.P.(the "Lessor") and Tyco Industries,
Inc.(the "Lessee").

Whereas, the Lessor leased certain premises known as 6000 Midlantic Drive, Mount
Laurel, New Jersey (the "Property") to the Lessee pursuant to that certain Lease
Agreement dated September 21, 1992, previously amended on November 11, 1992,
December 18, 1992, January 5, 1993, February 1, 1993, June 16, 1993, and August
6, 1993, the terms and conditions being more particularly described therein (the
Lease Agreement and amendments shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as
the "Lease Agreement").

Whereas, paragraph 24 of the Lease Agreement provides that the Lessee may
terminate the Lease Agreement if, due to foreclosure or sale or otherwise, the
Lessor or its affiliate ceases to be the owner of or managing agent for the

referred to as the ("Termination Option").

Option.

Now therefore, the Lessor and the Lessee wish to further amend the Lease
Agreement, and intending to be bound hereby agree as follows:

1. The Lessee waives the Termination Option, such that if LBHI, its successors
   and/or assigns, due to foreclosure or sale or otherwise, becomes the owner or
   managing agent of the Property, the Lease Agreement shall not be subject to
   termination by the Lessee due to the Lessor's loss of ownership of the
   Property.  Accordingly, the last five (5) lines of paragraph 24 of the Lease
   Agreement are hereby deleted in their entirety.

All other terms and conditions of the original Lease Agreement, shall remain in
full force and effect.

Ex. 10.53

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; Private Securities Litigation
                         Reform Act of 1995

TYCO TOYS, Inc. ("the Company") desires to take full adantage of the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
"Act"), and in order to do so is filing this Exhibit 10.53 as part of its Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995.

From time to time the Company or its officers may issue forward-looking
statements about the Company's sales, profits, operations, liquidity or
prospects. It is important to note that there are a variety of important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or
forward-looking statements issued by the Company. These factors include, among
others, the following.

"(1) The business operated by the Company is in a highly competitive industry,
and the Company's principal competitors are much larger firms; many of the
Company's competitors have financial resources greater than those of the
Company. In addition, the large amounts of capital required to operate the
business of the Company require extensive borrowings, which borrowings
frequently necessitate agreement by the Company to various affirmative and
negative covenants with lenders; these covenants may limit the flexibility of
management in certain respects. The amount and type of financing available to
the Company, changes in that financing and the costs of such financing are also
important considerations which could materially affect the operations results of
the Company in a given year. [See Business and Competition, pages 1 et ff. and
6, Annual Report on Form 10-K for Year Ended December 31, 1995 ("Report").]

    (2) Political or economic disruptions affecting the conduct of business in
countries where the Company or its suppliers employ manufacturing facilities, or
changes in monetary or fiscal policies in those countries, could adversely and
materially affect the Company. For example, the imposition by the US congress of
duties or other burdensome conditions on the importation of children's products
made in the People's Republic of China, or the adoption by the European
Community of additional limitations on the importation of such products, could
materially affect the Company. [See Manufacturing and Suppliers, page 7,
Report.]

(3) As a result of the seasonality of the toy industry, much of the Company's
manufacturing, packaging and distribution must be completed during short time
periods and cannot be spread out evenly on a year-round basis. If the Company
were prevented from acquiring its products from its joint venture partners or
suppliers in the far east, or if issues arise having an effect on

the several joint ventures in which the Company has an interest, significant
adverse financial impact could result, depending on the seriousness of the
disruption or the issue. [See Business, pp. 1 et ff., Report.]

(4) The cost of plastics, plastic resin, packaging and other raw materials or
components could increase or the Company could experience shortages of supply of
such materials; such increases or shortages could affect the profit margins
associated with the Company's products. [See Manufacturing and Suppliers, p. 7,
Report.]

(5) Certain customers account for a disproportionately large share of net sales
of the Company; if any such customer ceased doing business with the Company, or
significantly reduced the amount of their purchases from the Company, the
Company's business could be adversely impacted. Other similar factors which
could have material adverse effects include pressures on the Company to provide
financial incentives to its customers; pressures to reduce the price or change
the terms of sale of the Company's products and the effects of such changes on
the Company's profit margins; changes in the rate of growth associated with
consumer purchases of the Company's products; decisions of third parties, such
as retailers, relating to the price and promotion of the Company's products.
[See Marketing and Distribution, p. 6, Report, and note 12, p. F-21 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements ("Notes").]

(6) The Company has traditionally enjoyed good working relations with its
employees throughout the world; labor strife or work disruptions could have a
material adverse impact on the Company. Other factors of this type which could
have a material effect include manufacturing constraints, production
inefficiencies, higher costs of production and underutilization of manufacturing
capacity. [See Employees, p. 7, Report.]

(7) Consumer identification, play-value, price and the quality of manufacturing
are all important factors with respect to the Company's products; in addition,
the Company uses a high degree of product promotion, primarily through
advertising, for commercial success of its products. The toy industry is subject
to a constant need for creating and developing new products, which frequently
are successfully marketed for only one or two years. Changes in consumer
behavior patterns (which can occur quickly), including the potential for
decrease in consumer demand for products which are seasonal in nature, or the
imposition of additional restrictions on children-oriented television
programming and advertising could adversely affect the Company. [See Seasonality
and Backlog, p. 5 and Marketing and Distribution, pp. 5-6, Report.]

(8) The Company markets its products under a variety of trademarks, including
some owned by third parties and covered by license agreements; certain license
agreements require minimum guaranteed royalty payments regardless of the actual
sales of the products in question. In addition, the inability of a particular
licensed product or line of products to achieve a level of sales large enough to
support the required minimum guarantee payments could adversely affect the
Company's ability to retain the trademark license for that product or line. [See
Trademarks, page 6, Committments - Guaranteed Royalties, p. 19, Report and also
note 10, page F-18, Notes.]

(9) The cost of acquisition by the Company of tangible and intangible assets,
and changes in the tax laws, regulations or rates applicable to such
acquisitions. [See pp. 14-16, Report.]

(10) Difficulties which may be experienced by the Company in the testing,
development, production or marketing of new products. [See Design and
Development, p. 5, Report.]

(11) The toy industry is highly competitive and barriers to entry are not
significant. Increased competition may occur within categories in which the
Company enjoys a substantial market share. [See Competition, p. 6, Report.]

(12) The level of expenses associated with selling, distribution and
administrative activities of the Company, growth in such expenses, and the
impact of unusual items resulting from the ongoing evaluation by the Company of
its organization and strategy. [See Management Discussion and Analysis, pp. 12
et ff., Report.]

(13) Changes to the compensation and benefit plans at the Company, and changes
in the accounting policies and the results of their application to the Company.
[See note 1, pp. F-6 et ff., Notes.]

(14) The ability of the Company to engage in hedging activities against various
foreign currencies. [See Foreign Exchange Risk Management, p. 19, Report.]

(15) The costs of legal and administrative proceedings involving the Company or
its subsidiaries. [See Legal Proceedings, pp. 19-20, Report, and note 11, pp. F-
18,19, Notes.]

*  For the calculation of loss per share, the inclusion of the assumed exercise
   of options for the three years ended 1995, 1994 and 1993 did not result in a
   dilutive effect and were therefore excluded from the per share calculations.

** Fully diluted loss per share is not presented in the Consolidated Statements
   of Operations as the assumed conversion of the Company's Convertible
   Preferred Stock and Convertible Subordinated Notes is anti-dilutive.
