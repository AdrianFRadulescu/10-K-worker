                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
  (A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.
 
     The  Warnaco Group, Inc. ('Company'), a Delaware corporation, was organized
in 1986 for the purpose of acquiring Warnaco Inc. ('Warnaco') a publicly  traded
apparel  company. As a result,  Warnaco became a wholly  owned subsidiary of the
Company. The Company designs, manufactures and  markets a broad line of  women's
intimate  apparel, such as bras, panties  and sleepwear, and men's dress shirts,
neckwear, sportswear, underwear,  accessories and  small leather  goods, all  of
which  are sold under a variety of internationally recognized owned and licensed
brand names. On March 14, 1994,  the Company acquired the worldwide  trademarks,
rights  and business of Calvin Klein'r'  men's underwear and licensed the Calvin
Klein trademark for men's accessories. In addition, the acquisition included the
worldwide trademarks and rights  of Calvin Klein  women's intimate apparel  upon
the  expiration  of an  existing  license on  December  31, 1994.  The Company's
strategy is to build on the strength  of its brand names with consumer  oriented
marketing  programs in its  existing department and  specialty store channels of
distribution and to expand its distribution  on a selective basis with  specific
product  lines in mass merchandisers. The Company attributes the strength of its
brand names to the quality, fit and design of its products which have  developed
a  high degree  of consumer  loyalty and  a high  level of  repeat business. The
Company operates three divisions, Intimate  Apparel, Menswear and Retail  Outlet
Stores,  which accounted for 72%,  23% and 5%, respectively,  of net revenues in
fiscal  1994  with  the  intimate  apparel  division  accounting  for  a  larger
percentage of the Company's gross profit for the same period.
 
     The Intimate Apparel Division designs, manufactures and markets moderate to
premium-priced  intimate  apparel  for  women  under  the  Warner's'r', Olga'r',
Valentino Intimo'r', Scaasi'r', Blanche'r', White Stag'r', Fruit of the  Loom'r'
and  effective  January  1, 1995  Calvin  Klein  brand names.  In  addition, the
intimate apparel  division designs,  manufactures  and markets  men's  underwear
under  the Calvin Klein brand name. The intimate apparel division is the leading
marketer of  bras to  department  and specialty  stores  in the  United  States,
accounting  for over  31% of such  bra sales  in 1994, nearly  twice its nearest
competitor. The Warner's and Olga brand  names, which are owned by the  Company,
are 121 and 54 years old, respectively.
 
     The  Intimate Apparel  Division's strategy  is to  broaden its  channels of
distribution and expand its  highly recognized brand  names worldwide. In  1991,
the  Company entered into a  license agreement with Fruit  of the Loom, Inc. for
the design, manufacture and marketing of moderate priced bras, daywear and other
related items to be  distributed through mass  merchandisers, such as  Wal-Mart,
Venture,   Bradlees  and  Kmart,  under  the  Fruit  of  the  Loom  brand  name.
Additionally, in late 1993, the  Company signed a 3-year distribution  agreement
with  Avon Products, Inc. ('Avon') to distribute  Warner's and Fruit of the Loom
bras on an exclusive basis and Scaasi sleepwear throughout the United States.
 
     The Menswear Division designs,  manufactures, imports and markets  moderate
to  premium-priced  men's  apparel  and accessories  under  the  Chaps  by Ralph
Lauren'r', Hathaway'r',  Calvin Klein'r'  men's  underwear and  accessories  and
Catalina'r' brand names. Chaps by Ralph Lauren has increased its net revenues by
approximately  426% since  1989 from  $23 million  to $121  million in  1994, by
refocusing its products to the age 25 to 50 consumer and predominantly by  using
natural  fibers in its products. The Menswear Division's strategy is to build on
the strength of  its brand  names and  eliminate those  businesses whose  profit
contribution  is  below  the  Company's required  return.  Consistent  with this
strategy the  Company agreed  to  terminate its  licenses to  produce  Christian
Dior'r'  men's dress  shirts, neckwear and  accessories in 1994  and early 1995,
sold its Puritan trademark for menswear in  the United States and did not  renew
its  license to  produce Golden Bear  by Jack Nicklaus  products. These products
accounted for $19.3 and $100.3 million of net revenues for the Menswear Division
in 1994 and 1993, respectively. As  a result, operating margins in the  Menswear
Division increased from 9.6% in fiscal 1993 to 12.3% in fiscal 1994.
 
     The  Company licenses certain  of its brand names  throughout the world and
has been expanding the activities of its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  in
Canada,  Europe and Mexico. International  operations generated $94.2 million of
net  revenues   or  12%   of  the   total  Company's   net  revenues   in   1994
 
                                       1
 
<PAGE>
compared  to $98.6 million of  net revenues in fiscal year  1993 or 14.0% of the
total  Company  net  revenues.   The  total  net   revenues  of  the   Company's
international  operations in 1994 were negatively impacted by the generally weak
economies in Europe and Canada and  the restructuring of the Company's  menswear
operations.
 
     The  Company's business strategy  with respect to  its retail outlet stores
division is  to provide  a channel  for disposing  of the  Company's excess  and
irregular  inventory,  thereby  limiting  its  exposure  to  off-price retailers
without increasing the  total number of  stores to any  significant extent.  The
Company  had 53 stores at the  end of 1994 compared to  48 stores in 1993 and 52
stores in 1992.
 
     The Company's products  are distributed to  over 5,000 customers  operating
more  than 15,000 department specialty  and mass merchandising stores, including
such  leading  retailers  in  the  United  States  as  Dayton-Hudson,  Dillard's
Department Stores, Federated Department Stores, J.C. Penney, Kmart, The Limited,
Victoria's  Secret,  Macy's, The  May Department  Stores  and Wal-Mart  and such
leading retailers in Canada as Eaton's and The Hudson Bay Company. The Company's
products are also  distributed to  such leading  European retailers  as Marks  &
Spencer, House of Fraser, Harrods, Galeries Lafayette and Au Printemps.
 
  (B) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.
 
     The  Company operates within one dominant industry segment, the manufacture
and distribution of apparel, and has no customer which accounted for 10% or more
of its  net revenues  in  fiscal 1994.  (See Note  7  of Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages F-6 to F-19.)
 
  (C) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
     The  Company  designs, manufactures  and markets  a  broad line  of women's
intimate apparel  and men's  apparel and  accessories sold  under a  variety  of
internationally  recognized owned and licensed brand names. The Company operates
three divisions,  Intimate Apparel,  Menswear and  Retail Outlet  Stores,  which
accounted for 72%, 23% and 5%, respectively, of net revenues in fiscal 1994.
 
INTIMATE APPAREL
 
     The  Company  designs,  manufactures  and  markets  intimate  apparel which
includes bras,  panties, daywear  and sleepwear.  The Company  also designs  and
markets  mens underwear. The Company's bra brands  accounted for over 31% of bra
sales in department and  specialty stores in the  United States in 1994,  nearly
twice   its  nearest  competitor.  Management  considers  the  Intimate  Apparel
Division's primary strengths  to include its  strong brand recognition,  product
quality  and design innovation,  low cost production,  strong relationships with
department and  specialty stores  and  its ability  to deliver  its  merchandise
rapidly. Building on the strength of its brand names and reputation for quality,
the  Company has historically focused its intimate apparel products on the upper
moderate to  premium-priced range  distributed  through leading  department  and
specialty  stores. In  order to  expand its  market penetration  the Company (i)
entered into a license agreement with Fruit of the Loom, Inc., and in June 1992,
began to distribute moderate priced bras, daywear and other related items  under
this  license through the mass merchandise market (ii) in late 1993, the Company
signed a 3-year distribution  agreement with Avon  Products, Inc. to  distribute
Warner's  and Fruit of the Loom bras  on an exclusive basis and Scaasi sleepwear
throughout the United States and (iii)  in March 1994, the Company acquired  the
worldwide  trademarks, rights and businesses of Calvin Klein men's underwear and
the worldwide trademarks  and rights  of Calvin Klein  women's intimate  apparel
upon the expiration of an existing license on December 31, 1994.

</TABLE>
 
- ------------------
 
(1) On March 14, 1994, the Company acquired the worldwide trademarks, rights and
    businesses of Calvin Klein men's underwear and the worldwide trademarks  and
    rights  of Calvin Klein  women's intimate apparel upon  the expiration of an
    existing license on December 31, 1994.
 
     The Company  owns the  Warner's, Olga,  Calvin Klein  (men's underwear  and
intimate  apparel) and  Blanche brand  names and  trademarks. The  Company has a
license in  perpetuity for  the  White Stag  brand  for women's  sportswear  and
intimate  apparel. The  Company licenses  the other  brand names  under which it
markets its product lines. The Company  also manufactures intimate apparel on  a
private  and exclusive label basis for  certain leading specialty and department
stores. The  intimate apparel  division's revenues  are primarily  generated  by
sales  of the Company's own brand names. The Warner's brand is 121 years old and
the Olga brand is 54 years  old and commanded approximately 31% collectively  of
women's bra sales in United States department and specialty stores in 1994.
 
     In  August 1991, the Company entered into a license agreement with Fruit of
the Loom, Inc. for the design, manufacture and marketing of moderate priced bras
which are distributed  through mass  merchandisers, such  as Wal-Mart,  Venture,
Bradlees and Kmart under the Fruit of the Loom brand name. The license agreement
has since been extended to include daywear, full slips, half slips, culottes and
petticoats  as well as  coordinated fashion sets (bras  and panties) and certain
control bottoms and  sleepwear. The  Company began  shipping Fruit  of the  Loom
products  in June 1992. The  agreement with Fruit of  the Loom, Inc. has allowed
the Company to enter the mass  merchandise market, which is growing faster  than
the department and specialty store market.
 
     The  Company attributes the strength of its  brands to the quality, fit and
design of its  intimate apparel which  has developed a  high degree of  customer
loyalty  and a high level  of repeat business. The  Company believes that it has
maintained its leadership  position, in  part, through  product innovation  with
accomplishments  such as introducing the alphabet bra (A, B, C and D cup sizes),
the first  all-stretch  bra, the  body  stocking, the  use  of two  way  stretch
fabrics,  the cotton-lycra bra  and the sports bra.  The Company also introduced
the use of hangers and  certain point of sale  hangtags for in-store display  of
bras,  which was a significant  change from marketing bras  in boxes and enabled
women, for  the first  time, to  see the  product in  the store.  The  Company's
product innovations have become standards in the industry.
 
     Growth  in  the intimate  apparel industry  is benefiting  from a  shift in
consumer attitudes.  Specifically,  because  women  increasingly  view  intimate
apparel  as a  fashion-oriented purchase  rather than as  a purchase  of a basic
necessity. The  shift has  been  driven by  the  expansion of  intimate  apparel
specialty stores and catalogs such as Victoria's Secret and an increase in space
allocated to intimate apparel by department stores. The Company believes that it
is  well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for intimate apparel due to
its reputation for forward-looking design, quality,  fit and fashion and to  the
breadth  of its  product lines at  a range of  price points. Over  the past five
years, the Company has further improved  its position by obtaining the  licenses
to  produce intimate apparel under the Valentino  Intimo name in the premium end
of the market, by  continuing to introduce new  products under the Warner's  and
Olga brands in the better end of the market, by obtaining the license from Fruit
of the Loom, Inc. to produce bras, daywear and other related items, by producing
White  Stag bras for the mass merchandise segment of the market and by acquiring
the Calvin Klein trademarks for better priced women's intimate apparel and men's
underwear. The Company has further improved its position
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
by continuing  to  strengthen  its  relationships  with  its  department  store,
specialty store, and mass merchandise customers.
 
     The Intimate Apparel Division's revenues have increased at a 16% compounded
annual  growth rate since 1989, to $565.3 million in fiscal 1994, as the Company
increased  its  penetration  with  existing  accounts,  expanded  sales  to  new
customers  by  capitalizing  on the  high  growth  in such  specialty  stores as
Victoria's Secret and sales of Fruit of  the Loom to mass merchandisers such  as
Wal-Mart, Venture, Bradlees and Kmart and broadened its product lines to include
men's  underwear. The Company's  strong sales increase  was accomplished despite
the softening of the general retail  market due to poor economic conditions  and
the  bankruptcy,  reorganization or  liquidation of  certain major  retail store
customers  during  this  period.  The  intimate  apparel  division  has  reduced
operating  expenses  as a  percentage of  net revenue  by narrowing  its product
lines, controlling selling,  administrative and general  expenses and  improving
manufacturing efficiency. The Company believes that it is one of the lowest-cost
producers  of  intimate apparel  in the  United  States, producing  nearly eight
million dozen per year.
 
     The Company's  bras are  sold  primarily in  the department  and  specialty
stores  that  have been  the Company's  traditional  customer base  for intimate
apparel.  In  June  of  1992,  the  Company  expanded  into  a  new  channel  of
distribution, mass merchandisers, with its Fruit of the Loom product line, which
offers  a range of styles designed to meet  the needs of the consumer profile of
this market.  In  late  1993  the  Company  further  expanded  its  channels  of
distribution  by  signing  a  3-year  agreement  with  Avon  Products,  Inc.  to
distribute Warner's  and Fruit  of the  Loom bras  on an  exclusive basis,  and,
Scaasi   sleepwear  throughout  the   United  States.  The   Company  also  sees
opportunities for continued  growth in  the intimate apparel  division for  bras
specifically  designed for the 'full  figure' market, as well  as in the panties
and daywear product lines.
 
     The Intimate  Apparel Division  has subsidiaries  in Canada  and Mexico  in
North  America and  in the United  Kingdom, France, Belgium,  Ireland, Spain and
Germany in Europe. International sales accounted for approximately 14.8% of  the
intimate   apparel  division's  net  revenues   in  fiscal  1994.  Net  revenues
attributable to the  international divisions  of the  Intimate Apparel  Division
were  $79.1 million, $84.5 million and $84.1  million in fiscal years 1992, 1993
and  1994,  respectively.  Management's  strategy  is  to  increase  its  market
penetration  in Europe and to open  additional channels of distribution. In 1994
the Company  began distributing  its products  directly in  Spain, Portugal  and
Italy,  having  taken  back these  territories  from its  previous  licensee. In
addition, in  1994 the  Company entered  into  a joint  venture with  News  Corp
Limited  to  market, on  an  exclusive basis,  the  Company's products  over the
Satellite Television Asian Region Network ('STAR'), serving Asia and the  Middle
East.  The STAR network reaches over 60 million households in 53 countries in an
area that includes  two-thirds of  the world's  population. In  addition to  the
international  marketing  of its  product lines,  the  Company has  licensed its
intimate apparel brand names to manufacturers in certain foreign countries.
 
     The Company's intimate apparel products are manufactured principally in the
Company's facilities in  North America,  Central America,  the Caribbean  Basin,
Ireland and the United Kingdom.
 
     Although  the Intimate Apparel Division generally markets its product lines
for three  retail selling  seasons (spring,  fall and  holiday), its  sales  and
revenues are somewhat seasonal with approximately 57% of net revenues and 58% of
operating income generated during the second half of the fiscal year.
 
MENSWEAR
 
     The  Menswear Division designs, manufactures,  imports and markets moderate
to better-priced dress  shirts and neckwear,  sportswear and men's  accessories.
Management  considers the Menswear  Division's primary strengths  to include its
strong brand  recognition,  product  quality, reputation  for  fashion  styling,
strong  relationships with  department and specialty  stores and  its ability to
deliver merchandise rapidly.

</TABLE>
 
     The Hathaway brand name is owned by the Company. The Company also owns  the
trademarks  for Calvin Klein  men's underwear and  women's intimate apparel. The
Calvin Klein  brand name  for accessories,  and the  Chaps by  Ralph Lauren  and
Catalina brand names are licensed by the Company.
 
     The  Menswear Division's strategy is to build  on the strength of its brand
names, strengthen its position as a  global apparel company and eliminate  those
businesses  whose profit contribution is below the Company's required return. In
fiscal 1993 and 1994, because of a strategic decision to minimize the percentage
of commodity  type  businesses in  the  Company's  product mix  and  to  improve
profitability  in this Division,  the Company (i)  discontinued its manufactured
dress shirt, neckwear and accessories business segment under the Christian  Dior
label  (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F-6 to
F-19), (ii) sold the Puritan menswear label in the United States to Wal-Mart  in
December  1993, and (iii) did not renew its Golden Bear by Jack Nicklaus license
which expired in June 1994.
 
     The Menswear Division's net  revenue has decreased  from $213.9 million  in
fiscal  year 1989  to $183.8 million  in fiscal  year 1994 primarily  due to the
discontinuation of several underperforming  businesses including Christian  Dior
accessories,  neckwear,  sportswear  and  dress  shirts,  Golden  Bear  by  Jack
Nicklaus, Pringle and Puritan menswear. The men's business, and the dress  shirt
business  in particular, has been adversely  affected during this period by weak
retail demand due to poor economic conditions and the bankruptcy, reorganization
or liquidation of several of its major retail store customers. In addition,  the
division has been hurt by a shift in consumer preferences away from apparel made
with   synthetic  or  blended  fibers,   particularly  orlon  sweaters,  and  by
substantial liquidations of dress shirt,  knit shirt and sweater inventories  at
low  prices  by  certain of  the  Company's  competitors as  a  result  of their
financial difficulties.  The  negative  impact  of  these  conditions  has  been
partially  offset by the tremendous  success of the Chaps  by Ralph Lauren brand
which has increased its  net revenues by approximately  426% since 1989 to  $121
million while increasing operating profits over 600% to $17 milllion.
 
     Dress  Shirts and  Neckwear. The  Menswear Division  designs, manufactures,
imports  and   markets   three  principal   lines   of  dress   shirts:   basic,
intermediate-fashion  and fashion. The  average full retail  prices of the dress
shirts, which are marketed  under the Hathaway and  Chaps by Ralph Lauren  brand
names,  range from $20 to $45. Substantially  all of the division's dress shirts
are manufactured at Company owned or leased facilities in North America and  the
Caribbean Basin.
 
     Sportswear.  The Menswear Division has substantially revised its sportswear
product lines over the past  several years. The Chaps  by Ralph Lauren line  has
eliminated many synthetic and blended fabrics from its product lines and updated
its  styling, which has generated significant net revenue increases as mentioned
above. In 1993, the  Company entered into a  license agreement to produce  men's
and  women's  sportswear  and men's  dress  shirts and  furnishings  bearing the
Catalina trademark. Catalina brand products will be sold to the mass merchandise
segment of the market. The first shipments of Catalina products were made in the
first quarter of 1995.
 
     Accessories. The  Menswear  Division  markets  (beginning  in  1995)  men's
accessories including small leather goods and belts under the Calvin Klein brand
name  under an exclusive worldwide license.  Management believes that one of the
strengths of its accessories lines is  the high level of international  consumer
recognition associated with the Calvin Klein label. The Company's strategy is to
expand the
 
                                       5
 
<PAGE>
accessories  business, which on a consistent  basis has generated higher margins
than other menswear products.
 
     International sales accounted for approximately  6% of net revenues of  the
Menswear  Division in l994. Net revenues attributable to international divisions
of the Menswear Division were $12.7 million, $14.1 million and $10.2 million  in
fiscal  years l992, 1993  and 1994, respectively.  The decrease in international
sales in fiscal 1994  compared to fiscal 1993  reflects the Company's  strategic
decision  to restructure  its men's dress  shirt and neckwear  businesses and to
terminate its Christian Dior licenses.
 
     The Menswear  Division's sportswear  is sourced  principally from  the  Far
East.  The Menswear Division manufactures its  dress shirts in North America and
sources certain styles  of dress shirts  in the  Far East and  in the  Caribbean
Basin.  Accessories are sourced in  the United States, Europe  and the Far East.
Neckwear is sourced primarily in the United States.
 
     The Menswear  Division,  like  the  Intimate  Apparel  Division,  generally
markets  its apparel products for three retail selling seasons (spring, fall and
holiday). The Menswear Division introduces new styles, fabrics and colors  based
upon consumer preferences and market trends and to coincide with the appropriate
retail selling season. The sales of the Menswear Division's product lines follow
individual  seasonal shipping patterns ranging from one season to three seasons,
with multiple releases in  some of the  Division's more fashion-oriented  lines.
Consistent  with industry and consumer buying patterns, approximately 56% of the
Menswear Division's net revenues  and 67% of  the Menswear Division's  operating
profit  are generated in  the second half  of the calendar  year, reflecting the
strength of the fall and holiday shopping seasons.
 
RETAIL OUTLET STORES DIVISION
 
     The Retail Outlet Stores Division primarily sells the Company's products to
the general public. The Company's business  strategy with respect to its  retail
outlet  stores is to provide a channel for disposing of the Company's excess and
irregular inventory, thereby limiting its  exposure to off-price retailers.  The
Company's retail outlet stores are situated in areas where they generally do not
conflict  with the Company's  principal channels of  distribution. The Company's
newer retail outlet stores  are principally intimate  apparel stores located  in
outlet  malls. The Company has  found that it has  improved margins by operating
retail outlet stores that sell products of only one of the Company's  divisions.
The  Retail  Outlet Store  Division's EBITDA  in fiscal  1994 improved  40% over
fiscal 1993 to $2.8 million. The Company  operates 53 stores, of which 35  carry
intimate apparel only, 3 carry Menswear only and 15 carry both lines.
 
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
 
     The  Company has subsidiaries in Canada and  Mexico in North America and in
the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Spain and Germany in Europe  which
engage  in sales and marketing activities. With the exception of the fluctuation
of local  currencies against  the United  States dollar,  the Company  does  not
believe  that the operations in  Canada and western Europe  are subject to risks
which  are  significantly  different   from  domestic  operations.  Mexico   has
historically  been subject to high rates  of inflation and currency restrictions
which  may,  from  time  to  time  impact  the  Mexican  operation.  The  recent
devaluation  of the Mexican peso has had a favorable impact on the Company since
its Mexican operations  produce 25% of  the Company's intimate  apparel for  the
U.S.  market.  The Company  also  sells directly  to  customers in  Mexico which
represents less than 1% of the Company's total sales.
 
     The Company maintains manufacturing  facilities in Mexico, Honduras,  Costa
Rica,  the  Dominican  Republic,  Canada, Ireland  and  the  United  Kingdom and
warehousing facilities  in  Canada, Mexico,  the  United Kingdom  and  contracts
warehousing  in  Spain.  The Intimate  Apparel  Division  operates manufacturing
facilities in  Mexico and  in the  Caribbean Basin  pursuant to  duty-advantaged
(commonly  referred to  as 'Item 807')  programs. The recent  devaluation of the
Mexican peso  has  had a  favorable  impact on  the  Company since  its  Mexican
operations  produce 25% of  the Company's intimate apparel  for the U.S. market.
The Company's  manufacturing  policy  is  to  have  many  potential  sources  of
manufacturing  so that a disruption  of production at any  one facility will not
cause a significant problem.
 
                                       6
 
<PAGE>
     The majority of  the Company's  imported purchases are  invoiced in  United
States   dollars  and,  therefore,  are   not  subject  to  short-term  currency
fluctuations.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
     The Intimate Apparel and  Menswear Divisions sell  to over 5,000  customers
operating  more than 15,000  department, mass merchandise  and men's and women's
specialty stores  throughout North  America  and Europe.  While certain  of  the
Company's  department store customers are under  common ownership, none of these
corporate groups  accounted for  more than  10% of  the Company's  net  revenues
during fiscal 1994.
 
     The  Company's  retail  customers  are served  by  approximately  200 sales
representatives. The Company also employs  marketing coordinators who work  with
the  Company's  customers  in  designing  in-store  displays  and  planning  the
placement  of  merchandise.   The  Company  has   implemented  Electronic   Data
Interchange  (commonly  referred  to  as 'EDI')  programs  with  certain  of its
retailing  customers  which  permit  the  Company  to  receive  purchase  orders
electronically  from these  customers and, in  some cases,  to transmit invoices
electronically.
 
     The Company  utilizes various  forms  of advertising  media. In  l994,  the
Company spent approximately $37 million or 4.7% of net sales for advertising and
promotion  of its various product lines. This compares to $32 million or 4.5% of
net sales in 1993.  This increase was  made in order  to maintain the  Company's
strong  market position  in Warner's  and Olga  and increase  penetration of the
Fruit of the Loom and Calvin Klein product lines. The Company participates on  a
cooperative basis with retailers, principally through newspaper advertisements.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The  apparel  industry  is highly  competitive.  The  Company's competitors
include apparel manufacturers of all sizes, some of which have greater resources
than the Company.
 
     The Company also competes with foreign producers, but to date, such foreign
competition has  not  materially  affected  the  Intimate  Apparel  or  Menswear
Divisions.  The Company believes that its manufacturing skills, coupled with its
existing Central  American  and  Caribbean Basin  manufacturing  facilities  and
selective  use  of off-shore  sourcing, enable  the Company  to maintain  a cost
structure competitive with  other major  apparel manufacturers.  In addition  to
competition  from other branded  apparel manufacturers, the  Company competes in
certain product lines with department store private label programs.
 
     The Company  believes  that  it has  a  significant  competitive  advantage
because  of high consumer recognition and acceptance  of its brand names and its
strong presence and strong  market share in the  major department and  specialty
store chains.
 
     A  substantial  portion of  the Company's  sales are  of products,  such as
intimate apparel and  mens underwear,  that are  not very  susceptible to  rapid
design  changes.  This  relatively  stable base  of  business  is  a significant
contributing factor to the Company's favorable competitive and cost position  in
the apparel industry.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     The  Company's raw materials are  principally cotton, wool, silk, synthetic
and cotton-synthetic blends  of fabrics  and yarns.  Raw materials  used by  the
Intimate Apparel and Menswear Divisions are available from multiple sources.
 
IMPORT QUOTAS
 
     A  substantial  portion  of  the  Company's  products  are  manufactured by
contractors located outside the United  States. These products are imported  and
are  subject to  Federal customs  laws, which impose  tariffs as  well as import
quota restrictions established by the Department of Commerce. While  importation
of  goods  from certain  countries may  be  subject to  embargo by  U.S. Customs
authorities if
 
                                       7
 
<PAGE>
shipments exceed  quota  limits,  the Company  closely  monitors  import  quotas
through  its Washington, D.C. office and can, in most cases, shift production to
contractors  located  in  countries  with   available  quotas  or  to   domestic
manufacturing facilities. The existence of import quotas has, therefore, not had
a material effect on the Company's business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The  Company and  its subsidiaries  employ approximately  14,800 employees.
Approximately 17% of  the Company's employees,  all of whom  are engaged in  the
manufacture  and distribution of its products,  are represented by labor unions.
The Company considers labor relations with employees to be satisfactory and  has
not   experienced   significant  interruption   of   operations  due   to  labor
disagreements.
 
TRADEMARKS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS
 
     The Company has license agreements permitting it to manufacture and  market
specific  products using  the trademarks of  others. The  Company terminated its
license agreements with Christian Dior for the production of sportswear in  1992
and  for the  production of  dress shirts, neckwear  and accesories  in both the
United States and Canada in 1994 and 1995. The Company's joint venture agreement
with Golden Bear, Inc. expired in June 1994. The Company's exclusive license and
design agreements for the Chaps by Ralph Lauren trademark expire on December 31,
1996. These agreements grant the Company an exclusive right to use the Chaps  by
Ralph Lauren trademark in the United States of America. The Company's license to
use  the Valentino Intimo trademark for intimate apparel in the United States of
America, its territories  and possessions,  Puerto Rico and  Canada, expires  on
December  31,  l997 and,  subject  to certain  conditions,  is renewable  at the
Company's option, for an additional five-year term. The Company has an exclusive
license to  use  the Scaasi  trademark  in the  United  States of  America,  its
territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and numerous Caribbean
Islands  until December 31,  1999. The Company's  exclusive license agreement to
use the  Fruit of  the  Loom trademark  in the  United  States of  America,  its
territories  and possessions, Canada  and Mexico was  extended for an additional
two year term expiring December 31, 1996.
 
     On March 14, 1994, the Company entered into a license agreement with Calvin
Klein, Inc. to produce Calvin Klein men's accessories for a period of five years
through March 14, 1999 and a further five year renewal period through March  14,
2004, solely at the option of the Company. In December 1993, the Company entered
into a license agreement with Authentic Fitness Corporation to produce men's and
women's  sportswear and  men's dress shirts  and furnishings  under the Catalina
label. The Company's exclusive license  to use the Catalina trademark  worldwide
for these products expires in December 2003.
 
     Although  the specific  terms of each  of the  Company's license agreements
vary, generally  such agreements  provide for  minimum royalty  payments  and/or
royalty  payments based  on a percentage  of net sales.  Such license agreements
also generally grant the licensor the  right to approve any designs marketed  by
the licensee.
 
     The  Company  owns  other  trademarks,  the  most  important  of  which are
Warner's, Olga, Calvin  Klein men's  underwear, Calvin  Klein intimate  apparel,
Hathaway  and Blanche. The  Company has a  license in perpetuity  for White Stag
women's sportswear and intimate apparel.
 
     The Company licenses the Warner's, Hathaway and Calvin Klein brand names to
domestic and international licensees for a variety of products. These agreements
generally require the licensee to pay royalties and fees to the Company based on
a percentage of the licensee's net sales. The Company regularly monitors product
design, development, quality, merchandising and marketing and schedules meetings
throughout the  year with  licensees, to  assure compliance  with the  Company's
overall marketing, merchandising and design strategies, and to ensure uniformity
and   quality  control.   Royalty  income   derived  from   such  licensing  was
approximately $5.6  million (including  assignment fees  received in  connection
with  the  termination  of  certain licenses  of  $3.0  million),  $15.0 million
(including the  sale of  the Puritan  trademark in  the United  States for  $7.7
million)  and  $11.5  million  (including  the  sale  of  certain  trademarks to
Authentic Fitness Corporation for $6.6 million)  in fiscal years 1992, 1993  and
1994, respectively.

BACKLOG
 
     A  substantial portion  of net  revenues is  based on  orders for immediate
delivery, and, therefore, backlog  is not necessarily  indicative of future  net
revenues.
 
  (D) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT
SALES.
 
     The  information required by this portion  of Item 1 is incorporated herein
by reference to Note  7 of Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements on  pages
F-6 to F-19.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
 
     The  principal  executive offices  of the  Company are  located at  90 Park
Avenue, New York,  New York  10016 and  are occupied  pursuant to  a lease  that
expires  in  2004. In  addition  to its  executive  offices, the  Company leases
offices in Connecticut and  California, pursuant to leases  that expire in  1999
and 2000, respectively.
 
     The  Company has 16 domestic manufacturing and warehouse facilities located
in Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maine, California, New
York, Puerto Rico and Tennessee and 20 international manufacturing and warehouse
facilities located  in Costa  Rica, the  Dominican Republic,  Honduras,  Mexico,
Canada,  Spain,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Ireland.  Certain  of  the Company's
manufacturing and  warehouse facilities  are also  used for  administrative  and
retail  functions.  The Company  owns eight  of  its domestic  and three  of its
international facilities. The balance of the facilities are leased. Lease terms,
except for three month-to-month leases, expire from 1995 to 2007.
 
     The Company  also  leases  sales  offices in  a  number  of  major  cities,
including, Dallas and New York in the United States; Brussels, Belgium; Toronto,
Canada;  London, England; Dusseldorf, Germany;  Madrid, Spain and Paris, France.
The sales office leases expire  between 1995 and 2001  and are renewable at  the
Company's option.
 
     All  of the  Company's production and  warehouse facilities  are located in
appropriately designed  buildings  which  are  kept in  good  repair.  All  such
facilities  have  well maintained  equipment and  sufficient capacity  to handle
present volumes.  The  Company  has  expanded its  production  capacity  in  the
Caribbean  Basin in the last three years and anticipates additional expansion in
Mexico to support the Company's continued growth.
 
     In December 1993,  the Company  sold its  Checotah, Oklahoma  manufacturing
facility to Authentic Fitness Corporation, a related party, (See Note 6 of Notes
to  Consolidated Financial  Statements on pages  F-6 to F-19)  for its appraised
fair market value. Prior to the sale, the facility was being 100% utilized as  a
contract facility for Authentic Fitness Corporation.
 
     In  January  1994,  the  Company's  leased  warehouse  located  in  Sylmar,
California  suffered  significant  structural  damage  due  to  the   California
earthquake  and  was  permanently  closed.  The  Company  was  able  to  recover
substantially all of its inventory,  transfer the inventory to other  locations,
and  begin shipping at normal levels in  March, 1994. The Company has earthquake
insurance and, other than  a deductible of approximately  $3 million, which  was
recorded as a non-recurring expense in the first quarter of fiscal 1994, expects
to  fully recover  its losses  (See Note  4 of  Notes to  Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages F-6 to F-19.)
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
     The Company sued VF  Corporation and its Spanish  subsidiary for breach  of
contract,   fraud,  violation  of  Federal  trademark  laws  and  conspiracy  in
connection with the termination of a licensing agreement in Spain, Portugal  and
Italy.  The Company settled this action in December 1994 on favorable terms. The
Company is  not  a  party  to any  litigation,  other  than  routine  litigation
incidental to the
 
                                       9

     A recent last sales price for the shares of Common Stock as reported on the
New  York Stock Exchange Composite Tape was $17  7/8 on March 30, 1995. On April
3, 1995 there were 159 holders of Class A Common Stock, based upon the number of
holders of record and the number of individual participants in certain  security
position listings.
 
     The  Company has not  paid dividends on  its Common Stock.  Prior to fiscal
1994, certain  provisions  of  the  Company's  debt  agreements  restricted  the
Company's  ability  to  pay  dividends.  In May  1994  the  Company  received an
investment grade senior debt rating from Standard and Poor's and pursuant to the
terms of the Company's debt agreements, certain provisions of the Company's debt
agreements were automatically modified. As a result, the Company may declare and
pay dividends equal to  25% of the Company's  earnings accumulated since  fiscal
1993.

 (a) See  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition and
     Results of Operations'  for a discussion  of certain non-recurring  charges
     incurred in fiscal 1993 and 1994. On September 4, 1991, the Company's Board
     of  Directors determined that  the Company should  restructure its knitwear
     operations.  The  restructuring  resulted  in  a  non-recurring  charge  of
     approximately  $13 million (or $0.68 per share) in fiscal 1991. Such charge
     was associated with  the closing  of the  Company's knitwear  manufacturing
     facilities  and the liquidation of related  inventory. In October 1993, the
     Company decided to discontinue  a portion of  its men's manufactured  dress
     shirt  and  neckwear business  segment.  This resulted  in  a non-recurring
     charge of  $19.9  million.  Also,  the  Company  incurred  a  $2.6  million
     non-recurring   charge  associated  with  the   wind  up  of  a  previously
     discontinued business. The  total non-recurring charge  recorded in  fiscal
     1993  was $22.5 million (or  $0.56 per share). In  fiscal 1994, the Company
     incurred a $3 million (or $0.07 per share) charge related to the California
     earthquake. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 (b) Fiscal 1993 includes a  $10.5 million charge (or  $0.26 per share) for  the
     cumulative  effect of  the Company  changing its  method of  accounting for
     postretirement benefits  other  than  pensions.  See Note  9  of  Notes  to
     Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 (c) The Company has not paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
 
     During  the last  several years,  the Company  has implemented  a number of
strategies designed to  reduce operating  expenses and refocus  its business  on
less  fashion  sensitive  and  higher  margin  product  lines  with  world brand
potential. As a  result of  this strategic refocusing,  and notwithstanding  the
bankruptcy,  reorganization or  liquidation of  several of  the Company's retail
customers, including  B.  Altman  &  Co., Bonwit  Teller,  Carter  Hawley  Hale,
Federated  Department  Stores, Miller  & Rhoades,  R.H. Macy  & Co.,  Woodward &
Lathrop, and P.A. Bergner & Co., and the general softening of the retail  market
as  a result of  the economic slowdown  from 1989 through  1994, the Company has
significantly increased operating  income. The Intimate  Apparel Division's  net
revenues   have  grown  since  1989  at  a  compounded  annual  growth  rate  of
approximately 16%. Menswear  Division net  revenues have  decreased from  $213.9
million  in  fiscal  1989  to  $183.8 million  in  fiscal  1994,  reflecting the
Company's  strategic  decisions  to  eliminate  cash  intensive  businesses  and
businesses  that  did not  demonstrate  the potential  to  achieve profitability
levels acceptable to  management. (See Notes  3 and 4  of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages F-6 to F-19.) The strategic decisions included (i)
not  renewing its license with Pringle of  Scotland in fiscal 1989, (ii) closing
its knitwear manufacturing facilities in 1991, (iii) restructuring the Company's
dress shirt and neckwear manufacturing facilities in 1993, (iv) terminating  the
Christian  Dior licenses for dress shirts,  neckwear and accessories in 1994 and
1995 and selling the Christian Dior license for sportswear in 1992, (v)  selling
the  Puritan menswear trademark  in the United  States to Wal-Mart  and (vi) not
renewing the license  for Golden  Bear by Jack  Nicklaus in  1994. The  negative
impact  on net revenues  of the discontinued businesses  was partially offset by
strong growth in the  Company's Chaps by Ralph  Lauren line which has  increased
net  revenue over 400% since 1989 and increased operating profit over 600% since
1989.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The consolidated  results  of operations  for  the Company  are  summarized
below.  The Divisional  Summary includes the  Retail Outlet  Stores Division for
reporting purposes; however, since the Company's business strategy is to use its
Retail Outlet Stores as a channel for its excess inventory and the Company  does
not  consider the  results of  such division to  be material,  the Retail Outlet
Stores Division is not discussed further.

 (a) In October 1993, the Company decided to discontinue a portion of its  men's
     manufactured dress shirt and neckwear business segment, which resulted in a
     non-recurring  charge of $19.9  million. Also, the  Company incurred a $2.6
     million non-recurring charge associated  with the wind  up of a  previously
     discontinued  business. The  total non-recurring charge  recorded in fiscal
     1993 was $22.5  million (or $0.56  per share). In  fiscal 1994 the  Company
     recorded  a $3 million (or $0.07 per share) non-recurring charge related to
     the California earthquake. See  Note 4 of  Notes to Consolidated  Financial
     Statements on pages F-6 to F-19.
 
COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1994 WITH FISCAL 1993
 
     Net  revenues increased 12.1% from $703.8  million in fiscal 1993 to $788.8
million in fiscal 1994. The increase  in net revenue was accomplished despite  a
planned  reduction of approximately $90  million in discontinued Menswear brands
and is  attributable  to continued  growth  in the  Company's  Intimate  Apparel
Division  of 33.6% and continued  growth in the Company's  Chaps by Ralph Lauren
line of 36%. Net revenue includes royalty income of $11.5 million in fiscal 1994
(including the sale of certain trademarks to Authentic Fitness for $6.6 million)
compared to $15.0  million in  fiscal 1993 (including  the sale  of the  Puritan
menswear trademark in the United States for $7.7 million).
 
     INTIMATE  APPAREL DIVISION. Net revenues  increased 33.6% to $565.3 million
     in fiscal  1994  from the  $423.2  million  recorded in  fiscal  1993.  The
     increase  was driven by the acquisition of Calvin Klein which generated net
     revenues of $61.0 million in fiscal 1994, an increase in Fruit of the  Loom
     net  revenues of 95.4% to $64.3 million  and increases in Warner's and Olga
     of 13.2%.
 
     MENSWEAR DIVISION. Net revenues for fiscal 1994 decreased to $183.8 million
     from $243.2 million in fiscal 1993.  The decrease in sales is  attributable
     to  the  Company's  strategic decisions  in  fiscal  1993 and  1994  to (i)
     terminate the Christian Dior licenses for men's dress shirts, neckwear  and
     accessories,  (ii) sell the Puritan menswear trademark in the United States
     to Wal-Mart and (iii) discontinue the Golden Bear by Jack Nicklaus  product
     line.  Without these  discontinued brands,  Menswear Division  net revenues
     increased 15.3% in  fiscal 1994 to  $164.5 million from  $142.9 million  in
     fiscal  1993. The increase is  attributable to continued outstanding growth
     of 36.0% in Chaps by Ralph Lauren.
 
     Gross profit increased to $255.8 million in fiscal 1994 from $236.4 million
in fiscal 1993. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to  32.4%
in  fiscal 1994  from 33.6% in  fiscal 1993. The  decrease in gross  profit as a
percentage of net revenue reflects  the higher mix of  Fruit of the Loom  sales,
the  amortization  of start-up  costs  in the  Fruit  of the  Loom  business and
decreased manufacturing efficiency due to the start-up of four new plants.
 
     INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Intimate Apparel Division gross profit increased
     21.3% to $203.5  million (36.0% of  net revenues) from  the $167.7  million
     (39.6% of net revenues) recorded in fiscal
 
                                       14
 
<PAGE>
     1993.  The increase in gross profit  reflects the higher net revenues noted
     above. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 39.6% to
     36.0% due to the mix of Fruit of the Loom sales, the amortization of  Fruit
     of the Loom start-up costs, and decreased manufacturing efficiency as noted
     above.
 
     MENSWEAR  DIVISION.  Menswear  Division  gross  profit  decreased  to $38.2
     million (20.7% of net revenues) from $53.7 million (22.1% of net  revenues)
     last year. The decrease in gross profit reflects the lower sales volume due
     to discontinued brands, as discussed above. The decrease in gross profit as
     a  percentage of net revenues reflects  the favorable impact in fiscal 1993
     from the sale of the Puritan menswear trademark in the United States.
 
     Selling, administrative and general expenses increased 8.6% in fiscal  1994
to  $156.6 million  (19.9% of  net revenue)  from $144.2  million (20.5%  of net
revenue) in fiscal  1993. The  increase in selling,  administrative and  general
expenses reflects volume increases and an increase in marketing expenses of $5.6
million. Marketing expenses increased to 4.7% of net revenue in fiscal 1994 from
4.5%  in  fiscal  1993  and  3.2%  in  fiscal  1992.  The  decrease  in selling,
administrative and  general expenses  as a  percentage of  net revenue  reflects
continued efforts to control operating expenses by the Company and the favorable
impact  of  increased sales  to  mass merchandisers  and  Avon which  have lower
selling expenses than the Company's traditional channels of distribution.
 
     Interest expense decreased 17% to $32.5  million in fiscal 1994 from  $38.9
million  in fiscal  1993 despite  an overall  increase in  interest rates during
1994. The decrease in  interest expense is  a result of  the refinancing of  the
Company's  credit agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the attainment
of an Investment Grade credit rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor's in May 1994,
and the  renegotiation of  the Company's  cost of  borrowing in  June 1994.  The
combination  of the refinancing, the improved credit rating and the renegotiated
borrowing rate lowered  the Company's cost  of borrowing by  75 basis points  to
LIBOR  plus  0.5%.  In  addition, the  Company  has  purchased  agreements which
effectively fix  the Company's  rate of  interest  on $275  million of  debt  at
approximately 6.2% through fiscal 1995.
 
     In  January  1994,  The  Company's  leased  warehouse  located  in  Sylmar,
California  suffered  significant  structural  damage  due  to  the   California
earthquake  and  was  permanently  closed.  The  Company  was  able  to  recover
substantially all of its inventory,  transfer the inventory to other  locations,
and  begin shipping at normal levels in  March, 1994. The Company has earthquake
insurance and, other than  a deductible of approximately  $3 million, which  was
recorded as a non-recurring expense in the first quarter of fiscal 1994, expects
to fully recover its losses.
 
     The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109,
Accounting  for Income Taxes,  ('Statement No. 109') in  1992. The provision for
income taxes for  fiscal 1994 reflects  the the realization  of tax benefits  of
$22.6  million related to  the Company's net  operating loss carryforwards which
offset substantially all of the Company's income tax provision for fiscal  1994.
The   Company  has  utilized  substantially  all   of  its  net  operating  loss
carryforwards for financial reporting  purposes at the end  of fiscal 1994.  The
Company  has total deferred tax assets of approximately $38.5 million at the end
of fiscal 1994  and as a  result will  begin reporting fully  taxed earnings  in
fiscal 1995. The Company recognized $31.3 million of income tax benefits related
to future periods in fiscal years 1992 and 1993.
 
     The  Company has net  operating loss carryforwards  for income tax purposes
available to  offset  future  taxable income  amounting  to  approximately  $110
million  at January 7, 1995. These carryforwards, if fully utilized, will result
in a future tax savings of approximately $38.5 million at current U.S. corporate
income tax rates. The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in  2001
and fully expire in 2007.
 
     As  a result of the  Company's common stock offerings  in 1991 and 1992 and
other changes in the ownership of the Company's common stock, certain provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code  will limit the rate at  which the Company will  be
able  to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. The Company believes that
it will  realize all  of the  benefits attributable  to its  net operating  loss
carryforwards;  however,  the  amount of  such  benefits that  the  Company will
realize and the period in which any  benefit is realized are subject to  several
factors  including the general level of economic activity, the level of earnings
and future changes in U.S. corporate income tax laws and regulations (See Note 8
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F-6 to F-19).
 
                                       15
 
<PAGE>
     Income from  continuing  operations  for  fiscal  1994  was  $63.3  million
compared to $53.3 million in fiscal 1993. The increase in income from continuing
operations  of $10.0  million or  18.8% is  attributable to  increased operating
income and lower interest expense, as noted above.
 
     Net income for fiscal 1994 was  $63.3 million compared to $24.1 million  in
fiscal  1993. Net income for fiscal 1993 included an extraordinary item of $18.6
million (without income tax benefit)  primarily related to premium payments  and
the   write-off  of   deferred  financing   costs  associated   with  the  early
extinguishment of  debt.  In addition,  fiscal  1993 included  a  $10.5  million
non-cash  charge for the cumulative effective of adopting Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.106.
 
COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1993 WITH FISCAL 1992
 
     Net revenues increased  13% from $625.1  million in fiscal  1992 to  $703.8
million  in fiscal 1993. The increase  in net revenues is primarily attributable
to continued growth in the Company's Intimate Apparel Division and growth in the
Chaps by Ralph Lauren line of the Menswear Division.
 
     INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Net revenues increased 10% to $423.2 million  in
     fiscal  1993 from the $384.8 million recorded in fiscal 1992 despite a $7.5
     million negative effect on foreign  exchange translation due to the  strong
     dollar versus the pound sterling. The increase is attributable to continued
     growth  in the Company's domestic business, primarily the Warner's and Olga
     brands of over 8%, and the  highly successful introduction of the Fruit  of
     the  Loom brand of intimate apparel into the mass merchandise market, which
     increased 115%  to $32.9  million in  fiscal 1993,  from $15.3  million  in
     fiscal 1992, its first year of operation.
 
     MENSWEAR  DIVISION. Net  revenues for fiscal  1993 increased  22% to $243.2
     million from the $200.0  million recorded in fiscal  1992. The increase  is
     primarily attributable to an increase in Chaps by Ralph Lauren net revenues
     of  $30  million or  51%  to $89  million and  an  increase in  Puritan net
     revenues of $33 million including the  sale of the trademark in the  United
     States  to Wal-Mart for  $7.7 million. This  was partially offset  by a $16
     million or 23% decline in the Christian Dior business.
 
     Gross profit increased to $236.4 million in fiscal 1993 from $219.3 million
in fiscal 1992. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to  33.6%
in  fiscal 1993  from 35.1% in  fiscal 1992. The  decrease in gross  profit as a
percentage of net revenues reflects a  higher mix of menswear sales compared  to
the higher margin Intimate Apparel business, startup costs totaling $3.5 million
for three new intimate apparel plants in the Caribbean basin and the Miracle Bra
program for Victoria's Secret and the selling of excess dress shirt and neckwear
inventory at lower margins.
 
     INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Intimate Apparel Division gross profit increased
     10%  to  $167.7  million in  fiscal  1993  (39.6% of  intimate  apparel net
     revenues) from the $152.9 million (39.7% of intimate apparel net  revenues)
     recorded  in fiscal 1992.  The increase in  gross profit primarily reflects
     higher net  revenues noted  above.  Gross profit  as  a percentage  of  net
     revenues is down slightly due to the start-up costs mentioned above, offset
     by favorable manufacturing variances.
 
     MENSWEAR  DIVISION. Menswear  Division gross  profit increased  3% to $53.7
     million in fiscal 1993 (22.1% of menswear net revenues) from $52.3  million
     (26.1%  of menswear net revenues) recorded  in fiscal 1992. The decrease in
     gross margin reflects a considerable softness in the commodity dress  shirt
     and neckwear business and the selling of excess inventory at lower margins.
 
     Selling,  administrative and  general expenses increased  to $144.2 million
(20.5% of  net  revenues) in  fiscal  1993 from  $129.5  million (20.7%  of  net
revenues)  in fiscal 1992.  The increase in  selling, administrative and general
expenses reflects volume increases and an increase in advertising and  marketing
expense  to maintain  the Company's strong  Intimate Apparel  market position in
department stores and  increased penetration of  Fruit of the  Loom bras in  the
mass  merchandise market.  The decrease  in selling,  administrative and general
expenses as a  percentage of  net revenues  reflects continuing  efforts by  the
Company  to operate efficiently  and control costs and  the spreading of certain
fixed costs over  the higher net  revenue base, partially  offset by the  higher
level of advertising and marketing costs.
 
     Interest  expense decreased 20% to $38.9  million in fiscal 1993 from $48.8
million recorded in fiscal 1992. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 1993
compared to fiscal 1992 reflects the impact of the
 
                                       16
 
<PAGE>
Company's recapitalization in March 1992, which included the sale of  10,000,000
shares  of common stock  and the refinancing  of all of  the Company's remaining
high yield debt in September 1993, which reduced the average rate of interest on
the Company's outstanding debt from nearly  14% during 1991 to 7.5% during  1992
to approximately 6% at the end of 1993. The Company's debt at the end of 1993 is
substantially  all bank debt at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%, with $250 million or
62% of total debt  locked in at  varying rates over the  next 2 years.  Interest
expense for fiscal 1993 includes approximately $3.3 million of non-cash interest
compared  to $4.3 million for fiscal 1992.  The decrease in non-cash interest in
fiscal 1993 compared to fiscal 1992 reflects a decrease in accretion related  to
the  Senior Discount Term  Notes which were redeemed  in full in  May 1992 and a
reduction in deferred financing cost amortization due to the early repayment  of
all of the Company's high yield debt obligations during 1992.
 
     The  non-recurring  expense  recorded  in  fiscal  1993  of  $22.5  million
represents a  $19.9 million  charge related  to anticipated  future losses  from
operations  and non-cash  writedowns of assets  from a portion  of the Company's
men's manufactured dress shirt and  neckwear business segment, which it  decided
to  discontinue in October, 1993  and $2.6 million of  costs associated with the
windup of the Company's Canadian womenswear business which was discontinued in a
prior year.
 
     In the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal 1992,  the  Company  adopted  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board Statement  No.  109, Accounting  for  Income Taxes,
('Statement No. 109') retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. Statement
No. 109 requires, among other things, the recognition of deferred tax assets for
the future benefit associated with  net operating loss carryforwards.  Statement
No. 109 further provides that companies evaluate all deferred tax assets for the
potential  to realize such benefits in future  periods and to record a valuation
allowance offsetting deferred tax assets in certain circumstances.
 
     In evaluating the Company's ability to realize the benefits associated with
its net operating loss carryforwards, the Company considered the following:
 
     (i)    the  expected  impact  of  temporary  (timing)  differences  between
            taxable income and income reported for financial statement purposes;
 
     (ii)   the  pro forma impact on the  Company's earnings for the three years
            in the period ending with fiscal 1993 of the Initial Public Offering
            of 13,800,000 shares of  common stock in October  1991, the sale  of
            the  10,000,000  shares  of  common stock  in  April  1992,  and the
            refinancing  and  repayment  of   certain  of  the  Company's   debt
            obligations during fiscal 1993 and 1992;
 
     (iii)   income  from continuing  operations recorded in  fiscal 1993 before
             income taxes, non-recurring and extraordinary items; and
 
     (iv)   the Company's expected future operating income.
 
Consistent with the provisions of Statement No. 109, the Company reevaluated its
deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter  of fiscal 1993 and reversed a  portion
of  its valuation allowance amounting  to $24.7 million in  addition to the $6.6
million benefit it recognized in fiscal 1992. After giving effect to the benefit
from the recognition of future net operating loss carryforwards, the Company has
approximately $64  million  of  unrecognized net  operating  loss  carryforwards
available  for financial reporting purposes  at the end of  fiscal 1993. The tax
benefits that  will  be  realized  from the  treatment  of  acquisition  related
liabilities  will  be  credited against  the  excess  of costs  over  net assets
acquired in the period such benefits accrue.
 
     The Company has total net operating loss carryforwards available to  offset
future  taxable income  amounting to  approximately $170  million at  January 8,
1994, a portion of which will be applied  to the excess of cost over net  assets
acquired.  These carryforwards, if fully utilized,  would result in a future tax
saving of approximately $60 million at current U.S. corporate income tax  rates.
The  net operating loss carryforwards expire  beginning in 2001 and fully expire
in 2007.
 
     The principal  differences between  net  operating loss  carryforwards  for
financial  reporting and tax purposes are  related to liabilities accrued at the
date of  the Acquisition  and the  difference  in basis  for tax  and  financial
reporting purposes of the Activewear Division, which was sold in 1990.

     As  a  result of  the  Common Stock  offering in  1991  and 1992  and other
ownership changes occurring  during the  prior three  year period,  a change  of
ownership   occurred  under  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  382,  which  will
effectively limit the rate  at which the Company  may utilize its net  operating
loss  carryforwards. The Company believes that it will ultimately realize all of
the benefits attributable to its net operating loss carryforwards; however,  the
amount  of such benefits that  the Company will realize  and the period in which
any benefit is  realized are subject  to several factors  including the  general
level  of  economic activity,  the  level of  earnings,  future changes  in U.S.
corporate income tax  laws and regulations,  potential Internal Revenue  Service
audit  adjustments and limitations on the ability  of the Company to utilize net
operating tax carryforwards  under the  Internal Revenue  Code. (See  Note 8  of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F-6 to F-19.)
 
     Income  from  continuing  operations  for  fiscal  1993  was  $53.3 million
compared to income from continuing operations  of $47.6 million in fiscal  1992.
The  increase in  income from  continuing operations of  $5.7 million  or 12% is
attributable to  increased  operating income,  lower  interest expense  and  the
income  tax benefit recorded partially offset by the $22.5 million non-recurring
expense noted above.
 
     Extraordinary losses  of  $(18.6)  million  (without  income  tax  benefit)
recorded  in  fiscal  1993  and $(57.6)  million  (without  income  tax benefit)
recorded in fiscal 1992 primarily relate  to premium payments and the  write-off
of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt.
 
     In  January 1993, the Company  adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 106,  Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits other than  Pensions
('Statement No. 106') and accordingly recorded a $(10.5) million non-cash charge
associated with the cumulative effect of adopting Statement No. 106.
 
     Net income for fiscal 1993 of $24.1 million reflects income from continuing
operations  of  $53.3  million,  partially offset  by  extraordinary  charges of
$(18.6) million and the $(10.5) million cumulative effect noted above.
 
     Net loss for fiscal 1992 of $(17.5) million reflects income from continuing
operations of  $47.6  million  offset  by the  extraordinary  losses  for  early
extinguishment  of debt of  $(57.6) million and the  loss from discontinuing the
women's accessories business of $(7.4) million.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
 
     On  October  14,  1993  the  Company  refinanced  its  outstanding   credit
obligations with a $500 million facility underwritten by The Bank of Nova Scotia
and  Citibank, N.A., with  General Electric Capital  Corporation, Credit Suisse,
Societe Generale and  the Union Bank  of Switzerland as  co-agents, all of  whom
were  existing lenders  to the Company.  The new facility  reduced the borrowing
rate of the Company  from LIBOR plus  2.75% to LIBOR  plus 1.25%. The  agreement
also  included provisions that  further reduced the  Company's borrowing rate as
the Company's credit rating from certain credit rating agencies improves. In May
1994 the Company received an investment grade senior debt credit rating of BBB-,
which decreased  the Company's  borrowing rate  to LIBOR  plus 75  basis  points
pursuant to the provisions of its credit agreement. In June 1994, as a result of
the  Company's acquisition of the Calvin Klein trademarks, rights and businesses
and the continued strong growth of the Company's existing businesses the Company
amended its credit agreement to increase the maximum amount available under  the
Company's  revolving line of credit by $35 million to $235 million. In addition,
in  response  to  favorable  conditions  in  the  credit  markets,  the  Company
negotiated  a further reduction in its borrowing  rate to LIBOR plus 0.5%. These
actions have served to significantly reduce the Company's cost of borrowing  and
have  increased the financial flexability of  the Company. The reductions in the
Company's borrowing  rate  resulted in  interest  savings of  approximately  $10
million in fiscal 1994.
 
     On  February 1, 1993 the Company entered into an agreement with the Bank of
Nova Scotia to provide the Company with a $40 million line of credit to be  used
for  the issuance of commercial letters  of credit (the 'L/C Facility'). Letters
of credit issued under the L/C Facility are secured by the applicable  inventory
until  such  letters of  credit have  been paid.  The facility  was subsequently
increased to $50 million,  with a 90 day  term draft acceptance sub-facility  of
$30   million  (subsequently  increased  to   $40  million).  The  total  amount
outstanding at any one time under both facilities may not exceed $80 million.

     In March 1994, the Company acquired the Calvin Klein worldwide  trademarks,
rights  and businesses for men's underwear  and acquired a worldwide license for
Calvin Klein men's accessories. In addition, the Company acquired the  worldwide
trademarks  and  rights  of  Calvin  Klein  women's  intimate  apparel  upon the
expiration of an existing license on December 31, 1994. The total purchase price
was $60.9 million,  consisting of a  cash payments of  $33.1 million, in  fiscal
1994,  $5.0 million in fiscal 1995 and  1,699,492 shares of Class A common stock
of the Company valued at its  fair market value of approximately $22.8  million.
The Company funded the cash payment by borrowing against the Company's revolving
line  of credit  (see Note  2 of Notes  to Consolidated  Financial Statements on
pages F-6 to F-19).
 
     In August 1994,  the Company  purchased 286,600 shares  of its  outstanding
common  stock on the open market at an  average price of $17.45 per share. Total
cost of the  purchase was $5  million and  was funded by  borrowing against  the
Company's revolving line of credit.
 
     The  Company's liquidity requirements arise primarily from its debt service
requirements and the funding of  the Company's working capital needs,  primarily
inventory  and  accounts receivable.  The  Company's borrowing  requirements are
seasonal, with  peak working  capital needs  arising at  the end  of the  second
quarter  and beginning  of the  third quarter  of the  fiscal year.  The Company
typically generates nearly  all of  its net operating  cash flow  in the  fourth
quarter  of  the  fiscal  year,  reflecting  third  quarter  and  fourth quarter
shipments and the sale of  inventory built during the  first half of the  fiscal
year. (See 'Seasonality'.)
 
     Cash  provided by  operating activities  for the  1994 fiscal  year totaled
approximately $77.8  million  compared to  $11.9  million in  fiscal  1993.  The
significant  improvement  is primarily  attributable to  an improvement  in both
inventory and accounts receivable  efficiencies resulting in  a decrease in  net
working  capital changes  of $38.1  million compared  to 1993  and increased net
income.
 
     Interest expense for fiscal 1994 totalled $32.5 million, a reduction of 17%
from the $38.9 million recorded in fiscal 1993. Interest includes  approximately
$1.2  million and $3.3  million of non-cash  interest in fiscal  1994 and fiscal
1993,  respectively.  Non-cash  interest  primarily  reflects  amortization   of
deferred debt issue costs. The actual level of interest expense that the Company
will incur in fiscal 1995 is dependent on several factors, including the overall
level  of interest rates, the  general level of economic  activity, the level of
retail sales and the Company's  need for working capital  to fund growth in  its
operations. In addition, the Company has purchased interest rate swap agreements
which  effectively fix the Company's rate of interest on $275 million of debt at
approximately 6.2% through fiscal 1995.
 
     At  January  7,  1995,  the  Company  had  approximately  $109  million  of
additional  borrowing available under its  bank facilities. The Company believes
that funds  available  under its  bank  facilities  together with  funds  to  be
generated  from  future  operations  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  the capital
expenditure requirements  and working  capital needs  of the  Company  including
interest and debt principal payments for the foreseeable future.
 
     Capital   expenditures  for   new  facilities,   improvements  to  existing
facilities and for  machinery and  equipment were  approximately $13.7  million,
$12.4  million  and $17.5  million  in the  1992,  1993 and  1994  fiscal years,
respectively. Depreciation expense  was $10.4  million, $9.2  million and  $10.8
million in the 1992, 1993 and 1994 fiscal years, respectively.
 
SEASONALITY
 
     The operations of the Company are somewhat seasonal, with approximately 57%
of  net  revenues,  61%  of  operating  income  before  non-recurring  items and
substantially all  of the  Company's  net cash  flow from  operating  activities
generated  in  the second  half  of the  fiscal  year. Generally,  the Company's
operations during  the  first  half  of  the  year  are  financed  by  increased
borrowings. The following sets

INFLATION
 
     The Company  does  not  believe  that the  relatively  moderate  levels  of
inflation  which have been experienced in  the United States, Canada and western
Europe have had a significant effect  on its net revenues or its  profitability.
Management  believes that, in the past, the Company has been able to offset such
effects by  increasing  prices or  by  instituting improvements  in  efficiency.
Mexico  historically has been  subject to high rates  of inflation; however, the
effects of high  rates of inflation  on the operation  of the Company's  Mexican
subsidiaries  have not had a material impact on the results of operations of the
Company.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
The Warnaco Group, Inc.
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Warnaco
Group,  Inc.  as  of  January 8,  1994  and  January 7,  1995,  and  the related
consolidated statements of  operations, stockholders' equity  and cash flow  for
each  of the three  years in the period  ended January 7,  1995. Our audits also
included the financial statement  schedule listed in the  Index at Item 14  (a).
These  financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our  responsibility is  to  express an  opinion on  these  financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.
 
     We  conducted  our audits  in accordance  with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also  includes
assessing  the  accounting principles  used  and significant  estimates  made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In  our opinion,  the consolidated  financial statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
The Warnaco  Group,  Inc. at  January  8, 1994  and  January 7,  1995,  and  the
consolidated  results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 7, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also,  in our  opinion, the  related financial  statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a  whole, presents  fairly in  all material  respects the  information set forth
therein.
 
     As discussed  in  Note 9  to  the consolidated  financial  statements,  the
Company  changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions in 1993.

                            THE WARNACO GROUP, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Organization:  The Warnaco Group, Inc.  (the 'Company') was incorporated in
Delaware on March 14, 1986 and on May 10, 1986 acquired substantially all of the
outstanding shares of Warnaco Inc.  ('Warnaco') (the 'Acquisition'). Warnaco  is
the principal operating subsidiary of the Company.
 
     Basis  of  Consolidation  and Presentation:  The  accompanying consolidated
financial statements include  the accounts of  The Warnaco Group,  Inc. and  all
subsidiary  companies for the years  ended January 2, 1993,  January 8, 1994 and
January 7,  1995. The  1993 fiscal  year included  53 weeks  of operations.  The
impact  of the additional week of operations  was not material to the operations
of the Company. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
 
     Translation of Foreign Currencies: Cumulative translation adjustments arise
primarily from  consolidating foreign  operations and  are applied  directly  to
stockholders' equity.
 
     Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the  lower of cost, determined on a

</TABLE>
 
     Licenses, trademarks and  other intangible  assets are  amortized over  the
estimated  economic life  of the  assets which  range from  20 to  40 years. The
excess of cost over net assets acquired is amortized over 40 years. The carrying
value of the excess of cost over  net assets acquired will be reviewed if  facts
and  circumstances suggest that it  may be impaired. If  such a determination is
made, the  Company  will reduce  the  carrying  value of  this  asset.  Deferred
financing  costs are amortized over the life of the related debt, using the debt
outstanding method.
 
     Start up  costs:  The Company  defers  certain costs  associated  with  the
start-up  of new manufacturing  facilities and certain  new businesses. Deferred
costs are amortized using the straight-line method principally over five  years.
Start-up costs, net of accumulated amortization were $11,994,000 and $19,982,000
at  January 8, 1994 and January 7,  1995, respectively and are included in other
assets.
 
     Employee Retirement  Plans: The  Company has  non-contributory pension  and
profit  sharing  retirement  plans  for  the  benefit  of  qualifying employees.
Contributions are deposited  with fund  managers who  invest the  assets of  the
plans.
 
     Income  Taxes:  The  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 109 effective with its 1992 fiscal year.
 
     Capitalized  Leases:  The   asset  values  and   related  amortization   of
capitalized   leases  are  included  with  property,  plant  and  equipment  and
accumulated depreciation  and the  associated debt  is included  with  long-term
debt.
 
     Revenue  Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped
to customers.
 
     Income (Loss) Per Common Share: Income (loss) per common share is based  on
weighted  average  common  shares outstanding  after  deducting  preferred stock
dividends  and  taking  into  account  potential  dilution  from  common   stock
equivalents.
 
     Concentration  of credit risk: The Company sells its products to department
stores, specialty outlets, catalogs, direct sellers and mass merchandisers.  The
Company  performs  periodic  credit  evaluations  of  its  customers'  financial
condition and generally  does not  require collateral. Credit  losses have  been
within management's expectations. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company's  net revenues in any of the three years in the period ended January 7,
1995.

Subordinated Notes, (v) redemption of the entire principal amount outstanding of
the Company's 12 3/8% mortgage notes and (vi) repayment of certain capital lease

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     Operating  profit is  total revenue  less operating  expenses. In computing
operating profit,  none of  the  following items  has  been added  or  deducted:
general   corporate  expenses  --  net,  interest  expense,  and  income  taxes.
Non-recurring expense of  $22,500,000 in  fiscal 1993 and  $3,000,000 in  fiscal
1994 is included in general corporate expense -- net.
 
     Identifiable  assets are  those assets of  the Company  that are associated
with the operations in  each geographic area.  Corporate assets are  principally
property  and equipment, deferred financing costs, deferred income tax asset and
other assets.
 
NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES
 
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal  1992, retroactive to the beginning  of
fiscal  1992, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 109, Accounting  for Income  Taxes ('Statement  No. 109').  The adoption  of
Statement  No. 109 resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset amounting
to  approximately  $42,500,000  related  to  the  benefit  associated  with  net
operating  loss  carryforwards  to  be  realized in  future  periods  as  of the
beginning of fiscal 1992. The deferred tax asset was offset in its entirety by a
valuation allowance. During 1992, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common
stock generating net  proceeds of approximately  $161,310,000 (the  'Offering'),
refinanced or redeemed all of its outstanding high yield debt and repaid certain
other debt obligations (see Notes 11 and 12). The completion of the Offering and
debt  refinancing reduced  the Company's  annual interest  expense and preferred
stock dividends, on a pro forma basis, by approximately $34,000,000. As a result
of these transactions, in the fourth  quarter of 1992, the Company  re-evaluated
its deferred tax asset and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance related
to this asset amounting to $6,589,000.
 
     In  1993,  the  Company  recognized an  additional  deferred  tax  asset of
$1,541,000 (offset  in its  entirety by  a valuation  allowance) related  to  an
increase  in the  Company's statutory  tax rate  resulting from  tax legislation
passed in 1993.  In the  fourth quarter of  1993, the  Company re-evaluated  its
deferred tax asset and reversed an additional portion of its valuation allowance
amounting to $24,700,000 related to this asset.
 
     The Company recognized income tax benefits of $22,635,000 in the year ended
January  7, 1995 which  substantially offset the  Company's provision for income
taxes in fiscal 1994. At  January 8, 1994 and January  7, 1995, the Company  had
deferred  income tax assets of $53,924,000 and $38,505,000, respectively, offset
by a  valuation  allowance  of  $22,635,000 and  $0,  respectively.  Future  tax
benefits  of  $3,000,000 were  realized  in fiscal  1994  from the  treatment of
acquisition related liabilities and  were credited against  the excess of  costs
over net assets acquired.

     The  Company has received grants from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico which
allow the Company to exempt up to 87.5% 90% beginning with fiscal 1994 of income
earned in Puerto  Rico from taxation.  The grants expire  December 1, 2003.  Tax
benefits  realized amounted  to approximately  $1,315,000 ($0.03  per share) and
$733,000 ($0.02 per share) for  the years ended January  2, 1993 and January  8,
1994, respectively (none for the year ended January 7, 1995).
 
     The U.S. Statutory rate was: 1992, 34%; 1993, 35%; and 1994, 35%.

     At  January 7, 1995,  the Company had recognized  all available benefits of
its net operating loss carryforwards  for financial reporting purposes. For  tax
purposes,  the Company  has estimated U.S.  net operating  loss carryforwards of
approximately $110,000,000 which expire from 2001 through 2007.
 
     As a result  of the  1992 public stock  offering, the  1991 initial  public
offering  and  other ownership  changes  occurring during  the  prior three-year
period, a change of ownership occurred under Internal Revenue Code Section  382,
which  effectively limits  the rate  at which  the Company  may utilize  its net
operating loss carryforwards. Nevertheless, the Company expects that it will  be
able  to utilize  substantially all of  the net operating  loss carryforwards it
would have used, absent any Section 382 limitation.

NOTE 9 - EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
     PENSIONS
 
     The Company has a defined  benefit pension plan which covers  substantially
all  non-union domestic employees (the 'Plan').  The Plan is noncontributory and
benefits are  based upon  years of  service  and average  earnings for  the  six
(increasing  to ten years by  the year 1999 and fifteen  years by the year 2004)
highest  consecutive  calendar  years  of  compensation  immediately   preceding
retirement. Pension contributions are also made to foreign plans and directly to
union sponsored plans.
 
     The  funding policy for the Plan is to make, as a minimum contribution, the
equivalent of the minimum  required by the  Employee Retirement Income  Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA).

OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
 
     In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has defined  benefit
health  care and  life insurance plans  that provide  postretirement benefits to
retired employees and former directors. The plans are contributory, with retiree
contributions adjusted  annually, and  contain cost  sharing features  including
deductibles and co-insurance. The Company does not fund postretirement benefits.
 
     Effective  January  3, 1993,  the  Company adopted  Statement  on Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits
Other  than Pensions ('SFAS No. 106') and,  as a result, recorded an expense for
the cumulative effect of a change in the method of accounting for postretirement
benefits  of   $10,500,000   (without   income  tax   benefit).   The   periodic
postretirement  benefit cost for the  year ended Janaury 8,  1994 and January 7,
1995 consisted of  service cost  of $103,000 and  $83,000 and  interest cost  of
$897,000 and $598,000, respectively. Previously, these benefits were expensed on
an as incurred basis. Such expense amounted to $700,000 in 1992.
 
     The funded status of the plans is as follows:

                            THE WARNACO GROUP, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     The  weighted average  annual assumed  rate of  increase in  the per capita
costs of  covered benefits  (health care  cost trend  rate) for  the year  ended
January  8, 1994  was 13%  for years  1-4, 10%  for years  5-9 and  5% for years
thereafter. The weighted  average annual  assumed rate  of increase  in the  per
capita  costs of  covered benefits  (health care cost  trend rate)  for the year
ended January 7, 1995 was 11% for years 1-3, 9% for years 4-8, and 5% for  years
thereafter.  A 1% increase in the trend rate assumption would have increased the
cumulative effect adjustment  by approximately $442,000  and would increase  the
periodic  postretirement benefit cost  by approximately $44,000  and $34,000 for
the years ended January 8, 1994 and January 7, 1995, respectively. The  weighted
average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation  is  7.75%  and  8.75%  at  January  8,  1994  and  January  7,  1995
respectively, which is  consistent with the  discount rate used  in valuing  the
Company's pension plan.
 
     The  Company also sponsors defined contribution plans for substantially all
of its employees. Employees can contribute to  the plans, on a pre-tax basis,  a
percentage  of their qualifying compensation up  to the legal limits allowed. No
Company contributions are made to such plans.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     On October 14, 1993 the Company entered into a new financing agreement (the
'1993 Financing'), with substantially the same lenders as those in the Company's
previous financing agreement. The 1993  Financing provided for a revolving  loan
of  up to $200 million (subsequently increased  to $235 million) and a term note
of $300 million  at the lender's  base rate plus  0.5%. It also  provided for  a
LIBOR option at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%. LIBOR and base interest rates change
as the Company's debt ratings from S&P or Moody's ('Rating Agencies') change. In
May  1994 the Company  obtained a senior  credit rating of  BBB- from the Rating
Agencies, which reduced the interest  rate payable on the Company's  outstanding
debt  to LIBOR  plus 75 basis  points. In  addition, in June  1994 the Company's
negotiated a further reduction in the interest rate on the Company's outstanding
debt obligations to LIBOR plus 0.5%.
 
     Certain provisions in  the 1993 Financing  require the Company  to fix  the
interest  rate  on not  less than  $125  million of  the Company's  $500 million
(subsequently increased  to $535  million) facility.  As a  result, the  Company
entered  into agreements which effectively fixed  the Company's interest rate on
$25 million at  6.31%, $150  million at  6.57% and  $100 million  at 4.29%.  The
agreements   expire  in  October  1995,  October  1996  and  January  1996.  The
differential to be paid or received is  accrued as interest rates change and  is
recognized  over  the life  of the  agreements. The  risk associated  with these
agreements is the cost of replacing them  at current market rates, in the  event
of  default by the counterparties. Management believes that such risk is remote.
Interest expense over  the life of  the interest rate  swap agreements would  be
approximately  $1,821,000 higher if the Company had to pay interest at the three
month libor  rate (.4375%  as of  January 7,  1995) on  amounts covered  by  the
interest rate swap agreements.
 
     Amounts  drawn under the  revolving credit facility are  not limited by any
borrowing base.  Substantially  all  of  the Company's  assets  are  pledged  as
security against various financing agreements. Pursuant to the provisions of the
1993 Financing all collateral will be automatically and completely released upon
the Company's achievement of a specified credit rating from the Rating Agencies.
The  Company is also  required to pay a  .25% commitment fee to  the bank on its
unused portion  of the  revolving  credit facility  which  at January  7,  1995,
amounted to approximately $109,000,000.
 
     The   1993   Financing  contains   various  covenants   concerning  capital
expenditures and  additional  debt and  requires  the Company  to  meet  certain
defined  financial tests,  which as  of January  7, 1995,  were as  follows: (1)
interest  coverage   ratio   of   3.3   to   1;   (2)   minimum   adjusted   net
worth  --  $165,000,000; (3)  fixed  charge coverage  ratio  of 1.25  to  1; (4)
leverage ratio of 0.625  to 1 and (5)  minimum earnings before interest,  taxes,
depreciation  and amortization (EBITDA) of $108,000,000. At January 7, 1995, the
Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the 1993 Financing.
 
     The Company believes that the fair market value of its outstanding variable
rate debt is approximately equal to the outstanding principal amount thereof  as
(i)  substantially all  of the Company's  debt bears interest  at floating rates
(market) and  (ii) there  are no  prepayment  premiums required  by any  of  the
Company's material debt agreements.
 
     On  April  2, 1992  the  Company entered  into  a Financing  Agreement (the
'Financing')  that  provided  for  a  revolving  loan  of  up  to  $125  million
(subsequently  increased to $200,000,000  in May 1993)  and a term  loan of $225
million (subsequently increased to $325 million in October 1992) at the lender's
base rate plus 1.5%  for advances under the  revolving credit facility and  base
rate plus 2% for advances under the term loan. The Financing also provides for a
LIBOR  option at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% for the revolving loan and LIBOR plus
3% for the term loan. The Financing was replaced by the 1993 Financing.
 
     Cash interest paid amounted to $44,535,000, $37,069,000 and $30,680,000  in
the  years  ended  January  2,  1993,  January  8,  1994  and  January  7, 1995,
respectively.
 
     The Company issues stand-by and  commercial letters of credit  guaranteeing
the  Company's  performance under  certain purchase  agreements. The  letters of
credit are issued under the terms of the

1993 Financing and the L/C  Facility (discussed below). Certain obligations  for
letters  of credit reduce amounts available  under the revolving loan portion of
the 1993 Financing.  At January  8, 1994  and January  7, 1995  the Company  had
outstanding   letters   of  credit   totalling  approximately   $16,159,000  and
$42,515,000, respectively, of  which $4,309,000  and $10,599,000,  respectively,
reduced  amounts available under the  revolving credit facilities outstanding at
those dates.
 
     In addition, on February 1, 1993 the Company entered into an agreement with
a bank to provide the Company with an additional credit facility of  $40,000,000
for  the issuance  of commercial  letters of  credit (the  'L/C Facility'). This
facility was subsequently increased to $50,000,000, and expanded to include a 90
day term draft  acceptance sub-facility of  $30,000,000, which was  subsequently
increased  to $40,000,000. Total amounts  outstanding under these facilities may
not exceed $80,000,000.  Letters of  credit issued  under the  L/C Facility  are
secured  by the applicable inventory  until such letters of  credit are paid and
amounted to $11,850,000 and $31,916,000 at January 8, 1994 and January 7,  1995,
respectively.  The L/C Facility is  for a term of one  year and does not require
the Company to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion.
 
     The Company is required to maintain compensating balances securing  certain
credit  arrangements. Such balances amounted to $112,000 and $114,000 at January
8, 1994 and January 7, 1995,  respectively. In addition, the Company  classifies
lock  box receipts not available until the next business day as restricted cash.
Such balances amounted to $774,000 and $1,804,000 at January 8, 1994 and January
7, 1995, respectively.
 
NOTE 12 - CAPITAL STOCK
 
     On  August  25,  1994  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized   a
two-for-one  stock split  for stockholders  of record  on September  8, 1994 and
effective October 3, 1994. The split increased the number of outstanding  shares
of  Class A Common  Stock and outstanding  options by 100%.  Exercise prices for
outstanding options were adjusted to  reflect the split. All outstanding  shares
and  per share information has  been restated to reflect the  split as if it had
occurred at the beginning of each period presented.
 
     On May 14, 1993, the stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the
Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which authorized the
issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of  $.01
and increased the authorized number of shares of common stock from 40,000,000 to
65,000,000.
 
     On  April 2,  1992, the  Company sold 10,000,000  shares of  Class A Common
Stock to the public at  an offering price of $17.25  per share. Net proceeds  of
the  offering were  approximately $161,310,000  and were  used to  repay certain
indebtedness and redeem the Company's Class A and Class B Preferred Stock.
 
     Prior to May 1994, dividends  to common stockholders were restricted  under
certain  covenants of the debt agreements. The provisions of the debt agreements
restricting the Company's ability to  pay dividends were automatically  modified
upon the Company's achievement of an investment grade senior debt rating of BBB-
from  Standard  & Poor's  and,  as a  result, the  Company  may declare  and pay
dividends equal to 25% of the Company's earnings accumulated since fiscal 1993.
 
     In 1988, the Company adopted the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  ('Stock
Purchase  Plan'). The Stock Purchase Plan provides  for sales of up to 4,800,000
shares of Class  A Common  Stock of  the Company  to certain  key employees.  At
January  8, 1994 and January 7, 1995, 4,533,150 and 4,521,300 shares were issued
and outstanding pursuant to grants under the Stock Purchase Plan,  respectively.
The  Stock Purchase  Plan is  administered by  the Employee  Stock Purchase Plan
Administrative Committee of the Board of  Directors which has full authority  to
determine  the number  of shares granted  or sold,  vesting requirements, voting
requirements and conditions of any stock purchase agreement between the  Company
and a key employee.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     All  shares were sold at amounts determined  to be equal to the fair market
value of  the  shares.  The  shares are  subject  to  vesting  requirements  and
restrictions  on  the  transfer  of ownership.  In  addition,  certain employees
elected to pay for the shares granted by executing a Promissory Note payable  to
the  Company. Notes totalling  $8,394,000 and $6,561,000 at  January 8, 1994 and
January 7, 1995  are non-interest bearing,  while the balance  earn interest  at
approximately  8%.  The note  maturities  range from  five  to ten  years. Notes
receivable from  employees  are  deducted  from  stockholders'  equity  and  are
principally owed by officers and directors of the Company.
 
     During  1991, the  Company established The  Warnaco Group,  Inc. 1991 Stock
Option Plan  ('Option Plan')  and authorized  the issuance  of up  to  1,500,000
shares  of Class A Common Stock  to cover grants to be  made under the plan. The
Option Plan is  administered by a  committee of  the Board of  Directors of  the
Company  which determines the  number of stock  options to be  granted under the
Option Plan,  and the  terms and  conditions  of such  grants. The  Option  Plan
provides  for  the granting  of qualified  stock options  within the  meaning of
Internal Revenue Code Section 422 and non-qualified stock options. In  addition,
the  Option Plan limits  the amount of  qualified stock options  that may become
exercisable by any  individual during  a calendar  year and  limits the  vesting
period for options awarded under the Option Plan.
 
     On  May 14,  1993, the  stockholders approved  the adoption  of The Warnaco
Group, Inc. 1993  Stock Plan  ('Stock Plan'). The  Stock Plan  provided for  the
issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company through awards
of  stock  options, stock  appreciation  rights, performance  awards, restricted
stock units and stock unit awards. On May 12, 1994 the stockholders approved  an
amendment to the Plan whereby the number of shares issuable under the Stock Plan
is  automatically increased each year by 3%  of the outstanding number of shares
of Class A Common Stock of the Company as of the beginning of each fiscal  year.
The  total number of shares available for  issuance under the Plan as of January
8, 1995 was 4,462,021. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  has
the  sole and  complete authority  to make  awards under  the Stock  Plan and to
determine the specific  terms and  conditions of  such awards,  except that  the
exercise  price of any award may  not be less than the  fair market value of the
Company's common stock at the date of the grant.
 
     In May 1994 the  Company's stockholders approved the  adoption of the  1993
Non-Employee  Director Stock Plan ('Director  Plan'). The Director Plan provides
for awards of  up to  400,000 non-qualified stock  options to  directors of  the
Company who are not employees of the Company. Options granted under the Director
Plan are exercisable in whole or in part until the earlier of ten years from the
date  of the grant or one year from the date on which an optionee ceases to be a
Director eligible for grants.  Options are granted at  the fair market value  of
the  Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant. The Director Plan provides
for the automatic grant of options to purchase (i) 30,000 shares of common stock
upon a Director's election to the  Company's Board of Directors and (ii)  10,000
shares  of common stock immediately  following each Annual Shareholders' Meeting
as of the date of such meeting.

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                           ARTICLE II

           COMMITMENTS, BORROWING PROCEDURES AND NOTES

     Section 2.1.  Commitment.  On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement (including Article V), each Lender
severally agrees as follows.

     Section 2.1.1.  Commitment.  From time to time on any
Business Day occurring prior to the Commitment Termination Date,
each Lender severally agrees, subject to the terms of this
Agreement (including Article V) that it will make loans (relative

                                  -9-
<PAGE>

to such Lender, its "Loans") to the Borrower equal to its
Percentage of the aggregate amount of the Borrowing of Loans
requested by the Borrower to be made on such day or otherwise
required to be made pursuant to the terms of Section 2.3.  No
Lender's obligation to make any Loan shall be affected by any
other Lender's failure to make any Loan.  On the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, the Borrower may from time to
time borrow, prepay and reborrow Loans.  Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, so long as any Lender whose
Percentage to make Loans is less than 51% shall be in default in
its obligation to fund its pro rata share of any Loans (as
notified to such Lender by the Agent, the Agent agreeing to use
good faith efforts to give such notification promptly following
the occurrence of such default) or shall have rejected its
obligations under its Commitment, then such Lender whose
Percentage to make Loans is less than 51% shall not be entitled
to receive any payments of principal of or interest on its pro
rata share of the Loans or its share of any commitment or other
fees payable hereunder unless and until (x) the Loans of all the
other Lenders and all interest thereon have been paid in full,
(y) such failure to fulfill its obligation to fund is cured or
(z) the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared
or shall have become immediately due and payable, and for
purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the
Loan Documents, such Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender"
hereunder and such  Lender's Percentage shall each be deemed to
be zero (0).  No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or
otherwise affected by any such failure or rejections by any other
Lender.  Any payments of principal of or interest on Obligations
which would, but for this Section, be paid to any Lender, shall
be paid to the Lenders who shall not be in default under their
respective Commitments and who shall not have rejected any
Commitment, for application to the Obligations in such manner and
order (pro rata among such Lenders) as shall be determined by the
Agent.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that a Lender's
failure to make a Loan based on the Borrower's failure to satisfy
one or more of the conditions precedent to the making of Loans
set forth in Article V shall not be construed as such Lender
being in default of its obligations to fund its pro rata share of
Loans or a rejection of such Lender's obligations under its
Commitment.

     Section 2.1.2.  Lenders Not Permitted or Required To Make
Loans Under Certain Circumstances.  No Lender shall be permitted
or required to make any Loan if, after giving effect thereto, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans 

          (a)  made by all Lenders would exceed the then
     effective Commitment Amount; or 

                                  -10-
<PAGE>


          (b)  made by such Lender would exceed such Lender's
     Percentage multiplied by the Commitment Amount.

     Section 2.2.  Reduction of Commitment Amount.  The Borrower
may, from time to time on any Business Day, voluntarily reduce
the Commitment Amount; provided, however, that all such
reductions shall require at least three Business Days' prior
notice to the Agent and be permanent.

     Section 2.3.  Borrowing Procedure.  By delivering a
Borrowing Request to the Agent on or before 2:00 p.m., New York
time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time
irrevocably request, on not less than three nor more than five
Business Days' notice (in the case of LIBO Rate Loans) and on the
date of such Borrowing (in the case of Base Rate Loans), that a
Borrowing be made in an amount not to exceed the full amount of a
Disbursement under a Letter of Credit.  Proceeds of such Loans
shall be used only to fund the Reimbursement Obligations in
respect of Letters of Credit under which a Disbursement was made
on the date of the Loan.

     On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each Borrowing shall be comprised of the type of
Loans, and shall be made on the Business Day, specified in such
Borrowing Request.    

     Section 2.4.  Continuation and Conversion Elections.  By
delivering a Continuation/Conversion Notice to the Agent on or
before 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a Business Day, the Borrower
may from time to time irrevocably elect, on not less than three
nor more than five Business Days' notice that all, or any portion 
of any Loans be, in the case of Base Rate Loans, converted into
LIBO Rate Loans or, in the case of a LIBO Rate Loan, converted
into a Base Rate Loan or continued as a LIBO Rate Loan (in the
absence of delivery of a Continuation/Conversion Notice with
respect to any LIBO Rate Loan at least three Business Days before
the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto, such LIBO Rate Loan shall, on such last day,
automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan unless such Loan is
otherwise required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (including the first sentence of Section 3.1));
provided, however, that no portion of the outstanding principal
amount of any Loans may be continued as, or be converted into,
LIBO Rate Loans when any Default has occurred and is continuing. 

     Section 2.5.  Funding.  Each Lender may, if it so elects,
fulfill its obligation to make, continue or convert LIBO Rate
Loans hereunder by causing one of its foreign branches or 
affiliates (or an international banking facility all of the
capital stock or other ownership interests of which are wholly-
owned by such Lender) to make or maintain such LIBO Rate Loan;

                                  -11-
<PAGE>

provided, however, that such LIBO Rate Loan shall nonetheless be
deemed to have been made and to be held by such Lender, and the
obligation of the Borrower to repay such LIBO Rate Loan shall
nevertheless be to such Lender for the account of such foreign
branch, affiliate or international banking facility; provided,
further that the Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount
under this Section or Section 4.6 that is greater than the amount
which it would have been required to pay had such Lender not
caused such branch, affiliate or facility to make or maintain
such LIBO Rate Loan.  In addition, the Borrower hereby consents
and agrees that, for purposes of any determination to be made for
purposes of Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, it shall be
conclusively assumed that such Lender elected to fund all LIBO
Rate Loans by purchasing Dollar deposits in its LIBOR Office's
interbank eurodollar market. 

     Section 2.6.  Notes.  Each Lender's Loans under the
Commitment shall be evidenced by a Note payable to the order of
such Lender in a maximum principal amount equal to such Lender's
Percentage of Loans multiplied by the Commitment Amount.  The
Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make (or
cause to be made) appropriate notations on the grid attached to
such Lender's Note (or on any continuation of such grid), which
notations, if made, shall evidence, inter alia, the date of, the
outstanding principal of, and the interest rate and Interest
Period applicable to the Loans evidenced thereby.  Such notations
shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest
error; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make
any such notations shall not limit or otherwise affect any
Obligations of the Borrower.

     Section 2.7.  Extension of Commitment Termination Date.  The
Commitment Termination Date may be extended by the Lenders in
their sole and absolute discretion upon written request of the
Borrower received at least 60 days but not more than 90 days
prior to the then effective Commitment Termination Date (as such
date may have been extended).  The Lenders shall give written
notice to the Borrower of their decision and, if approved, of the
new Commitment Termination Date; provided, that notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the modified Commitment Termination Date exceed 364
days from the then expiring Commitment Termination Date.  The
Lenders shall give written notice to the Borrower of their
decision within 30 days of request.  In the absence of notice by
any one of the Lenders, the then effective Commitment Termination
Date shall not be extended and shall terminate and expire as
otherwise provided in this Agreement.

                           ARTICLE III

           REPAYMENTS, PREPAYMENTS, INTEREST AND FEES

     Section 3.1.  Repayments and Prepayments.  The Borrower
shall repay in full the entire unpaid principal amount of each
Loan upon the earlier of (i) at the election of the Borrower, no
later than 90 days following the date of the making of such Loan
(or, if different, on the last day of the Interest Period for
such Loan) and (ii) the Stated Maturity Date therefor.  Prior
thereto, the Borrower

          (a)  may, from time to time on any Business Day, make a
     voluntary prepayment, in whole or in part, of the
     outstanding principal amount of any Loans; provided,
     however, that 

               (i)  no such prepayment of any LIBO Rate Loan may
          be made on any day other than the last day of the
          Interest Period for such Loan; and

               (ii)  all such voluntary prepayments shall require
          at least one Business Day's prior written notice to the
          Agent; 

          (b)  shall, on each date when any reduction in the
     Commitment Amount shall become effective, make a mandatory
     prepayment of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
     all Loans then outstanding in an amount equal to the excess,
     if any, of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
     Loans over the Commitment Amount, as so reduced; and

           (c)  shall, immediately upon any acceleration of the
      Stated Maturity Date of any Obligations pursuant to Section
      8.2 or Section 8.3, repay all Obligations, unless, pursuant
      to Section 8.3, only a portion of all Obligations is so
      accelerated.

Each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to this Section shall
be without premium or penalty, except as may be required by
Section 4.4.  No voluntary prepayment of principal of any Loans
shall cause a reduction in the Commitment Amount. 

      Section 3.2.  Interest Provisions.  Interest on the
outstanding principal amount of Loans shall accrue and be payable
in accordance with this Section 3.2. 

                                  -13-
<PAGE>


      Section 3.2.1.  Rates.  Loans comprising a Borrowing shall
accrue interest at a rate per annum:

           (a)  on that portion maintained from time to time as a
      Base Rate Loan, equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate
      from time to time in effect plus 3/4 of 1%; or

           (b)  on that portion maintained as a LIBO Rate Loan,
      during each Interest Period applicable thereto, equal to
      the sum of the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) for such
      Interest Period plus 1.250%.

      The "LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted)" means, relative to any
Loan to be made, continued or maintained as, or converted into, a
LIBO Rate Loan for any Interest Period, a rate per annum (rounded
upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/16 of 1%) determined
pursuant to the following formula:

         LIBO Rate         =                 LIBO Rate           
                                  -------------------------------
      (Reserve Adjusted)          1.00 - LIBOR Reserve Percentage

The LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) for any Interest Period for LIBO
Rate Loans will be determined by the Agent on the basis of the
LIBOR Reserve Percentage in effect on, and the applicable rates
furnished to and received by the Agent from Scotiabank, two
Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period.

      "LIBO Rate" means, relative to any Interest Period for LIBO
Rate Loans, the rate of interest equal to the average of the
rates per annum at which Dollar deposits in immediately available
funds are offered to Scotiabank's LIBOR Office in the London
interbank market as at or about 11:00 a.m. London time two
Business Days prior to the beginning of such Interest Period for
delivery on the first day of such Interest Period, and in an
amount approximately equal to the amount of Scotiabank's LIBO
Rate Loan and for a period approximately equal to such Interest
Period.

      "LIBOR Reserve Percentage" means, relative to any Interest
Period for LIBO Rate Loans, the reserve percentage, if any
(expressed as a decimal) equal to the maximum aggregate reserve
requirements (including all basic, emergency, supplemental,
marginal and other reserves and taking into account any
transitional adjustments or other scheduled changes in reserve
requirements) specified under regulations issued from time to
time by the F.R.S. Board and then applicable to assets or
liabilities consisting of and including "Eurocurrency
Liabilities", as currently defined in Regulation D of the F.R.S.
Board, having a term approximately equal or comparable to such
Interest Period.

                                  -14-
<PAGE>


      All LIBO Rate Loans shall bear interest from and including
the first day of the applicable Interest Period to (but not
including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest
rate determined as applicable to such LIBO Rate Loan.

      Section 3.2.2.  Post-Maturity Rates.  After the date any
principal amount of any Loan is due and payable (whether on the
Stated Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise), or after
any other monetary Obligation of the Borrower shall have become
due and payable, the Borrower shall pay, but only to the extent
permitted by law, interest (after as well as before judgment) on
such amounts at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the
Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 3%, and (ii) the then
applicable interest rate plus a margin of 1%.

      Section 3.2.3.  Payment Dates.  Interest accrued on each
Loan shall be payable, without duplication:

           (a)  on the Stated Maturity Date therefor;

           (b)  on the date of any optional or required payment
      or prepayment, in whole or in part, of principal
      outstanding on such Loan (including, with respect to LIBO
      Rate Loans, on the last day of each applicable Interest
      Period for such LIBO Rate Loan);

           (c)  with respect to any Loans maintained as Base Rate
      Loans, on each Quarterly Payment Date and, with respect to
      any Base Rate Loans converted into LIBO Rate Loans on a day
      when interest would not otherwise have been payable
      pursuant to the terms hereof, on the date of such
      conversion; and

           (d)  on that portion of any Loans the Stated Maturity
      Date of which is accelerated pursuant to Section 8.2 or
      Section 8.3, immediately upon such acceleration.

Interest accrued on Loans or other monetary Obligations arising
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document after the date
such amount is due and payable (whether on the Stated Maturity
Date, upon acceleration or otherwise) shall be payable upon
demand.

      Section 3.3.  Commitment Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay
to the Agent for the account of each Lender, for the period
(including any portion thereof when its Commitment is suspended
by reason of the Borrower's inability to satisfy any condition of
Article V) commencing on the Effective Date and continuing
through (but excluding) the Commitment Termination Date, a
commitment fee at the rate of 1/4 of 1% per annum on such
Lender's Percentage of the average daily unused portion of the

                                  -15-
<PAGE>

Commitment Amount.  Such commitment fees shall be non-refundable
and shall be payable by the Borrower in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date, commencing with the first such day following the
Effective Date and on the Commitment Termination Date.  


                           ARTICLE IV

             CERTAIN LIBO RATE AND OTHER PROVISIONS

      Section 4.1.  LIBO Rate Lending Unlawful.  If any Lender
shall determine (which determination shall, upon notice thereof
to the Borrower, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such
Lender to make, continue or maintain any Loan as, or to convert
any Loan into, a LIBO Rate Loan, the obligations the Lenders to
make, continue, maintain or convert into any such Loans shall,
upon such determination, forthwith be suspended until such Lender
shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist, and all LIBO Rate Loans shall
automatically convert into Base Rate Loans at the end of the then
current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if
required by such law or assertion. 

      Section 4.2.  Deposits Unavailable.  If any Lender shall
have determined that

           (a)  Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for
      the relevant Interest Period are not available to it in its
      relevant market; or

           (b)   by reason of circumstances affecting such
      Lender's relevant market, adequate means do not exist for
      ascertaining the interest rate applicable hereunder to LIBO
      Rate Loans,

then, upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower and the Agent,
the obligations of the Lenders under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4
to make or continue any Loans as, or to convert any Loans into,
LIBO Rate Loans shall forthwith be suspended until such Lender
shall notify the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist.

      Section 4.3.  Increased LIBO Rate Loan Costs, etc.  The
Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender for any increase in the
cost to such Lender of, or any reduction in the amount of any sum
receivable by such Lender in respect of, making or continuing (or
of its obligation to make or continue) any Loans as, or of
converting (or of its obligation to convert) any Loans into, LIBO

                                  -16-
<PAGE>

Rate Loans.  Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Agent in writing of the occurrence of any such event, such
notice to state, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and
the additional amount required fully to compensate such Lender
for such increased cost or reduced amount.  Such additional
amounts shall be payable by the Borrower directly to such Lender
within five Business Days of its receipt of such notice, and such
notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower.

      Section 4.4.  Funding Losses.  In the event any Lender
shall incur any loss or expense (including any loss or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits
or other funds acquired by such Lender to make, continue or
maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Loan as, or
to convert any portion of the principal amount of any Loan into,
a LIBO Rate Loan, but excluding the loss of any anticipated or
expected profits in respect of such LIBO Rate Loan) as a result
of

           (a)  any conversion or repayment or prepayment of the
      principal amount of any LIBO Rate Loans on a date other
      than the scheduled last day of the Interest Period
      applicable thereto, whether pursuant to Section 3.1 or
      otherwise;

           (b)  any Loans not being made as LIBO Rate Loans in
      accordance with the Borrowing Request therefor; or

           (c)  any Loans not being continued as, or converted
      into, LIBO Rate Loans in accordance with the Continuation/
      Conversion Notice therefor,

then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the Borrower and
the Agent, the Borrower shall, within five Business Days of its
receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender such amount as will
(in the reasonable determination of such Lender) reimburse such
Lender for such loss or expense.  Such written notice (which
shall include calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the
Borrower.

      Section 4.5.  Increased Capital Costs, etc.  If the
implementation of or, after the date hereof, the introduction or
any change in the interpretation of, or any change in its
application to the Borrower and/or the Lenders of, any law or any
regulation or guideline issued by any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
including any eurocurrency or other reserve or special deposit
requirement or any tax (other than tax which is on a Lender's
general net or gross income or in respect of a Lender's franchise

                                  -17-
<PAGE>

taxes) or any capital requirement, has, due to a Lender's
compliance, the effect, directly or indirectly, of (i) increasing
the cost to such Lender of performing its obligations hereunder
or under any Loan; (ii) reducing any amount received or
receivable by such Lender or its effective return hereunder or in
respect of any Loan or on its capital; or (iii) causing such
Lender to make any payment or to forgo any return based on any
amount received or receivable by such Lender hereunder or in
respect of any Loan, then upon demand from time to time the
Borrower shall pay such amount as shall compensate such Lender
for any such cost, reduction, payment or foregone return upon
receipt of the certificate referred to in the last sentence of
this paragraph.  Any certificate of any Lender in respect of the
foregoing will be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower,
except for manifest error, and shall set forth a determination of
the amounts owing to such Lender in good faith using any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  Anything in this
Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding,
no Lender shall be indemnified for, exculpated from, or relieved
from liability, under this Agreement or any Loan Document, for
any act or omission constituting gross negligence or wilful
misconduct.

      Section 4.6.  Taxes.  (a)  Each payment made by the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of,
and without deduction for, any present or future withholding or
other taxes imposed on such payments by or on behalf of any
government or any political subdivision or agency thereof or
therein, except for any income, franchise and other taxes imposed
on the Lender (which for purposes of this Section 4.6 shall
include any branch, affiliate or international banking facility
created by a Lender to make or maintain a LIBO Rate Loan pursuant
to Section 2.5) by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such
Lender is organized or any political subdivision or agency
thereof or by the jurisdiction of such Lender's branch or lending
office or principal place of business (all such non-excluded
taxes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").  Whenever any
Taxes are payable by the Borrower with respect to any payments
hereunder, the Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Agent for
the account of the applicable Lender official receipts (to the
extent that the relevant governmental authority delivers such
receipts) evidencing payment of any such Taxes so withheld or
deducted.

      (b)  Each Lender that is not a "United States person" (as
such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986) shall submit to the Borrower on or before
the Effective Date (or, in the case of a Person that becomes a
Lender after the Effective Date by assignment or pursuant to
Section 2.5 promptly upon such assignment or funding) two duly
completed and signed copies of either (1) Form 1001 of the United

States Internal Revenue Service entitling such Lender to a
complete exemption from withholding on all amounts to be received
by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement or (2) Form 4224 of the
United States Internal Revenue Service relating to all amounts to
be received by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement.  Each such
Lender shall, from time to time after submitting either such
form, submit to the Borrower and the Agent such additional duly
completed and signed copies of one or the other such forms (or
such successor forms or other documents as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as
may be (1) reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or the
Agent and (2) appropriate under then current United States law or
regulations to avoid United States withholding taxes on payments
in respect of any amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant
to this Agreement.  Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower
or the Agent, each Lender that has not provided the forms or
other documents, as provided above, on the basis of being a
"United States person" shall submit to the Borrower and the Agent
a certificate to the effect that it is such a "United States
person".

      (c)  If any Lender which is not a "United States person"
determines that it is unable to submit to the Borrower and the
Agent any form or certificate that such Lender is requested to
submit pursuant to the preceding paragraph, or that it is
required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate, or
that any such form or certificate previously submitted has
otherwise become ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of such fact.

      (d)  The Borrower shall not be required to pay any
additional amount in respect of Taxes to any Lender if and only
to the extent that (A) such Lender is subject to such Taxes on
the Effective Date (or in the case of a Person that became a
Lender after the Effective Date by assignment or pursuant to
Section 2.5 on the date of such assignment or funding) or would
be subject to such Taxes on such date if a payment under this
Agreement has been received by it on such date; (B) such Lender
becomes subject to such Taxes subsequent to the date referred to
in clause (A) above (or in the case of a Lender which is not a
"United States person", the first date on which it delivers the
appropriate form or certificate to the Borrower as referred to in
clause (b) of this Section) as a result of a change in the
circumstances of such Lender (other than a change in applicable
law), including without limitation a change in the residence,
place of incorporation or principal place of business of the
Lender, a change in the branch or lending office of the Lender
participating in the transactions set forth herein or as a result
of the sale by the Lender of participating interests in such
Lender's creditor position(s) hereunder; or (C) such Taxes would
not have been incurred but for the failure of such Lender to file

                                  -19-
<PAGE>

with the appropriate tax authorities and/or provide to the
Borrower any form or certificate that it was required so to do
pursuant to clause (b) of this Section, unless the Lender is not
entitled to provide such form or certificate as a result of a
change in applicable law after the Effective Date (or in the case
of a Person that became a Lender after the Effective Date by
assignment or pursuant to Section 2.5 the date of such assignment
or funding).

      (e)  Within thirty (30) days after the written reasonable
request of the Borrower, each Lender shall execute and deliver to
the Borrower such certificates, forms or other documents which
can be furnished consistent with the facts and which are
reasonably necessary to assist the Borrower in applying for
refunds of Taxes paid by the Borrower hereunder or making payment
of Taxes hereunder; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
required to furnish to the Borrower any financial information
with respect to itself or other information which it considers
confidential.

      (f)  The Borrower shall have the right to require any
Lender which is not a "United States person" to which the
Borrower is required to make additional payments pursuant to
Section 4.6 hereof on account of Taxes (or would, upon payment to
such Lender of an amount hereunder, be so required) to assign
such Lender's total Loans and Commitments to one or more banks or
financial institutions identified by the Borrower and acceptable
to the Agent at a purchase price equal to the then outstanding
amount of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts then
owed to such Lender.

      Section 4.7.  Payments, Computations, etc.  Unless
otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document
shall be made by the Borrower to the Agent for the account of the
Lenders entitled to receive such payment.  All such payments
required to be made to the Agent shall be made, without setoff,
deduction or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
time, on the date due, in same day or immediately available
funds, to such account as the Agent shall specify from time to
time by notice to the Borrower.  To the extent the Agent receives
such funds prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, the Agent shall
promptly remit in same day funds to each Lender its share, if
any, of such payments received by the Agent for the account of
such Lender.  All interest and fees shall be computed on the
basis of the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring during the period for which
such interest or fee is payable over a year comprised of 360
days.  Whenever any payment to be made shall otherwise be due on
a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall (except as
otherwise required by clause (b) of the definition of the term

                                  -20-
<PAGE>

"Interest Period") be made on the next succeeding Business Day
and such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.

      Section er voluntary,
involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) in excess of
its Percentage of payments then or therewith obtained by all
Lenders, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such
participations as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from
such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and each
Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender
shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the
ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such selling Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion
of

           (a)  the amount of such selling Lender's required
      repayment to the purchasing Lender

to

           (b)  the total amount so recovered from the purchasing
      Lender)

of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing
Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another
Lender pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
pursuant to Section 4.9) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower
in the amount of such participation.  If under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives
a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section
applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise
its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this
Section to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured
claim.

      Section 4.9.  Setoff.  Each Lender shall, upon the
occurrence of any event or condition described in clause (f) of
Section 6.01 of the U.S. Credit Agreement or, with the consent of
the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence of any other Event of
Default, have the right to appropriate and apply to the payment
of the Obligations owing to it (whether or not then due) any and
all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the

                                  -21-
<PAGE>

Borrower then or thereafter maintained with or otherwise held by
such Lender; provided, however, that any such appropriation and
application shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.8. 
Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Agent
after any such setoff and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights
of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including other rights of setoff under applicable
law or otherwise) which such Lender may have.

      Section 4.10.  Use of Proceeds.  The Borrower shall apply
the proceeds of each Credit Extension in accordance with the
third recital and Section 2.3.

      Section 9.1.  Actions.  Each Lender hereby appoints
Scotiabank as its Agent under and for purposes of this Agreement,
the Notes and each other Loan Document.  Each Lender authorizes
the Agent to act on behalf of such Lender under this Agreement,
the Notes and each other Loan Document and, in the absence of
other written instructions from the Required Lenders received
from time to time by the Agent (with respect to which the Agent
agrees that it will comply, except as otherwise provided in this
Section or as otherwise advised by counsel), to exercise such
powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to
or required of the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers as may be reasonably incidental
thereto.  Each Lender hereby indemnifies (which indemnity shall
survive any termination of this Agreement) the Agent, pro rata
according to such Lender's Percentage, from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time
be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, the Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes and
any other Loan Document, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
and as to which the Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrower;
provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment
of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses which are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final proceeding to have resulted
solely from the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 
The Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder,
under the Notes or under any other Loan Document, or to prosecute
or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document, unless it is indemnified hereunder to its
satisfaction.  If any indemnity in favor of the Agent shall be or
become, in the Agent's determination, inadequate, the Agent may
call for additional indemnification from the Lenders and cease to
do the acts indemnified against hereunder until such additional
indemnity is given.

      Section 9.2.  Copies, etc.  The Agent shall give prompt
notice to each Lender of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to the Agent by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (unless concurrently delivered to the
Lenders by the Borrower).  The Agent will distribute to each
Lender each document or instrument received for its account and
copies of all other communications received by the Agent from the
Borrower for distribution to the Lenders by the Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                                  -30-

      Section 9.3.  Exculpation.  Neither the Agent nor any of
its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in connection
herewith or therewith, except for its own wilful misconduct or
gross negligence, nor responsible for any recitals or warranties
herein or therein, nor for the effectiveness, enforceability,
validity or due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or the validity, genuineness, enforceability,
existence, value or sufficiency of any collateral security, nor
to make any inquiry respecting the performance by the Borrower of
its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.  Any
such inquiry which may be made by the Agent shall not obligate it
to make any further inquiry or to take any action.  The Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal
matters and upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or
writing which the Agent believes to be genuine and to have been
presented by a proper Person.

      Section 9.4.  Successor.  The Agent may resign as such at
any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the Borrower and
all Lenders.  If the Agent at any time shall resign, the Required
Lenders may appoint another Lender as a successor Agent which
shall thereupon become the Agent hereunder.  If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent,
which shall be one of the Lenders or a commercial banking
institution organized under the laws of the U.S. (or any State
thereof) or a U.S. branch or agency of a commercial banking
institution, and having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $100,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
be entitled to receive from the retiring Agent such documents of
transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably
request, and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement.  After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as the Agent, the provisions of

           (a)  this Article IX shall inure to its benefit as to
      any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
      the Agent under this Agreement; and

           (b)  Section 10.3 and Section 10.4 shall continue to
      inure to its benefit.

      Section 9.5.  Loans Made by Scotiabank.  Scotiabank shall
have the same rights and powers with respect to (x) the Loans

                                  -31-
<PAGE>

made by it or any of its affiliates, and (y) the Notes held by it
or any of its affiliates, as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as if it were not the Agent.  Scotiabank and its
affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if Scotiabank were not
the Agent hereunder.

      Section 9.6.  Credit Decisions.  Each Lender acknowledges
that it has, independently of the Agent and each other Lender,
and based on such Lender's review of the financial information of
the Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents (the terms
and provisions of which being satisfactory to such Lender) and
such other documents, information and investigations as such
Lender has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to
extend its Commitment.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently of the Agent and each other Lender, and based
on such other documents, information and investigations as it
shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own
credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to
time  any rights and privileges available to it under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.


                            ARTICLE X

                    MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

      Section 10.1.  Waivers, Amendments, etc.  The provisions of
this Agreement and of each other Loan Document may from time to
time be amended, modified or waived, if such amendment,
modification or waiver is in writing and consented to by the
Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no
such amendment, modification or waiver which would:

           (a)  modify any requirement hereunder that any
      particular action be taken by all the Lenders or by the
      Required Lenders shall be effective unless consented to by
      each Lender;

           (b)  modify this Section 10.1, change the definition
      of "Required Lenders", increase the Commitment Amount or
      the Percentage of any Lender, release the Guarantor from
      its obligations under the Guaranty, reduce any fees
      described in Article III or extend the Commitment
      Termination Date shall be made without the consent of each
      Lender and each holder of a Note;

           (c)  extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of,
      any scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or

<PAGE>

      rate of interest on any Loan) shall be made without the
      consent of the holder of that Note evidencing such Loan; or
      
           (d)  affect adversely the interests, rights or
      obligations of the Agent in its capacity as the Agent shall
      be made without consent of the Agent.

No failure or delay on the part of the Agent, any Lender or the
holder of any Note in exercising any power or right under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other power or right.  No notice to or demand
on any Obligor in any case shall entitle it to any notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances.  No waiver or approval
by the Agent, any Lender or the holder of any Note under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, except as may be
otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to
subsequent transactions.  No waiver or approval hereunder shall
require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter
to be granted hereunder.

      Section 10.2.  Notices.  All notices and other
communications provided to any party hereto under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document shall be in writing or by Telex or by

      Section 10.3.  Payment of Costs and Expenses.  The Borrower
agrees to pay on demand all reasonable expenses of the Agent
(including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
counsel to the Agent and of local counsel, if any, who may be
retained by counsel to the Agent) in connection with

           (a)  the negotiation, preparation, execution and
      delivery of this Agreement and of each other Loan Document,
      including schedules and exhibits, and any amendments,
      waivers, consents, supplements or other modifications to
      this Agreement or any other Loan Document as may from time
      to time hereafter be required, whether or not the
      transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, and

                                  -33-
<PAGE>


           (b)  the preparation and review of the form of any
      document or instrument relevant to this Agreement or any
      other Loan Document. 

The Borrower covenants to pay on demand all reasonable costs and
expenses of the Agent and the Lenders incurred in the enforcement
of the Agent's or any Lender's rights under this Agreement and
any Loan Document.  All payments to be made to the Agent and the
Lenders hereunder shall, subject to Section 4.6, be made for
value on the date due and free of any withholding tax or levy,
other than taxes imposed on the net income of the Agent or a
Lender, and the Borrower covenants that such taxes or levies,
other than as excepted, shall be paid by the Borrower.  The
provisions of this paragraph will survive payment in full
hereunder.

      Section 10.4.  Indemnification.  In consideration of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Lender and the
extension of the Commitments, the Borrower hereby indemnifies,
exonerates and holds the Agent and each Lender and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") free and harmless from
and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, losses,
costs, liabilities and damages, and expenses incurred in
connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such
Indemnified Party is a party to the action for which
indemnification hereunder is sought), including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"), incurred by the Indemnified Parties or any of them
as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to 

           (a)  any transaction financed or to be financed in
      whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds
      of any Loan; or

           (b)  the entering into and performance of this
      Agreement and any other Loan Document by any of the
      Indemnified Parties (including any action brought by or on
      behalf of the Borrower as the result of any determination
      by the Required Lenders pursuant to Article V not to make
      any Credit Extension);

except for any such Indemnified Liabilities arising for the
account of a particular Indemnified Party by reason of the
relevant Indemnified Party's gross negligence or wilful
misconduct.

      Section 10.5.  Survival.  The obligations of the Borrower
under Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 10.3 and 10.4, and the
obligations of the Lenders under Section 9.1, shall in each case
survive any termination of this Agreement, the payment in full of

                                  -34-
<PAGE>

all Obligations and the termination of all Commitments.  The
representations and warranties made by the Borrower in this
Agreement and in each other Loan Document shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each such other Loan
Document.

      Section 10.6.  Severability.  Any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such provision and
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or such Loan Document or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

      Section 10.7.  Headings.  The various headings of this
Agreement and of each other Loan Document are inserted for
convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or
any provisions hereof or thereof.

      Section 10.8.  Execution in Counterparts, Effectiveness,
etc.  This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
several counterparts, each of which shall be executed by the
Borrower and the Agent and be deemed to be an original and all of
which shall constitute together but one and the same agreement. 
This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts hereof
executed on behalf of the Borrower and each Lender (or notice
thereof satisfactory to the Agent) shall have been received by
the Agent and notice thereof shall have been given by the Agent
to the Borrower and each Lender.

      Section 10.9.  Governing Law; Entire Agreement.  THIS
AGREEMENT, THE NOTES AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL EACH BE
DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  This Agreement, the Notes and the
other Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding among
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any prior agreements, written or oral, with respect
thereto.

      Section 10.10.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
provided, however, that:

           (a)  the Borrower may not assign or transfer its
      rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
      consent of the Agent and all Lenders; and

                                  -35-
<PAGE>


           (b)  the rights of sale, assignment and transfer of
      the Lenders are subject to Section 10.11.

      Section 10.11.  Sale and Transfer of Loans and Notes;
Participations in Loans and Notes.  Each Lender may assign, or
sell participations in, its Loans and Commitments to one or more
other Persons in accordance with this Section 10.11.

      Section 10.11.1.  Assignments.  Any Lender,

           (a)  with the written consents of the Borrower and the
      Agent (which consents shall not be unreasonably delayed or
      withheld) may at any time assign and delegate to one or
      more commercial banks or other financial institutions; and

           (b)  with notice to the Borrower and the Agent, but
      without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, may
      assign and delegate to any of its affiliates or to any
      other Lender or any Lender under the U.S. Credit Agreement

(each Person described in either of the foregoing clauses as
being the Person to whom such assignment and delegation is to be
made, being hereinafter referred to as an "Assignee Lender"), all
or a fraction of such Lender's total Loans and Commitments;
provided, that after giving effect to such assignment or
transfer, such Lender and its Assignee Lender shall each hold not
less than $5,000,000 of Loans and/or Commitments; provided,
further, that the Borrower shall not be required to pay an amount
under Section 4.6 that is greater than the amount which it would
have been required to pay had no assignment been made and
further, provided, however, that, the Borrower and the Agent
shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned and
delegated to an Assignee Lender until

           (c)  written notice of such assignment and delegation,
      together with payment instructions, addresses and related
      information with respect to such Assignee Lender, shall
      have been given to the Borrower and the Agent by such
      Lender and such Assignee Lender, 

           (d)  such Assignee Lender shall have executed and
      delivered to the Borrower and the Agent a Lender Assignment
      Agreement, accepted by the Agent, and

           (e)  the processing fees described below shall have
      been paid.

From and after the date that the Agent accepts such Lender
Assignment Agreement, (x) the Assignee Lender thereunder shall be
deemed automatically to have become a party hereto and to the

                                  -36-
<PAGE>

extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned
and delegated to such Assignee Lender in connection with such
Lender Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, and (y) the assignor Lender, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned and delegated by it
in connection with such Lender Assignment Agreement, shall be
released from its obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.  Within five Business Days after its receipt of notice
that the Agent has received an executed Lender Assignment
Agreement with respect to the assignment of Loans, the Borrower
shall execute and deliver to the Agent (for delivery to the
relevant Assignee Lender) new Notes evidencing such Assignee
Lender's assigned Loans and Commitments and, if the assignor
Lender has Loans and Commitments hereunder, replacement Notes in
the principal amount of the Loans and Commitments retained by the
assignor Lender hereunder (such Notes to be in exchange for, but
not in payment of, those Notes then held by such assignor
Lender).  Each such Note shall be dated the date of the
predecessor Notes.  The assignor Lender shall mark the
predecessor Notes "exchanged" and deliver them to the Borrower. 
Accrued interest on that part of the predecessor Notes evidenced
by the new Notes, and accrued fees, shall be paid as provided in
the Lender Assignment Agreement.  Accrued interest on that part
of the predecessor Notes evidenced by the replacement Notes shall
be paid to the assignor Lender.  Accrued interest and accrued
fees shall be paid at the same time or times provided in the
predecessor Notes and in this Agreement.  Such assignor Lender or
such Assignee Lender must also pay a processing fee to the Agent
upon delivery of any Lender Assignment Agreement in the amount of
$2,500.  Any attempted assignment and delegation not made in
accordance with this Section 10.11.1 shall be null and void.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from
pledging its rights (but not its obligations to make Loans and to
issue or participate in Letters of Credit) under this Agreement
and/or its Loans and/or Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank
in support of borrowing made by such Lender from such Federal
Reserve Bank.

      Section 10.11.2.  Participations.  Any Lender may at any
time sell to one or more commercial banks or other Persons (each
of such commercial banks and other Persons being herein called a
"Participant") participating interests in any of the Loans,
Commitments, or other interests of such Lender hereunder;
provided, however, that

           (a)  no participation contemplated in this
      Section 10.11 shall relieve such Lender from its
      Commitments or its other obligations hereunder or under any
      other Loan Document,

                                  -37-
<PAGE>


           (b)  such Lender shall remain solely responsible for
      the performance of its Commitments and such other
      obligations,

           (c)  the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal
      solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
      such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
      and each of the other Loan Documents,

           (d)  no Participant, unless such Participant is an
      affiliate of such Lender, or is itself a Lender, shall be
      entitled to require such Lender to take or refrain from
      taking any action hereunder or under any other Loan
      Document, except that such Lender may agree with any
      Participant that such Lender will not, without such
      Participant's consent, take any actions of the type
      described in clause (b) or (c) of Section 10.1, and 

           (e)  the Borrower shall not be required to pay any
      amount under Section 4.6 that is greater than the amount
      which it would have been required to pay had no
      participating interest been sold.

      Section 10.12.  Other Transactions.  Nothing contained
herein shall preclude the Agent or any other Lender from engaging
in any transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of
its affiliates in which the Borrower or such affiliate is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. 

      Section 10.13.  Forum Selection and Consent to
Jurisdiction.  ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF THE AGENT, THE LENDERS OR
THE BORROWER SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT
COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
THAT ANY SUIT SEEKING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ANY COLLATERAL OR OTHER
PROPERTY MAY BE BROUGHT, AT THE AGENT'S OPTION, IN THE COURTS OF
ANY JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE
FOUND.  THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION AS
SET FORTH ABOVE AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY
JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LITIGATION. 
THE BORROWER FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF
PROCESS BY REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, OR BY PERSONAL
SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  THE BORROWER
HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT

                                  -38-
<PAGE>

PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE OR HEREAFTER
MAY HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH
LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  TO THE
EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY
IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS
(WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT,
ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO
ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

      Section 10.14.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS
THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN)
OR ACTIONS OF THE AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE ISSUER OR THE BORROWER. 
THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED
FULL AND SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROVISION (AND EACH
OTHER PROVISION OF EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A
PARTY) AND THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PROVISION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENT, THE ISSUER AND THE LENDERS
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

      Section 10.15.  Usury Restraint.  The provisions of this
Agreement shall be subject to any applicable law, regulation,
order, rule or direction (a "Usury Restraint") which prohibits or
restricts the charging, receipt or retention of interest or other
amounts at the rates and amounts set forth herein (the "Stated
Rate") in excess (the "Excess") of the maximum rates or amount
(the "Maximum Rate") stipulated in the Usury Restraint.  The
provisions of this Agreement shall not require the payment or
permit the collection of interest in excess of the Maximum Rate
from time to time.  If the Lenders comply (whether or not
required to do so at law) with such Usury Restraint then, to the
extent permitted by law, a subsequent reduction in the Stated
Rate below the Maximum Rate shall be deemed not to reduce the
Stated Rate below the Maximum Rate until the total amount of
interest and other amounts earned and retained, measured by a
dollar amount, equals the amount of interest and other amounts
which would have been earned and retained hereunder, inclusive of
the Excess, measured by a dollar amount, if the Stated Rate had
not been held at the Maximum Rate or any amount had not been
refunded to the Borrower.

                                  -39-

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto

          $10,000,000, and".

     SECTION  2.  Conditions  of  Effectiveness.  This  Amendment  shall  become

counterparts of this Amendment executed by the Borrower,  Group and the Required

     or filing with, any governmental  authority or regulatory body or any other
     third  party is  required  for the due  execution,  delivery,  recordation,
     filing or  performance  of this  Amendment or the Consent by any Loan Party
     party thereto, or of any of the Loan Documents, as amended hereby, to which
     such  Loan  Party is or is to be a party,  or for the  consummation  of the
     transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

          (d) This Amendment has been, and the Consent when delivered  hereunder
     will have been,  duly  executed  and  delivered  by each Loan  Party  party
     thereto. This Amendment and each of the Loan Documents,  as amended hereby,

     enforceability  of this Amendment,  the Consent or any other Loan Document,
     as amended  hereby or the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
     hereby or thereby or (ii)  except as set forth on  Schedule  4.01(i) to the
     Credit  Agreement,  is or would be  reasonably  likely  to have a  Material

     financial  effect on any Loan  Party or any of their  Subsidiaries,  of the
     Disclosed  Litigation from that described on Schedule 4.01(i) to the Credit
     Agreement on the date thereof or except as has been disclosed to the Agents
     and the Lenders.

like import referring to the Credit  Agreement,  and each reference in the other
Loan Documents to "the Credit  Agreement",  "thereunder",  "thereof" or words of

the Collateral  described therein do and shall continue to secure the payment of
all  obligations of the Loan Parties under the Credit  Agreement,  the Notes and
the other Loan Documents, in each case as amended hereby.

     (c) The execution,  delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not,
except as expressly provided herein,  operate as a waiver of any right, power or
remedy of any Lender,  either  Managing  Agent,  the  Documentation  Agent,  the
Collateral  Agent or the

     SECTION 6. Execution in Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and  delivered  shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken  together shall  constitute  one and the same  amendment.
Delivery of an executed  counterpart  of a signature  page to this  Amendment by
telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed  counterpart of
this Amendment.

     SECTION  7.  Governing  Law.  This  Amendment  shall be  governed  by,  and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
