                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
  (A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.
 
     The  Warnaco Group, Inc. ('Company'), a Delaware corporation, was organized
in 1986 for the purpose of acquiring Warnaco Inc. ('Warnaco'), a publicly traded
apparel company. As a  result, Warnaco became a  wholly owned subsidiary of  the
Company.  The Company designs, manufactures and  markets a broad line of women's
intimate apparel, such as bras, panties  and sleepwear, and men's apparel,  such
as  sportswear, underwear and accessories, all of which are sold under a variety
of internationally recognized owned and licensed brand names. In March 1994, the
Company acquired  the  worldwide  trademarks,  rights  and  business  of  Calvin
Klein'r'  men's  underwear and  licensed the  Calvin  Klein trademark  for men's
accessories. In addition, the acquisition included the worldwide trademarks  and
rights  of  Calvin Klein  women's  intimate apparel  upon  the expiration  of an
existing license on December 31, 1994. The Company seeks to continue its  growth
strategy  by capitalizing on  its highly recognized  brand names worldwide while
broadening its channels of distribution and improving manufacturing efficiencies
and cost controls. The Company attributes the strength of its brand names to the
quality, fit and design of  its products which have  developed a high degree  of
consumer loyalty and a high level of repeat business. The Company operates three
divisions,  Intimate Apparel, Menswear and Retail Outlet Stores, which accounted
for 75%, 20%  and 5%, respectively,  of net  revenues in fiscal  1995, with  the
Intimate  Apparel Division accounting  for a larger  percentage of the Company's
gross profit for the same period.
 
     The Intimate Apparel Division designs, manufactures and markets moderate to
premium-priced intimate apparel for women under the Warner's'r', Olga'r', Calvin
Klein'r', Valentino Intimo'r', Scaasi'r', Van Raalte'r', White Stag'r', Fruit of
the Loom'r'  and  Speedo'r'  brand  names. In  addition,  the  Intimate  Apparel
Division  designs,  manufactures and  markets men's  underwear under  the Calvin
Klein brand  name. The  Intimate Apparel  Division is  the leading  marketer  of
women's bras to department and specialty stores in the United States, accounting
for  approximately 30% of such women's bra  sales over the last three years. The
Warner's and Olga brand names,  which are owned by the  Company, are 122 and  55
years old, respectively.
 
     The  Intimate Apparel  Division's strategy is  to increase  its channels of
distribution and expand its  highly recognized brand  names worldwide. In  1991,
the  Company entered into a  license agreement with Fruit  of the Loom, Inc. for
the design, manufacture and marketing of moderate priced bras, daywear and other
related items to be distributed through mass merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart and
Kmart, under the Fruit of the Loom brand name and has built its market share  to
nearly  7%  in the  mass merchandise  market.  This license  was renewed  by the
Company in  1994. The  Company has  a 3-year  distribution agreement  with  Avon
Products,  Inc. ('Avon') to distribute Warner's and Fruit of the Loom bras on an
exclusive basis and Scaasi sleepwear throughout the United States. In late 1994,
the Company purchased the  Van Raalte trademark for  $1 million and launched  an
intimate  apparel line through Sears stores in  July 1995. In February 1996, the
Company acquired substantially all of the  assets of the GJM Group of  companies
('GJM'),  a private  label manufacturer  and marketer  of women's  sleepwear and
lingerie.
 
     The Menswear Division designs,  manufactures, imports and markets  moderate
to  premium-priced  men's  apparel  and accessories  under  the  Chaps  by Ralph
Lauren'r', Calvin Klein'r',  Hathaway'r' and Catalina'r'  brand names. Chaps  by
Ralph  Lauren has  increased its net  revenues by approximately  500% since 1989
from $23 million to $138.2 million in 1995 by refocusing its products to the age
25 to 50 consumer and predominantly by using natural fibers in its products. The
Menswear Division's strategy is to build on the strength of its brand names  and
eliminate  those  businesses whose  profit contribution  is below  the Company's
required return.  Consistent  with this  strategy,  the Company  has  eliminated
several  under-performing brands since  1992. In 1995,  the Company extended its
Chaps by Ralph Lauren license through December 31, 2004.
 
     The Company licenses certain  of its brand names  throughout the world  and
has  been expanding the activities of its wholly owned operating subsidiaries in
Canada, Europe and Mexico. International
 
                                       1

operations generated $108.7 million  of net revenues or  11.9% of the  Company's
net  revenues in fiscal 1995 compared to $94.2 million of net revenues in fiscal
1994 or 11.9% of the Company's net revenues.
 
     The Company's business strategy  with respect to  its Retail Outlet  Stores
Division  is to  provide a  channel for  disposing of  the Company's  excess and
irregular inventory, thereby limiting its exposure to off-price retailers and to
shift to more  profitable intimate apparel  stores to improve  its margins.  The
Company  had 56 stores  at the end of  fiscal 1995 compared to  53 stores and 48
stores at the end of fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993, respectively.
 
     The Company's products  are distributed to  over 5,000 customers  operating
more  than 15,000 department, specialty and mass merchandising stores, including
such  leading  retailers  in  the  United  States  as  Dayton-Hudson,  Federated
Department  Stores, J.C. Penney,  Victoria's Secret, Macy's,  The May Department
Stores, Sears and Wal-Mart and such  leading retailers in Canada as Eaton's  and
The  Hudson Bay  Company. The  Company's products  are also  distributed to such
leading European retailers  as Marks &  Spencer, House of  Fraser, British  Home
Stores,  Harrods,  Galeries Lafayette  and Au  Printemps.  The Company  has also
opened new channels of distribution by entering into a three-year agreement with
Avon Products, Inc.  to distribute Warner's  and Fruit  of the Loom  bras on  an
exclusive basis and Scaasi sleepware throughout the United States and by joining
in  a joint venture arrangement  with News Corp Limited  to market the Company's
products directly to consumers  in Asia through  the Satellite Television  Asian
Region Network ('STAR').
 
  (B) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.
 
     The  Company operates within one dominant industry segment, the manufacture
and distribution  of apparel.  No customer  accounted  for 10%  or more  of  the
Company's  net revenues in any of the three years in the period ended January 6,
1996. (See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F-7  to
F-22).
 
  (C) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
     The  Company  designs, manufactures  and markets  a  broad line  of women's
intimate apparel  and men's  apparel and  accessories sold  under a  variety  of
internationally  recognized owned and licensed brand names. The Company operates
three divisions,  Intimate Apparel,  Menswear and  Retail Outlet  Stores,  which
accounted for 75%, 20% and 5%, respectively, of net revenues in fiscal 1995.
 
INTIMATE APPAREL
 
     The  Company's Intimate Apparel Division  designs, manufactures and markets
women's intimate apparel  which includes bras,  panties, sleepwear and  daywear.
The  Company also designs and markets  men's underwear. The Company's bra brands
accounted for approximately 30% of women's  bra sales over the last three  years
in  department and specialty  stores in the  United States. Management considers
the Intimate Apparel Division's  primary strengths to  include its strong  brand
recognition,  product quality and design innovation, low cost production, strong
relationships with department and  specialty stores and  its ability to  deliver
its  merchandise  rapidly.  Building on  the  strength  of its  brand  names and
reputation for  quality,  the  Company has  historically  focused  its  intimate
apparel  products  on the  upper  moderate to  premium-priced  range distributed
through leading department and specialty stores.  In order to expand its  market
penetration  in recent  years the  Company (i) in  1992, entered  into a license
agreement with Fruit of the Loom,  Inc. and began to distribute moderate  priced
bras,  daywear  and other  related  items under  this  license through  the mass
merchandise market, (ii) in  late 1993, signed  a 3-year distribution  agreement
with Avon Products, Inc. to distribute Warner's and Fruit of the Loom bras on an
exclusive  basis and  Scaasi sleepwear  throughout the  United States,  (iii) in
March 1994, acquired the worldwide  trademarks, rights and businesses of  Calvin
Klein  men's underwear  and the worldwide  trademarks, rights  and businesses of
Calvin Klein women's intimate apparel upon the expiration of an existing license
on December 31, 1994, (iv) in late 1994, purchased the Van Raalte trademark  for
$1  million and launched an  intimate apparel line through  Sears stores in July
1995, (v)  in June  1995, entered  an agreement  to manufacture  and  distribute
intimate apparel products under the Speedo brand

(1) Shipments began in the third quarter of fiscal 1995.
 
(2) The Company  entered  an exclusive  license  agreement for  the  design  and
    marketing of certain intimate apparel products in June 1995; shipments began
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.
 
     The  Company owns the Warner's, Olga,  Calvin Klein (underwear and intimate
apparel) and Van Raalte brand names and trademarks. The Company has an exclusive
license in  perpetuity  for  White  Stag for  women's  sportswear  and  intimate
apparel.  The Company licenses the other brand  names under which it markets its
product lines, primarily on  an exclusive basis.  The Company also  manufactures
intimate  apparel on  a private  and exclusive  label basis  for certain leading
specialty and department  stores. The Intimate  Apparel Division's revenues  are
primarily  generated by  sales of  the Company's  own brand  names. The Warner's
brand is 122 years old and the Olga brand is 55 years old.
 
     In August 1991,  the Company  entered into an  exclusive license  agreement
with  Fruit  of the  Loom, Inc.  for  the design,  manufacture and  marketing of
moderate priced bras which are  distributed through mass merchandisers, such  as
Wal-Mart and Kmart under the Fruit of the Loom brand name. The license agreement
has since been extended to include daywear, full slips, half slips, culottes and
petticoats  as well as  coordinated fashion sets (bras  and panties) and certain
control bottoms and  sleepwear. The  Company began  shipping Fruit  of the  Loom
products in June 1992 and has built its current market share to nearly 7% in the
mass  merchandise market. The agreement with Fruit of the Loom, Inc. has allowed
the Company to enter the mass  merchandise market, which is growing faster  than
the department and specialty store market.
 
     In  March 1994, the  Company acquired the  worldwide trademarks, rights and
business of Calvin  Klein men's  underwear and  effective January  1, 1995,  the
worldwide  trademark and rights  for Calvin Klein  women's intimate apparel. The
purchase price was approximately $60.9 million and consisted of cash payments of
$33.1 million in fiscal 1994,  $5.0 million in fiscal  1995 and the issuance  of
1,699,492  shares  of the  Company's Common  Stock valued  at fair  market value
($22.8 million)  for such  shares.  In addition,  the  Company entered  into  an
exclusive license agreement to produce men's accessories and small leather goods
under  the Calvin Klein label. The growth potential of the Calvin Klein brand is
evidenced in the Company's financial results  for fiscal 1995. The Calvin  Klein
brand  accounted for net revenues of $159.7  million in fiscal 1995, an increase
of 162% over the $61.0 million recorded in fiscal 1994.
 
     The Company attributes the strength of  its brands to the quality, fit  and
design  of its intimate  apparel which has  developed a high  degree of customer
loyalty and a high level  of repeat business. The  Company believes that it  has
maintained  its leadership  position, in  part, through  product innovation with
accomplishments such as introducing the alphabet bra (A, B, C and D cup  sizes),
the  first  all-stretch  bra, the  body  stocking,  the use  of  two-way stretch
fabrics, the cotton-lycra bra  and the sports bra.  The Company also  introduced
the  use of hangers and certain point of  sale hang tags for in-store display of
bras, which was a  significant change from marketing  bras in boxes and  enabled
women, for

the  first  time,  to  see  the product  in  the  store.  The  Company's product
innovations have become standards in the industry.
 
     Growth in  the intimate  apparel industry  is benefiting  from a  shift  in
consumer   attitudes.   Women   increasingly   view   intimate   apparel   as  a
fashion-oriented purchase rather than  as a purchase of  a basic necessity.  The
shift  has been driven by the expansion of intimate apparel specialty stores and
catalogs such  as  Victoria's Secret  and  an  increase in  space  allocated  to
intimate  apparel  by  department  stores.  The  Company  believes  that  it  is
well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for intimate apparel due to its
reputation for  forward-looking design,  quality,  fit and  fashion and  to  the
breadth  of its  product lines at  a range of  price points. Over  the past five
years, the Company has further improved  its position by obtaining the  licenses
to  produce intimate apparel under the Valentino  Intimo and Scaasi names in the
premium end of  the market, by  continuing to introduce  new products under  the
Warner's  and Olga  brands in  the better  end of  the market,  by obtaining the
license from Fruit of the Loom, Inc. to produce bras, daywear and other  related
items,  by producing  White Stag  bras for the  mass merchandise  segment of the
market, by  acquiring the  Calvin Klein  trademarks for  premium priced  women's
intimate apparel and better priced men's underwear, by purchasing the Van Raalte
trademark  and introducing an intimate apparel line through Sears stores in July
1995, by entering an  agreement to manufacture  and distribute intimate  apparel
products  under the  Speedo brand name  and by making  strategic acquisitions to
expand product lines and  distribution channels such as  the GJM acquisition  in
February  1996. The Company  has further improved its  position by continuing to
strengthen its relationships with its department store, specialty store and mass
merchandise customers.
 
     The Intimate  Apparel Division's  net revenues  have increased  at a  19.3%
compounded  annual growth rate since 1991, to  $689.2 million in fiscal 1995, as
the Company increased its penetration with existing accounts, expanded sales  to
new  customers by capitalizing  on the high  growth in such  specialty stores as
Victoria's Secret and sales of Fruit of  the Loom to mass merchandisers such  as
Wal-Mart  and Kmart and broadened its  product lines to include men's underwear.
The Company's strong sales  increase was accomplished  despite the softening  of
the  general retail market  due to poor economic  conditions and the bankruptcy,
reorganization or liquidation  of certain  major retail  store customers  during
this  period. The Intimate Apparel Division  has reduced operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue by  narrowing its product lines, controlling  selling,
administrative  and general expenses and improving manufacturing efficiency. The
Company believes that it is one of the lowest-cost producers of intimate apparel
in the United States,  producing approximately nine  million dozen garments  per
year.
 
     The  Company's  bras are  sold primarily  in  the department  and specialty
stores that  have been  the  Company's traditional  customer base  for  intimate
apparel.  In June 1992, the Company expanded into a new channel of distribution,
mass merchandisers, with  its Fruit  of the Loom  product line,  which offers  a
range  of styles  designed to  meet the  needs of  the consumer  profile of this
market. In late 1993 the Company  further expanded its channels of  distribution
by  signing  a  three-year  agreement with  Avon  Products,  Inc.  to distribute
Warner's and Fruit of the Loom bras  on an exclusive basis and Scaasi  sleepwear
throughout  the United States. The Company also sees opportunities for continued
growth in the Intimate Apparel Division  for bras specifically designed for  the
'full figure' market, as well as in the panties and daywear product lines.
 
     The  Intimate Apparel  Division has  subsidiaries in  Canada and  Mexico in
North America and  in the United  Kingdom, France, Belgium,  Ireland, Spain  and
Germany  in Europe. International sales accounted for approximately 14.5% of the
Intimate  Apparel  Division's  net  revenues   in  fiscal  1995.  Net   revenues
attributable  to the  international divisions  of the  Intimate Apparel Division
were $84.5 million, $84.1 million and $100.0 million in fiscal years 1993,  1994
and  1995,  respectively.  Management's  strategy  is  to  increase  its  market
penetration in Europe and to open additional channels of distribution. In  1994,
the  Company joined  in a  joint venture arrangement  with News  Corp Limited to
market, on  an  exclusive  basis,  the Company's  products  over  the  Satellite
Television  Asian Region Network ('STAR'), serving Asia and the Middle East. The
STAR network reaches over 60 million households in 53 countries in an area  that
includes two-thirds of the world's population.
 
     Initial shipments of merchandise to STAR were made in the fourth quarter of
fiscal  1995. In addition, the Company  began distributing its products directly
in Spain, Portugal and Italy in  1994, having taken back these territories  from
its   previous   licensee.   In   addition   to   the   international  marketing
 
                                       4

of its product lines, the Company has licensed its intimate apparel brand  names
to manufacturers in several other foreign countries.
 
     The Company's intimate apparel products are manufactured principally in the
Company's  facilities in  North America,  Central America,  the Caribbean Basin,
Ireland and the United Kingdom. Over the last three years the Company has opened
five new  manufacturing  facilities in  response  to increased  demand.  Certain
direct and incremental plant start-up costs associated with the establishment of
new  manufacturing facilities in  countries where special  efforts are needed to
recruit and train  entire work forces  are capitalized and  amortized over  five
years.  Capitalized costs represent direct and incremental costs associated with
the new  facility  and  include  site selection  and  site  development,  worker
training  costs, rent and other operating costs incurred prior to achieving full
production in  the  facility.  This  amortization,  together  with  the  initial
inefficiencies  associated with  the new  facilities resulted  in a  lower gross
profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) during the 1993 and
1994 fiscal  years.  The Company  achieved  a  portion of  the  expected  future
benefits  associated with these  plants in fiscal 1995  with gross profit margin
increasing 140  basis  points  (See  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results  of  Operations on  pages  14 to  20).  In the
Company's experience,  it  is approximately  five  years before  new  facilities
achieve the manufacturing efficiencies of established plants.
 
     Although  the Intimate Apparel Division generally markets its product lines
for three  retail selling  seasons (spring,  fall and  holiday), its  sales  and
revenues are somewhat seasonal with approximately 56% of net revenues and 59% of
operating income generated during the second half of the fiscal year.
 
MENSWEAR
 
     The  Menswear Division designs, manufactures,  imports and markets moderate
to better-priced dress  shirts and neckwear,  sportswear and men's  accessories.
Management  considers the Menswear  Division's primary strengths  to include its
strong brand  recognition,  product  quality, reputation  for  fashion  styling,
strong  relationships with  department and specialty  stores and  its ability to
deliver merchandise rapidly.
 
     The Menswear Division markets its lines under the following brand names:

(a) See Intimate Apparel Division
 
     The Hathaway brand name is owned by the Company. The Chaps by Ralph Lauren,
Catalina and Calvin Klein accessories brand  names are licensed on an  exclusive
basis by the Company.
 
     The  Menswear Division's strategy is to build  on the strength of its brand
names, strengthen its position as a  global apparel company and eliminate  those
businesses  whose profit  contribution is  below the  Company's required return.
Since  1993,  to  improve  profitability  in  this  division,  the  Company  (i)
discontinued  its manufactured  dress shirt,  neckwear and  accessories business
segment under the  Christian Dior  label (See Note  4 of  Notes to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements on pages F-7 to F-22),  (ii) sold the Puritan label in the
United States to Wal-Mart in  December 1993 and (iii)  did not renew its  Golden
Bear by Jack Nicklaus license which expired in June 1994.

     Due  to the strategic decision to discontinue approximately $100 million of
net revenues in  under-performing brands, the  Menswear Division's net  revenues
have  increased  slightly from  $180.8  million in  fiscal  year 1991  to $185.7
million in fiscal 1995. The reduction  in net revenues from discontinued  brands
has  been offset by  the tremendous success  of the Chaps  by Ralph Lauren brand
which has increased its net revenues by approximately 253% since fiscal 1991  to
$138.2 million in fiscal 1995.
 
     Sportswear.  In 1989,  the Company began  repositioning its  Chaps by Ralph
Lauren product lines by changing to the  use of all natural fibers and  updating
its  styling, which has generated significant net revenue increases as mentioned
above. The  Company sold,  for $7.7  million, its  Puritan label  in the  United
States  to  Wal-Mart  in  1993  due to  the  difficult  price  points  for men's
sportswear in the  mass merchandise market.  During 1992 and  1994, the  Company
sold  or terminated its licenses for  Christian Dior sportswear, neckwear, dress
shirts and accessories. In addition, the  Company did not renew its Golden  Bear
by  Jack  Nicklaus license  which expired  in  June 1994.  In 1993,  the Company
entered a license  agreement to design  men's and women's  sportswear and  men's
dress  shirts  and furnishings  bearing the  Catalina trademark.  Catalina brand
products are sold  in the mass  merchandise segment of  the market. The  Company
recorded  approximately $2.0 million of  royalty income associated with Catalina
products in fiscal 1995. The Company is in the process of expanding its line  of
pants and casual bottoms under the Chaps by Ralph Lauren brand.
 
     Accessories. The Menswear Division markets men's small leather goods, men's
jewelry  and belts under the Calvin Klein  brand name under a worldwide license.
The first shipments of Calvin Klein  accessories were made in the third  quarter
of  fiscal 1995 to United States  customers and accounted for approximately $3.9
million of net  revenues in  fiscal 1995. Management  believes that  one of  the
strengths  of its accessories lines is  the high level of international consumer
recognition associated with the Calvin Klein label. The Company's strategy is to
expand the  accessories business,  which  on a  consistent basis  has  generated
higher margins than other menswear products.
 
     Dress  Shirts and  Neckwear. The  Menswear Division  designs, manufactures,
imports  and   markets   three  principal   lines   of  dress   shirts:   basic,
intermediate-fashion  and fashion. The  average full retail  prices of the dress
shirts, which are marketed  under the Hathaway and  Chaps by Ralph Lauren  brand
names,  range from $20 to $45. Substantially  all of the division's dress shirts
are manufactured at Company owned or leased facilities in North America and  the
Caribbean Basin. The dress shirt and neckwear market has deteriorated during the
last  three years  due to  an oversupply and  a shift  toward casual  wear. As a
result, the Menswear  Division discontinued  the Christian Dior  portion of  its
manufactured  dress shirt and neckwear business segment  in 1994 in an effort to
improve the Company's profitability and operating margins.
 
     International sales accounted for approximately  5% of net revenues of  the
Menswear  Division in  fiscal l995.  Net revenues  attributable to international
divisions of the Menswear  Division were $14.1 million,  $10.2 million and  $8.8
million  in  fiscal years  l993, 1994  and 1995,  respectively. The  decrease in
international sales over the last  three years reflects the Company's  strategic
decision to terminate the Christian Dior licenses, as previously mentioned.
 
     The  Menswear Division's sportswear, consisting of knit shirts and sweaters
and other  apparel, is  sourced  principally from  the  Far East.  The  Menswear
Division  manufactures its  dress shirts  in North  America and  sources certain
styles of dress shirts in the Far  East and in the Caribbean Basin.  Accessories
are  sourced in the United States, Europe  and the Far East. Neckwear is sourced
primarily in the United States.
 
     The Menswear  Division,  like  the  Intimate  Apparel  Division,  generally
markets  its apparel products for three retail selling seasons (spring, fall and
holiday). The Menswear Division introduces new styles, fabrics and colors  based
upon consumer preferences and market trends and to coincide with the appropriate
retail selling season. The sales of the Menswear Division's product lines follow
individual  seasonal shipping patterns ranging from one season to three seasons,
with multiple releases in  some of the  division's more fashion-oriented  lines.
Consistent  with industry and consumer buying patterns, approximately 56% of the
Menswear Division's net revenues  and 59% of  the Menswear Division's  operating
profit  are generated in  the second half  of the calendar  year, reflecting the
strength of the fall and holiday shopping seasons.

RETAIL OUTLET STORES DIVISION
 
     The Retail Outlet Stores Division primarily sells the Company's products to
the general public. The Company's business  strategy with respect to its  retail
outlet  stores is to provide a channel for disposing of the Company's excess and
irregular inventory, thereby limiting its  exposure to off-price retailers.  The
Company's retail outlet stores are situated in areas where they generally do not
conflict  with the Company's  principal channels of  distribution. The Company's
newer retail outlet stores  are principally intimate  apparel stores located  in
outlet  shopping malls. The  Company has found  that it has  improved margins by
operating retail outlet stores that sell  products of only one of the  Company's
divisions,  and  has converted  most of  its  outlets to  the exclusive  sale of
intimate apparel. EBITDA for  the Retail Outlet Stores  Division in fiscal  1995
improved  25%  over fiscal  1994 to  $3.5 million.  As of  January 6,  1996, the
Company operated 56 stores, of which 41 carried intimate apparel only, 3 carried
menswear only and 12 carried both lines.
 
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
 
     The Company has subsidiaries in Canada  and Mexico in North America and  in
the  United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Spain and Germany in Europe which
engage in sales and marketing activities. With the exception of the  fluctuation
of  local  currencies against  the United  States dollar,  the Company  does not
believe that the operations  in Canada and Western  Europe are subject to  risks
which   are  significantly  different  from   domestic  operations.  Mexico  has
historically been subject to high  rates of inflation and currency  restrictions
which  may, from time  to time, impact  the Mexican operation.  The Company also
sells directly  to  customers  in  Mexico. Net  revenues  from  these  shipments
represent less than 1% of the Company's net revenues in fiscal 1995.
 
     The  Company maintains manufacturing facilities  in Mexico, Honduras, Costa
Rica, the  Dominican  Republic,  Canada,  Ireland and  the  United  Kingdom  and
warehousing  facilities in Canada, Mexico, the  United Kingdom and contracts for
warehousing in  Spain.  The  Intimate Apparel  Division  operates  manufacturing
facilities  in Mexico  and in  the Caribbean  Basin pursuant  to duty-advantaged
(commonly referred  to  as 'Item  807')  programs. The  Company's  manufacturing
policy  is to have many potential sources  of manufacturing so that a disruption
of production at any one facility will not significantly impact the Company.
 
     The majority of  the Company's  imported purchases are  invoiced in  United
States   dollars  and,  therefore,  are   not  subject  to  short-term  currency
fluctuations.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
     The Intimate Apparel and  Menswear Divisions sell  to over 5,000  customers
operating  more than 15,000  department, mass merchandise  and men's and women's
specialty stores  throughout North  America and  Europe. None  of the  Company's
customers  accounted for more than 10% of  the Company's net revenues during any
of the three years in the period ended January 6, 1996.
 
     The Company's  retail  customers  are served  by  approximately  200  sales
representatives.  The Company also employs  marketing coordinators who work with
the  Company's  customers  in  designing  in-store  displays  and  planning  the
placement   of  merchandise.   The  Company  has   implemented  Electronic  Data
Interchange (commonly referred to as 'EDI') programs with most of its  retailing
customers  which permit  the Company  to receive  purchase orders electronically
from these customers and,  in some cases,  to transmit invoices  electronically.
These  innovations assist the Company in getting  its products to customers on a
timely basis and at the lowest cost possible.
 
     The Company utilizes various  forms of advertising  media. In fiscal  l995,
the  Company  spent approximately  $41.0  million or  4.5%  of net  revenues for
advertising and promotion of its various  product lines. This compares to  $37.2
million  or 4.7%  of net revenues  in fiscal  1994. The statement  of income for
fiscal 1995  also includes  a special  charge for  advertising costs  previously
deferable  of  $11.7 million  ($7.3 million  after giving  effect to  income tax
benefits of  $4.4 million)  related  to the  change  in accounting  for  certain
advertising  costs in  accordance with Statement  of Position  93-7 ('SOP 93-7')
issued by the American  Institute of Certified  Public Accountants ('AICPA')  in
December  1993 for years beginning after  July 1994. The increase in advertising
costs in fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994
 
                                       7

reflects the introductions of Calvin Klein intimate apparel and accessories  and
Van  Raalte intimate  apparel and  the Company's  desire to  maintain its strong
market position in  Warner's, Olga and  Fruit of the  Loom intimate apparel  and
Calvin  Klein men's underwear.  The Company participates  on a cooperative basis
with retailers, principally through newspaper advertisements.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The apparel  industry  is  highly competitive.  The  Company's  competitors
include apparel manufacturers of all sizes, some of which have greater resources
than the Company.
 
     The Company also competes with foreign producers, but to date, such foreign
competition  has  not  materially  affected  the  Intimate  Apparel  or Menswear
Divisions. The Company believes that its manufacturing skills, coupled with  its
existing  Central  American  and Caribbean  Basin  manufacturing  facilities and
selective use  of off-shore  sourcing, enable  the Company  to maintain  a  cost
structure  competitive with  other major  apparel manufacturers.  In addition to
competition from other  branded apparel manufacturers,  the Company competes  in
certain product lines with department store private label programs.
 
     The  Company  believes  that  it has  a  significant  competitive advantage
because of high consumer recognition and  acceptance of its brand names and  its
strong  presence and strong  market share in the  major department and specialty
store chains.
 
     A substantial  portion of  the Company's  sales are  of products,  such  as
intimate  apparel and  mens underwear,  that are  not very  susceptible to rapid
design changes.  This  relatively  stable  base of  business  is  a  significant
contributing  factor to the Company's favorable competitive and cost position in
the apparel industry.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     The Company's raw materials are  principally cotton, wool, silk,  synthetic
and  cotton-synthetic blends  of fabrics  and yarns.  Raw materials  used by the
Intimate Apparel and Menswear Divisions are available from multiple sources.
 
IMPORT QUOTAS
 
     Approximately one-third  of  the  Company's products  are  manufactured  by
contractors  located outside the United States.  These products are imported and
are subject to  federal customs  laws, which impose  tariffs as  well as  import
quota  restrictions established by the Department of Commerce. While importation
of goods  from certain  countries may  be  subject to  embargo by  U.S.  Customs
authorities  if  shipments exceed  quota  limits, the  Company  closely monitors
import quotas through its Washington, D.C. office and can, in most cases,  shift
production  to  contractors located  in countries  with  available quotas  or to
domestic  manufacturing  facilities.  The   existence  of  import  quotas   has,
therefore, not had a material effect on the Company's business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The  Company and  its subsidiaries  employ approximately  16,200 employees.
Approximately 18% of  the Company's employees,  all of whom  are engaged in  the
manufacture  and distribution of its products,  are represented by labor unions.
The Company considers labor relations with employees to be satisfactory and  has
not   experienced   significant  interruption   of   operations  due   to  labor
disagreements.
 
TRADEMARKS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS
 
     The Company has license agreements permitting it to manufacture and  market
specific  products  using  the  trademarks of  others.  The  Company's exclusive
license and design agreements for the Chaps by Ralph Lauren trademark expire  on
December  31, 2004. These licenses  grant the Company an  exclusive right to use
the Chaps  by  Ralph Lauren  trademark  in the  United  States of  America.  The
Company's  license to use the Valentino Intimo trademark for intimate apparel in
the United States of
 
                                       8

America, its territories  and possessions,  Puerto Rico and  Canada, expires  on
December  31, 2002,  and is  extendable subject to  the mutual  agreement of the
parties. In  October,  1995, the  Company  entered into  a  worldwide  licensing
arrangement  granting  the  Company  exclusive,  worldwide  rights  to  use  the
Valentino Intimo trademark for  intimate apparel for  a period co-terminus  with
the  Company's  United States  license, through  December  31, 2002,  subject to
extension by  mutual agreement  of the  parties. The  Company has  an  exclusive
license  to  use the  Scaasi  trademark in  the  United States  of  America, its
territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and numerous Caribbean
Islands until December 31,  l999. The Company's  exclusive license agreement  to
use  the  Fruit of  the  Loom trademark  in the  United  States of  America, its
territories and possessions, Canada and Mexico expires December 31, 1996 and  is
currently under negotiation for renewal.
 
     The  Company's  exclusive  license  agreement with  Calvin  Klein,  Inc. to
produce Calvin Klein  men's accessories is  for a period  of five years  through
March  14, 1999 and is renewable for  a five-year period through March 14, 2004,
solely at  the option  of the  Company.  The Company  has entered  into  license
agreements  with Authentic  Fitness Corporation  to produce  and sell  men's and
women's sportswear and  men's dress  shirts and furnishings  under the  Catalina
label  and  certain  intimate  apparel under  the  Speedo  label.  The Company's
exclusive license to  use the  Catalina trademark for  these products  worldwide
expires  in December 2003 and  the exclusive license for  use of the Speedo name
for intimate apparel products continues in perpetuity.
 
     Although the specific  terms of  each of the  Company's license  agreements
vary,  generally  such agreements  provide for  minimum royalty  payments and/or
royalty payments based  on a percentage  of net sales.  Such license  agreements
also  generally grant the licensor the right  to approve any designs marketed by
the licensee.
 
     The Company  owns  other  trademarks,  the  most  important  of  which  are
Warner's, Olga, Calvin Klein men's underwear, Calvin Klein intimate apparel, Van
Raalte  and Hathaway.  The Company  has a license  in perpetuity  for White Stag
women's sportswear and intimate apparel.
 
     The Company  licenses  the Warner's,  Hathaway,  White Stag,  Catalina  and
Calvin  Klein brand names to domestic  and international licensees for a variety
of products. These agreements  generally require the  licensee to pay  royalties
and  fees to the Company based on a  percentage of the licensee's net sales. The
Company regularly monitors product  design, development, quality,  merchandising
and  marketing and  schedules meetings  throughout the  year with  licensees, to
assure compliance with the Company's overall marketing, merchandising and design
strategies, and to  ensure uniformity and  quality control. The  Company, on  an
ongoing  basis, evaluates entering into  license agreements with other companies
that would  permit  such  companies  to  market  products  under  the  Warner's,
Hathaway, White Stag, Catalina, Calvin Klein and other trademarks. Generally, in
evaluating a potential licensee, the Company considers the experience, financial
stability,  manufacturing  performance  and marketing  ability  of  the proposed
licensee. Royalty income  derived from  such licensing  was approximately  $15.0
million  (including the sale of  the Puritan trademark in  the United States for
$7.7 million),  $11.5  million (including  the  sale of  certain  trademarks  to
Authentic  Fitness Corporation  for $6.6  million) and  $10.8 million  in fiscal
years 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively.
 
     The Company believes that only the trademarks mentioned herein are material
to the business of the Company.
 
BACKLOG
 
     A substantial portion  of net  revenues is  based on  orders for  immediate
delivery  and, therefore,  backlog is not  necessarily indicative  of future net
revenues.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
 
     The principal  executive offices  of the  Company are  located at  90  Park
Avenue,  New York,  New York  10016 and  are occupied  pursuant to  a lease that
expires in  2004. In  addition  to its  executive  offices, the  Company  leases

- ------------------------
 
 (a) On September 4, 1991, the Company's Board of Directors determined that  the
     Company  should  restructure  its  knitwear  operations.  The restructuring
     resulted in a non-recurring charge of  $13 million (or $0.68 per share)  in
     fiscal  1991. Such charge was associated  with the closing of the Company's
     knitwear manufacturing  facilities  and  the  liquidation  of  the  related
     inventory. In October 1993, the Company decided to discontinue a portion of
     its  men's  manufactured dress  shirt and  neckwear business  segment. This
     resulted in  a non-recurring  charge of  $19.9 million.  Also, the  Company
     incurred  a $2.6 million non-recurring  charge associated with a previously
     discontinued business. The  total non-recurring charge  recorded in  fiscal
     1993  was $22.5 million (or  $0.56 per share). In  fiscal 1994, the Company
     incurred a $3 million (or $0.07 per share) charge related to the California
     earthquake.
 
 (b) Fiscal 1993 includes a  $10.5 million charge (or  $0.26 per share) for  the
     cumulative  effect of  the Company  changing its  method of  accounting for
     postretirement benefits other than pensions.

 (c) Income reflects the benefits of utilizing the Company's net operating  loss
     carryforward  to offset the Company's  federal income tax provision. Income
     before non-recurring  items,  after  giving  effect  to  a  normalized  tax
     provision at the Company's fiscal 1995 effective income tax rate of 38% was
     $41.1 million (or $1.00 per share).
 
 (d) All  share  and  per  share  amounts  have  been  adjusted  to  reflect the
     two-for-one stock split effective October  3, 1994 and includes all  Common
     Stock and Common Stock equivalents.
 
 (e) Effective  with  the 1995  fiscal year,  the  Company adopted  Statement of
     Position 93-7 ('SOP 93-7'), dealing  with certain types of advertising  and
     promotion costs. SOP 93-7 requires, among other things, that certain costs,
     which   had  previously  been  deferred  for  amortization  against  future
     revenues, be currently expensed. The Company incurred a special charge  for
     advertising  costs previously deferable of  $11.7 million ($7.3 million net
     of income  tax benefits)  (or  $0.16 per  share)  primarily in  the  fourth
     quarter of fiscal 1995 related to SOP 93-7.
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
 
     During  the last  several years,  the Company  has implemented  a number of
strategies designed to  reduce operating  expenses and refocus  its business  on
less  fashion  sensitive  and  higher  margin  product  lines  with  world brand
potential. As a  result of  this strategic refocusing,  and notwithstanding  the
bankruptcy,  reorganization or  liquidation of  several of  the Company's retail
customers, including  B.  Altman  &  Co., Bonwit  Teller,  Carter  Hawley  Hale,
Federated  Department  Stores, Miller  & Rhoades,  R.H. Macy  & Co.,  Woodward &
Lathrop, and P.A. Bergner & Co., and the general softening of the retail  market
as  a result of  the economic slowdown  from 1989 through  1994, the Company has
significantly increased operating income.
 
     The Intimate Apparel  Division's net  revenues have grown  at a  compounded
annual growth rate of approximately 19% since 1991.
 
     Menswear Division net revenues have decreased from $213.9 million in fiscal
1989  to  $185.7  million in  fiscal  1995, reflecting  the  Company's strategic
decisions to eliminate  cash intensive  businesses and businesses  that did  not
demonstrate   the  potential  to  achieve  profitability  levels  acceptable  to
management (See Note 4  of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements on  pages
F-7  to F-22). The  strategic decisions included (i)  not renewing the Company's
license  with  Pringle  of   Scotland  in  1989,   (ii)  closing  its   knitwear
manufacturing  facilities in 1991, (iii) restructuring the Company's dress shirt
and neckwear manufacturing facilities in  1993, (iv) not renewing the  Company's
license  for Golden Bear by Jack Nicklaus in 1994, (v) terminating the Christian
Dior licenses for dress shirts, neckwear and accessories in 1994 and selling the
Christian Dior  license for  sportswear in  1992 and  (vi) selling  the  Puritan
trademark  in the United States to Wal-Mart  in 1993. The negative impact on net
revenues of the discontinued businesses was partially offset by strong growth in
the Company's Chaps  by Ralph Lauren  line which has  increased net revenues  by
approximately 500% since 1989.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The consolidated statements of income for the Company are summarized below.
The  Divisional Summary includes the Retail Outlet Stores Division for reporting
purposes; however, since the  Company's business strategy is  to use its  retail
outlet  stores as a  channel for its  excess inventory and  the Company does not
consider the results of such division  to be material, the Retail Outlet  Stores
Division is not discussed further.

COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1995 WITH FISCAL 1994.
 
     Net  revenues increased  16.2% to  $916.2 million  from the  $788.8 million
recorded in fiscal 1994  due primarily to a  21.9% increase in intimate  apparel
net revenues.
 
     INTIMATE  APPAREL DIVISION. Net revenues  increased 21.9% to $689.2 million
     in fiscal  1995 from  $565.3  million in  fiscal  1994. Warner's  and  Olga
     domestic  net  revenues increased  12.6%  (including Victoria's  Secret and
     Avon). Calvin Klein net revenues increased 162% to $159.7 million  compared
     to $61.0 million in fiscal 1994 (nine months of operations in fiscal 1994).
     The  increase in  Calvin Klein is  a result  of the launch  of Calvin Klein
     women's intimate apparel and an over 70% increase in the Calvin Klein men's
     underwear business.  Fruit of  the  Loom net  revenues decreased  17.3%  in
     fiscal  1995 compared to fiscal 1994 primarily as a result of a decrease of
     approximately $27 million in Avon shipments. Fruit of the Loom net revenues
     in the mass  merchandise market  (without Avon) increased  30.7% in  fiscal
     1995 compared to fiscal 1994. International sales increased 18.9% to $100.0
     million  compared  to  $84.1  million in  fiscal  1994  which  represents a
     significant turnaround compared to prior years.

     MENSWEAR DIVISION. Net revenues increased 1.1% to $185.7 million in  fiscal
     1995  from  $183.8 million  in fiscal  1994. Excluding  discontinued brands
     (Dior, Puritan  and  Nicklaus),  net  revenues  increased  13.6%  primarily
     attributable  to  continued  growth  in Chaps  by  Ralph  Lauren  where net
     revenues increased 14.3% in fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994 and to  the
     launch  of Calvin  Klein accessories which  generated net  revenues of $3.9
     million in  its  first  four  months of  shipping.  Hathaway  net  revenues
     decreased  6% in fiscal  1995 compared to  fiscal 1994 reflecting continued
     softness in the men's dress shirt market.
 
     Gross profit increased 21.1% to $309.7  million in fiscal 1995 compared  to
$255.8  million in  fiscal 1994.  Gross profit as  a percentage  of net revenues
increased to 33.8% in fiscal 1995 compared to 32.4% in fiscal 1994. The increase
in gross profit as a  percentage of net revenues  of 140 basis points  primarily
reflects  manufacturing efficiencies  achieved in the  Intimate Apparel Division
and a more favorable mix due to growth in the Calvin Klein business.
 
     INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Intimate Apparel Division gross profit increased
     27.4% to $259.2 million (37.6% of net revenues) in fiscal 1995 from  $203.5
     million  (36.0%  of  net  revenues)  in  fiscal  1994.  Gross  profit  as a
     percentage of net revenues increased to 37.6% of net revenues from 36.0% in
     fiscal 1994 due primarily to manufacturing efficiencies associated with the
     Company's new manufacturing facilities and a better mix of sales reflecting
     the sales increase in the Calvin Klein business.
 
     MENSWEAR DIVISION. Gross profit in the Menswear Division decreased slightly
     to $35.5 million (19.1% of net revenues) in fiscal 1995 from $38.2  million
     in  fiscal 1994 (20.7% of  net revenues). The decrease  in net revenues and
     gross profit as a percentage of net revenues reflects softness in the men's
     dress shirt business and  the final liquidation  of merchandise related  to
     discontinued brands.
 
     Selling,  administrative  and general  expenses  increased 17.5%  to $184.0
million (20.1% of net revenues) in fiscal 1995 from $156.6 million (19.9% of net
revenues) in fiscal 1994.  The increase in  selling, administrative and  general
expenses  reflects  higher  sales  volume  and  an  increase  in  marketing  and
advertising expenses (not  including the  special charge  for advertising  costs
previously deferable in accordance with SOP 93-7) of approximately $4 million in
fiscal  1995 compared to fiscal 1994.  The increase in advertising and promotion
expenses is primarily  related to the  launch of Calvin  Klein women's  intimate
apparel.  Selling, administrative  and general expenses  as a  percentage of net
revenues for  fiscal 1995  were  essentially equal  to fiscal  1994,  reflecting
continuing efforts to control operating expenses.
 
     Interest  expense increased slightly  to $33.9 million  in fiscal 1995 from
$32.5 million  in  fiscal  1994.  The increase  in  interest  expenses  reflects
increased  interest costs supporting the  increased working capital required for
the 16.2% sales growth  achieved in fiscal 1995  offset by the favorable  impact
from  the  proceeds  from  the  Company's offering  of  Common  Stock  which was
completed in October 1995.
 
     The Company's treatment of certain advertising costs changed in fiscal 1995
reflecting the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants Statement  of
Position  93-7 ('SOP 93-7'). SOP 93-7 requires, among other things, that certain
advertising costs previously deferred and  amortized over the period  benefited,
be  expensed in the period the advertising is first run. As a result of adopting
SOP 93-7, the Company incurred a special charge for advertising costs previously
deferable  of  $11.7   million  ($7.3  million  net   of  income  tax  benefits)
primarily in  the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.
 
     Income  tax expense for  fiscal 1995 was $30.4  million corresponding to an
effective income tax rate of  38%. Income tax expense  for fiscal 1994 was  $0.4
million.  Income  tax expense  for  fiscal 1994  reflects  $22.5 million  of tax
benefits associated with  the Company's  net operating  loss carryforwards.  The
Company  had utilized substantially  all of its  net operating loss carryforward
benefits for financial reporting purposes  at the end of  fiscal 1994 and, as  a
result,  had approximately $38.5  million of deferred tax  assets at 1994 fiscal
year end.
 
     The difference between the  U.S. federal statutory income  tax rate of  35%
and  the Company's effective  income tax rate  of 38% for  fiscal 1995 primarily
reflects the  impact of  state income  taxes and  the effect  of  non-deductible
intangible  amortization partially  offset by  certain benefits  associated with
state income tax net operating loss carryforwards.

     For income tax purposes, the  Company has net operating loss  carryforwards
available  to  offset future  taxable  income amounting  to  approximately $39.8
million at January 6,  1996. These carryforwards, which  the Company expects  to
fully  utilize,  will result  in  a future  tax  savings of  approximately $13.9
million at current U.S.  federal corporate income tax  rates. The net  operating
loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2001 and fully expire in 2007.
 
     As  a result of the  Company's Common Stock offerings  in 1991 and 1992 and
other changes in the ownership of the Company's Common Stock, certain provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code could limit  the rate at which the Company will  be
able  to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. The Company believes that
it will  realize all  of the  benefits attributable  to its  net operating  loss
carryforwards;  however,  the  amount of  such  benefits that  the  Company will
realize and the period in which any  benefit is realized are subject to  several
factors  including the general level of economic activity, the level of earnings
and future changes in U.S. corporate income tax laws and regulations (See Note 8
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F-7 to F-22).
 
     Income before  non-recurring  and  special items,  adjusted  to  reflect  a
normalized  income tax rate of  38%, increased 37.4% to  $56.9 million in fiscal
1995 compared to  $41.4 million  in fiscal  1994. The  increase reflects  higher
operating income.
 
     In  October 1995, the  Company entered into new  bank credit agreements and
wrote-off deferred financing costs related  to the prior bank credit  agreement.
The  write-off resulted in an extraordinary item  of $3.1 million (net of income
tax benefits of $1.9 million) due to the early extinguishment of debt.
 
     Net income,  after non-recurring,  special  and extraordinary  charges  was
$46.5  million in  fiscal 1995  compared to  $63.3 million  in fiscal  1994. The
decrease in  net income  in fiscal  1995 compared  to fiscal  1994 reflects  the
impact  of the full income  tax provision in fiscal  1995 and the special charge
for SOP 93-7, partially offset by higher operating income, as noted above.
 
COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1994 WITH FISCAL 1993.
 
     Net revenues increased 12.1% from $703.8  million in fiscal 1993 to  $788.8
million  in fiscal 1994. The increase in  net revenue was accomplished despite a
planned reduction of approximately $90  million in discontinued Menswear  brands
and  is  attributable  to continued  growth  in the  Company's  Intimate Apparel
Division of 33.6%  and continued net  revenue growth in  the Company's Chaps  by
Ralph Lauren line of 36%.
 
     INTIMATE  APPAREL DIVISION. Net revenues  increased 33.6% to $565.3 million
     in fiscal  1994  from the  $423.2  million  recorded in  fiscal  1993.  The
     increase  was driven by the acquisition of Calvin Klein which generated net
     revenues of $61.0 million in fiscal 1994, an increase in Fruit of the  Loom
     net revenues of 95.4% to $64.3 million and increases in the net revenues of
     Warner's and Olga of 13.2%.
 
     MENSWEAR DIVISION. Net revenues for fiscal 1994 decreased to $183.8 million
     from  $243.2 million in fiscal 1993.  The decrease in sales is attributable
     to the Company's strategic  decisions in fiscal 1993  and 1994 to (i)  sell
     the Puritan trademark to Wal-Mart, (ii) discontinue the Golden Bear by Jack
     Nicklaus  product line, and (iii) terminate the Christian Dior licenses for
     men's dress  shirts,  neckwear  and  accessories  in  1995.  Without  these
     discontinued  brands,  Menswear Division  net  revenues increased  15.3% in
     fiscal 1994  to $164.5  million from  $142.9 million  in fiscal  1993.  The
     increase  is attributable to continued growth  of 36.0% in the net revenues
     of Chaps by Ralph Lauren.
 
     Gross profit increased to $255.8 million in fiscal 1994 from $236.4 million
in fiscal 1993. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to  32.4%
in  fiscal 1994  from 33.6% in  fiscal 1993. The  decrease in gross  profit as a
percentage of net revenue reflects  the higher mix of  Fruit of the Loom  sales,
the  amortization  of start  up  costs in  the Fruit  of  the Loom  business and
decreased manufacturing efficiency due to the start up of four new plants.
 
     INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Intimate Apparel Division gross profit increased
     21.3% to $203.5  million (36.0% of  net revenues) from  the $167.7  million
     (39.6%  of net  revenues) recorded  in fiscal  1993. The  increase in gross
     profit reflects the  higher net  revenues noted  above. Gross  profit as  a
     percentage  of net revenues decreased from 39.6% to 36.0% due to the mix of
     Fruit of the Loom
 
                                       17

     sales, the amortization of Fruit of  the Loom start-up costs and  decreased
     manufacturing efficiency, as noted above.
 
     MENSWEAR  DIVISION.  Menswear  Division  gross  profit  decreased  to $38.2
     million (20.7% of net revenues) in fiscal 1994 from $53.7 million (22.1% of
     net revenues) last year.  The decrease in gross  profit reflects the  lower
     sales  volume due to discontinued brands,  as discussed above. The decrease
     in gross profit  as a  percentage of  net revenues  reflects the  favorable
     impact in fiscal 1993 from the sale of the Puritan trademark.
 
     Selling,  administrative and general expenses increased 8.6% in fiscal 1994
to $156.6  million (19.9%  of net  revenue) from  $144.2 million  (20.5% of  net
revenue)  in fiscal  1993. The increase  in selling,  administrative and general
expenses reflects sales volume increases  and an increase in marketing  expenses
of  $5.6 million  to $37  million. Marketing expenses  increased to  4.7% of net
revenue in fiscal 1994  from 4.5% in  fiscal 1993 and 3.2%  in fiscal 1992.  The
decrease  in selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net
revenue reflects continued efforts to control operating expenses by the  Company
and the favorable impact of increased sales to mass merchandisers and Avon which
have   lower  selling  expense  than   the  Company's  traditional  channels  of
distribution.
 
     Interest expense decreased 17% to $32.5  million in fiscal 1994 from  $38.9
million  in fiscal 1993 despite a  significant increase in interest rates during
1994. The decrease in  interest expense is  a result of  the refinancing of  the
Company's  credit agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the attainment
of an Investment Grade credit rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor's in May 1994,
and the  renegotiation of  the Company's  cost of  borrowing in  June 1994.  The
combination  of the refinancing, the improved credit rating and the renegotiated
borrowing rate lowered  the Company's cost  of borrowing by  75 basis points  to
LIBOR  plus  0.5%. In  addition, the  Company has  purchased interest  rate swap
agreements which effectively fix the Company's rate of interest on $275  million
of debt at approximately 6.2% through fiscal 1995.
 
     In  January  1994,  the  Company's  leased  warehouse  located  in  Sylmar,
California  suffered  significant  structural  damage  due  to  the   California
earthquake  and  was  permanently  closed.  The  Company  was  able  to  recover
substantially all of its inventory,  transfer the inventory to other  locations,
and  begin shipping at normal levels in  March, 1994. The Company has earthquake
insurance and, other than  a deductible of approximately  $3 million, which  was
recorded as a non-recurring expense in the first quarter of fiscal 1994, expects
to fully recover its losses.
 
     The  provision for income taxes for fiscal 1994 reflects the recognition of
tax benefits  of $22.6  million  related to  the  Company's net  operating  loss
carryforwards  which  offset  substantially  all  of  the  Company's  income tax
provision for fiscal 1994. The Company has utilized substantially all of its net
operating loss  carryforwards for  financial reporting  purposes at  the end  of
fiscal  1994. The Company  had total deferred tax  assets of approximately $38.5
million at the end of  fiscal 1994 and as a  result began reporting fully  taxed
earnings  in fiscal  1995. The  Company recognized  $31.3 million  of income tax
benefits related to future periods in fiscal years 1992 and 1993.
 
     For income tax purposes  the Company had  net operating loss  carryforwards
available  to  offset  future  taxable income  amounting  to  approximately $110
million at January 7,  1995. These carryforwards, which  the Company expects  to
fully  utilize,  will result  in  a future  tax  savings of  approximately $38.5
million at current  U.S. federal corporate  income tax  rates as of  the end  of
fiscal  1994. The net operating loss  carryforwards expire beginning in 2001 and
fully expire in 2007.
 
     As a result of the  Company's Common Stock offerings  in 1991 and 1992  and
other changes in the ownership of the Company's Common Stock, certain provisions
of  the Internal Revenue  Code may limit the  rate at which  the Company will be
able to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. The Company believes  that
it  will realize  all of  the benefits  attributable to  its net  operating loss
carryforwards; however,  the  amount of  such  benefits that  the  Company  will
realize  and the period in which any  benefit is realized are subject to several
factors including the general level of economic activity, the level of  earnings
and future changes in U.S. corporate income tax laws and regulations (See Note 8
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F-7 to F-22).

     Income  from  continuing  operations  for  fiscal  1994  was  $63.3 million
compared to $53.3 million in fiscal 1993. The increase in income from continuing
operations of  $10.0 million  or 18.8%  is attributable  to increased  operating
income and lower interest expense, as noted above.
 
     Net  income for fiscal 1994 was $63.3  million compared to $24.1 million in
fiscal 1993. Net income for fiscal 1993 included an extraordinary item of  $18.6
million  (without income tax benefit) primarily  related to premium payments and
the  write-off  of   deferred  financing   costs  associated   with  the   early
extinguishment  of  debt.  In addition,  fiscal  1993 included  a  $10.5 million
non-cash charge for the cumulative effective of adopting Statement of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
 
     The  Company's liquidity requirements arise primarily from its debt service
requirements and the funding of  the Company's working capital needs,  primarily
inventory  and  accounts receivable.  The  Company's borrowing  requirements are
seasonal, with  peak working  capital needs  arising at  the end  of the  second
quarter  and during the third quarter of  the fiscal year. The Company typically
generates nearly all of its net operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year, reflecting third quarter and fourth quarter shipments and the  sale
of   inventory  built   during  the  first   half  of  the   fiscal  year.  (See
'Seasonality').
 
     In October 1995, the Company sold 9,717,000 shares of Class A Common  Stock
in   an  underwritten  public  offering.  Net  proceeds  of  the  offering  were
approximately $223 million and were used to repay outstanding debt. In addition,
the Company refinanced its bank credit agreement. The new bank credit agreements
consist of a term loan of $200  million and revolving loans of $350 million.  In
addition,  the Company entered a new letter  of credit bank facility that allows
the Company to issue up to $200  million in trade letters of credit and  finance
up  to $100 million of the trade letters of credit for up to 90 days. Borrowings
under the above credit agreements are essentially unsecured and bear interest at
the bank's base lending rate or at approximately LIBOR plus 0.375%. The rate  of
interest  payable on  outstanding borrowing  decreases as  the Company's implied
senior debt  rating from  certain credit  rating agencies  improves. In  January
1996,  the Company achieved an  implied senior debt rating  of BBB from Standard
and Poors, Inc., its fifth debt rating upgrade in less than four years.
 
     Cash used  by  operating  activities  for  the  1995  fiscal  year  totaled
approximately  $(13.6) million compared to cash provided by operating activities
of $77.8 million  in fiscal 1994.  The use of  cash in fiscal  1995 compared  to
fiscal  1994  reflects  the  increase in  working  capital,  primarily inventory
necessary to support increases in net revenues  for fiscal 1995 of over 16%.  In
addition,  the increase in inventory  reflects management's decision to increase
inventory in core products and growth  brands (Calvin Klein, Warner's and  Chaps
by Ralph Lauren) to continue its growth and improve service levels to customers.
 
     Interest  expense for fiscal 1995 totalled $33.9 million, a slight increase
over the $32.5 million in  fiscal 1994. Interest expense includes  approximately
$1.2  million of non-cash interest in both fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1994. Non-cash
interest primarily  reflects amortization  of deferred  debt issue  costs. As  a
result  of  receiving  approximately  $223  million  of  net  proceeds  from the
Company's stock  offering in  October 1995,  the Company  expects that  interest
expense  will be reduced to approximately $25 million in fiscal 1996. The actual
level of  interest  expense  that the  Company  will  incur in  fiscal  1996  is
dependent on several factors, including the overall level of interest rates, the
general  level of economic activity, the level of retail sales and the Company's
need for working capital to fund growth in its operations.
 
     At  January  6,  1996,  the  Company  had  approximately  $293  million  of
additional  borrowing available under the revolving  loan portions of its United
States bank facilities. The  Company also has bank  credit agreements in  Canada
and  Europe. At January  6, 1996, the  Company had approximately  $29 million of
additional credit available  under these agreements.  The Company believes  that
funds available under its various bank facilities, together with cash flow to be
generated  from  future  operations,  will be  sufficient  to  meet  the capital
expenditure requirements and  working capital  needs of  the Company,  including
interest and debt principal payments for the next twelve months and for at least
the next several years.
 
     Capital   expenditures  for   new  facilities,   improvements  to  existing
facilities and for  machinery and  equipment were  approximately $12.4  million,
$17.5  million  and $39.1  million  in the  1993,  1994 and  1995  fiscal years,
respectively. Depreciation expense  was $9.2  million, $10.8  million and  $13.3
million in the

<PAGE>
1993,  1994  and  1995  fiscal  years,  respectively.  The  increase  in capital
expenditures in fiscal 1995 compared  to fiscal 1994 represents the  significant
investment in store fixtures for both the Calvin Klein and Chaps by Ralph Lauren
brands.
 
SEASONALITY
 
     The operations of the Company are somewhat seasonal, with approximately 56%
of  net  revenues,  60%  of  operating  income  before  non-recurring  items and
substantially all  of the  Company's  net cash  flow from  operating  activities
generated  in  the second  half  of the  fiscal  year. Generally,  the Company's
operations during  the  first  half  of  the  year  are  financed  by  increased
borrowing.  The following sets  forth the net  revenues, operating income before
non-recurring items and net  cash flow from  operating activities generated  for
each quarter of fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995.

INFLATION
 
     The  Company  does  not  believe that  the  relatively  moderate  levels of
inflation which have been experienced in  the United States, Canada and  Western
Europe  have had a significant effect on  its net revenues or its profitability.
Management believes that, in the past, the Company has been able to offset  such
effects  by  increasing prices  or  by instituting  improvements  in efficiency.
Mexico historically has been  subject to high rates  of inflation; however,  the
effects  of high rates  of inflation on  the operation of  the Company's Mexican
subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the results of operations of  the
Company.
 
IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
     The  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position 93-7 -- Reporting  on Advertising Costs ('SOP  93-7') in December  1993
effective  for the  Company's 1995 fiscal  year. SOP 93-7  requires, among other
things, that  certain advertising  and promotional  costs that  the Company  had
previously  deferred and  amortized over the  period benefitted  must be charged
directly to operations in the period  the advertisement first runs. The  Company
incurred  a special charge  for advertising costs  previously deferable of $11.7
million ($7.3  million net  of  income tax  benefits)  primarily in  the  fourth
quarter of fiscal 1995 related to SOP 93-7.
 
     In  October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
on  Financial  Accounting   Standards  No.  123,   Accounting  for   Stock-Based
Compensation   ('FAS  123'),  which  establishes  market  value  accounting  and
reporting standards for stock-based  employee compensation plans. Companies  may
elect  to continue to  account for stock-based  compensation using the intrinsic
value approach under APB Opinion  No. 25. The Company  is required to adopt  FAS
123  for  its 1996  fiscal  year and  anticipates  that the  accounting  for its
stock-based compensation will  continue to  follow APB Opinion  25. The  Company
expects  to provide  pro-forma disclosure in  fiscal 1996 using  the fair market
value method specified in FAS 123.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of The Warnaco Group, Inc.
 
In  our opinion,  the accompanying  consolidated balance  sheet and  the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders'  equity and cash flows  present
fairly,  in all material respects, the  financial position of The Warnaco Group,
Inc. and  its  subsidiaries  at  January  6, 1996,  and  the  results  of  their
operations  and their  cash flows  for the  year then  ended in  conformity with
generally accepted  accounting principles.  These financial  statements are  the
responsibility  of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of these statements  in accordance  with generally  accepted auditing  standards
which  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the  financial statements  are free of  material misstatement.  An
audit  includes examining, on a test  basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in  the financial  statements, assessing  the accounting  principles
used  and significant estimates  made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides   a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
 
As  discussed in  Note 3 to  the consolidated financial  statements, the Company
adopted  the  provisions   of  the  American   Institute  of  Certified   Public
Accountants' Statement of Position 93-7, 'Reporting on Advertising Costs' during
the year ended January 6, 1996.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
The Warnaco Group, Inc.
 
     We  have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Warnaco
Group, Inc. as of  January 7, 1995, and  the related consolidated statements  of
income,  stockholders' equity and  cash flows for  each of the  two years in the
period ended January 7, 1995. Our  audits also included the financial  statement
schedule  listed  in the  Index at  Item 14(a).  These financial  statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our  responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
 
     We  conducted  our audits  in accordance  with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also  includes
assessing  the  accounting principles  used  and significant  estimates  made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In  our opinion,  the consolidated  financial statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
The Warnaco Group, Inc. at January 7, 1995, and the consolidated results of  its
operations  and its  cash flows for  each of the  two years in  the period ended
January 7, 1995,  in conformity with  generally accepted accounting  principles.
Also,  in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents  fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
     As  discussed  in  Note 9  to  the consolidated  financial  statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other  than
pensions in 1993.

                            THE WARNACO GROUP, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Organization:  The Warnaco Group, Inc.  (the 'Company') was incorporated in
Delaware on March 14, 1986 and on May 10, 1986 acquired substantially all of the
outstanding shares of Warnaco Inc.  ('Warnaco') ('Acquisition'). Warnaco is  the
principal operating subsidiary of the Company.
 
     Nature of Operations: The Company designs, manufactures and markets a broad
line  of  women's  intimate  apparel,  men's  underwear  and  men's  sportswear,
accessories and dress  furnishings under a  number of owned  and licensed  brand
names.  The Company's products are sold to department and specialty stores, mass
merchandise stores, catalog  and other retailers  throughout the United  States,
Canada, Mexico and Western Europe.
 
     Basis  of  Consolidation  and Presentation:  The  accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements include  the accounts of  The Warnaco Group,  Inc. and  all
subsidiary  companies  for  the years  ended  January 8,  1994  ('Fiscal 1993'),
January 7, 1995 ('Fiscal 1994') and January 6, 1996 ('Fiscal 1995'). Fiscal 1993
included 53 weeks of operations. The impact of the additional week of operations
was not material to the operations of the Company.
 
     The preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions that  affect the  reported  amounts of  assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure  of contingent assets  and liabilities, at the  date of the financial
statements, and  the  reported  amounts  of revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
     Certain  amounts  have been  reclassified to  conform  to the  current year
presentation.
 
     Translation of Foreign Currencies: Cumulative translation adjustments arise
primarily from  consolidating foreign  operations and  are applied  directly  to
stockholders' equity.
 
     Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the  lower of cost, determined on a
first-in-first-out basis, or market.
 
     Depreciation and  Amortization:  Provision  is  made  for  depreciation  of
property,  plant and equipment  computed over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method, as summarized below:
 
<TABLE>

<S>                                                                                  <C>
Buildings......................................................................      20-40 years
Building improvements..........................................................       2-20 years
Machinery and equipment........................................................       3-10 years
</TABLE>
 
     Licenses, trademarks and  other intangible  assets are  amortized over  the
estimated  economic life  of the  assets which  range from  20 to  40 years. The
excess of cost over net assets acquired is amortized over 40 years. The carrying
value of the excess of cost over  net assets acquired will be reviewed if  facts
and  circumstances suggest that it  may be impaired. If  such a determination is
made, the  Company  will reduce  the  carrying  value of  this  asset.  Deferred
financing  costs are amortized over the life of the related debt, using the debt
outstanding method.
 
     Start-Up Costs:  The  Company  defers certain  costs  associated  with  the
start-up  of new manufacturing  facilities and certain  new businesses. Deferred
costs are amortized using the straight-line method principally over five  years.
Start-up   costs,  net   of  accumulated  amortization,   were  $19,982,000  and
$34,673,000 at  January 7,  1995  and January  6,  1996, respectively,  and  are
included in other assets.
 
     Employee  Retirement Plans: The Company has a non-contributory pension plan
and  defined  contribution  retirement  plans  for  the  benefit  of  qualifying
employees.  Contributions are deposited with fund managers who invest the assets
of the plans.
 
     Income Taxes: The provision for income  taxes and income taxes payable  are
determined  in accordance with  Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.
109.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     Capitalized  Leases:  The   asset  values  and   related  amortization   of
capitalized   leases  are  included  with  property,  plant  and  equipment  and
accumulated depreciation  and the  associated debt  is included  with  long-term
debt.
 
     Revenue  Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped
to customers.
 
     Income per Common Share: Income per  common share is based on the  weighted
average  number  of  shares  of Common  Stock  outstanding  taking  into account
potential dilution from Common Stock equivalents.
 
     Concentration of Credit Risk: The Company sells its products to  department
stores,  specialty outlets, catalogs, direct sellers and mass merchandisers. The
Company  performs  periodic  credit  evaluations  of  its  customers'  financial
condition  and generally  does not require  collateral. Credit  losses have been
within management's expectations. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company's net revenues in any of the three years in the period ended January  6,
1996.
 
NOTE 2 - ACQUISITION
 
     On  March 14, 1994,  the Company acquired certain  assets and the worldwide
trademarks, rights and business  of Calvin Klein  men's underwear, licensed  the
Calvin  Klein  trademark  for  men's  accessories  and  acquired  the  worldwide
trademarks and  rights  of  Calvin  Klein  women's  intimate  apparel  upon  the
expiration  of an existing license on December  31, 1994. The purchase price was
approximately $60,924,000  and  consisted of  cash  payments of  $33,103,000  in
fiscal  1994 and $5,000,000 in fiscal 1995  and the issuance of 1,699,492 shares
of the Company's Common Stock valued at the fair market value ($13.43 per  share
or  $22,821,000) for  such shares. The  acquisition was accounted  for under the
purchase  method  of   accounting.  Accordingly,   the  accompanying   financial
statements  include the results of the  Calvin Klein businesses commencing March
15, 1994.
 
     The purchase price was  allocated to the fair  value of assets acquired  as
summarized below (in millions of dollars):

</TABLE>
 
     In  February 1995,  the Company  terminated the  license agreement  for the
production of men's underwear  and women's intimate  apparel bearing the  Calvin
Klein  name  in Canada.  The Company  will directly  design, produce  and market
Calvin Klein men's underwear and women's intimate apparel in Canada. The cost of
terminating the license  agreement before its  expiration in the  year 2000  was
$6,200,000.
 
NOTE 3 - SPECIAL CHARGE FOR ADVERTISING COSTS PREVIOUSLY DEFERABLE
 
     In  December 1993, the  American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement  of  Position 93-7  --  Reporting on  Advertising  Costs  ('SOP
93-7').  SOP 93-7  requires, among  other things,  that certain  advertising and
promotion costs that the Company had previously deferred and amortized over  the
period  the  advertising benefitted,  be expensed  when the  advertisement first
runs. As a result, the Company  recorded a special charge for advertising  costs
previously  deferable of $11,745,000  ($7,282,000 net of  income tax benefits of
$4,463,000) primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 related to SOP  93-7.
Advertising  and promotion expense was  $31,578,000, $37,192,000 and $40,988,000
(excluding the special charge)  in the years ended  January 8, 1994, January  7,
1995 and January 6, 1996, respectively.

NOTE 4 - NON-RECURRING EXPENSES
 
     On  October 3, 1993, the Company made a strategic decision to discontinue a
portion of  its  men's  manufactured  dress shirt  and  neckwear  business.  Net
revenues  for the year  ended January 8, 1994  approximated $33,500,000 for this
operation. Non-recurring expense for fiscal  1993 includes a $19,900,000  charge
for  fourth quarter losses and anticipated future losses from operations through
the estimated  date of  disposal and  losses and  expenses associated  with  the
disposal of assets, liquidation of inventories and termination of employees.
 
     In  addition,  non-recurring expense  for the  year  ended January  8, 1994
includes $2,600,000 of costs associated with the final wind-up of the  Company's
Canadian womenswear business, which had been discontinued in a prior year.
 
     In  January  1994,  the  Company's  leased  warehouse  located  in  Sylmar,
California  suffered  significant  structural  damage  due  to  the   California
earthquake  and  was  permanently  closed.  The  Company  was  able  to  recover
substantially all of its inventory,  transfer the inventory to other  locations,
and  begin shipping at normal levels in  March, 1994. The Company has earthquake
insurance and, other than  a deductible of approximately  $3 million, which  was
recorded as a non-recurring expense in the first quarter of fiscal 1994, expects
to fully recover its losses.
 
NOTE 5 - EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS
 
     In  October 1993, in conjunction with a refinancing of the Company's credit
agreement, the Company  recorded non-cash extraordinary  charges of  $18,637,000
(without  income tax benefit,  due to the Company's  then existing net operating
loss carryforwards) related to the  write-off of deferred financing costs  under
the Company's previous credit agreement.
 
     In  October 1995, in conjunction with a refinancing of the Company's credit
agreement, as more fully described in  Note 11, the Company recorded a  non-cash
extraordinary  charge of $3,120,000  (net of income  tax benefits of $1,913,000)
related to  the  write-off  of  deferred financing  costs  under  the  Company's
previous credit agreement.

     For  tax  purposes,  the  Company has  estimated  U.S.  net  operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $42,910,000 which expire from 2001 through 2007.
 
     As a result  of the  1992 public stock  offering, the  1991 initial  public
offering  and  other ownership  changes  occurring during  the  prior three-year
period, a change of ownership occurred under Internal Revenue Code Section  382,
which  effectively limits  the rate  at which  the Company  may utilize  its net
operating loss carryforwards. Nevertheless, the Company expects that it will  be
able  to utilize  substantially all of  the net operating  loss carryforwards it
would have used, absent any Section 382 limitation.

NOTE 9 - EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

PENSIONS
 
     The Company has a defined  benefit pension plan which covers  substantially
all  non-union domestic employees (the 'Plan').  The Plan is noncontributory and
benefits are based  upon years  of service and  average earnings  for the  seven
highest  consecutive calendar years of compensation  (increasing to ten years in
1999  and  fifteen  years  in  2000)  during  the  years  immediately  preceding
retirement. Pension contributions are also made to foreign plans and directly to
union sponsored plans.
 
     The  funding policy for the Plan is to make, as a minimum contribution, the
equivalent of the minimum  required by the  Employee Retirement Income  Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA).
 
     Pension costs were:

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has defined  benefit
health  care and  life insurance plans  that provide  postretirement benefits to
retired employees and former directors. The plans are contributory, with retiree
contributions adjusted  annually, and  contain cost  sharing features  including
deductibles and co-insurance. The Company does not fund postretirement benefits.
 
     Effective  January  3, 1993,  the  Company adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits
Other  than Pensions ('SFAS No. 106') and,  as a result, recorded an expense for
the cumulative effect of a change in the method of accounting for postretirement
benefits  of   $10,500,000   (without   income  tax   benefit).   Net   periodic
postretirement benefit cost is as follows:

     The  weighted average  annual assumed  rate of  increase in  the per capita
costs of  covered benefits  (health care  cost trend  rate) for  the year  ended
January  8, 1994  was 13%  for years  1-4, 10%  for years  5-9 and  5% for years
thereafter. The weighted  average annual  assumed rate  of increase  in the  per
capita  costs of covered  benefits (health care  cost trend rate)  for the years
ended January 7, 1995 and  January 6, 1996 was 11%  for years 1-3, 9% for  years
4-8,  and 5% for  years thereafter. A  1% increase in  the trend rate assumption
would have increased the cumulative effect adjustment by approximately  $442,000
and  would increase  the periodic  postretirement benefit  cost by approximately
$44,000, $34,000 and  $34,000 for the  years ended January  8, 1994, January  7,
1995, and January 6, 1996, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used
in  determining the accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation  is 8.75% and
7.50% at  January  7,  1995 and  January  6,  1996, respectively.  The  rate  is
consistent with the discount rate used in valuing the Company's pension plans.
 
     The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan for substantially all
of  its domestic employees. Employees  can contribute to the  plan, on a pre-tax
and after tax  basis, a percentage  of their qualifying  compensation up to  the
legal  limits allowed. Beginning  July 1, 1995,  the Company contributes amounts
equal to  15%  of  the  first  6%  of  employee  contributions  to  the  defined
contribution plan. The maximum Company contribution on behalf of any employee is
$1,350  in any year. Employees vest in the Company contribution over four years.
Company contribution to the defined  contribution plan totaled $125,000 for  the
year  ended January 6, 1996 (none in the years ended January 8, 1994 and January
7, 1995).

     On October 12, 1995, the Company  entered into Bank Credit Agreements  (the
'1995  Bank Credit Agreements') with substantially  the same lenders as those in
the Company's previous bank  credit agreement. The  1995 Bank Credit  Agreements
provide  for a  term loan  of $200 million,  a five  year revolving  loan in the
amount of  $250 million  and a  364 day  revolving loan  in the  amount of  $100
million ('Revolving Credit Facilities'). The 364 day revolving loan is renewable
at  the  Company's  option.  Amounts  outstanding  under  the  1995  Bank Credit
Agreements bear  interest at  the Bank's  base lending  rate, or  at LIBOR  plus
0.425%.  In addition, the 1995 Bank Credit Agreements allow the Company to place
amounts borrowed under the $250 million revolving loan portion of the 1995  Bank
Credit  Agreements for bid  with participating credit  institutions. The Company
has the  right  to  accept or  reject  any  bids offered  by  the  participating
institutions.  Amounts  drawn  under  the Revolving  Credit  Facilities  are not
limited to any borrowing base. Borrowings  under the 1995 Credit Agreements  are
unsecured. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on unused portions of
the  Revolving Credit Facilities  equal to 0.175%  per annum in  the case of the
$250 million revolving loan and 0.125% per annum on the 364 day revolving  loan.
Unused  commitments under  the Revolving  Credit Facilities  at January  6, 1996
amounted to approximately $293 million. The rate of interest payable on  amounts
outstanding under the 1995 Bank Credit Agreements and the commitment fee payable
on  unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facilities decreases as the Company's
implied senior debt rating, from certain credit rating agencies, improves.
 
     The  1995  Bank  Credit  Agreements  contain  various  covenants  involving
additional  debt,  liens  on  Company property,  mergers,  investments  in other
entities, asset sales  and other  items. The  1995 Bank  Credit Agreements  also
require  the Company  to meet  certain financial tests,  which as  of January 6,
1996, were as follows: (1) Minimum net worth -- $471,300,000, (2) Leverage ratio
of .550 to 1, and (3) Fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1. As of January 6,
1996, the Company was  in compliance with  all of the  covenants under the  1995
Bank Credit Agreements.
 
     On  October 14, 1993,  the Company entered into  a Financing Agreement (the
'1993 Financing'). The  1993 Financing provided  for a revolving  loan of up  to
$200  million (subsequently increased to  $235 million) and a  term note of $300
million  at  the  lender's  base  rate  plus  .25%.  It  also  provided  for   a

LIBOR  option at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%. In May 1994, the Company obtained a
senior credit rating of BBB- from certain credit rating agencies, which  reduced
the  interest rate payable on the Company's  outstanding debt to the bank's base
rate or LIBOR plus  .875%. In addition,  in June 1994  the Company negotiated  a
further  reduction  in  the  interest rate  on  the  Company's  outstanding debt
obligations to LIBOR plus  50 basis points. The  1993 Financing was replaced  in
October 1995 by the 1995 Bank Credit Agreements.
 
     Certain  provisions in the  1993 Financing required the  Company to fix the
interest rate  on  $125 million  of  the Company's  $500  million  (subsequently
increased  to  $535 million)  facility. As  a result,  the Company  entered into
agreements which effectively fixed the Company's interest rate on $25 million at
6.31%, $150 million at 6.57% and  $100 million at 4.29%. The agreements  expired
prior  to their maturity in October 1995, when the Company entered into the 1995
Bank Credit Agreements.  There was  no cost to  the Company  to terminate  these
agreements prior to their maturity. The related write-off of deferred debt issue
costs  associated with the 1993 Financing  amounted to $3,120,000 (net of income
tax benefits of $1,913,000) and was recorded in October 1995 as an extraordinary
item related to the early extinguishment of debt.
 
     In October  1995,  in  conjunction  with  entering  the  1995  Bank  Credit
Agreements,  the  Company entered  into  an agreement  with  a bank  whereby the
interest rate on $150,000,000 of the Company's variable rate debt was fixed  for
a  term of  three years at  an interest  rate of 5.99%.  Differences between the
fixed interest  rate  and  the  three month  LIBOR  interest  rate  are  settled
quarterly  between the Company  and the bank.  The Company made  a payment under
this agreement  amounting to  $20,000 in  the year  ended January  6, 1996.  The
Company estimates that the cost to terminate the agreement as of January 6, 1996
would have been approximately $3,214,000.
 
     Cash  interest paid amounted to $37,069,000, $30,680,000 and $32,667,000 in
the years  ended  January  8,  1994,  January  7,  1995  and  January  6,  1996,
respectively.
 
     The  Company's average interest  rate on all its  outstanding bank debt was
approximately  6.35%  and  6.19%  at  January  7,  1995  and  January  6,  1996,
respectively.
 
     In  December 1995, the Company entered into a $200,000,000 credit agreement
with its  banks  which provides  the  Company with  a  credit facility  for  the
issuance  of commercial letters of credit (the 'L/C Facility'). The L/C Facility
replaced a previous  facility with the  same lenders in  an aggregate amount  of
$80,000,000  (subsequently increased to $100,000,000).  In addition to providing
for the issue of  trade letters of  credit, the L/C  Facility provides that  the
Company  may borrow,  for a period  of 90  days, the amounts  due under maturing
trade letters of credit  ('90 Day Loans'). Total  amounts outstanding under  the
L/C  Facility, including the face  amount of trade letters  of credit and 90 Day
Loans may not exceed $200,000,000 in the  aggregate. The total amount of 90  Day
Loans  outstanding may not exceed $100,000,000  at any time. Amounts outstanding
under 90 Day  Loans accrue interest  at the bank's  base rate or  at LIBOR  plus
0.4250%.  The interest rate payable on outstanding 90 Day Loans decreases as the
Company's implied senior debt rating improves. The L/C Facility is for a term of
one year. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused  portion
of  the L/C Facility equal to 0.125% per  annum of the average unused portion of
the L/C  Facility. The  Company  classifies 90  Day  Loans with  trade  accounts
payable.  The amount of 90 Day Loans  outstanding at January 7, 1995 and January
6, 1996 was $7,244,000 and $41,369,000, respectively.
 
     The Company issues stand-by and  commercial letters of credit  guaranteeing
the  Company's  performance under  certain purchase  agreements. The  letters of
credit are issued under the terms of the 1995 Bank Credit Agreements and the L/C
Facility. At January 7,  1995 and January 6,  1996, the Company had  outstanding
letters   of  credit   totalling  approximately   $42,515,000  and  $49,785,000,
respectively, of which $10,599,000 and $6,490,000, respectively, reduced amounts
available under the Revolving Credit Facilities.

     The Company  and certain  of  its foreign  subsidiaries have  entered  into
credit  agreements that provide  for revolving lines  of credit ('Foreign Credit
Facilities'). The  terms  of the  Foreign  Credit Facilities  are  substantially
similar to the 1995 Bank Credit Agreements. At January 6, 1996, the total amount
of  credit available under  the Foreign Credit  Facilities was approximately $29
million.
 
     The Company is required to maintain compensating balances securing  certain
credit  arrangements. Such balances amounted to $114,000 and $100,000 at January
7, 1995 and January 6, 1996,  respectively. In addition, the Company  classifies
lock  box receipts not available until the next business day as restricted cash.
Such balances  amounted to  $1,804,000 and  $3,839,000 at  January 7,  1995  and
January 6, 1996, respectively.
 
NOTE 12 - CAPITAL STOCK
 
     On  August  25,  1994,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a
two-for-one stock split  for stockholders  of record  on September  8, 1994  and
effective  October 3, 1994. The split increased the number of outstanding shares
of Class A  Common Stock and  outstanding options by  100%. Exercise prices  for
outstanding  options were adjusted to reflect  the split. All outstanding shares
and per share information has  been restated to reflect the  split as if it  had
occurred at the beginning of each period presented.
 
     On May 14, 1993, the stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the
Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which authorized the
issuance  of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $.01
and increased the authorized number of shares of Common Stock from 40,000,000 to
65,000,000. On May 11,  1995, the Company approved  amendments to the  Company's
Amended  and  restated  Certificate of  Incorpoation  increasing  the authorized
number of shares of Common Stock from 65,000,000 to 130,000,000.
 
     Prior to May 1994, dividends  to common stockholders were restricted  under
certain  covenants of the debt agreements.  The provision of the debt agreements
restricting the Company's ability to  pay dividends were automatically  modified
upon  the Company's  achievement of  an investment  grade senior  debt rating of
BBB-from Standard & Poor's  and, as a  result, the Company  may declare and  pay
dividends. On June 30, 1995 the Company paid its first quarterly dividend on its
Common  Stock equal to  $.07 per common  share. Total dividends  paid during the
year ended January 6, 1996 were $5,868,000. In addition, on November 7, 1995 the
Company's declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share payable on January 8,
1996 to  shareholders  of record  on  December  1, 1995.  The  accrued  dividend
amounted  to $3,624,000 and was  paid on January 8,  1996. On February 22, 1996,
the Company declared  a quarterly cash  dividend of $0.07  per share payable  on
April  5, 1996 to shareholders of record on  March 1, 1996. The 1995 Bank Credit
Agreements include certain restrictions on  the amount of dividends the  Company
may declare in any period.
 
     In  1988, the Company adopted the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('Stock
Purchase Plan'). The Stock Purchase Plan  provides for sales of up to  4,800,000
shares  of Class A Common Stock of the Company to certain key employees. At both
January  7,  1995  and  January  6,  1996,  4,521,300  shares  were  issued  and
outstanding pursuant to grants under the Stock Purchase Plan. The Stock Purchase
Plan  is  administered  by  the  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  Administrative
Committee of the Board  of Directors which has  full authority to determine  the
number  of shares granted or sold, vesting requirements, voting requirements and
conditions of  any  stock purchase  agreement  between  the Company  and  a  key
employee.
 
     All  shares were sold at amounts determined  to be equal to the fair market
value of  the  shares.  The  shares are  subject  to  vesting  requirements  and
restrictions  on  the  transfer  of ownership.  In  addition,  certain employees
elected to pay for the shares granted by executing a promissory note payable  to
the  Company. Notes totalling  $6,561,000 and $5,971,000 at  January 7, 1995 and
January 6, 1996 are non-

interest bearing, while the balance earn interest at approximately 8%. The  note
maturities range from five to ten years.
 
     Notes  receivable from employees are deducted from stockholders' equity and
are principally owed by officers and directors of the Company.
 
     During 1991, the  Company established  The Warnaco Group,  Inc. 1991  Stock
Option  Plan  ('Option Plan')  and authorized  the issuance  of up  to 1,500,000
shares of Class A Common  Stock to cover grants to  be made under the plan.  The
Option  Plan is  administered by a  committee of  the Board of  Directors of the
Company which determines  the number of  stock options to  be granted under  the
Option  Plan,  and the  terms and  conditions  of such  grants. The  Option Plan
provides for  the granting  of qualified  stock options  within the  meaning  of
Internal  Revenue Code Section 422 and non-qualified stock options. In addition,
the Option Plan  limits the amount  of qualified stock  options that may  become
exercisable  by any  individual during  a calendar  year and  limits the vesting
period for options awarded under the Option Plan.
 
     On May 14,  1993, the  stockholders approved  the adoption  of The  Warnaco
Group,  Inc. 1993  Stock Plan  ('Stock Plan'). The  Stock Plan  provided for the
issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company through awards
of stock  options, stock  appreciation  rights, performance  awards,  restricted
stock units and stock unit awards. On May 12, 1994, the stockholders approved an
amendment  to the  Stock Plan  whereby the number  of shares  issuable under the
Stock Plan is automatically increased each year by 3% of the outstanding  number
of  shares of Class  A Common Stock of  the Company as of  the beginning of each
fiscal year. The total number of  shares available for issuance under the  Stock
Plan  as of  January 6,  1996 was 5,873,601.  The Compensation  Committee of the
Board of Directors has the sole and complete authority to make awards under  the
Stock  Plan and to determine  the specific terms and  conditions of such awards,
except that the exercise price of any option award may not be less than the fair
market value of the Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant.
 
     In May 1994, the Company's stockholders  approved the adoption of the  1993
Non-Employee  Director Stock Plan ('Director  Plan'). The Director Plan provides
for awards of non-qualified  stock options to directors  of the Company who  are
not  employees  of the  Company.  Options granted  under  the Director  Plan are
exercisable in whole or in part until the earlier of ten years from the date  of
the grant or one year from the date on which an optionee ceases to be a Director
eligible  for  grants. Options  are  granted at  the  fair market  value  of the
Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant. The Director Plan provides  for

NOTE 15 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The  following  methods  and  assumptions  were  used  by  the  Company  in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments.
 
     Revolving and term loans. The carrying amounts of the Company's outstanding
balances under its 1995 Credit Agreements and other outstanding debt approximate
the fair  value because  the  interest rate  on  the outstanding  borrowings  is
variable and there are no prepayment penalties.
 
     Interest  rate swap agreement. The fair value of the Company's agreement to
fix the interest  rate on  $150,000,000 of its  outstanding debt  is based  upon
quoted market prices.
 
     Letters  of credit. Letters of credit collaterlize the Company's obligation
to third parties  and have  terms ranging  from 30 days  to one  year. The  face
amount  of the  letters of credit  are a  reasonable estimate of  the fair value
since the value for each is fixed over its relatively short maturity.
 
     The carrying amounts and fair value of the Company's financial  instruments
as of January 7, 1995 and January 6, 1996 are as follows (in thousands):

        THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 4, 1995, among WARNACO INC.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), THE WARNACO GROUP, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Group"), the various financial institutions as are or may become

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

        WHEREAS, the Borrower, certain financial institutions and Scotiabank are
parties to a Credit Agreement, dated as of July 16, 1993 (as amended or
otherwise modified to the date hereof, the "Existing Credit Agreement"),
pursuant to which, inter alia, such financial institutions have made (or
participated in) loans to the Borrower, as listed on Schedule I hereto, and
Scotiabank provides a documentary letter of credit facility in favor of the
Borrower and has issued those letters of credit (the "Existing Letters of
Credit") listed on Schedule I hereto;

        WHEREAS, the Borrower, certain financial institutions and Scotiabank, as
agent, are parties to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of
August 31, 1995 (as amended or otherwise modified to the date hereof, the
"Existing Amended and Restated Agreement"), pursuant to which such financial
institutions have made (or participated in) loans to the Borrower (such loans,
together with the loans made to the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement
are collectively referred to as the "Existing Loans"), as listed on Schedule I
hereto;

        WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders refinance and
replace the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Amended and Restated
Agreement with this Agreement; providing a documentary letter of credit facility
in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the Letter of Credit Commitment
Amount;

        WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement the Borrower desires to obtain
Commitments from the Lenders pursuant to which

               (a) documentary Letters of Credit will be issued by the Fronting
        Bank for the account of the Borrower to support obligations of the
        Borrower and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (and their respective

        time to time hereunder prior to the Commitment Termination Date; and

               (b) Loans will be made by the Fronting Bank to the Borrower and,
        under the several obligations hereunder, each of the Lenders will, to
        the extent of such Lender's Percentage, participate in or make the Loans
        from time to time prior to the Commitment Termination Date;

        WHEREAS, the Fronting Bank and the Lenders are willing, on the terms and
subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth (including Article VI), to
extend such Commitments, make and participate in such Loans and issue and
participate in such Letters of Credit; and

        WHEREAS, the proceeds of Loans will be used for the sole purpose of
providing the Borrower with up to a three-month (or 90-day, in the case of Base
Rate Loans) trade credit in respect of disbursements made to the beneficiaries
of Letters of Credit and Letters of Credit will be issued solely to support the
worldwide sourcing of merchandise by the Borrower and its wholly- owned

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                    Article I

                        DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS

        Section 1.1. Defined Terms. The following terms (whether or not
underscored) when used in this Agreement, including its preamble and recitals,
shall, except where the context otherwise requires, have the following meanings
(such meanings to be equally applicable to the singular and plural forms
thereof):

        "Agent" is defined in the preamble and includes each other Person as
shall have subsequently been appointed as the successor Agent pursuant to
Section 10.4.

        "Agreement" means, on any date, this Credit Agreement as originally in
effect on the Effective Date and as thereafter from time to time amended,
supplemented, amended and restated, or otherwise modified and in effect on such
date.

        "Alternate Base Rate" means, on any date and with respect to all Base
Rate Loans, a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the higher of

               (a)  the rate of interest most recently announced by
        Scotiabank at its Domestic Office as its base rate for
        Dollar loans; and

               (b) the Federal Funds Rate most recently determined by the Agent
        plus 1/2 of 1%.

                                       -2-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>




The Alternate Base Rate is not necessarily intended to be the lowest rate of
interest determined by Scotiabank in connection with extensions of credit.
Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Loans maintained as Base
Rate Loans will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate
Base Rate. The Agent will give notice promptly to the Borrower of changes in the
Alternate Base Rate.

        "Applicable Margin" means, on any date, a percentage per annum
determined by reference to the Implied Senior Rating in effect on such date as
set forth below:

<TABLE>

BB+ or below                           0.250%                      0.875%
BBB-                                   0.000%                      0.500%
BBB                                    0.000%                      0.425%

        The Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the Implied
Senior Rating in effect from time to time; provided, however, that no change in
the Applicable Margin shall be effective until three Business Days after the
date on which the Agent receives evidence reasonably satisfactory to it from
Group or the Borrower that a new Implied Senior Rating is in effect. In the
event that at any time no Implied Senior Rating shall be in effect, the
Applicable Margin shall be 0.250% for each Base Rate Loan and 0.875% for each
LIBO Rate Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the sixth-month anniversary

        Section 2.1. Commitments. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement (including Article VI), each Lender severally agrees as follows:

        Section 2.1.1. Loan Commitment. From time to time on any Business Day
each Lender severally agrees, subject to the terms of this Agreement (including
Article VI) that

               (a) in the case of the Fronting Bank, it will make trade credit
        loans (the "Loans") to the Borrower on the Disbursement Date of each
        Letter of Credit for a period not to exceed the Stated Maturity Date for
        such Loan in a principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of
        Disbursements made under one or more Letters of Credit on such
        Disbursement Date; and

        such capacity), such Lender will participate in the Loans made by the
        Fronting Bank pursuant to this Agreement and, if required pursuant to
        the terms of this Agreement, such Lender will refinance and reimburse
        the Fronting Bank for the outstanding principal amount of Loans
        previously made by the Fronting Bank in an amount equal to its
        Percentage of the aggregate amount of all (or, if elected by the
        Fronting Bank, less than all) Loans then outstanding and owing to the
        Fronting Bank (in its capacity as the Fronting Bank), and upon the
        receipt by the Fronting Bank of immediately available funds from a
        Lender in respect of the reimbursement or refinancing of a Loan
        previously made by and owing to the Fronting Bank, the amount so
        received by the Fronting Bank will thereafter be a Loan owing to such
        Lender (and no longer owing to the Fronting Bank). No Lender's
        obligation to make any Loan shall be affected by any other Lender's
        failure to make any Loan. On the terms and subject to the conditions
        hereof, the Borrower may from time to time borrow Loans and continue or
        convert such Loans as Base Rate Loans or LIBO Rate Loans pursuant to

                                      -14-

        the terms hereof, but once a particular Loan is repaid or prepaid by the
        Borrower, it cannot be reborrowed. Notwithstanding anything contained
        herein to the contrary, so long as any Lender shall be in default in its
        obligation to fund its pro rata share of any Loans (as notified to such
        Lender by the Agent, the Agent agreeing to use good faith efforts to
        give such notification promptly following the occurrence of such
        default) or shall have rejected its obligations under its Commitments,
        then such Lender shall not be entitled to receive any payments of
        principal of or interest on its pro rata share of the Loans or its share
        of any commitment or other fees payable hereunder (including fees
        payable pursuant to Section 3.3) unless and until (x) the Loans of all
        the other Lenders and all interest thereon have been paid in full, (y)
        such failure to fulfill its obligation to fund is cured or (z) the
        Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have
        become immediately due and payable, and for purposes of voting or
        consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents, such Lender
        shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" hereunder and such Lender's
        Percentage shall each be deemed to be zero (0) (with each other Lender's
        Percentage being increased proportionately for purposes of the
        definition of "Required Lenders" so that all such non-defaulting
        Lenders' Percentages shall collectively equal 100%). No Commitment of
        any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected by any such failure
        or rejections by any other Lender. Any payments of principal of or
        interest on Obligations which would, but for this Section, be paid to
        any Lender, shall be paid to the Lenders who shall not be in default
        under their respective Commitments and who shall not have rejected any
        Commitment, for application to the Obligations or cash collateral in
        respect of Letters of Credit in such manner and order (pro rata among
        such Lenders) as shall be determined by the Agent. The parties hereto
        acknowledge and agree that a Lender's failure to make a Loan based on
        the Borrower's failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions
        precedent to the making of Loans set forth in Article VI shall not be
        construed as such Lender being in default of its obligations to fund its
        pro rata share of Loans or a rejection of such Lender's Commitments.

        Section 2.1.2. Commitment to Issue Letters of Credit. From time to time
on any Business Day prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the Fronting Bank
will issue, and each Lender will participate in, the Letters of Credit, in
accordance with Article IV.

        Section 2.1.3. Lenders Not Permitted or Required to Make Loans and
Fronting Bank Not Permitted or Required to Issue Letters of Credit Under Certain
Circumstances. In addition to the other terms of this Agreement (including
Article VI:)

               (a) No Lender (other than, in the case of clause (a)(iii), the
        Fronting Bank acting in such capacity) shall be permitted or required to
        make any Loan if, after giving effect thereto (and the payment of any
        Reimbursement Obligations with the proceeds of such Loans or the
        refunding and refinancing of Loans made by the Fronting Bank with the
        proceeds of the Loans made by the Lenders hereunder), the aggregate
        outstanding principal amount of all Loans

                      (i) together with all Letter of Credit Outstandings, would
               exceed $200,000,000 (as such amount may be reduced from time to
               time pursuant to reductions in the Commitment Amounts),

                      (ii)  would exceed the then effective Loan
               Commitment Amount, or

                      (iii) owing by such Lender would exceed the amount of such
               Lender's Percentage multiplied by the Loan Commitment Amount.

               (b) The Fronting Bank shall not be permitted or required to issue
        any Letter of Credit or extend for an additional period of time the
        Stated Expiry Date of a previously issued Letter of Credit if, after
        giving effect thereto

                      (i) all Letter of Credit Outstandings together with the
               aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans would exceed
               $200,000,000 (as such amount may be reduced from time to time
               pursuant to reductions in the Commitment Amounts), or

                      (ii) all Letter of Credit Outstandings would exceed the
               then effective Letter of Credit Commitment Amount.

               (c) The Fronting Bank shall not be permitted or required to make
        any Loan on any Disbursement Date if, after giving effect thereto (and
        the payment of any Reimbursement Obligations with the proceeds of such
        Loans), the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans

                      (i) together with all Letter of Credit Outstandings, would
               exceed $200,000,000 (as such amount may be reduced from time to
               time pursuant to reductions in the Commitment Amounts), or

                      (ii) (including Loans made by other Lenders to refund and
               refinance Loans previously made by the Fronting Bank) would
               exceed the then effective Loan Commitment Amount.

        Section 2.2. Reduction of Commitment Amounts. The Borrower may, from
time to time on any Business Day, voluntarily reduce the amount of either
Commitment Amount; provided, however, that all such reductions shall require at
least three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent and be permanent and any
reduction to either Commitment Amount shall immediately and without any action
required on the part of any Person irrevocably cause a corresponding Dollar for
Dollar reduction in the other Commitment Amount.

        Section 2.3. Borrowing Procedure. (a) Upon any Disbursements being made
in respect of one or more Letters of Credit (whether such Letters of Credit were
issued to support the obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower (or any of their respective divisions)), the Borrower shall (unless it
shall have given notice to the Agent to the contrary prior to 3:00 p.m., New
York time, at least three Business Days prior to the date of such Disbursement)
be deemed to have delivered to the Agent a Borrowing Request pursuant to which
the Borrower shall have been deemed to irrevocably request that the Fronting
Bank make a LIBO Rate Loan with a three month Interest Period in a principal
amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Disbursements made on such date. The
Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Borrowing Request deemed to be
delivered hereunder, the making of a Loan by the Fronting Bank to reimburse the
Fronting Bank for Disbursements made under the Letters of Credit and the
acceptance by the Borrower of the proceeds of the Borrowing shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that on the date of such Borrowing
(both immediately before and after giving effect to such Borrowing and the
application of the proceeds thereof) the statements made in Section 6.2.1 are in
each case true and correct. Proceeds of such Loans shall be used to fund the
Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit under which one or
more Disbursements were made on the date of the Loan. In addition, to the extent
that the amount available under the Loan Commitment is not sufficient to fund
the entire aggregate amount of the Disbursements made on the date the Loans are
being made, then the Borrower shall have been deemed to request that Scotiabank,
in its capacity as Swingline Bank under (and as defined in) the U.S. Credit
Agreement, make a Swingline Advance (as such term is defined in the U.S. Credit
Agreement) in an amount necessary to fund the remainder of such Disbursements
(after giving effect to the Loans being made hereunder). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Scotiabank shall only be required to
make such Swingline Advances if the Borrower has satisfied all of the conditions
to making Swingline Advances under the U.S. Credit Agreement as in effect on the
date of the making of such Swingline Advances and the Borrower hereby
acknowledges and agrees that all the terms and conditions (including as to
repayment, accrual of interest and otherwise) contained in the U.S. Credit
Agreement shall be applicable to all Swingline

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

Advances made pursuant to this Section. Each of the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.1, the Existing Loans shall be deemed to be Loans made by the Fronting
Bank on the Effective Date under the terms of this Agreement and shall
thereafter accrue interest and fees pursuant to the terms hereof, and each
Lender shall participate in such Loans in an amount equal to such Lender's
Percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Loans.

        (b) In addition to the provisions of the making of Loans set forth in
clause (a), above, by delivering a Borrowing Request to the Agent on or before
11:00 a.m., New York time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time
irrevocably request, on not less than three nor more than five Business Days'
notice (in the case of LIBO Rate Loans) and on the date of such Borrowing (in
the case of Base Rate Loans), that a Borrowing be made as other than a LIBO Rate
Loan having a three month Interest Period or in an amount other than the full
amount of Disbursements with respect to which such Loan is to be made. If the
Borrower elects that a Borrowing be made as a LIBO Rate Loan having a one or two
month Interest Period pursuant to this clause, then upon the expiration of such
Interest Period the Borrower shall (unless it shall have given notice to the
Agent to the contrary prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, at least three
Business Days prior to the date of such Disbursement) be deemed to have
delivered to the Agent a Continuation/Conversion Notice pursuant to which the
Borrower shall have been deemed to irrevocably request that the Fronting Bank
continue the outstanding LIBO Rate Loan as a LIBO Rate Loan with an Interest
Period of (i) one month, in the case of the expiration of a two month or the
second of two one month Interest Periods, or (ii) two months, in the case of the
expiration of a one month Interest Period, in each case in a principal amount
equal to the amount of the LIBO Rate Loan with an Interest Period then expiring.
On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Borrowing
shall be comprised of the type of Loans, and shall be made on the Business Day,
specified (or deemed to be specified) in such Borrowing Request.

         (c) The Fronting Bank may, at any time (whether or not a Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing), in its sole and absolute
discretion but subject to clause (a)(iii) of Section 2.1.3, demand that each
other Lender make a Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of all or a portion of the Loans outstanding on the
date such demand is made. Each Lender (other than the Fronting Bank) irrevocably
agrees that it shall (whether or not the conditions to the making of a Credit
Extension contained in Article VI have been (or can be) satisfied) make such
Loan by depositing the amount so demanded in same day funds in an account
specified by the Fronting Bank on or before 11:00

                                      -18-

a.m. New York City time on the first Business Day following receipt of such a
demand. The Fronting Bank agrees to apply all such funds received by it under
this clause to refund and refinance the Loans previously made by it to the
Borrower, as identified in the demand that it delivers to the Lenders pursuant
to this clause. On the date (a "Funding Date") that the Lenders (other than the
Fronting Bank) advance funds to the Fronting Bank pursuant to this clause, the
principal amount so refunded and refinanced shall become a Loan outstanding
under such Lender's Note and shall no longer be a Loan owed to the Fronting Bank
under the Fronting Bank's Note.

        All interest payable with respect to any Loans made pursuant to this
clause shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the period of time during
which such Loans were owing to the Fronting Bank and, on and subsequent to a
Funding Date, such Loans were owing to the Lenders.

        The obligation of each Lender to make Loans by way of advancing
immediately available funds to the Fronting Bank on a Funding Date to be applied
to refund and refinance the Loans previously made by the Fronting Bank under
this clause shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which any Lender may have against Scotiabank, the Borrower or any
other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of
any Default or the inability of the Borrower to otherwise satisfy the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VI; (iii) any adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any other Obligor; (iv) the
acceleration or maturity of any Loans or other Obligations or the termination of
any Commitment after the making of any Loan; (v) any breach of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Obligor or any Lender; or
(vi) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

        Section 2.4. Continuation and Conversion Elections. By delivering a
Continuation/Conversion Notice to the Agent on or before 10:00 a.m., New York
time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably elect,
on not less than three nor more than five Business Days' notice that all, or any
portion of any Loans be, in the case of Base Rate Loans, converted into LIBO
Rate Loans or, in the case of a LIBO Rate Loan, converted into a Base Rate Loan
or continued as a LIBO Rate Loan (in the absence of delivery of a
Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan at least three
Business Days before the last day of the then current Interest Period with
respect thereto, such LIBO Rate Loan shall, on such last day, automatically
convert to a LIBO Rate Loan pursuant to the provisions of clause (b) of Section
2.3, unless such Loan is otherwise required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
this

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Agreement (including the first sentence of Section 3.1)); provided, however,
that (i) no portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Loans may be
continued as, or be converted into, LIBO Rate Loans when any Default has
occurred and is continuing and (ii) the maximum length of any Interest Period or
combination of Interest Periods for any particular Loan shall not exceed three
months.

        Section 2.5. Funding. Each Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its
obligation to participate in, and to make, continue or convert LIBO Rate Loans
hereunder by causing one of its foreign branches or affiliates (or an
international banking facility all of the capital stock or other ownership
interests of which are wholly-owned by such Lender) to make or maintain such
LIBO Rate Loan; provided, however, that such LIBO Rate Loan shall nonetheless be
deemed to have been made and to be held by such Lender, and the obligation of
the Lender to refund and refinance such LIBO Rate Loan on the Funding Date and
the obligation of the Borrower to repay such LIBO Rate Loan shall nevertheless
be of or to such Lender for the account of such foreign branch, affiliate or
international banking facility; provided, further that the Borrower shall not be
required to pay any amount under this Section or Section 5.6 that is greater
than the amount which it would have been required to pay had such Lender not
caused such branch, affiliate or facility to make or maintain such LIBO Rate
Loan. In addition, the Borrower hereby consents and agrees that, for purposes of
any determination to be made for purposes of Section 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4, it
shall be conclusively assumed that such Lender elected to fund all LIBO Rate
Loans by purchasing Dollar deposits in its LIBOR Office's interbank eurodollar
market.

        Section 2.6. Notes. The Loans of the Fronting Bank under the Loan
Commitment shall be evidenced by a Note payable to the order of the Fronting
Bank in a maximum principal amount equal to the then existing Loan Commitment
Amount, and the Loans of each Lender (other than the Fronting Bank) under the
Loan Commitment shall be evidenced by a Note payable to the order of such Lender
in a maximum principal amount equal to such Lender's Percentage multiplied by
the Loan Commitment Amount. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each
Lender to make (or cause to be made) appropriate notations on the grid attached
to such Lender's Note (or on any continuation of such grid), which notations, if
made, shall evidence, inter alia, the date of, the outstanding principal of, and
the interest rate and Interest Period applicable to the Loans evidenced thereby
and the principal amount of Loans that have been repaid (including, in the case
of the Fronting Bank, Loans that have been refunded and refinanced by the
Lenders on a Funding Date). Such notations shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of any
Lender to make any

                                    -20-

<PAGE>

such notations shall not limit or otherwise affect any Obligations of the
Borrower.

        Section 2.7. Extension of Commitment Termination Date. The Commitment
Termination Date may be extended by the Lenders in their sole and absolute
discretion upon written request of the Borrower received at least 60 days but
not more than 90 days prior to the then effective Commitment Termination Date
(as such date may have been extended). The Lenders shall give written notice to
the Borrower of their decision and, if approved, of the new Commitment
Termination Date; provided, that notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the modified Commitment Termination
Date exceed 364 days from the then expiring Commitment Termination Date. The
Lenders shall give written notice to the Borrower of their decision within 30
days of request. In the absence of the approval of any one of the Lenders, the
then effective Commitment Termination Date shall not be extended and shall
terminate and expire as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and the failure of
any Lender to deliver a written notice within the requisite period set forth
above shall be deemed to be an election by that Lender not to extend the
Commitment Termination Date.


                                   Article III

                   REPAYMENTS, PREPAYMENTS, INTEREST AND FEES

        Section 3.1. Repayments and Prepayments. The Borrower shall repay in
full the entire unpaid principal amount of each Loan upon the Stated Maturity
Date therefor. Prior thereto (and subject to Section 2.1.1), the Borrower

               (a) may, from time to time on any Business Day, make a voluntary
        prepayment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding principal amount of
        any Loans; provided, however, that all such voluntary prepayments shall
        require at least one Business Day's prior written notice to the Agent;

               (b) shall, on each date when any reduction in the Letter of
        Credit Commitment Amount shall become effective (which reduction shall
        be subject to Section 2.2), make a mandatory prepayment (which shall be
        applied (or held as cash collateral for application, as the case may be)
        by the Agent to the payment of Reimbursement Obligations of the then
        Letter of Credit Outstandings) equal to the excess, if any, of the
        aggregate, outstanding principal amount of all Letter of Credit
        Outstandings over the Letter of Credit Commitment Amount as so reduced;

                                      -21-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

               (c) shall, on each date when any reduction in the Loan Commitment
        Amount shall become effective (which reduction shall be subject to
        Section 2.2), make a mandatory prepayment of the aggregate outstanding
        principal amount of all Loans then outstanding in an amount equal to the
        excess, if any, of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
        Loans over the Loan Commitment Amount, as so reduced; and

               (d) shall, immediately upon any acceleration of the Stated
        Maturity Date of any Obligations pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3,
        repay all Obligations, unless, pursuant to Section 9.3, only a portion
        of all Obligations is so accelerated.

Each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to this Section shall be without
premium or penalty, except as may be required by Section 5.4. No voluntary
prepayment of principal of any Loans shall cause a reduction in the Loan
Commitment Amount.

        Section 3.2. Interest Provisions. Interest on the outstanding principal
amount of Loans shall accrue and be payable in accordance with this Section 3.2.

        Section 3.2.1. Rates. Loans comprising a Borrowing shall accrue interest
at a rate per annum:

               (a) on that portion maintained from time to time as a Base Rate
        Loan, equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate from time to time in
        effect plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time; or

               (b) on that portion maintained as a LIBO Rate Loan (whether made
        pursuant to clause (a) or clause (b) of Section 2.3), during each
        Interest Period applicable thereto, equal to the sum of the LIBO Rate
        (Reserve Adjusted) for such Interest Period plus the Applicable
        Margin in effect from time to time.

        The "LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted)" means, relative to any Loan to be
made, continued or maintained as, or converted into, a LIBO Rate Loan for any
Interest Period, a rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest
1/16 of 1%) determined pursuant to the following formula:

           LIBO Rate         =                 LIBO Rate
       (Reserve Adjusted)         --------------------------------
                                   1.00 - LIBOR Reserve Percentage

The LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) for any Interest Period for LIBO Rate Loans
will be determined by the Agent on the basis of the LIBOR Reserve Percentage in
effect on, and the applicable rates furnished to and received by the Agent from
Scotiabank, two Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period.

                                      -22-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        "LIBO Rate" means, relative to any Interest Period for LIBO Rate Loans,
the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest
1/16 of 1%) reported, on the first day of such Interest Period as of 11:00 a.m.
London time, on Telerate Access Service Page 3750 (British Bankers Association
Settlement Rate) as the London Interbank Offered Rate for Dollar deposits having
a term comparable to such Interest Period and in an amount of $1,000,000 or more
(or, if said page shall cease to be publicly available, as reported by any
publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Agent that, in
the Agent's reasonable judgment, accurately reflects such London Interbank
Offered Rate).

        "LIBOR Reserve Percentage" means, relative to any Interest Period for
LIBO Rate Loans, the reserve percentage, if any (expressed as a decimal) equal
to the maximum aggregate reserve requirements (including all basic, emergency,
supplemental, marginal and other reserves and taking into account any
transitional adjustments or other scheduled changes in reserve requirements)
specified under regulations issued from time to time by the F.R.S. Board and
then applicable to assets or liabilities consisting of and including
"Eurocurrency Liabilities", as currently defined in Regulation D of the F.R.S.
Board, having a term approximately equal or comparable to such Interest Period.

        All LIBO Rate Loans shall bear interest from and including the first day
of the applicable Interest Period to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such LIBO Rate
Loan.

        Section 3.2.2. Post-Maturity Rates. After the date any principal amount
of any Loan is due and payable (whether on the Stated Maturity Date, upon
acceleration or otherwise), or after any other monetary Obligation of the
Borrower shall have become due and payable, the Borrower shall pay, but only to
the extent permitted by law, interest (after as well as before judgment) on such
amounts at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the Alternate Base Rate
plus a margin of 2%, and (ii) the then applicable interest rate plus a margin of
1%.

        Section 3.2.3. Payment Dates. Interest accrued on each Loan shall be
payable, without duplication:

               (a)  on the Stated Maturity Date therefor;

               (b) on the date of any optional or required payment or
        prepayment, in whole or in part, of principal outstanding on such Loan
        (including, with respect to LIBO Rate Loans, on the last day of each
        applicable Interest Period for such LIBO Rate Loan);

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

               (c) with respect to any Base Rate Loans converted into LIBO Rate
        Loans on a day when interest would not otherwise have been payable
        pursuant to the terms hereof, on the date of such conversion; and

               (d) on that portion of any Loans the Stated Maturity Date of
        which is accelerated pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, immediately
        upon such acceleration.

Interest accrued on Loans or other monetary Obligations arising under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document after the date such amount is due and
payable (whether on the Stated Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise)
shall be payable upon demand.

        Section 3.2.4. Allocation of Interest Payments. Accrued and unpaid
interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Loans shall be allocated and
payable to the Lenders as set forth in this Section:

               (a) Interest shall be payable by the Borrower to the Fronting
        Bank (for its own account) on the outstanding principal amount of the
        Loans from the date such Loans are made to (but excluding) the Funding
        Date in an amount equal to the difference between (x) (i) in the case of
        LIBO Rate Loans, the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) or, in the case of
        Base Rate Loans, the Alternate Base Rate, plus the Applicable Margin
        then in effect for LIBO Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans (as applicable)
        multiplied by (ii) the outstanding principal amount of the LIBO Rate
        Loans or Base Rate Loans, as the case may be, minus (y) the Interest
        Amount (as defined below). Prior to the Funding Date each Lender (other
        than the Fronting Bank) shall be paid interest in an aggregate amount
        (referred to as the "Interest Amount") equal to such Lender's Percentage
        of (i) the principal amount of the Loans outstanding prior to a Funding
        Date multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Margin then in effect for LIBO
        Rate Loans (in the case of the outstanding principal amount of LIBO Rate
        Loans) or Base Rate Loans (in the case of the outstanding principal
        amount of Base Rate Loans).

               (b) On and subsequent to a Funding Date, interest shall be
        payable by the Borrower for the account of each Lender (including the
        Fronting Bank, in its capacity as a Lender) in accordance with its
        Percentage on the principal amount of the Loans actually funded by such
        Lender in an amount equal to (in the case of the outstanding principal
        amount of LIBO Rate Loans) the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) plus the
        Applicable Margin for such LIBO Rate Loans or, if applicable (in the
        case of the outstanding principal amount

        for Base Rate Loans.

        Section 3.3.  Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay the fees
set forth in this Section 3.3.  All such fees shall be non-
refundable.


        Section 3.3.1. Letter of Credit Face Amount Fee. The Borrower agrees to
pay to the Agent, for the pro rata account of the Lenders determined in
accordance with each Lender's Percentage, a fee for each Letter of Credit for
the period from and including the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit
to (but not including) the earlier of (a) the date upon which such Letter of
Credit expires and (b) the date upon which the Stated Amount of such Letter of
Credit is irrevocably reduced to zero (by the making of a Disbursement by the
Fronting Bank or otherwise), at the rates per annum determined by reference to
the Implied Senior Rating in effect from time to time as set forth below
(provided, however, that no change in the rate for Letters of Credit shall be
effective until three Business Days after the date on which the Agent receives
evidence reasonably satisfactory to it from Group or the Borrower that a new
Implied Senior Rating is in effect):

        Section 4.1. Issuance Requests. By delivering to the Agent and the
Fronting Bank an Issuance Request (such request being, in the Borrower's sole
discretion, either delivered (by telex, teletransmission or otherwise) in
accordance with the terms of the Tradexpress Agreement or in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B) on or before 3:00 p.m., New York time on the Business Day
on which a Letter of Credit is to be issued, the Borrower or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Borrower (or any of their respective divisions) may request,
from time to time on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date, that the
Fronting Bank issue an irrevocable sight documentary letter of credit in such
form as may be requested by the Borrower or such Subsidiary and approved by the
Fronting Bank (each a "Letter of Credit"), to facilitate the Borrower's and the
Borrower's Subsidiaries' worldwide sourcing of merchandise. Each Letter of
Credit shall by its terms:

               (a)  be issued in a Stated Amount which does not
        exceed (or would not exceed) the then Letter of Credit
        Availability;

               (b) be stated to expire on a date (its "Stated Expiry Date") no
        later than 180 days from its date of issuance (it being acknowledged and
        agreed by the Fronting Bank and the Lenders that the Stated Expiry Date
        may be a date that is up to 179 days subsequent to the Commitment
        Termination Date); and

               (c)  on or prior to its Stated Expiry Date:

                      (i) terminate immediately upon notice to the Fronting Bank
               thereof from the beneficiary thereunder that all obligations
               covered thereby have been terminated, paid, or otherwise
               satisfied in full, and

                      (ii) reduce in part immediately and to the extent the

otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Tradexpress Agreement or in the

Termination Date request the Fronting Bank to extend the Stated Expiry Date of
such Letter of Credit for an additional period not to exceed the earlier of 180
days from its date of extension and 179 days after the Commitment Termination
Date. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Fronting Bank may in its discretion refuse to issue any Letter of Credit if such
issuance would, in the Fronting Bank's reasonable determination, contravene any
sanctions, laws or regulations of any State of the United States or any Federal
body or authority of the United States (including but not limited to the
regulations of the Federal Reserve Bank) or the laws, regulations or sanctions
of any other applicable jurisdiction or authority or if, in the Fronting Bank's
reasonable determination, any of the above-mentioned laws, regulations or
sanctions would affect the Fronting Bank's ability to perform its obligations
with respect to any such Letter of Credit if issued.

        Section 4.2. Issuances and Extensions. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement (including Article VI), the Fronting Bank shall
issue Letters of Credit, and extend the Stated Expiry Dates of outstanding
Letters of Credit, in accordance with the Issuance Requests made therefor. The
Fronting Bank will make available the original of each Letter of Credit which it
issues in accordance with the Issuance Request therefor to the beneficiary
thereof (and, at the request of a Lender, will provide such Lender on a monthly
basis with a schedule of the outstanding Letters of Credit as of the last day of
the prior month) and will notify the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit of
any extension of the Stated Expiry Date thereof.

        Section 4.3. Destruction of Goods, etc. Neither the Fronting Bank nor
its agents or correspondents shall be responsible for the negligence or
fraudulence of any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit for the existence, nature,
condition, description, value, quality or quantity of the Goods, for the
packing, shipment, export, import, handling, storage or delivery thereof, or for
the safety or preservation thereof at any time, and neither the Fronting Bank
nor its agents or correspondents shall be liable for any loss resulting from the
total or partial destruction of or damage to or deterioration or fall in value
of the Goods, or from the delay in arrival or failure to arrive of either the
Goods or of any of the documents relating thereto, or from the inadequacy or
invalidity of any document or insurance, or from the default or insolvency of
any insurer, carrier or other Person issuing any document with respect to the
Goods, or from failure to give or delay in giving notice of arrival of the Goods
or any other notice, or from any error in or misinterpretation of or default or
delay in the sending, transmission, arrival or delivery of any message, whether
in writing or not, by post, telegraph, cable, wireless or otherwise, and the
obligations hereunder of the Borrower to the Fronting

Bank shall not be in any way lessened or affected if any Draft or document
accepted, paid or acted upon by the Fronting Bank or its agents or
correspondents does not bear a reference or sufficient reference to a Letter of
Credit or if no note thereof is made on a Letter of Credit.

        Section 4.4. Other Lenders' Participation. Each Letter of Credit issued
pursuant to Section 4.2 shall, effective upon its issuance and without further
action, be issued on behalf of all Lenders (including the Fronting Bank thereof)
according to their respective Percentages. Each Lender shall, to the extent of
its Percentage, be deemed irrevocably to have participated in the issuance of
such Letter of Credit and shall be responsible to reimburse promptly the
Fronting Bank thereof for Reimbursement Obligations which have not been
converted into a Loan on the Disbursement Date pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or reimbursed by the Borrower in accordance with Section 4.5, or which
have been converted into a Loan on the Disbursement Date pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement or reimbursed by the Borrower but must be returned, restored
or disgorged by the Fronting Bank for any reason, and each Lender shall, to the
extent of its Percentage, be entitled to receive from the Agent a ratable
portion of the letter of credit fees received by the Agent pursuant to Section
3.3.1, with respect to each Letter of Credit. In the event that the Borrower
shall fail to reimburse the Fronting Bank, or if for any reason Loans shall not
be made to fund any Reimbursement Obligation, in each case as provided in this
Agreement and in an amount equal to the Disbursement amount, or in the event the
Fronting Bank must for any reason return or disgorge such reimbursement, the
Fronting Bank shall promptly notify each Lender of the unreimbursed amount of
such drawing and of such Lender's respective participation therein. Each Lender
shall make available to the Fronting Bank, whether or not any Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, an amount equal to its respective participation in
same day or immediately available funds at the office of the Fronting Bank
specified in such notice not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
Business Day after the date notified by the Fronting Bank. In the event that any
Lender fails to make available to the Fronting Bank the amount of such Lender's
participation in such Letter of Credit as provided herein, the Fronting Bank
shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together
with interest at the Federal Funds Rate from the date such amount is due through
(but excluding) the date such payment is made (together with such other
compensatory amounts as may be required to be paid by such Lender to the Agent
pursuant to the Rules for Interbank Compensation of the council on International
Banking or the Clearinghouse Compensation Committee, as the case may be, as in
effect from time to time). Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prejudice
the right of any Lender to recover from the Fronting Bank any amounts made
available by such Lender to the Fronting Bank pursuant to this Section in the
event that it is

                                      -29-

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to
a Letter of Credit by the Fronting Bank in respect of which payment was made by
such Lender constituted gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
Fronting Bank. The Fronting Bank shall distribute to each other Lender which has
paid all amounts payable by it under this Section with respect to any Letter of
Credit issued by the Fronting Bank such other Lender's Percentage of all
payments received by the Fronting Bank from the Borrower in reimbursement of
drawings honored by the Fronting Bank under such Letter of Credit when such
payments are received.

        Section 4.5. Disbursements. The Fronting Bank will notify the Borrower
and the Agent promptly of the presentment for payment of any Letter of Credit,
together with notice of the date (a "Disbursement Date") such payment shall be
made. Subject to the terms and provisions of such Letter of Credit, and the
delivery to the Fronting Bank of all documents and instruments required as a
condition to making a Disbursement under such Letter of Credit, the Fronting
Bank shall make such payment to the beneficiary (or its designee) of such Letter
of Credit (with proceeds of Loans (and, if applicable, Swingline Loans) pursuant
to Section 2.3 or otherwise). If and to the extent that Loans (and, if
applicable, Swingline Loans) are not made to fund a Reimbursement Obligation
pursuant to Section 2.3, then the Borrower will reimburse the Fronting Bank
within one Business Day following the Disbursement Date for all amounts which
the Fronting Bank has disbursed under the Letter of Credit.

        Section 4.6. Reimbursement; Outstanding Letters, etc. (a) The Borrower's
obligation (a "Reimbursement Obligation") under Section 4.5 to reimburse the
Fronting Bank with respect to each Disbursement (including fees and interest
thereon payable pursuant to Section 3.2.2 and Section 3.3.1), and each Lender's
obligation to make participation payments pursuant to Section 4.4 in each
Disbursement, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be
reduced by any event or occurrence including, without limitation,

               (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
        legal effect of any Letter of Credit or any document submitted by any
        party in connection with the application for and issuance of a Letter of
        Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
        invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;

               (ii) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
        legal effect of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting
        to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
        thereunder or the proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove
        to be invalid or ineffective for any reason;

                                      -30-

               (iii) failure of the beneficiary to comply fully with conditions
        required in order to demand payment under a Letter of Credit;

               (iv)  errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
        transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable,
        telegraph, telex or otherwise;

               (v)  any loss or delay in the transmission or
        otherwise of any document or draft required in order to make a
        Disbursement under a Letter of Credit;

               (vi) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
        any other term of, all or any of the Obligations in respect of any
        Letter of Credit or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to
        departure from any Letter of Credit;

               (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
        that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any
        transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such
        beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Fronting Bank or
        any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions
        contemplated by the applicable Letter of Credit or any unrelated
        transaction;

               (viii) payment by the Fronting Bank under a Letter of Credit
        against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
        comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

               (ix)  any release or amendment or waiver of or consent
        to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the
        Obligations in respect of the applicable Letter of Credit;
        or

               (x) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
        not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
        that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
        of, the Borrower or a guarantor.

The obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect and shall apply to any alteration to or extension of the
expiration date of any Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit issued to
replace, extend or alter any Letter of Credit during the term of this Agreement.
None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the
rights or powers granted to the Fronting Bank or any Lender hereunder. In
furtherance and extension and not in limitation or derogation of any of the
foregoing, any action taken or omitted

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

to be taken by an Fronting Bank in good faith (and not constituting gross
negligence or willful misconduct) shall be binding upon the Borrower, each
Obligor and each such Lender, and shall not put such Fronting Bank under any
resulting liability to the Borrower, any Obligor or any such Lender, as the case
may be.

        (b) The Borrower shall pay to the Fronting Bank an amount equal to then
Stated Amount and all unpaid fees in respect of (i) any Letter of Credit
outstanding under this Agreement upon any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
any Letter of Credit which is affected by, or becomes the subject matter of, any
order, judgment, injunction or other such determination (an "Order") or any
petition or other application for any Order by the Borrower or any other party,
restricting payment by the Fronting Bank under and in accordance with such
Letter of Credit or extending the Fronting Bank's or any Lender's liability
under such Letter of Credit beyond the expiration date stated therein, or if not
stated therein, which would otherwise apply to such Letter of Credit. Payment in
respect of each such Letter of Credit described in (i) and (ii) in this clause
shall be due forthwith upon demand and in Dollars.

        (c) The Fronting Bank hereby agrees that it will, with respect to each
Letter of Credit subjected to any such demand for payment under the preceding
clause (b), upon the later of:

               (i) the date on which any final and non-appealable order,
        judgment or other such determination has been rendered or issued either
        terminating any applicable Order or permanently enjoining the Fronting
        Bank from paying under such Letter; and

               (ii) the earlier of (x) the date on which either the original
        counterpart of such Letter of Credit is returned to the Fronting Bank
        for cancellation or the Fronting Bank is released by the beneficiary
        thereof from any further obligations in respect of such Letter of
        Credit, and (y) the expiry of such Letter of Credit;

pay to the Borrower an amount in Dollars equal to any excess of the amount
received by the Fronting Bank pursuant to clause (b) above in respect of such
Letter of Credit (the "Received Amount") over the equivalent in Dollars of the
total of amounts applied to reimburse the Fronting Bank for amounts paid by it
under such Letter of Credit, if any (the Fronting Bank having the right to so
appropriate such funds), together with an additional amount in Dollars computed
by applying to the amount of such excess from time to time a per annum rate
equal to 3% less than the Alternate Base Rate. Such additional amount shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days
elapsed from and including the date of payment to the Fronting Bank of

                                      -32-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the Received Amount to (but not including) the date of return to the Borrower of
the excess.

        Section 4.7. Deemed Disbursements. Upon (i) the occurrence of any
Commitment Termination Event of the type described in clause (c) of the
definition of "Commitment Termination Event", (ii) the occurrence and during the
continuation of any event or condition specified in clause (e) of Section 6.01
of the U.S. Credit Agreement, or (iii) the occurrence and during the continuance
of any other Event of Default,

               (a) an amount equal to that portion of Letter of Credit
        Outstandings attributable to outstanding and undrawn Letters of Credit
        shall, without demand upon or notice to the Borrower, be deemed to have
        been paid or disbursed by the Fronting Bank under such Letters of Credit
        (notwithstanding that such amount may not in fact have been so paid or
        disbursed); and

               (b) upon notification by the Fronting Bank to the Agent and the
        Borrower of its obligations under this Section, the Borrower shall be
        immediately obligated to reimburse the Fronting Bank the amount deemed
        to have been so paid or disbursed by the Fronting Bank.

Any amounts so received by the Fronting Bank from the Borrower pursuant to this
Section shall be held as collateral security for the repayment of the Borrower's
Obligations in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by the Fronting
Bank. At any time when such Letters of Credit shall terminate and all
Obligations of the Fronting Bank are either terminated or paid or reimbursed to
the Fronting Bank in full, the Obligations of the Borrower under this Section
shall be reduced accordingly (subject, however, to reinstatement in the event
any payment in respect of such Letters of Credit is recovered in any manner from
the Fronting Bank), and the Fronting Bank will return to the Borrower the
excess, if any, of

               (c)  the aggregate amount deposited by the Borrower
        with the Fronting Bank and not theretofore applied by the
        Fronting Bank to any Reimbursement Obligation

over

               (d) the aggregate amount of all Reimbursement Obligations to the
        Fronting Bank pursuant to this Section, as so adjusted.

At such time when all Events of Default shall have been cured or waived, the
Fronting Bank shall return to the Borrower all amounts then on deposit with the
Fronting Bank pursuant to this Section together with an additional amount in
dollars computed by

                                      -33-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

applying to the amount so returned to the Borrower from time
to time a per annum rate equal to 3% less than the Alternate Base Rate. Such
additional amount shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 360 day year for
the actual number of days elapsed from and including the date of payment to the
Fronting Bank by the Borrower to (but not including) the date of return to the
Borrower of such amounts.

        Section 4.8. Nature of Reimbursement Obligations. The Borrower shall
assume all risks of the acts, omissions, or misuse of any Letter of Credit by
the beneficiary thereof. Any action, inaction or omission taken or suffered by
the Fronting Bank or any of the Fronting Bank's correspondents under or in
connection with a Letter of Credit or any Draft made thereunder or any document
relating thereto, if in good faith and in conformity with foreign or domestic
laws, regulations or customs applicable thereto shall be binding upon the
Borrower and shall not place the Fronting Bank or any of its correspondents
under any resulting liability to the Borrower. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Fronting Bank and its correspondents may receive, accept
or pay as complying with the terms of a Letter of Credit, any Draft thereunder,
otherwise in order which may be signed by, or issued to, the administrator or
any executor of, or the trustee in bankruptcy of, or the receiver for any
property of, or other Person or entity acting as the representative or in the
place of, such beneficiary or its successors and assigns. The Borrower covenants
that it will not take any steps, issue any instructions to the Fronting Bank or
any of its correspondents or institute any proceedings intended to derogate from
the right or ability of the Fronting Bank or its correspondents to honor and pay
any Draft or Drafts. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 4.6,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in
any other Loan Document, the Borrower irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
it is unconditionally liable for all Reimbursement Obligations with respect to
each Disbursement (including fees and interest thereon) under each Letter of
Credit, regardless of whether such Letter of Credit was issued in respect of the
sourcing or other corporate requirements or needs of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower, or otherwise.

        Section 4.9. Existing Letters of Credit. Upon the payment to Scotiabank
of all fees and other amounts due and owing to Scotiabank and the lenders
parties thereto under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Existing
Letters of Credit, and the amount and payment date of fees on Letters of Credit
(including such Existing Letters of Credit deemed to be Letters of Credit
hereunder), shall be governed by this Agreement. Simultaneously with the
effectiveness of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.8, the Existing Credit
Agreement shall be terminated and of no further force and effect, except to the
extent of any provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement which

                                      -34-

by their express terms survive termination of the Existing Credit Agreement.


                                    Article V

                     CERTAIN LIBO RATE AND OTHER PROVISIONS

        Section 5.1. LIBO Rate Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall determine
(which determination shall, upon notice thereof to the Borrower, be conclusive
and binding on the Borrower) that the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to make,
continue or maintain any Loan as, or to convert any Loan into, a LIBO Rate Loan,
the obligations of the Lenders to make, continue, maintain or convert into any
such Loans shall, upon such determination, forthwith be suspended until such
Lender shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension
no longer exist, and all LIBO Rate Loans shall automatically convert into Base
Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto
or sooner, if required by such law or assertion.

        Section 5.2.  Deposits Unavailable.  If any Lender shall
have determined that

               (a)  Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for
        the relevant Interest Period are not available to it in its
        relevant market; or

               (b) by reason of circumstances affecting such Lender's relevant
        market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate
        applicable hereunder to LIBO Rate Loans,

then, upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower and the Agent, the
obligations of the Lenders under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 to make or continue
any Loans as, or to convert any Loans into, LIBO Rate Loans shall forthwith be
suspended until such Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Agent that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

        Section 5.3. Increased LIBO Rate Loan Costs, etc. The Borrower agrees to
reimburse each Lender for any increase in the cost to such Lender of, or any
reduction in the amount of any sum receivable by such Lender in respect of,
making or continuing (or of its obligation to make or continue) any Loans as, or
of converting (or of its obligation to convert) any Loans into, LIBO Rate Loans.
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of the
occurrence of any such event, such notice to state, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor and

                                      -35-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the additional amount required fully to compensate such lender for such
increased cost or reduced amount. Such additional amounts shall be payable by
the Borrower directly to such Lender within five Business Days of its receipt of
such notice, and such notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

        Section 5.4. Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall incur any
loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
to make, continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Loan
as, or to convert any portion of the principal amount of any Loan into, a LIBO
Rate Loan, but excluding the loss of any anticipated or expected profits in
respect of such LIBO Rate Loan) as a result of

               (a) any conversion or repayment or prepayment of the principal
        amount of any LIBO Rate Loans on a date other than the scheduled last
        day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to
        Section 3.1 or otherwise;

               (b)  any Loans not being made as LIBO Rate Loans in
        accordance with the Borrowing Request therefor; or

               (c) any Loans not being continued as, or converted into, LIBO
        Rate Loans in accordance with the Continuation/ Conversion Notice
        therefor,

then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the Borrower and the Agent, the
Borrower shall, within five Business Days of its receipt thereof, pay directly
to such Lender such amount as will (in the reasonable determination of such
Lender) reimburse such Lender for such loss or expense. Such written notice
(which shall include calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

        Section 5.5. Increased Capital Costs, etc. If the implementation of or,
after the date hereof, the introduction or any change in the interpretation of,
or any change in its application to the Borrower, the Fronting Bank and/or the
Lenders of, any law or any regulation or guideline issued by any central bank or
other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), including
any eurocurrency or other reserve or special deposit requirement or any tax
(other than tax which is on a Lender's general net or gross income or in respect
of a Lender's franchise taxes) or any capital requirement, has, due to a
Lender's or the Fronting Bank's compliance, the effect, directly or indirectly,
of (i) increasing the cost to such Lender or Fronting Bank of performing its
obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit or Loan; (ii) reducing any
amount received or receivable by such Lender or Fronting Bank or its effective

                                      -36-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

return hereunder or in respect of any Letter of Credit or Loan or on its
capital; or (iii) causing such Lender or Fronting Bank to make any payment or to
forgo any return based on any amount received or receivable by such Lender or
Fronting Bank hereunder or in respect of any Letter of Credit or Loan, then upon
demand from time to time the Borrower shall pay such amount as shall compensate
such Lender or Fronting Bank for any such cost, reduction, payment or foregone
return upon receipt of the certificate referred to in the last sentence of this
paragraph. The Borrower shall further indemnify the Fronting Bank for all costs,
losses and expenses incurred by the Fronting Bank in connection with any Letter
of Credit and agrees that the Fronting Bank shall have no liability to the
Borrower for any reason in respect of any Letter of Credit other than on account
of the Fronting Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct. Any certificate of
the Fronting Bank or any Lender in respect of the foregoing will be conclusive
and binding upon the Borrower, except for manifest error, and shall set forth a
determination of the amounts owing to the Fronting Bank or such Lender in good
faith using any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Anything in this
Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender or
Fronting Bank shall be indemnified for, exculpated from, or relieved from
liability, under this Agreement or any Loan Document, for any act or omission
constituting gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

        Section 5.6. Taxes. (a) Each payment made by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction for, any
present or future withholding or other taxes imposed on such payments by or on
behalf of any government or any political subdivision or agency thereof or
therein, except for any income, franchise and other taxes imposed on the Lender
(which for purposes of this Section 5.6 shall include any branch, affiliate or
international banking facility created by a Lender to make or maintain a LIBO
Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.5) by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
such Lender is organized or any political subdivision or agency thereof or by
the jurisdiction of such Lender's branch or lending office or principal place of
business (all such non-excluded taxes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").
Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Borrower with respect to any payments
hereunder, the Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Agent for the account of
the applicable Lender official receipts (to the extent that the relevant
governmental authority delivers such receipts) evidencing payment of any such
Taxes so withheld or deducted.

        (b) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall submit
to the Borrower on or before the Effective Date (or, in the case of a Person
that becomes a Lender after the Effective Date by assignment or pursuant to
Section 2.5 promptly upon such assignment or funding) two duly

                                      -37-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

completed and signed copies of either (1) Form 1001 of the United States
Internal Revenue Service entitling such Lender to a complete exemption from
withholding on all amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant to this
Agreement or (2) Form 4224 of the United States Internal Revenue Service
relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant to this
Agreement. Each such Lender shall, from time to time after submitting either
such form, submit to the Borrower and the Agent such additional duly completed
and signed copies of one or the other such forms (or such successor forms or
other documents as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United
States taxing authorities) as may be (1) reasonably requested in writing by the
Borrower or the Agent and (2) appropriate under then current United States law
or regulations to avoid United States withholding taxes on payments in respect
of any amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement. Upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent, each Lender that has not
provided the forms or other documents, as provided above, on the basis of being
a "United States person" shall submit to the Borrower and the Agent a
certificate to the effect that it is such a "United States person".

        (c) If any Lender which is not a "United States person" determines that
it is unable to submit to the Borrower and the Agent any form or certificate
that such Lender is requested to submit pursuant to the preceding paragraph, or
that it is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate, or that
any such form or certificate previously submitted has otherwise become
ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Agent of such fact.

        (d) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount in
respect of Taxes to any Lender if and only to the extent that (A) such Lender is
subject to such Taxes on the Effective Date (or in the case of a Person that
became a Lender after the Effective Date by assignment or pursuant to Section
2.5 on the date of such assignment or funding) or would be subject to such Taxes
on such date if a payment under this Agreement has been received by it on such
date; (B) such Lender becomes subject to such Taxes subsequent to the date
referred to in clause (A) above (or in the case of a Lender which is not a
"United States person", the first date on which it delivers the appropriate form
or certificate to the Borrower as referred to in clause (b) of this Section) as
a result of a change in the circumstances of such Lender (other than a change in
applicable law), including without limitation a change in the residence, place
of incorporation or principal place of business of the Lender, a change in the
branch or lending office of the Lender participating in the transactions set
forth herein or as a result of the sale by the Lender of participating interests
in such Lender's creditor position(s) hereunder; or (C) such Taxes would not
have been incurred but for the failure of such Lender to file

                                      -38-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

with the appropriate tax authorities and/or provide to the Borrower any form or
certificate that it was required so to do pursuant to clause (b) of this
Section, unless the Lender is not entitled to provide such form or certificate
as a result of a change in applicable law after the Effective Date (or in the
case of a Person that became a Lender after the Effective Date by assignment or
pursuant to Section 2.5 the date of such assignment or funding).

        (e) Within thirty (30) days after the written reasonable request of the
Borrower, each Lender shall execute and deliver to the Borrower such
certificates, forms or other documents which can be furnished consistent with
the facts and which are reasonably necessary to assist the Borrower in applying
for refunds of Taxes paid by the Borrower hereunder or making payment of Taxes
hereunder; provided, however, that no Lender shall be required to furnish to the
Borrower any financial information with respect to itself or other information
which it considers confidential.

        (f) The Borrower shall have the right to require any Lender which is not
a "United States person" to which the Borrower is required to make additional
payments pursuant to Section 5.6 hereof on account of Taxes (or would, upon
payment to such Lender of an amount hereunder, be so required) to assign such
Lender's total Loans and Commitments to one or more banks or financial
institutions identified by the Borrower and acceptable to the Agent at a
purchase price equal to the then outstanding amount of all principal, interest,
fees and other amounts then owed to such Lender.

        Section 5.7. Payments, Computations, etc. Unless otherwise expressly
provided herein (including as set forth in Section 2.3 and Section 4.5), all
payments by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document shall be made by the Borrower to the Agent for the account of the
Lenders entitled to receive such payment. All such payments required to be made
to the Agent shall be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date due, in same day or immediately
available funds, to such account as the Agent shall specify from time to time by
notice to the Borrower. To the extent the Agent receives such funds prior to
12:00 noon, New York time, the Agent shall promptly remit in same day funds to
each Lender its share, if any, of such payments received by the Agent for the
account of such Lender. All interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring during the period for which such interest or fee is payable over a
year comprised of 360 days. Whenever any payment to be made shall otherwise be
due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall (except as
otherwise required by clause (b) of the definition of the term "Interest
Period") be

                                      -39-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with such
payment.

        Section 5.8. Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall obtain any payment
or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or
otherwise) on account of any Letter of Credit or Loan in excess of its
Percentage of payments then or therewith obtained by all Lenders, such Lender
shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in Letters of Credit
or Loans, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other
recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall
be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable
extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such selling Lender's
ratable share (according to the proportion of

               (a)  the amount of such selling Lender's required
        repayment to the purchasing Lender

to

               (b)  the total amount so recovered from the purchasing
        Lender)

of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in
respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including pursuant to Section 5.9) with respect to such participation as fully
as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this
Section applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its
rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights
of the Lenders entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any
recovery on such secured claim.

        Section 5.9. Setoff. Each Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any event
or condition described in clause (e) of Section 6.01 of the U.S. Credit
Agreement or, with the consent of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence of
any other Event of Default, have the right to appropriate and apply to the
payment of the Obligations owing to it (whether or not then due) any and all
balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the

                                      -40-

Borrower then or thereafter maintained with or otherwise held by such Lender;
provided, however, that any such appropriation and application shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 5.8. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
Borrower and the Agent after any such setoff and application made by such
Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under
this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff under applicable law or otherwise) which such Lender may have.

        Section 5.10.  Use of Proceeds.  The Borrower shall apply
the proceeds of each Credit Extension in accordance with the
sixth recital.

        In order to induce the Lenders and the Agent to enter into this
Agreement and to make Loans and issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each of the
Borrower and Group represents and warrants unto the Agent and each Lender as set
forth in this Article VII.

        Section 7.1. Organization, etc. Group and each of its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or limited liability company, as the case may be, validly organized
and existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or foreign entity, as applicable, in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in the U.S. Credit Agreement), and each Obligor has full power and
authority and holds all requisite governmental licenses, permits

                                      -44-

Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document to which it is a party and to
own and hold under lease its property and to conduct its business substantially

delivery and performance (i) by the Borrower and Group of this Agreement, the

action, and do not

               (a)  contravene such Obligor's Organic Documents;

               (b)  contravene any contractual restriction, law or
        governmental regulation or court decree or order binding on
        or affecting such Obligor; or

               (c)  result in, or require the creation or imposition
        of, any Lien on any of such Obligor's properties.

        Section 7.3. Government Approval, Regulation, etc. No authorization or
approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
authority or regulatory body or other Person is required for the due execution,
delivery or performance by the Borrower, Group or any other Obligor of this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document to which it is a party. Neither
Group nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a "holding company", or a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding
company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", within the meaning
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

        Section 7.4. Validity, etc. This Agreement constitutes, and the Notes
and each other Loan Document executed by the Borrower and each other Obligor
will, on the due execution and delivery thereof, constitute, the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Borrower or such Obligor enforceable in

be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general equity
principles.

        Section 7.5. No Material Adverse Change. Since January 7, 1995, there
has been no material adverse change in the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), operations, performance,

                                      -45-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

properties or prospects of (i) the Borrower or (ii) Group and its Subsidiaries,
taken a whole.

        Section 7.6. Litigation, Labor Controversies, etc. There is no pending
or, to the knowledge of either the Borrower or Group, threatened litigation,
action, proceeding, or labor controversy affecting the Borrower or Group and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any of their respective properties,
businesses, assets or revenues, which could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations,
performance, properties or prospects of the Borrower or Group and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which purports to affect the legality,
validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document.

        Section 7.7. Regulations G, U and X. The Borrower is not engaged in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin
stock, and no proceeds of any Loans will be used for a purpose which violates,
or would be inconsistent with, F.R.S. Board Regulation G, U or X. Terms for
which meanings are provided in F.R.S. Board Regulation G, U or X or any
regulations substituted therefor, as from time to time in effect, are used in
this Section with such meanings.

        Section 7.8. Accuracy of Information. All factual information heretofore
or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or Group in
writing to the Agent or any Lender for purposes of or in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby is, and all other such factual
information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Agent or
any Lender will be, true and accurate in every material respect on the date as
of which such information is dated or certified and as of the date of execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Agent and such Lender, and such
information is not, or shall not be, as the case may be, incomplete by omitting
to state any material fact necessary to make such information not misleading.
The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this Section shall
constitute a representation or warranty by the Borrower or Group as to the
future financial performance or the results of operations of either the Borrower
or Group; provided, however, that any projections delivered pursuant to this
Agreement have been (and will be) prepared on the basis of the assumptions
accompanying them, and such projections and assumptions, as of the date of
preparation thereof and as of the date hereof, are reasonable and represent the
Borrower's or Group's good faith estimate of its future financial performance.

        Section 7.9. U.S. Credit Agreement Representations and Warranties. As to
all representations and warranties contained in Article IV of the U.S. Credit
Agreement and each Loan Document

                                    Article X

                                    THE AGENT

        Section 10.1. Actions. Each Lender hereby appoints Scotiabank as its
Agent under and for purposes of this Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan
Document. Each Lender authorizes the Agent to act on behalf of such Lender under
this Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document and, in the absence of
other written instructions from the Required Lenders received from time to time
by the Agent (with respect to which the Agent agrees that it will comply, except
as otherwise provided in this Section or as otherwise advised by counsel), to
exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to
or required of the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender hereby indemnifies
(which indemnity shall survive any termination of this Agreement) the Agent, pro
rata according to such Lender's Percentage, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses of any kind
or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against, the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Notes and any other Loan Document, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, and as to which the Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrower;
provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
which are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final proceeding
to have resulted solely from the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
The Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder, under the Notes or
under any other Loan Document, or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of
this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, unless it is indemnified
hereunder to its satisfaction. If any indemnity in favor of the Agent shall be
or become, in the Agent's determination, inadequate, the Agent may call for
additional indemnification from the Lenders and cease to do the acts indemnified
against hereunder until such additional indemnity is given.

        Section 10.2. Copies, etc. The Agent shall give prompt notice to each
Lender of each notice or request required or permitted to be given to the Agent
by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (unless concurrently
delivered to the Lenders by the Borrower). The Agent will distribute to each
Lender each document or instrument received for its account and copies of all
other communications received by the Agent from the Borrower for distribution to
the Lenders by the Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

        Section 10.3. Exculpation. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, employees or agents shall be liable to

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in connection herewith or therewith,
except for its own wilful misconduct or gross negligence, nor responsible for
any recitals or warranties herein or therein, nor for the effectiveness,
enforceability, validity or due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, nor for the creation, perfection or priority of any Liens (if any)
purported to be created by any of the Loan Documents, or the validity,
genuineness, enforceability, existence, value or sufficiency of collateral
security (if any), nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance by the
Borrower of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Any such
inquiry which may be made by the Agent shall not obligate it to make any further
inquiry or to take any action. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice
of counsel concerning legal matters and upon any notice, consent, certificate,
statement or writing which the Agent believes to be genuine and to have been
presented by a proper Person.

        Section 10.4. Successor. The Agent may resign as such at any time upon
at least 30 days' prior notice to the Borrower and all Lenders. If the Agent at
any time shall resign, the Required Lenders may appoint another Lender as a
successor Agent which shall thereupon become the Agent hereunder. If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall
have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving
notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Agent, which shall be one of the Lenders or a commercial
banking institution organized under the laws of the U.S. (or any State thereof)
or a U.S. branch or agency of a commercial banking institution, and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall be entitled to receive from the retiring Agent such documents of transfer
and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably request, and shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as the Agent, the provisions of

               (a) this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
        taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Agent under this
        Agreement; and

               (b)  Section 11.3 and Section 11.4 shall continue to
        inure to its benefit.

        Section 10.5. Loans or Letters of Credit Issued by Scotiabank.
Scotiabank shall have the same rights and powers with respect to (x) the Loans
made by it or any of its

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

affiliates, (y) the Notes held by it or any of its affiliates, and (z) its
participating interests in the Letters of Credit as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as if it were not the Agent. Scotiabank and its affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if
Scotiabank were not the Agent hereunder.

        Section 10.6. Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently of the Agent and each other Lender, and based on such Lender's
review of the financial information of the Borrower, this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents (the terms and provisions of which being satisfactory to such
Lender) and such other documents, information and investigations as such Lender
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend its Commitment.
Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently of the Agent and each
other Lender, and based on such other documents, information and investigations
as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit
decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and
privileges available to it under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.


                                   Article XI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        Section 11.1. Waivers, Amendments, etc. The provisions of this Agreement
and of each other Loan Document may from time to time be amended, modified or
waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and consented to
by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such
amendment, modification or waiver which would:

               (a) modify any requirement hereunder that any particular action
        be taken by all the Lenders or by the Required Lenders shall be
        effective unless consented to by each Lender;

               (b) modify this Section 11.1, change the definition of "Required
        Lenders", increase any Commitment Amount or (except as otherwise
        contemplated by this Agreement) the Percentage of any Lender, reduce any
        fees described in Article III, release any guarantor under the
        Subsidiary Guaranty or the Group Guaranty, or extend any Commitment
        Termination Date shall be made without the consent of each Lender and
        each holder of a Note;

               (c) extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of, any
        scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or interest on or fees
        payable in respect of any Loan (or

                                      -52-

        respect of any Loan) shall be made without the consent of the holder of
        that Note evidencing such Loan;

               (d) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of the
        Fronting Bank in its capacity as the Fronting Bank shall be made without
        the consent of the Fronting Bank; or

               (e) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of the
        Agent in its capacity as the Agent shall be made without consent of the
        Agent.

No failure or delay on the part of the Agent, any Lender or the holder of any
Note in exercising any power or right under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or demand on
the Borrower in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances. No waiver or approval by the Agent, any Lender or the
holder of any Note under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, except
as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to
subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall require any
similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted hereunder.

        Section 11.2. Notices. All notices and other communications provided to
any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in
writing or by facsimile and addressed, delivered or transmitted to such party at
its address, or facsimile number set forth below its signature hereto or set
forth in the Lender Assignment Agreement or at such other address or facsimile
number as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties. Any
notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid or if properly
addressed and sent by pre-paid courier service, shall be deemed given when
received; any notice, if transmitted by facsimile, shall be deemed given when
transmitted.

        Section 11.3. Payment of Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay
on demand all reasonable expenses of the Agent (including the reasonable fees
and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel to the Agent and of local counsel, if any,
who may be retained by counsel to the Agent) in connection with

               (a) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
        Agreement and of each other Loan Document, including schedules and
        exhibits, and any amendments, waivers, consents, supplements or other
        modifications to this Agreement or any other Loan Document as may from
        time

                                      -53-

        to time hereafter be required, whether or not the transactions
        contemplated hereby are consummated, and

               (b)  the preparation and review of the form of any
        document or instrument relevant to this Agreement or any
        other Loan Document.

The Borrower covenants to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the
Agent, the Fronting Bank and the Lenders incurred in the enforcement of the
Agent's, the Fronting Bank's or any Lender's rights under this Agreement and any
Loan Document (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Agent, the Fronting Bank and each Lender with respect thereto) and, further,
covenants that it will indemnify the Agent, the Fronting Bank and the Lenders on
demand against all loss or damage to such Persons arising out of the issuance of
or other action taken by such Persons in connection with any Letter of Credit or
Loan including, without limitation, the costs relating to any legal process
instituted by any party restraining or seeking to restrain the Fronting Bank
from accepting or paying any Letter of Credit or Draft. The Borrower also agrees
that neither the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any Lender shall have any liability
to it for any reason in respect of the issuance of any Letter of Credit or Loan
other than on account of such Agent's, Fronting Bank's or Lender's gross
negligence or wilful misconduct. All payments to be made to the Agent, the
Fronting Bank and the Lenders hereunder shall, subject to Section 5.6, be made
for value on the date due and free of any withholding tax or levy, other than
taxes imposed on the net income of the Agent, the Fronting Bank or a Lender, and
the Borrower covenants that such taxes or levies, other than as excepted, shall
be paid by the Borrower. The provisions of this paragraph will survive payment
in full hereunder.

        Section 11.4. Indemnification. In consideration of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each Lender and the extension of the Commitments,
the Borrower hereby indemnifies, exonerates and holds the Agent, the Fronting
Bank and each Lender and each of their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") free and harmless from and
against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, losses, costs, liabilities
and damages, and expenses incurred in connection therewith (irrespective of
whether any such Indemnified Party is a party to the action for which
indemnification hereunder is sought), including the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel for the Agent, the Fronting Bank and each Lender with respect thereto
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), incurred by the Indemnified
Parties or any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to

                                      -54-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>


               (a)  any transaction financed or to be financed in
        whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds
        of any Loan or the use of any Letter of Credit; or

               (b) the entering into and performance of this Agreement and any
        other Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties (including any
        action brought by or on behalf of the Borrower as the result of any
        determination by the Required Lenders pursuant to Article VI not to make
        any Credit Extension);

except for any such Indemnified Liabilities arising for the account of a
particular Indemnified Party by reason of the relevant Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or wilful misconduct.

        Section 11.5. Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections
5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 11.3 and 11.4, and the obligations of the Lenders under
Section 10.1, shall in each case survive any termination of this Agreement, the
payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of all Commitments. The
representations and warranties made by the Borrower in this Agreement and in
each other Loan Document shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and each such other Loan Document.

        Section 11.6. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
to such provision and such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Agreement or such Loan Document or affecting the validity or enforceability
of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

        Section 11.7. Headings. The various headings of this Agreement and of
each other Loan Document are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or
any provisions hereof or thereof.

        Section 11.8. Execution in Counterparts, Effectiveness, etc. This
Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in several counterparts, each of
which shall be executed by the Borrower and the Agent and be deemed to be an
original and all of which shall constitute together but one and the same
agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts hereof
executed on behalf of the Borrower and each Lender (or notice thereof
satisfactory to the Agent) shall have been received by the Agent and notice
thereof shall have been given by the Agent to the Borrower and each Lender.

        Section 11.9. Governing Law; Entire Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES
AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL EACH BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER
AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. This Agreement, the
Notes and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior
agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto.

        Section 11.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, that:

               (a)  the Borrower may not assign or transfer its
        rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
        of the Agent and all Lenders; and

               (b)  the rights of sale, assignment and transfer of
        the Lenders are subject to Section 11.11.

      Section 11.11. Sale and Transfer of Loans and Notes; Participations in
Loans and Notes. Each Lender may assign, or sell participations in, its Loans
and Commitments to one or more other Persons in accordance with this Section
11.11.

      Section 11.11.1.  Assignments.  Any Lender,

               (a) with the written consent of the Borrower (which consent shall
        not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) and the Agent may at any time
        assign and delegate to one or more commercial banks or other financial
        institutions; and

               (b)  with the consent of the Fronting Bank, and notice
        to the Borrower and the Agent, but without the consent of
        the Borrower or the Agent, may assign and delegate to any
        other Lender or any Lender under the U.S. Credit Agreement

(each Person described in either of the foregoing clauses as being the Person to
whom such assignment and delegation is to be made, being hereinafter referred to
as an "Assignee Lender"), all or a fraction of such Lender's total Loans and
Commitments; provided, that (i) after giving effect to such assignment or
transfer, such Lender and its Assignee Lender shall each hold not less than
$10,000,000 of Loans and/or Commitments and (ii) each Lender must assign an
equal amount of its Loan Commitment and Letter of Credit Commitment to such
Assignee Lender; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be required to
pay an amount under Section 5.6 that is greater than the amount which it would
have been required to pay had no assignment been made and provided, further,
however, that, the Borrower and the Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal
solely and directly with

                                      -56-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned and delegated to an
Assignee Lender until

               (c) written notice of such assignment and delegation, together
        with payment instructions, addresses and related information with
        respect to such Assignee Lender, shall have been given to the Borrower
        and the Agent by such Lender and such Assignee Lender,

               (d) such Assignee Lender shall have executed and delivered to the
        Borrower and the Agent a Lender Assignment Agreement, accepted by the
        Agent, and

               (e)  the processing fees described below shall have
        been paid.

From and after the date that the Agent accepts such Lender Assignment Agreement,
(x) the Assignee Lender thereunder shall be deemed automatically to have become
a party hereto and to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
assigned and delegated to such Assignee Lender in connection with such Lender
Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (y) the assignor Lender, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and
delegated by it in connection with such Lender Assignment Agreement, shall be
released from its obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
Within five Business Days after its receipt of notice that the Agent has
received an executed Lender Assignment Agreement with respect to the assignment
of Loans, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Agent (for delivery to
the relevant Assignee Lender) new Notes evidencing such Assignee Lender's
assigned Loans and Commitments and, if the assignor Lender has Loans and
Commitments hereunder, replacement Notes in the principal amount of the Loans
and Commitments retained by the assignor Lender hereunder (such Notes to be in
exchange for, but not in payment of, those Notes then held by such assignor
Lender). Each such Note shall be dated the date of the predecessor Notes. The
assignor Lender shall mark the predecessor Notes "exchanged" and deliver them to
the Borrower. Accrued interest on that part of the predecessor Notes evidenced
by the new Notes, and accrued fees, shall be paid as provided in the Lender
Assignment Agreement. Accrued interest on that part of the predecessor Notes
evidenced by the replacement Notes shall be paid to the assignor Lender. Accrued
interest and accrued fees shall be paid at the same time or times provided in
the predecessor Notes and in this Agreement. Such assignor Lender or such
Assignee Lender must also pay a processing fee to the Agent upon delivery of any
Lender Assignment Agreement in the amount of $2,500. Any attempted assignment
and delegation not made in accordance with this Section 11.11.1 shall be null
and void. Nothing in this Section shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from

                                      -57-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

pledging its rights (but not its obligations to make Loans and to issue or
participate in Letters of Credit) under this Agreement and/or its Loans and/or
Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowing made by such
Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank.

      Section 11.11.2. Participations. Any Lender may at any time sell to one or
more commercial banks or other Persons (each of such commercial banks and other
Persons being herein called a "Participant") participating interests (or a
sub-participating interest, in the case of a Lender's participating interest in
a Letter of Credit) in any of the Loans, Commitments, or other interests of such
Lender hereunder; provided, however, that

               (a) no participation or sub-participation contemplated in this
        Section 11.11 shall relieve such Lender from its Commitments or its
        other obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document,

               (b)  such Lender shall remain solely responsible for
        the performance of its Commitments and such other
        obligations,

               (c) the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
        directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
        obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents,

               (d) no Participant, unless such Participant is an affiliate of
        such Lender, or is itself a Lender, shall be entitled to require such
        Lender to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or under any
        other Loan Document, except that such Lender may agree with any
        Participant that such Lender will not, without such Participant's
        consent, take any actions of the type described in clause (b) or (c) of
        Section 11.1, and

               (e) the Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount under
        Section 5.6 that is greater than the amount which it would have been
        required to pay had no participating interest been sold.

      Section 11.11.3. Fronting Bank Assignments. In the event that S&P, Moody's
or Thompson's BankWatch (or InsuranceWatch Ratings Service, in the case of
Lenders that are insurance companies (or Best's Insurance Reports, if such
insurance company is not rated by InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)) shall, after
the date that any Lender becomes a Lender, downgrade the long-term certificate
of deposit ratings of such Lender, and the resulting ratings shall be below
BBB-, Baa3 and B (or BB, in the case of Lender that is an insurance company (or
B, in the case of an insurance company not rated by InsuranceWatch Ratings
Service)),

                                      -58-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

then the Fronting Bank or the Borrower shall have the right, but not the
obligation, upon notice to such Lender, to replace (or, in the case of a request
by the Fronting Bank, to request the Borrower to use its reasonable efforts to
replace) such Lender with an Assignee Lender (in accordance with and subject to
the restrictions contained in Section 11.11.1), and such affected Lender hereby
agrees to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 11.11.1) all of its interests, rights
and obligations in respect of its Commitment, Loans and other Obligations owing
to it, together with the obligations of such affected Lender hereunder, to such
Assignee Lender; provided, however, that (i) no such assignment shall conflict
with any law, rule and regulation or order of any governmental authority and
(ii) such Assignee Lender shall pay to such affected Lender in immediately
available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and interest
accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by such Lender hereunder and
all other amounts accrued for such Lender's account or owed to it hereunder.

        Section 11.12. Other Transactions. Nothing contained herein shall
preclude the Agent or any other Lender from engaging in any transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its affiliates in which the Borrower or such
affiliate is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

        Section 11.13. Forum Selection and Consent to Jurisdiction. ANY
LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF
DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF THE AGENT, THE
LENDERS OR THE BORROWER SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES
TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LITIGATION.
THE BORROWER FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS BY
REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, OR BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE
STATE OF NEW YORK. THE BORROWER HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE OR HEREAFTER
MAY HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT
REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE
ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER
THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF
EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO

                                      -59-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN
RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

        Section 11.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR
ACTIONS OF THE AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE FRONTING BANK OR THE BORROWER. THE
PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED FULL AND SUFFICIENT
CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROVISION (AND EACH OTHER PROVISION OF EACH OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY) AND THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS
PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENT, THE FRONTING BANK AND THE
LENDERS ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

        Section 11.15. UCP; etc. (a) The Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits as most recently published by the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "UCP") shall in all respects apply to each Letter of Credit issued
hereunder and shall be deemed for such purpose to be a part hereof as if fully
incorporated herein. In the event of any conflict between the UCP and the
governing law of the Agreement, the UCP shall prevail to the extent necessary to
remove the conflict.

        (b) In the event of any issuance of a further Letter of Credit for which
the Borrower may apply from time to time hereafter, or, of any extension of the
maturity or time for presentation of any Draft, or, of any renewal, extension or
increase in the amount of a Letter of Credit or any other modifications of its
terms, in each case with the consent or at the request of the Borrower, the
terms of the Agreement shall continue in force and apply to the further Letter
of Credit so issued, or, to a Letter of Credit so renewed, extended, increased
or otherwise modified, or, to any, Draft, document or property covered thereby
and to any action taken by the Fronting Bank or its agents or correspondents in
accordance with such issuance, renewal, extension, increase or other
modification.

        Section 11.16. Usury Restraint. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be subject to any applicable law, regulation, order, rule or direction (a "Usury
Restraint") which prohibits or restricts the charging, receipt or retention of
interest or other amounts at the rates and amounts set forth herein (the "Stated
Rate") in excess (the "Excess") of the maximum rates or amount (the "Maximum
Rate") stipulated in the Usury Restraint. The provisions of this Agreement shall
not require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the
Maximum Rate from time to time. If the Lenders comply (whether or not

                                      -60-


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

required to do so at law) with such Usury Restraint then, to the extent
permitted by law, a subsequent reduction in the Stated Rate below the Maximum
Rate shall be deemed not to reduce the Stated Rate below the Maximum Rate until
the total amount of interest and other amounts earned and retained, measured by
a dollar amount, equals the amount of interest and other amounts which would
have been earned and retained hereunder, inclusive of the Excess, measured by a
dollar amount, if the Stated Rate had not been held at the Maximum Rate or any
amount had not been refunded to the Borrower.
