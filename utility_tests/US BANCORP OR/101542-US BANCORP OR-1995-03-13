ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                    GENERAL

    U.  S. Bancorp is a regional  multi-bank holding company incorporated in the
state of Oregon in 1968 and  headquartered in Portland, Oregon. At December  31,
1994,  U. S. Bancorp had consolidated  assets of $21.8 billion and shareholders'
equity of  $1.8 billion.  U.S. Bancorp  is  among the  35 largest  bank  holding
companies in the United States in terms of total assets.

    The  principal  subsidiaries of  U. S.  Bancorp at  December 31,  1994, were
United  States  National  Bank  of  Oregon  ("U.  S.  Bank  of  Oregon"),   also
headquartered  in  Portland,  Oregon, and  U.  S. Bank  of  Washington, National
Association ("U. S. Bank of Washington"), headquartered in Seattle,  Washington.
U.  S. Bank  of Oregon and  U. S.  Bank of Washington  are engaged  in a general
retail and commercial banking business. In terms of deposits, at June 30,  1994,
U.  S.  Bank of  Oregon was  the largest  bank  in Oregon  and the  52nd largest
commercial bank  in  the  United States.  Also  at  that date,  U.  S.  Bank  of
Washington  was, in terms of deposits, the  third largest commercial bank in the
state of Washington and the 99th largest commercial bank in the United States.

    Other subsidiaries of U.  S. Bancorp provide  financial services related  to
banking,  including mortgage  banking, lease financing,  consumer and commercial
finance  including  credit  cards,   discount  brokerage,  investment   advisory
services,  and insurance agency and credit life insurance services. In addition,
in 1994, the investment  advisor subsidiary of U.  S. Bank of Oregon,  Qualivest
Capital  Management, Inc., commenced  advising a new group  of mutual funds, the
Qualivest Funds. U. S. Bancorp's principal activities are located in the Pacific
Northwest, but  it has  operations throughout  the  Far West  and, to  a  lesser
extent,  the rest  of the  United States.  U. S.  Bancorp also  actively reviews
proposals for  various  acquisition opportunities  with  which it  is  regularly
presented.

    In  1994,  U.  S.  Bancorp  commenced a  major  cost  reduction  and revenue
enhancement program to  improve productivity  and to achieve  an overhead  ratio
(noninterest  expenses as a percentage of tax-equivalent net interest income and
noninterest revenue)  of 59  percent within  three  years of  the start  of  the
program. In connection with this program, U. S. Bancorp is consolidating certain
operations  and facilities for efficiency and  has divested or closed facilities
or activities that  no longer fit  U. S. Bancorp's  corporate objectives or  the
needs of regional customers.

    U.  S. Bancorp's ongoing program  has resulted in the  sale of a significant
portion of the assets of U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Company in the third quarter  of
1994,  including  $3.6 billion  of the  $4.3  billion residential  mortgage loan
servicing portfolio and 50 loan origination offices in various states. Since the
sale, mortgage banking services are being  provided through the branches of  the
bank  subsidiaries  and a  loan by  phone program.  Additionally, U.  S. Bancorp
closed Agent Financial Services Corporation, a loan securitization business.  In
early  January 1995, U. S. Bancorp sold its credit reporting subsidiary, CREDCO,
Inc., and is currently  winding down operations  of its import/export  financing
subsidiary, U. S. World Trade Corporation, and U. S. Bank (Canada).

    Additionally,  the  program  included  staff  reductions  of  the  number of
full-time  equivalent  employees   through  attrition,   a  special   retirement
opportunity   for  certain   employees,  other   severance  programs,   and  the
consolidation  of  certain  operations  and  facilities.  An  eighteen   percent
reduction  in full-time equivalent  employees was accomplished  during 1994 as a
result of these actions.

    U. S.  Bancorp's  program to  increase  efficiency and  reduce  overhead  is
continuing  into 1995. In January 1995,  U. S. Bancorp announced that operations
and objectives for U. S. Bank of Idaho, National Association would be  refocused
on  retail and small  business banking, resulting  in centralization and further
staff reductions. Further, U. S. Bank  of Oregon recently announced that it  has
signed  a letter  of intent to  outsource U.  S. Bank of  Oregon's merchant bank
services, resulting in  enhanced service  capabilities along  with further  cost
containment.  Other  consolidations  involving Heart  Federal  Savings  and Loan
Association and U. S. Bank of Southwest Washington are described below in "Other
Banking Subsidiaries."

                               COMMERCIAL BANKING

U. S. Bank of Oregon and U. S. Bank of Washington

    U. S.  Bank of  Oregon and  U. S.  Bank of  Washington provide  full-service
commercial  and  consumer  banking  and  a  wide  range  of  trust  services  to

range of other personal and  business service industries. The services  provided

cash  management services, including computerized balance and deposit reporting.
U. S. Bank  of Oregon and  U. S.  Bank of Washington  also purchase  installment
obligations from retailers with or without recourse. Additionally, U. S. Bank of
Oregon  and  U.  S. Bank  of  Washington maintain  financial  relationships with
numerous companies  based  outside the  Pacific  Northwest, providing  lines  of
credit and other financial services.

    CONSUMER  ACTIVITIES.   U. S. Bank  of Oregon  and U. S.  Bank of Washington
provide  financial  services  to  individual  customers  throughout  Oregon  and
Washington  as  well as,  to a  more  limited extent,  in certain  other western
states. These  services  include accepting  checking,  savings, and  other  time
deposits,  and the making of  loans. The loan services offered  by U. S. Bank of
Oregon and U. S. Bank of  Washington include real property loans (including  for
home  improvements), extensions of credit for purchases of automobiles and other
consumer goods and services, and individual lines of credit, both unsecured  and
secured.  In  addition,  U. S.  Bank  of Oregon  and  U. S.  Bank  of Washington
customers may have access  to U. S. Bancorp's  automated teller machine  ("ATM")
system  ("U-BANK-Registered  Trademark-"), which  is  the tenth  largest  in the
United States,  with  1,200 ATMs  located  throughout U.  S.  Bancorp's  banking
region.   U.   S.  Bancorp   banks   have  issued   approximately   1.1  million
U-BANK-Registered Trademark- cards, including 600,000 debit cards for  customers
with  checking accounts.  A major purchase  revolving line of  credit secured by
real estate is also available from either bank.

    INTERNATIONAL BANKING  ACTIVITIES.    U. S.  Bank  of  Oregon  international
operations  include  import-export  transaction  financing,  letters  of credit,
collections, remittance services, and foreign exchange services.

    U. S.  Bank  of  Oregon's  International  Banking  Division  finances  trade
transactions,  primarily  through  Oregon  ports,  and  maintains  correspondent
accounts with 52  banks in 23  foreign countries. Fifty-three  (53) banks in  21
foreign  countries maintain  accounts with  the International  Banking Division.
These  correspondent  relationships   facilitate  loans,   letters  of   credit,
acceptances,  collections and exchange  services abroad. U.  S. Bank of Oregon's
Investment Division engages in  money market loans to  United States offices  of
foreign banks, with terms not normally exceeding 90 days.

    At  December 31, 1994, foreign loans outstanding  with respect to U. S. Bank
of  Oregon  totaled  approximately  $20.3  million.  In  addition,  there   were
outstanding  banker's acceptances in Mexico totaling $30.1 million, representing
in part a  participation in  a syndicated  accommodation to  PEMEX, the  Mexican
national oil company, which matures in May 1996.

<PAGE>
    U.  S.  Bank  of  Washington  provides  international  services  through its
International Banking Division primarily for the benefit of existing  customers.
Such  services include  import-export transaction financing,  letters of credit,
collections, and remittance services. Foreign exchange services also are offered
through U. S. Bank of Washington.

    U. S.  Bank of  Washington  does not  have direct  overseas  representation,
either  through  representatives or  foreign  branch offices.  However, numerous
correspondent and agency arrangements are  maintained with banks throughout  the
world  with  special emphasis  on  banks located  in  Pacific Rim  countries. At
December 31, 1994, U.  S. Bank of  Washington maintained correspondent  accounts
with  28 banks in 17  foreign countries, while 21  banks in 10 foreign countries
maintained accounts  with  the  International Banking  Division.  Foreign  loans
outstanding at December 31, 1994, totaled approximately $29.5 million.

    TRUST ACTIVITIES.  U. S. Bank of Oregon and U. S. Bank of Washington offer a
wide  range of  fiduciary services for  individuals and  corporations. Each bank
acts as executor  under wills, as  trustee under trusts  and pension and  profit
sharing  plans, as  conservator for  estates of  minors and  incompetents and as
investment adviser to individuals, businesses  and others. Trust assets  managed
at  December 31, 1994, by U. S. Bank of Oregon totaled over $2.98 billion and by
U. S. Bank of Washington totaled approximately $2.18 billion.

    COMPETITION.  U. S. Bank of Oregon and U. S. Bank of Washington compete  for
deposits,  loans, trust accounts, and in providing other financial services with
independent, locally  controlled banks,  branches of  foreign banks,  and  banks
which  are  subsidiaries of  bank holding  companies  based outside  the Pacific
Northwest. U.  S. Bank  of Oregon  and U.  S. Bank  of Washington  also  compete
actively with savings and loan associations, savings banks, credit unions, small
local  and  national  personal  loan  companies,  local  and  national insurance
companies, local and national finance  companies and other institutions such  as
brokerage houses and financial units of out-of-state bank holding companies. All
of  these entities are actively engaged in  marketing various types of loans and
other financial services. Quality  of service to  customers, price of  products,
range of products and services and ease of accessibility to facilities are among
the  principal  methods  of meeting  competition  in the  banking  and financial
service industries. U. S. Bancorp emphasizes responsive service of high  quality
and value throughout the organization.

Other Banking Subsidiaries

    U.   S.  Bancorp's   other  banking  subsidiaries   (including  its  savings

subsidiaries was not material  to U. S. Bancorp's  operations as a whole  during
1994.  The largest of  the banking subsidiaries  listed above in  terms of total
assets and deposits are U. S. Bank of California and U. S. Bank of Nevada.

of  $.8 billion, and total loans of $.4  billion. The bank was the third largest
full-service commercial bank in Nevada at December 31, 1994.

    In February 1995, U. S. Bancorp received regulatory approval to merge  Heart
Federal  Savings and  Loan Association  into U. S.  Bank of  California, and the
merger was consummated  in late February  1995. In addition,  U. S. Bancorp  has
recently  received approval from Canadian  banking regulators to proceed towards
closure of U. S. Bank (Canada).

    U. S. Bancorp has recently received state and federal regulatory approval to
merge U. S.  Bank of  Southwest Washington  with and  into First  State Bank  of
Oregon. The merger is anticipated to be completed by March 31, 1995.

                              NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES

    U.  S.  Bancorp's  nonbank subsidiaries,  including  subsidiaries  of banks,
totaled 38 companies  at December 31,  1994. These subsidiaries  operate in  the
fields  of  commercial  and  consumer  lending,  insurance  services,  equipment
leasing, investment  advisory services  and  discount brokerage,  among  others.
Among U. S. Bancorp's nonbank subsidiaries are the following:

                                   EMPLOYEES

    As   of  December  31,  1994,  U.   S.  Bancorp  and  its  subsidiaries  had
approximately 10,610 full-time equivalent employees.

    A number  of  benefit  programs  are provided  to  all  eligible  employees,
including  officers,  of  U.  S. Bancorp  and  its  majority-owned subsidiaries,
including: retirement and 401(k) plans, medical, dental and long-term disability
plans, life insurance,  accidental death and  dismemberment insurance, a  travel
accident plan, paid vacations and a sick leave program.

                               MONETARY POLICIES

    The  growth of U.  S. Bancorp and  its subsidiaries is  affected by both the
prevailing economic environment and the fiscal and monetary policies of branches
and agencies of  the U. S.  Government. The  Board of Governors  of the  Federal
Reserve  System  (the  "Federal Reserve  Board")  directly  influences corporate
performance through  management of  such  factors as  the reserves  required  of
financial institutions, the growth and contraction of the nation's money supply,
and  interest  rates paid  by banks  in  their borrowings  from and  through the
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board carries additional  regulatory
authority  over member banks and holding  company activities. These powers allow
federal authorities substantial  control of  financial activity  in general  and
also  of  the operations  of financial  institutions.  Monetary policies  of the
Federal Reserve Board have had and will continue to have a significant effect on
the operating results of financial institutions.

                           SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

    U. S. BANCORP.   U. S.  Bancorp, as a  bank holding company,  is subject  to
regulation  under the Bank Holding Company Act  of 1956, as amended (the "Act"),
and is registered with the Federal Reserve  Board. U. S. Bancorp is required  by
the  Act to file reports of its operations with the Federal Reserve Board and is
subject to inspection by  the Federal Reserve Board.  The Federal Reserve  Board
has  authority to  issue cease and  desist orders against  holding companies and
their nonbank subsidiaries  where the  action of  either of  them constitutes  a
serious threat to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank and to
pursue  criminal  penalties  for  willful  violations  and  civil  penalties for
violations under the Act.

    The Act and the Federal Reserve Board's regulations pursuant thereto require
every bank holding company to obtain  the prior approval of the Federal  Reserve
Board  before merging with  any bank holding  company or acquiring substantially
all the assets of any bank, or  direct or indirect ownership or control of  more

                                       4
<PAGE>
than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank or bank holding company. The Act
provides  that the  Federal Reserve Board  shall not approve  any acquisition or
merger which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any
attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United  States,
or  any  other  proposed acquisition  or  merger,  the effect  of  which  may be
substantially to  lessen competition  or to  tend to  create a  monopoly in  any
section  of the country  or which in any  other manner would  be in restraint of
trade, unless  the  anti-competitive effects  of  the proposed  transaction  are
clearly  outweighed  in  the  public  interest by  the  probable  effect  of the
transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be  served.
In  reviewing applications, the Federal Reserve Board analyzes the financial and
managerial resources and future  prospects of the  companies and banks  involved
and the convenience and needs of the community to be served.

    The Act also prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from
engaging  in or acquiring direct  or indirect control of  more than 5 percent of
the voting shares of any company  engaged in nonbanking activities. The  Federal
Reserve  Board is  authorized to approve,  among other things,  the ownership of
shares by a  bank holding company  in any  company the activities  of which  the
Federal  Reserve Board  has determined  to be so  closely related  to banking or
managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making such
determination, the  Federal Reserve  Board  is required  to weigh  the  expected
benefits  to the public,  such as greater  convenience, increased competition or
gains in efficiency,  against the  risks of  possible adverse  effects, such  as
undue  concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of
interest, or unsound banking practices.

    With a limited exception for acquisitions of financially troubled banks, the
Act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding company of substantially all the
assets or more than 5 percent of the voting shares of a bank located outside the
state in  which the  operations  of its  banking subsidiaries  were  principally
conducted  at  the  time  it  became a  bank  holding  company,  unless  such an
acquisition is specifically authorized  by a statute of  the state in which  the
bank  to be acquired is located.  Numerous states, including California, Oregon,
and Washington, have enacted legislation that authorizes bank holding  companies
located in all or designated states to acquire banks in the enacting states.

    In  1994, Congress enacted the  Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act of 1994 (the  "Interstate Banking Act"), which allows  adequately
capitalized  and managed  bank holding  companies to  acquire and  operate banks
across state lines beginning  in 1997. Pursuant to  the Interstate Banking  Act,
commencing  in  September  1995,  bank holding  companies  which  meet specified
capital and management adequacy standards will  be eligible to acquire banks  in
other than their home states, but will need to retain a separate bank charter in
each  state where subsidiaries conduct banking business. Various restrictions on
interstate acquisitions will continue to apply, including (1) federal and  state
antitrust  laws, as  currently in effect;  (2) prohibitions on  a single holding
company system  accounting for  more than  10% of  all deposits  nationwide  or,
subject  to various  opt-in and  opt-out provisions  for individual  states on a
nondiscriminatory basis, accounting for  30% or more of  deposits in any  state;
(3)  state-imposed prohibitions on acquiring banks within up to five years after
they commence operations; and (4) compliance by the acquirer with the  Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the "CRA") and fair lending laws.

    Commencing  on June 1, 1997, banks will be permitted to cross state lines to
merge with  other  banks, subject  to  individual states'  adoption  of  various
nondiscriminatory opt-in and opt-out provisions. Antitrust and anticoncentration
restrictions  will apply as  described above. It  will not be  necessary to keep
multiple state  charters  in  effect  or  to  have  a  holding  company  system.
Generally,  all  banks that  are  parties to  a  proposed post-1997  merger must
satisfy applicable CRA, management quality and capital adequacy standards.

    U. S. Bancorp's  management is  considering the  alternatives available  for
operation  of  its  banking  subsidiaries  under  the  Interstate  Banking  Act.
Theoretically,  if  none  of  the  states  in  which  U.  S.  Bancorp's  banking
subsidiaries  are located opt out, U. S. Bancorp's domestic banking subsidiaries
could all be organized and operated as a single banking institution.

    U. S. Bancorp, its banking subsidiaries, and its nonbanking subsidiaries are
affiliates of U. S. Bank of Oregon, U. S. Bank of Washington and U. S. Bancorp's
other national banking subsidiaries  within the meaning  of the Federal  Reserve
Act.  The Federal Reserve Act,  the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act, and the Home
Owners' Loan Act impose certain restrictions on loans by U. S. Bancorp's banking
subsidiaries to U. S. Bancorp

                                       5
<PAGE>
or certain nonbank affiliates, on purchases of certain assets by U. S. Bancorp's
banking subsidiaries  from  U. S.  Bancorp  or certain  nonbank  affiliates,  on
investments by U. S. Bancorp's banking subsidiaries in their stock or securities
and  on U. S. Bancorp's banking subsidiaries taking such stock and securities as
collateral for loans. U. S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries, as affiliates of U. S.
Bancorp's  national   banking  subsidiaries,   are  also   subject  to   certain
restrictions  with respect  to engaging  in the  issue, flotation, underwriting,
public sale  and distribution  of  securities. Under  Section  106 of  the  1970
amendments  to the Act and the regulations  of the Federal Reserve Board, a bank
holding company and  its subsidiaries  are prohibited from  engaging in  certain
tie-in  arrangements in connection with any  extension of credit or provision of
any property or service.

    BANKING SUBSIDIARIES.    There  are various  requirements  and  restrictions
affecting  U. S. Bank  of Oregon, U. S.  Bank of Washington  and U. S. Bancorp's
other banking  subsidiaries,  including  the requirement  to  maintain  reserves
against   deposits,  restrictions  on  the  nature  and  amount  of  loans,  and
restrictions relating  to investments,  branching and  other activities  of  the
banks.  U. S. Bancorp's national banking  subsidiaries are subject to regulation
by the  Office of  the  Comptroller of  the  Currency (the  "Comptroller"),  the
Federal  Reserve  Board  and  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation (the
"FDIC"), and are examined by the  Comptroller, which is the primary  supervisory
authority for national banks.

    Each  of U. S. Bancorp's national banking subsidiaries can initiate dividend
payments in a  given year,  without the prior  approval of  the Comptroller,  in
amounts  equal to net profits (as defined  by regulation) for that year combined
with its retained  net profits for  the preceding two  calendar years, less  any
required  transfers to  surplus or  a fund for  the retirement  of any preferred
stock. In addition, a national bank may not pay a dividend in an amount  greater
than  its net profits then on hand  after deducting statutory bad debt in excess
of the bank's  allowance for  loan losses.  The payment  of dividends  by U.  S.
Bancorp's national bank subsidiaries may also be affected by other factors, such
as  requirements for the  maintenance of adequate  capital. In addition, federal
bank regulatory  agencies  have  issued policy  statements  which  provide  that
national  banks, banks that are members of  the Federal Reserve System, and bank
holding companies should generally pay  dividends only out of current  operating
earnings.

    Other  banking subsidiaries of U. S. Bancorp may be subject to regulation by
the appropriate state regulatory agency, the Federal Reserve Board, or the FDIC.
Until its  closure,  U.  S.  Bank  (Canada) is  subject  to  regulation  by  the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada.

    The  federal banking laws contain  a "cross-guarantee" provision which could
result in U. S. Bancorp or one  of the insured depository institutions which  it
owns  being  assessed  for  losses  incurred  by  the  FDIC  in  connection with
assistance provided  to, or  the failure  of, any  other depository  institution
owned by U. S. Bancorp.

    The  FDIC  Improvement Act  of 1991  authorized  the imposition  of stricter
capital requirements on banks. If a  bank is undercapitalized, the bank will  be
required to develop and submit a plan for the restoration of its capital. If the
bank's efforts to restore capital are inadequate, the parent holding company, if
any,  may be required  to contribute additional  capital to the  bank, up to the
lesser of  the  full  amount needed  to  bring  the bank's  capital  level  into
compliance  or 5%  of the holding  company's total assets.  Each federal banking
agency is  also required  to  promulgate regulations  and specify  standards  in
numerous  areas of bank  operations, addressing such  issues as internal control
and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate  risk,
asset  growth, executive officer  and director compensation,  asset quality, and
other operational and managerial  standards. These regulatory requirements  have
increased  and may continue to  increase the cost of,  and the regulatory burden
associated with, the banking business.

    U. S. Bancorp's bank subsidiaries pay assessments on their domestic deposits
to the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund. In addition, two of U. S. Bancorp's financial
institutions pay assessments on some or  all of their deposits at rates  imposed
for members of the Savings Association Insurance Fund.

    Under  FDIC  regulations,  the  assessment rate  for  an  insured depository
institution varies according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. An
institution's risk  category  is based  upon  whether the  institution  is  well
capitalized,  adequately capitalized  or less than  adequately capitalized. Each
insured depository  institution  is  also  assigned  to  one  of  the  following
"supervisory   subgroups":   Subgroup   A,   B  or   C.   Subgroup   A  includes

                                       6
<PAGE>
financially  sound   institutions  with   few  minor   weaknesses;  Subgroup   B
institutions  demonstrate weaknesses  which, if  not corrected,  could result in
significant deterioration; and Subgroup C includes institutions for which  there
is a substantial probability that the FDIC will suffer a loss in connection with
the  institution  unless  effective action  is  taken  to correct  the  areas of
weakness.  Based  on  its  capital  and  supervisory  subgroups,  each   insured
institution is assigned an annual FDIC assessment rate varying between 0.23% per
annum   (for  well   capitalized  Subgroup   A  institutions)   and  0.31%  (for
undercapitalized Subgroup C institutions). In February 1995, the FDIC  published
proposed  rules  which  would,  if adopted,  cause  a  significant  reduction in
assessment rates for members of the Bank Insurance Fund.

    U. S. Bancorp and its banking subsidiaries are subject to the CRA, which  is
aimed  particularly  at  encouraging  financial  institutions  to  give  special
attention to the needs of  low and moderate income  areas in meeting the  credit
needs  of the communities in which they operate. If the regulatory evaluation of
a banking  subsidiary's CRA  activities is  less than  satisfactory,  regulatory
approval  of  the bank's  or a  related  entity's proposed  acquisitions, branch
openings, expansion  of activities  related to  banking, or  other  applications
requiring  Federal Reserve  Board approval may  be delayed until  the bank's CRA
performance is deemed satisfactory by the appropriate bank regulatory agency. U.
S. Bancorp's  banking  subsidiaries  that  are subject  to  the  CRA  each  have
regulatory evaluations of satisfactory or better. U. S. Bank of Oregon and U. S.
Bank of Washington each received regulatory evaluations of outstanding in 1994.

    Activities  of U. S. Bancorp and its banking subsidiaries in other countries
are also subject to restrictions imposed by the laws and banking authorities  of
such countries and the Federal Reserve Board.

    The  foregoing references to  applicable statutes and  regulations are brief
summaries thereof which do not purport to be complete and which are qualified in
their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations.

    The information included under the  heading "Capital and Dividends" on  page
32 of this report is incorporated herein by reference.

    OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.  Non-bank subsidiaries of U. S. Bancorp in the states of
Oregon,  Washington, California, Idaho,  and Nevada and  other jurisdictions are
subject to  the  supervision and  inspection  of various  federal  and/or  state
regulatory agencies.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    The  headquarters of U.  S. Bancorp and U.  S. Bank of  Oregon is located in
downtown Portland, Oregon, in  the U. S. Bancorp  Tower, which was completed  in

including  the approximately 244,000  square feet utilized by  U. S. Bancorp and
its subsidiaries.

    U. S. Bancorp or U. S. Bank  of Oregon own six additional buildings  located
in  the Portland metropolitan area, including U. S. Bancorp's operations center,
nine  miles  east   of  downtown   Portland.  The   operations  facility,   with
approximately  360,000 square feet of space,  houses U. S. Bancorp's information

227,200-square-foot office  building in  Seattle, Washington,  which housed  its
headquarters  for a portion of 1994; negotiations  for the sale of this facility
are under  way.  During  1994,  U.  S.  Bank  of  Washington  relocated  to  new
headquarters  in  the U.  S. Bank  Centre, a  facility  in which  U. S.  Bank of
Washington and its affiliates lease approximately 179,300 square feet.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

    The  following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying notes  appearing  elsewhere in  this  report. When
necessary, reclassifications have been made to prior years' data throughout  the
following  discussion and analysis  for purposes of  comparability with the 1994
presentation. Each of the items referred  to in this performance review is  more
fully  described in the following discussion or in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements presented on pages 44 through 69 of this report.

Performance Overview

    In the  first quarter  of  1994, U.  S.  Bancorp announced  a  restructuring
program to aggressively improve the productivity and profitability of all of its
businesses.  This announcement reflected the  company's refocus on businesses in
its core  market area  of Oregon,  Washington, northern  California, Nevada  and
Idaho,  and on selected  other businesses that meet  its objective of sustaining
consistent, high-return financial performance. One important financial objective
of U. S. Bancorp's restructuring program was to improve productivity to  achieve
an  overhead ratio (noninterest  expenses as a  percentage of tax-equivalent net
interest income and noninterest  revenues) of 59 percent  within three years  of
the start of the program.

    For the year 1994, net income was $151.5 million, or $1.40 per common share,
compared  with $257.9  million, or  $2.47 per common  share, for  the year 1993.
However, there were a number of items that affected net income in 1994 and 1993.
A $100  million  pretax  charge was  recorded  in  the first  quarter  of  1994,
reflecting  the cost  of implementing  the restructuring  program. In  the third
quarter, U. S. Bancorp  sold a substantial portion  of its residential  mortgage
operations,  resulting  in  a  pretax  gain  of  $50.8  million.  Certain  asset
write-downs deemed necessary by management were also taken in the third  quarter
and  the ratio  of the  allowance to  loans outstanding  was increased  at third
quarter end to 1.95 percent from 1.91 percent at December 31, 1993. The  results
for  1993  included $74  million in  pretax income  from equity  investments and
certain mortgage banking activities.

    Quarterly earnings increased  during 1994 as  a result of  the many  actions
initiated  in the first quarter and a  strong economic environment in most of U.
S. Bancorp's  markets. These  initiatives included  implementing cost  reduction
plans  and divesting or closing less  profitable businesses. Highlights for 1994
included:

    - Noninterest expenses declined substantially from an annualized run-rate of
      $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter of 1993, to an annualized run-rate  of
      $904 million in the fourth quarter of 1994.

    - Overhead  ratio improved to  63.3 percent in the  fourth quarter from 67.1
      percent in  the third  quarter of  1994,  and 74.6  percent in  the  first
      quarter  (excluding the restructure  charge); the overhead  ratio was 65.8
      percent in  1993 and  75.5 percent  in 1994  (including the  restructuring
      charge).

    - Average loans grew 11 percent in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis
      over the third quarter of 1994, and 10 percent as compared with the fourth
      quarter a year ago.

    - Credit  quality  improved as  reflected  by the  decline  in nonperforming
      assets to  total  loans  and  foreclosed property  from  1.77  percent  at
      year-end 1993 to 1.31 percent at year-end 1994. Annualized net charge-offs
      were  .51 percent in  the fourth quarter  of 1994 and  .48 percent for the
      year, compared with .60 percent for the year 1993.

    To  facilitate  a  better  understanding  of  U.  S.  Bancorp's  results  of
operations,  management believes  an analysis that  separates noncore businesses
and nonrecurring activities from ongoing activities provides for a more accurate
assessment of overall  trends and operations.  Accordingly, operating income  as
used  below and throughout this report is defined as income before the provision
for credit losses, other real estate owned (OREO) write-downs, equity investment
income and loss, gains  and losses on sales  of mortgage loan servicing  rights,
net  of accelerated  intangibles amortization,  gain on  sale of  operations and
loans, gains and losses on sales of securities, the restructuring charge,  asset
write-downs and items determined by management to be nonrecurring.

    Due  to this  format of  presentation, not  all individual  line items agree
directly to the financial statements.

    Operating  income increased four percent in 1994 as compared with 1993. On a
quarterly basis,  operating  income rose  steadily  during the  year.  Operating
income  increased from  $87.1 million  in the  first quarter  of 1994  to $129.7
million in the fourth quarter, a 49 percent increase.

    - Net interest income in  1994 increased 3.3 percent  over 1993, mainly  the
      result  of  growth in  commercial and  consumer loans.  Average commercial
      loans in 1994 increased 10 percent  over 1993, and average consumer  loans
      increased  13 percent. The increase in the  margin to 5.35 percent in 1994
      from 5.29 percent  in 1993  was primarily attributable  to higher  overall
      asset yields and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.

    - Excluding revenues associated with activities affected by divestitures and
      other  revenue items as specified in the noninterest revenue table on page
      17, noninterest  revenues increased  five percent.  Strong  year-over-year
      growth  was  achieved in  service charges,  up  13 percent,  and insurance
      revenues, up 49 percent. Total noninterest revenues declined in 1994  from
      1993,  mainly  due  to  declines  in  revenues  associated  with  divested
      businesses. A  significant portion  of U.  S. Bancorp's  mortgage  banking
      subsidiary's  loan origination  offices and  loan servicing  portfolio was
      sold in  the third  quarter of  1994. As  a result  of this  sale, and  an
      overall  decline  in  mortgage  loan  origination  volumes  due  to rising
      interest rates, mortgage banking  income was down $27  million in 1994  as
      compared  with  1993.  Credit  reporting  revenues  from  U.  S. Bancorp's
      subsidiary Credco, Inc. were $21 million lower in 1994 due to lower demand
      for credit reports. In December  1994, U.S. Bancorp announced the  signing
      of  a definitive agreement to sell Credco, Inc. The sale closed in January
      1995.

    - Noninterest expenses in  1994, excluding the  restructuring charge,  asset
      write-downs  and  items  determined  by  management  to  be  nonrecurring,
      decreased two percent  from 1993  levels reflecting the  benefit of  major
      cost  initiatives  implemented  at U.  S.  Bancorp during  1994.  The most
      significant cost  reductions were  achieved in  employee compensation  and
      benefits   due  to  a  combination  of  attrition,  a  special  retirement
      opportunity and divestiture or closure of several business activities. The
      number of full-time equivalent employees  decreased 18 percent during  the
      year as a result of these actions.

Net Interest Income (tax-equivalent basis)

    Net  interest  income, the  principal source  of  U. S.  Bancorp's operating
income, includes interest income and fees generated by interest-earning  assets,
primarily   loans   and  investment   securities,   less  interest   expense  on
interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits, purchased funds and  long-term
debt. Net interest income is affected by the volume, interest rates and relative
mix   of  both  earning  assets  and  interest-bearing  and  noninterest-bearing
liabilities.

    Net interest income was $995.1 million  in 1994, up $32.1 million, or  three
percent,  from the prior  year. This followed  an increase of  $66.4 million, or
seven percent, in 1993 compared with 1992.  In 1994, the growth in net  interest
income resulted primarily from the increase in earning assets and an increase in
the net interest margin.

    Average  earning assets in  1994 totaled $18.6 billion,  an increase of $416
million, or two percent, from the prior year. This followed an increase of  $896
million,  or five percent, in 1993 from 1992. The increase in 1994 reflected the
growth in average loans, which rose  $1.1 billion, or eight percent, over  1993.
Average  commercial loans  increased $618  million, or  10 percent,  and average
consumer loans increased $392 million, or 13 percent, over the prior year. These
increases in average loans  were partially offset by  a $388 million decline  in
average  loans held for sale  and a $205 million  decrease in average investment
securities. The  decline in  loans  held for  sale  was due  to  the sale  of  a
substantial  portion of  the mortgage loan  origination offices  of the mortgage
subsidiary in  August 1994  and the  decision by  management to  transfer  $96.4
million  of consumer loans held for sale  during 1993 into the loan portfolio in
mid-1994.

    Average interest-bearing  liabilities  in  1994 totaled  $15.0  billion,  an
increase  of  $121  million,  or  one  percent,  from  the  prior  year. Average
interest-bearing deposits declined $347  million, or three  percent, in 1994  as
increases in savings, interest-checking and money market accounts were offset by
a  $583 million decrease in time deposits less than $100,000. Average short-term
borrowings,  including   federal  funds   purchased  and   security   repurchase
agreements, increased $600 million in 1994 over the prior year.

    The  net interest  margin on interest-earning  assets, which  is the average
yield on interest-earning assets less the  average rate paid for all sources  of
funding,  including the impact of interest-free  funds, was 5.35 percent in 1994
compared with 5.29  and 5.18  percent in 1993  and 1992,  respectively. The  six
basis  point increase in the net interest margin in 1994 over 1993 was primarily
due to  an improvement  in the  earning asset  yield, mainly  related to  higher
yields   earned  on  variable  rate  commercial   loans.  The  average  cost  of
interest-bearing  liabilities  increased  five  basis  points  as  the  cost  of
short-term   borrowings  increased  in  1994.  The   increase  in  the  cost  of
interest-bearing liabilities was offset by the impact of a higher proportion  of
interest-earning  assets supported  by noninterest-bearing  sources of  funds in
1994.

Rate-Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income

    The following table sets forth, on a tax-equivalent basis, a summary of  the
changes  in net  interest income  resulting from  changes in  volumes and rates.
Since changes in interest  income and expense  are calculated independently  for
each  line in the table, the  totals in the volume and  rate columns are not the
sum of the individual lines.  Changes not due solely  to volume or rate  changes
are allocated to rate.

    Service  charges on deposit accounts increased  13 percent to $152.0 million
in 1994  from  $134.7 million  in  1993.  Selective repricing  of  consumer  and
corporate  payment and cash  management products contributed  to the increase in
these revenues in 1994 over 1993.

    Bank card revenue totaled $61.2 million in 1994, compared with $59.1 million
in 1993. The increase is  attributable to the growth  in the affinity bank  card
portfolio partially offset by a higher level of annual fee waivers.

    Trust  and investment administration revenues were $51.1 million in 1994 and
$48.7 million in 1993. The increase of  $2.4 million in 1994 over 1993  reflects
the  increase in revenue  received from the management  of employee benefit plan
assets, which increased from $10.7 million to $12.9 million.

    Exchange fees, which consist primarily of fees from letters of credit, check
orders and foreign  money exchanges,  totaled $31.5  million in  1994 and  $28.1
million in 1993.

    Insurance  revenue increased  49 percent in  1994 compared with  1993 due to
continued success in marketing annuity  products. ATM revenue was $18.9  million
in  1994 and $16.1 million in 1993 and continued to reflect the expansion of ATM
transactions available to customers  and adjustment of  the pricing schedule  to
accommodate the new features.

    In  August 1994, U.  S. Bancorp sold  most of the  residential mortgage loan
servicing portfolio and  50 loan  origination offices  of its  subsidiary U.  S.
Bancorp   Mortgage   Company.   Mortgage   banking  income   in   1994   is  not

                                       17
<PAGE>
comparable to prior years due to the impact of this sale. In addition,  mortgage
banking revenues were also lower in 1994 as compared with 1993 and 1992 due to a
lower  volume of loan originations  industry-wide as a result  of an increase in
interest rates. Credit reporting revenues in 1994 were similarly affected by the
decline in mortgage loan originations and  refinancings. U. S. Bancorp sold  its
credit reporting subsidiary, Credco, Inc., in January 1995.

    Included  in revenues  in 1994  was the  $50.8 million  gain related  to the
aforementioned sale of  mortgage subsidiary assets.  Gains on sale  of loans  in
1994  totaled $11.2 million and relate to sales of a portion of an affinity bank
card portfolio and student loans. In 1993,  gains on sale of loans totaled  $4.5
million and gain on sale of operations was $4.8 million, primarily the result of
the  sale of U. S. Bancorp's  corporate trust business. Equity investment income
(loss) consisted primarily of market value adjustments of U. S. Bancorp's equity
investments in public  companies and,  on a  smaller scale,  in venture  capital
investments  in  non-public  companies.  In  1993,  a  portion  of  the mortgage
subsidiary's mortgage servicing rights  portfolio was sold for  a gain of  $54.8
million,  and also led to recognition of $8.9 million of hedge income related to
the portfolios  sold. In  addition,  during 1993,  U.  S. Bancorp  adjusted  the
recorded  value of its purchased mortgage  servicing rights and excess servicing
fees  receivable  in  light  of  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  mortgage  loan
prepayments.  The carrying value  of these assets was  reduced by $23.5 million.
Losses incurred in 1994 on sale of investment securities relate to the sale of a
portion of the securities  available for sale portfolio,  the proceeds of  which
were  reinvested to increase the portfolio  yield in future periods. Included in
other nonrecurring revenue items in 1994 were losses of $3.9 million incurred by
U. S. Bancorp's  import/export finance  subsidiary and $8.3  million of  trading
account   losses  related  to  the   sale  of  certain  collateralized  mortgage
obligations.

Noninterest Expense

    Noninterest expenses, excluding  the restructure charge  and other  expenses
identified  in the table below, decreased  $16.6 million, or 2 percent, compared
with 1993.  Total noninterest  expenses  were $1.1  billion compared  with  $983
million in 1993 and $869 million in 1992.

    In  first quarter  1994, a  $100 million  restructuring charge  was recorded
related to a comprehensive program designed to allow U. S. Bancorp to become  an
even more efficient, competitive and customer-focused financial institution. The
program  included  staff  reductions accomplished  through  an  early retirement
opportunity for  certain  employees,  other severance  programs  and  attrition,
divestiture  of  noncore activities,  and the  consolidation and  integration of
certain operations and facilities that no  longer fit U. S. Bancorp's  corporate
objectives or the needs of its regional customers. The program is anticipated to
be completed by the end of the first quarter of 1995.

    The $100 million charge represented the incremental costs as a result of the
restructuring  plan. Included in the restructuring  charge were $52.4 million of
costs associated  with enhanced  retirement and  other benefit  programs,  $22.6
million  of severance benefits, $9.5 million of  expenses related to the cost to
exit certain  business activities,  $7.3 million  related to  consolidation  and
integration  of facilities,  and $8.2 million  of other  cost reduction expenses
related to the program.

    The restructuring  charge  consists of  $96.4  million in  anticipated  cash
expenditures  and $3.6  million of non-cash  charges, mainly  the write-downs of
facilities. A  significant  portion of  the  cash outlays  associated  with  the
program  relate to enhanced retirement programs, which  will be funded over a 10
to 15  year  period  as  contributions  are  made  to  the  benefit  plans.  The
restructure program is not expected to have a material impact on U. S. Bancorp's
liquidity.

    The  most significant portion  of future expense  reductions will consist of
savings of employee compensation and benefits  due to a reduction in  employees.
By the third quarter of 1994, U. S. Bancorp had achieved a ten percent reduction
in  full-time equivalent (FTE)  employees, excluding the  reduction in employees
associated with the mortgage  loan origination offices  sold. By year-end  1994,
FTE  employees decreased to 10,610,  or 18 percent, from  12,863 at December 31,
1993. Of the 2,253 decrease in FTE employees, 555 were the result of  activities
sold and the balance was directly related to the restructuring program.

    As  of December 31, 1994, $18.9 million of the restructuring charge remained
in other liabilities which represented $10.9 million related to staff reductions
that were  initiated in  1994, $3.1  million related  to the  consolidation  and
integration  of facilities  in process, and  $4.9 million related  to other cost
reduction actions during 1994. At December  31, 1994, $48.8 million of  employee
benefit  plan liabilities related to the  enhanced retirement programs were also
included in other liabilities.

    As a result of the restructuring  program, a substantial reduction in U.  S.
Bancorp's  operating expenses was achieved.  Fourth quarter noninterest expenses
annualized were $904 million, a 12 percent reduction from the annualized  fourth
quarter 1993 noninterest expenses of $1.03 billion.

    Significant  improvement  in  the  overhead  ratio  (defined  as noninterest
expenses as a percentage of  tax-equivalent net interest income and  noninterest
revenues) was achieved by the fourth quarter of 1994 when the ratio reached 63.3
percent, down from 67.1 percent in the third quarter of 1994 and 74.5 percent in
the  first quarter  of 1994 (excluding  the restructuring  charge). The overhead
ratio for the year 1994 was  75.5 percent (including the restructuring  charge),
compared with 65.8 percent and 64.8 percent for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Employee  compensation  decreased $23.4  million in  1994, or  five percent,
compared with 1993, and in the  fourth quarter of 1994 decreased $18.1  million,
or 17 percent, compared with compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 1993.
These  reductions reflect  the decrease  in FTE  employees that  occurred during
1994. Employee benefits expense  decreased $2 million, or  two percent, in  1994
compared with 1993.

    Net  occupancy expense increased principally as the result of rent increases
associated with the occupancy of  a new headquarters building  by U. S. Bank  of
Washington   in  Seattle,   Washington.  Equipment   rentals,  depreciation  and
maintenance, excluding the impact of  the computer software write-off  discussed
below,  increased eight percent in 1994  compared with 1993. The increase mainly
represents the incremental costs associated with upgrading systems and equipment
to improve productivity.

                                       19
<PAGE>
    Regulatory agency fees declined in 1994 as the result of improvement in  the
FDIC risk classification of one of U.S. Bancorp's principal banking subsidiaries
for  assessment purposes.  Telecommunications expense  increased six  percent in
1994 as compared with 1993,  and reflected the rapid  growth in U. S.  Bancorp's
24-hour  telephone service centers which  provide automated and personal service
around the clock to U. S. Bancorp customers. Reductions in several other expense
categories have been achieved through actions taken to implement the restructure
program as previously discussed.

    Included  in  asset  write-downs  in  1994  was  the  write-off  of  certain
capitalized  expenses as U.  S. Bancorp changed  its policy with  respect to the
capitalization of internal costs related to the development and installation  of
computer  software.  These unamortized  costs related  to several  projects were
written off as a charge to expenses totaling $12.1 million in the third  quarter
of  1994.  Write-downs  of  intangibles resulting  from  revaluation  of certain
acquired business  intangibles  in 1994  totaled  $3.3 million.  Deferred  costs
totaling  $3.0 million related to agent-originated  consumer loans held for sale
were written off upon the transfer of  these loans to the loan portfolio.  Other
nonrecurring  items were anticipated  expenses related to  system conversions --
$6.2 million; interest accrued  on pending settlements  with tax authorities  --
$3.0  million; and other items totaling  $1.4 million. Asset write-downs in 1993
included a  $3.0  million  write-down  of  bank  premises  and  a  $2.8  million
write-down  of affinity  credit card intangibles  due to a  change in underlying
assumptions  regarding  the  solicitation  period  for  potential   cardholders.
Nonrecurring  items in 1993 included reversal of excess postretirement and other
liabilities of $8 million.  Nonrecurring items in 1992  included a $2.7  million
environmental  liability accrual (a  portion of which was  reversed in 1993) and
$6.7 million of long-term debt redemption expense.

Income Taxes

    U. S. Bancorp's effective income tax rate was 29.9 percent in 1994, compared
with 32.9 percent in 1993 and 30.8 percent in 1992. The decline in the effective
tax rate in  1994 from 1993  was caused  primarily by the  higher proportion  of
tax-exempt  income in 1994 due  to the decline in  taxable income related to the
restructuring charge. Also, in 1994, U.  S. Bancorp recorded a higher amount  of
tax  credits associated with  low income housing  investments. The effective tax
rate in 1993 increased from  1992 primarily due to  the increase in the  federal
income  tax rate from  34 percent to 35  percent, and a decrease  in 1993 in the
relative proportion of tax-exempt income as compared with 1992.

                              FINANCIAL CONDITION

Securities Portfolios

    The securities  portfolios are  managed  to maximize  yield over  an  entire
interest  rate cycle  while minimizing  market exposure  to changes  in interest
rates. In  the third  quarter of  1994,  U. S.  Bancorp sold  a portion  of  its
available  for  sale  U.  S. Treasury  securities  and  reinvested  the proceeds
primarily in collateralized  mortgage obligations  to improve the  yield of  the
securities portfolios. At December 31, 1994, the yield on the available for sale
securities  portfolio was 5.43  percent, compared with  6.13 percent at year-end
1993. The decline  in the  portfolio yield  in 1994  is the  result of  maturing
securities  reinvested  at lower  rates. Securities  available for  sale totaled
$1.37 billion at December 31, 1994, and $1.68 billion at December 31, 1993.

    Securities held  to maturity  totaled $1.40  billion at  December 31,  1994,
compared with $1.74 billion at year-end 1993. Maturities of U. S. Treasuries and
government agencies accounted for the decline. The yield on the held to maturity
portfolio  was 6.26 percent at December 31,  1994, compared with 6.36 percent at
year-end 1993.

    At December 31, 1994,  the securities portfolios  included $1.37 billion  of
mortgage-backed  securities  and collateralized  mortgage  obligations, compared
with $1.43 billion at December 31,  1993. Substantially all of these  securities
were  issued  by  Federal  agencies or  backed  by  Federal  agency pass-through
securities.

Loan Portfolio

    There  was strong loan growth in 1994.  Average loans grew 11 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1994 on  an annualized basis over  the third quarter, and  ten
percent  from  the fourth  quarter of  1993.  For the  full year,  average loans
increased eight percent over the prior year. Loan growth was particularly strong
in commercial and consumer loans, and was geographically broad-based  throughout
the  year. Commercial loans increased to $7.4 billion at December 31, 1994, from
$6.8 billion at December  31, 1993, a nine  percent increase. Consumer loans  at
year-end  1994 were  $3.7 billion.  Excluding the increase  in loans  due to the
transfer of  consumer loans  held for  sale  into the  loan portfolio  in  1994,
consumer loans increased 14 percent over year-end 1993.

    It is U. S. Bancorp's objective to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse
in  terms of type  of loan, industry  concentration, geographic distribution and
borrower concentration in order to reduce the overall credit risk by  minimizing
the  adverse impact of  any single event  or set of  occurrences. The Commercial
Loan Distribution table below shows the commercial loan portfolio stratified  by
significant  Standard Industrial Code  classifications. It should  be noted that
within the  indicated classification,  there  are other  subclassifications  for
which U. S. Bancorp's reporting system monitors industry concentrations.

    Commercial  loans were  primarily local  middle-market credits  and loans to
small businesses. U. S. Bancorp's two largest banks -- U. S. Bank of Oregon  and
U.  S. Bank  of Washington  -- are  leaders in  small business  lending in their
respective states.

    Real estate  mortgage loans  increased  $335.3 million  to $2.9  billion  at
year-end  1994 compared with  1993, primarily due to  an increase in one-to-four
family residential real  estate mortgage loans.  In an effort  to increase  home
ownership opportunities for low- to moderate-income and first-time buyers, U. S.
Bancorp expanded its successful HomePartner loan program in the first quarter of
1994.  The HomePartner product line provides more flexible credit guidelines and
flexible down  payment  options  for  first-time  and  low-  to  moderate-income
borrowers.  For  the  year 1994,  in  excess  of 1,300  loans  were  closed with
principal balances amounting to $111.5 million.

    The majority of U. S. Bancorp's  real estate mortgage loans outstanding  are
collateralized  by  properties located  in  the Pacific  Northwest  and Northern
California. U. S. Bancorp  closely monitors the composition  of its real  estate
portfolio   through  prudent  underwriting  criteria   and  by  monitoring  loan
concentrations by geographic region and property  type. An analysis of the  real

Asset/Liability Management

    KEY  OBJECTIVE.  A key objective  of asset/liability management is to manage
interest rate risk  due to asset  and liability cash  flows and market  interest
rate  movements. The asset/liability management committee (ALCO) is comprised of
key executives and provides oversight to the asset/liability management  process
and  recommends policy guidelines  for board of  director approval. Adherence to
these policies is  monitored continuously, and  decisions regarding exposure  to
changes  in interest rates are made when appropriate and agreed to by the asset/
liability management committee.

    SIMULATION MODEL.  An asset/liability management simulation model is used to
quantify the exposure  and impact of  changing interest r  ates on earnings.  In
general,  the  simulation model  is a  dynamic tool  which uses  forecasting and
option adjusted cash flow analysis in  order to model portfolios and the  entire
balance  sheet. Specifically,  the simulation  model: (i)  captures all  on- and
off-balance sheet  financial instruments;  (ii)  anticipates balance  sheet  mix
changes  and trends; (iii)  utilizes both a standardized  rate scenario set, and
multiple, randomly generated  rate scenarios  to forecast  net interest  income;
(iv)  includes  derivative instruments  used  to hedge  "natural  balance sheet"
dynamics; and (v) simulates pro forma  balance sheets, cash flows, net  interest
margin sensitivity and net interest income. Short-term interest rate sensitivity
is  based on simulated impacts on net  interest income for the succeeding twelve
months under  standardized  rising, flat  and  falling rate  scenarios.  Earning
assets  and  interest-bearing liabilities  with longer  lives (duration)  may be
subject to more volatility than those with shorter duration. The model  accounts
for these differences in its simulations.

    The  simulation model combines the  significant factors that affect interest
rate sensitivity into  a comprehensive  earnings simulation  for the  succeeding
twelve    months.    At   December    31,    1994,   the    simulation   modeled

                                       23
<PAGE>
the impact of  assumptions that  the treasury  yield curve  would: (i)  increase
linearly  during the year by 200 basis  points, or (ii) decrease linearly by 100
basis points, and compared both of these rate scenarios to a flat rate scenario.
ALCO policy guidelines provide that the difference between a most probable  rate
scenario compared with higher rate and lower rate scenarios should not result in
more  than a ten percent negative impact  on return on equity. Simulations as of
December  31,  1994,  indicated  U.  S.  Bancorp  was  positioned  within  these
guidelines  and  was  slightly asset  sensitive.  It  should be  noted  that the
simulation model neither takes into account future management actions that could
be undertaken to alter the simulated results,  if there were a change in  actual
market  interest rates  during the  year, nor  does it  contemplate a  change in
anticipated interest rate level/ volatility.

    SIMULATION VERSUS GAP ANALYSIS.  The matching of assets and liabilities  may
be  analyzed by examining  the extent to  which such assets  and liabilities are
"interest rate  sensitive"  and by  monitoring  an institution's  interest  rate
sensitivity  "gap". An asset or liability is  said to be interest rate sensitive
within a specific  time period if  it will  mature or reprice  within that  time
period.  The interest rate sensitivity gap  is defined as the difference between
the  amount  of   interest-earning  assets  anticipated,   based  upon   certain
assumptions,  to mature or reprice within a  specific time period and the amount
of interest-bearing liabilities anticipated, based upon certain assumptions,  to
mature or reprice within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the
amount  of interest rate sensitive assets  maturing within a specific time frame
exceeds the amount of interest  rate sensitive liabilities maturing within  that
same time frame.

    The  simulation model process provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate
sensitivity, whereas a static interest rate gap table is compiled as of a  point
in time. The model simulations differ from a traditional gap analysis because it
does  not reflect the multiple effects of  interest rate movements on the entire
range of assets,  liabilities and off-balance  sheet financial instruments,  and
the analysis ignores the impact of new business strategies.

    The  simulation model is  dynamic because it  includes significant variables
(balance sheet mix, volumes, and  pricing methodologies) that are identified  as
being  affected by interest rates. For example, the factors the simulation model
captures, which  traditional gap  tables do  not, include:  (i) rate  of  change
(magnitude)  differentials, such as  federal funds rates  versus savings account
rates; (ii)  maturity effects,  such  as refinanced  loans; (iii)  rate  barrier
effects,  such as  caps or  floors on loans;  (iv) changing  balance sheet, both
volume and mix changes; (v)  floating rate loans that  may be related to  PRIME,
LIBOR,  Treasury  notes or  other rate  indices, which  do not  necessarily move
correspondingly with market  rate changes;  (vi) leads  and lags  that occur  as
market  rates change; and (vii) the  effects of prepayment volatility on various
fixed-rate assets such as residential mortgages, mortgage-backed securities  and
consumer  loans. These and  certain other effects were  evaluated to develop the
multiple scenarios from  which sensitivity  of earnings to  changes in  interest
rates was determined.

    The  above mentioned  effects included  in the  simulation are  difficult to
properly present  in  a  gap  analysis.  Notwithstanding  these  limitations,  a
traditional  banking  industry gap  table is  presented on  page 25.  To improve
interest rate sensitivity disclosure, the table has been modified to include the
effect of off-balance sheet instruments. For presentation purposes, (i) savings,
interest checking and money market accounts, which can theoretically be repriced
at any time,  are included in  the 1-30 day  category, (ii)  noninterest-bearing
deposits   are  presented   as  non-interest/non-market   sensitive,  and  (iii)
off-balance sheet financial instruments reflect the most likely expected  impact
for the succeeding twelve month period.

    USE OF DERIVATIVES IN INTEREST RISK MANAGEMENT.  Off-balance sheet financial
instruments  used  in  interest  risk  management  include  forward  and futures
contracts and interest rate swap  agreements. Interest rate swaps are  primarily
used to change the floating or fixed rate characteristics of existing assets and
liabilities  or to  manage the  repricing relationship  between certain floating
rate  assets  and  floating  rate   liabilities.  Managing  the  interest   rate
sensitivity   position  of  the   organization  is  the   primary  purpose.  All
counterparties to these off-balance sheet  financial instruments are subject  to
the  same credit  analysis and  approval afforded  borrowing customers  of U. S.
Bancorp.

Liquidity

    Another objective  of asset/liability  management  is to  manage  liquidity.
Liquidity  is  the  ability  to  raise  adequate  and  reasonably  priced funds,
primarily through deposits, as well as purchased funds and the issuance of  debt
and  equity capital, and is  managed through the selection  of the asset mix and
the maturity mix of liabilities.

    Core deposits, defined as deposits other  than time deposits of $100,000  or
more,  are U. S.  Bancorp's primary source  of funding. Core  deposits provide a
sizable source of relatively  stable and low-cost  funds. Average core  deposits
and  shareholders' equity, which totaled $16.3 billion in 1994 and $16.4 billion
in 1993, funded  77 percent  and 79  percent of  average total  assets in  these
years, respectively.

    A  significant portion of the remaining funding of average total assets came
from senior and subordinated debt. Average  senior and subordinated debt was  $1
billion  and  $1.2 billion  in  1994 and  1993,  respectively. Other  sources of
liquidity include purchased funds, comprised of time deposits over $100,000  and
short-term  borrowings. Average purchased funds totaled $3.2 billion in 1994 and
$2.6 billion in 1993.

    The  affiliate  banks  individually  maintain  liquidity  in  the  form   of
short-term  money market investments, anticipated  prepayments and maturities of
securities and the maturity structure  of their loan portfolios. Another  source
of  liquidity are those  securities classified as available  for sale, which was
$1.4 billion at  December 31,  1994. A bank  note program  has been  implemented
successfully over the past few years and is utilized by U. S. Bank of Oregon and
U. S. Bank of Washington to gain access to national markets. Also, U. S. Bank of
Washington,  U. S. Bank of  California and U. S.  Savings Bank of Washington are
members of the Federal Home Loan Bank  System which provides a stable source  of
attractive, alternative funding and liquidity.

    U.  S. Bancorp believes  that liquidity is  also provided by  its ability to
raise funds in a variety of money and capital markets. U. S. Bancorp has  access
to  funding through an ongoing medium-term  note offering. At December 31, 1994,
U. S.  Bancorp  had available  various  uncommitted capacities,  including  $648
million  remaining capacity under an $800  million debt shelf registration filed
in 1991, of which $500 million has been designated as medium-term notes.  During
1993,  U. S. Bancorp  further enhanced its  liquidity with the  filing of a $500
million uncommitted  subordinated  debt shelf  registration,  all of  which  was
unissued at year-end 1994. In addition, U. S. Bancorp had available $165 million
in  committed line  of credit arrangements  from unaffiliated  banks, which were
primarily used  as  commercial paper  back-up  lines.  U. S.  Bancorp  also  had
available  $150 million of  remaining capacity under  a $300 million uncommitted
preferred stock shelf registration filed in 1992.

    U. S. Bancorp's liquidity is enhanced by its accessibility to a diversity of
national market sources of funds. The following table summarizes U. S. Bancorp's
ratings by major credit rating agencies  at December 31, 1994; such ratings  are
subject  to revision or withdrawal at anytime. With respect to commercial paper,
an A-1 rating indicates a very strong capacity for timely payment. The  Standard
&  Poor's long-term investment  grade ratings range  from AAA to  BBB, with an A
rating indicating a strong capacity. With respect to Moody's long-term  ratings,
A  is applied to upper-medium-grade obligations with adequate repayment capacity
and Baa (or baa) is applied  to medium-grade obligations; ratings modified by  1
rank  at the  higher end  of the  category. Moody's  Investors Service (Moody's)
upgraded U. S. Bancorp's senior debt rating to A2 from A3, subordinated debt  to
A3  from Baa1, and the commercial paper  rating to Prime-1 from Prime-2 in 1994.
The credit rating upgrades were based  on improvements in credit quality and  U.
S. Bancorp's emphasis on overhead reduction.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

    U.  S.  Bancorp's  allowance for  credit  losses totaled  $305.8  million at
December 31, 1994, representing 1.96 percent of loans outstanding, compared with
1.91 percent at  year-end 1993.  The provision for  credit losses  for 1994  was
$106.9  million, compared  with a  $92.9 million  provision in  1993. The higher
provision reflected  loan  growth and  management's  intention to  increase  the
allowance for future potential loan losses, even as credit quality trends showed
improvement  in  1994.  The  allowance  for credit  losses  as  a  percentage of
nonperforming loans was 125 percent at  December 31, 1993, and increased  during
1994 to 168 percent of nonperforming loans at December 31, 1994.

    The  majority of net charge-offs  in 1994 related to  bank card and consumer
loans. Net bank card charge-offs declined from a peak of 3.89 percent in 1993 to
3.02 percent  in 1994,  while  consumer loan  net  charge-offs declined  to  .66
percent from .83 percent in 1993. Real estate construction loan charge-offs were
$12.1  million in 1994, compared  with $4.7 million in  1993 and $4.1 million in
1992. The 1994  charge-offs relate  primarily to  three commercial  construction
projects in California.

    Management  performs a quarterly analysis to establish the appropriate level
of  the  allowance,  taking  into  consideration  such  factors  as  loan   loss
experience,   an  evaluation  of  potential  losses  in  the  portfolio,  credit
concentrations and  trends  in  portfolio volume,  maturity,  delinquencies  and
nonaccruals, risks associated with standby letters of credit which guarantee the
debt  of  others and  other off-balance  sheet  commitments, and  prevailing and
anticipated economic conditions. This analysis provides an allowance  consisting
of  two components, allocated and  unallocated. The allocated component reflects
inherent losses resulting from the analysis of individual loans and is developed
through specific credit  allocations for  individual loans  and historical  loss
experience  for each loan category and risk classification within each category.
The total of these allocations is then supplemented by the unallocated component
of the allowance. The unallocated  component reflects management's judgment  and
determination  of  the  amounts  necessary  for  loan  concentrations,  economic
uncertainties and other subjective factors.

    U. S.  Bancorp  continues  to  closely  monitor  credit  risk  in  its  loan
portfolio.  U. S. Bancorp believes that its credit approval and review processes
are effective and operating in accordance with sound banking policy and that the
allowance for  credit  losses  at  December 31,  1994  was  adequate  to  absorb
potential  credit losses inherent in loans, leases, loan commitments and standby
letters of credit outstanding at that date.

    In May 1993, the  Financial Accounting Standards  Board issued Statement  of
Financial  Accounting Standards  -(SFAS) No.  114, "Accounting  by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan." The statement was amended in October of 1994 by SFAS  No.
118,  which eliminated  the income  recognition provisions  of SFAS  No. 114 and
clarified certain disclosure  requirements about impaired  loans. Creditors  are
permitted to continue to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on
impaired  loans  after  adoption  of these  statements,  which  became effective
January 1, 1995, and can only be applied prospectively.

    A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is  probable that  a  creditor will  be unable  to  collect all  amounts  due
according  to  the contractual  terms  of the  loan  agreement. Once  a  loan is
determined to  be  impaired,  the  statements require  that  the  impairment  be
measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, the
impairment  may be measured by  using the loan's observable  market price or the
fair value, less expected costs  of disposal, of the  collateral if the loan  is
collateral  dependent (i.e., repayment is expected  to be provided solely by the
underlying collateral). The  choice of  a measurement method  may be  made on  a
loan-by-loan basis.

    If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment
in  the loan (including accrued  interest, net deferred loan  fees or costs, and
unamortized premium or discount), an impairment is to be recognized by  creating
a  valuation allowance with  a corresponding charge to  the provision for credit
losses or by  adjusting an existing  valuation allowance for  the impaired  loan
with  a  corresponding charge  or  credit to  the  provision for  credit losses.
Alternatively, the loan may be written down by the amount of the impairment.

    Based upon assessment of the impact of the loan impairment statements on  U.
S.  Bancorp, the balance of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 1994
will not increase upon adoption of these statements on January 1, 1995.

ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

    The allowance  is  available  to  absorb losses  from  all  loans,  although
allocations have been made for certain loans and loan categories. The allocation
of  the allowance as shown below should not be interpreted as an indication that
charge-offs in future  periods will occur  in these amounts  or proportions,  or
that  the allocation indicates future charge-off trends. In addition to the most
recent analysis of individual loans and pools of loans, management's methodology
also places emphasis on historical loss data, delinquency and nonaccrual  trends
by  loan  classification category  and  expected loan  maturity.  This analysis,
management believes, identifies potential losses  within the loan portfolio  and
therefore  results in allocation of a large portion of the allowance to specific
loan categories. The loan category percent represents the percentage of loans in
each category to total loans.

Asset Quality

    Nonperforming assets  consist  of  loans  on which  interest  is  no  longer
accrued,  certain restructured loans for which  the interest rate or other terms
have been renegotiated, and real  estate and equipment acquired in  satisfaction
of  loans. During  1994, U.  S. Bancorp  continued to  experience positive asset
quality trends.  Nonperforming  assets represented  1.31  percent of  loans  and
foreclosed  property at  December 31, 1994,  down from 1.77  percent at year-end
1993. Nonaccrual and restructured  loans, as a percent  of total loans, fell  to
1.17 percent from 1.53 percent at December 31, 1993.

    Nonperforming  real estate loans and properties  totaled $147 million, or 72
percent, of  the nonperforming  assets.  Loans or  properties  of less  than  $5
million  each made up  52 percent, or  $107 million, of  nonperforming assets at
December 31, 1994. Of the balance, six loans over $10 million each accounted for
$87 million. A significant portion of nonperforming assets at December 31,  1994
were  commercial real estate  loans related to  properties located in California
($90 million) and Washington ($20 million).

    At  December  31,  1994,  U.  S.  Bancorp's  exposure  to  highly  leveraged
transactions  (HLT's)  was  $274  million of  loans  outstanding,  with unfunded
commitments of $290  million. This  compares to  HLT loans  outstanding of  $239
million  a year earlier, with unfunded  commitments of $136 million. At December
31, 1994,  there were  no HLT  loans on  nonaccrual status,  and there  were  no
charge-offs associated with HLT loans during the year.

    In  addition to  the loans  classified as  nonperforming, U.  S. Bancorp has
other loans  which  it  has  internally classified,  largely  due  to  weakening
financial  strength of the borrowers or concern about specific industries. These
loans, although currently performing in  accordance with contractual terms,  are
monitored  closely by management and have  been specifically provided for in the
evaluation  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses.  U.  S.  Bancorp's  lending
procedures  and  loan  portfolio,  including  internally  classified  loans, are
examined by regulatory agencies as part of their supervisory activities.

    The following table presents nonaccrual  loans on both a contractually  past
due  and  contractually  current  basis  at December  31,  1994.  Both  book and
contractual balances are  indicated, the difference  reflecting charge-offs  and
interest payments applied to principal.

    Approximately  45 percent of the total nonaccrual loan portfolio at December
31, 1994 was less than 90 days  past due, including $62 million, or 36  percent,
that  were contractually current. Of the nonaccrual loans that are contractually
current, loans to 7 borrowers amounted to 80 percent of the total, and there was
some uncertainty that these loans will remain contractually current.

Capital and Dividends

    U.  S. Bancorp believes that a strong capital position is vital to continued
profitability and to  promote depositor and  investor confidence.  Additionally,
under  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Improvement  Act  of  1991
(FDICIA), acquisition capability, funding and the level and nature of regulatory
oversight will be dependent on the adequacy of capitalization.

    The federal  bank  regulatory  agencies  have  jointly  issued  rules  which
implement  a  system  of  prompt corrective  action  for  financial institutions
required by FDICIA. The  rules define the relevant  capital levels for the  five
categories, ranging from "well-capitalized" to "critically undercapitalized". An
insured  depository institution is generally  deemed to be "well-capitalized" if
it has  a total  risk-based capital  ratio  of at  least 10  percent, a  Tier  1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6 percent, and a leverage ratio of at least
5 percent.

    Risk-based  capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board establish
a risk-adjusted ratio  relating capital  to different categories  of assets  and
off-balance sheet exposures for bank holding companies. The guidelines require a
minimum  total risk-based capital ratio of 8  percent, with half of the total in
the form  of  Tier 1  capital.  U. S.  Bancorp's  Tier 1  capital  is  comprised
primarily  of common  equity and  perpetual preferred  stock, less  goodwill and
certain other intangibles, and excludes the equity impact of adjusting available
for sale securities to  market value. Total  capital also includes  subordinated
debt and a portion of the allowance for credit losses, as defined.

    The  risk-based capital  rules have been  supplemented by  a leverage ratio,
defined as Tier 1  capital to adjusted quarterly  average total assets.  Banking
organizations  other  than those  which are  most highly  rated are  expected to
maintain ratios at least  100 to 200  basis points above  the minimum 3  percent
level, depending on their financial condition.

    Each  subsidiary bank  is subjected to  capital requirements  similar to the
requirements for bank  holding companies.  At December 31,  1994, all  of U.  S.
Bancorp's  banking subsidiaries  met the  risk-based capital  ratio and leverage
ratio requirements  for  "well  capitalized" banks.  The  banking  subsidiaries'
ratios  are expected to be maintained at the required levels by the retention of
earnings and,  if  necessary,  the  issuance  of  additional  capital-qualifying
securities.

    The  risk-based  capital  and leverage  ratios  for  U. S.  Bancorp  and its
significant bank subsidiaries at  December 31, 1994 are  presented in the  table
below (assets in millions):

    At  December 31, 1994, common shareholders' equity was $1.6 billion. For the
year 1994,  average common  equity to  average total  assets increased  to  7.69
percent  from 7.54  percent in  1993. In  April 1994,  U. S.  Bancorp's Board of
Directors approved  a plan  to repurchase  up to  six million  shares of  U.  S.
Bancorp  common stock over the next five  years. During 1994, 2.2 million shares
were acquired at  a cost  of $57.1 million.  The quarterly  common dividend  was
increased  13 percent in  the third quarter  of 1994, resulting  in dividends of
$.94 per share declared in 1994, compared with $.85 per share in 1993.

1)  Yields are based on amortized cost balances.
2)  Interest  income on tax-exempt  securities and loans has  been adjusted to a
    fully tax-equivalent basis using  the statutory Federal  income tax rate  of
    35% for 1993 and 1994, and 34% for all other years.
3)  Loans  on nonaccrual status have been included in the computation of average
    balances.

                              LETTER OF MANAGEMENT

    The  management of  U. S.  Bancorp has prepared  and is  responsible for the
integrity  and  fairness  of  the  financial  statements  and  other   financial
information  included  in  this  annual  report.  The  financial  statements are
prepared in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles and,  when
appropriate, include amounts based on management's estimates and judgment.

    To  meet its  responsibility both  for the  integrity and  fairness of these
financial statements and  information, management  maintains accounting  systems
and related internal accounting controls. These controls are designed to provide
reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are  properly  authorized,  assets are
safeguarded and  financial  records  are reliably  maintained.  The  concept  of
reasonable  assurance is based on  the recognition that the  cost of a system of
internal controls must be related to the benefits derived.

    Management monitors the effectiveness and compliance of its internal control
systems through a continuous program of internal audits. Management has reviewed
the recommendations  of  the  internal  auditors  and  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP,
independent  auditors,  and  has  responded  in  an  appropriate, cost-effective
manner.

    The Audit Committee of  the Board of Directors,  composed solely of  outside
directors, meets periodically with U. S. Bancorp's management, internal auditors
and  the  independent auditors  to  review matters  relative  to the  quality of
financial reporting  and internal  accounting controls  and the  results of  the
audit.  The  independent  auditors and  internal  auditors meet  with  the Audit
Committee, at least once a year, without management present.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Directors and Shareholders of U. S. Bancorp:

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of U. S. Bancorp
and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders'  equity, and cash flows for  each
of  the  three years  in the  period  ended December  31, 1994.  These financial
statements  are  the   responsibility  of  U.   S.  Bancorp's  management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion  on these financial statements based on
our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion,  such consolidated financial  statements present fairly,  in
all  material respects, the financial position of U. S. Bancorp and subsidiaries
at December 31, 1994  and 1993, and  the results of  their operations and  their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As  discussed  in Note  1 to  the consolidated  financial statements,  U. S.
Bancorp and  subsidiaries  changed their  method  of accounting  for  investment
securities  effective December 31, 1993, to  conform with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115. Also, as discussed  in Note 12, U. S. Bancorp  and
subsidiaries   changed  their  methods  of  accounting  for  postretirement  and
postemployment benefits effective January 1, 1992, to conform with Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 and No. 112.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    The  accounting and reporting policies of U. S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries
conform with generally accepted  accounting principles and prevailing  practices
within  the  banking  industry.  The  following is  a  description  of  the more
significant policies.

    BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

    The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance  with
generally  accepted accounting principles  and with general  practice within the
banking industry. In preparing such financial statements, management is required
to make estimates and judgments that  affect the reported amounts of assets  and
liabilities  as of the date  of the balance sheet  and revenues and expenses for
the period.  Actual results  could differ  significantly from  those  estimates.
Material  estimates  that  are particularly  susceptible  to  significant change
relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation
of real estate acquired  in connection with foreclosures  or in satisfaction  of
loans.  In connection with the determination  of the allowance for credit losses
and  the  valuation  of  real  estate  owned,  management  obtains   independent
appraisals for significant properties.

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

    The  consolidated financial statements of U. S. Bancorp include the accounts
of U. S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The significant banking subsidiaries of U. S.
Bancorp (the Banks) include United States National Bank of Oregon (U. S. Bank of
Oregon), U.  S.  Bank  of  Washington,  National  Association  (U.  S.  Bank  of
Washington),  U. S. Bank of California, U. S.  Bank of Nevada, and U. S. Bank of
Idaho, National Association.

    Results of operations of companies  acquired and accounted for as  purchases
are included from their dates of acquisition. When an acquisition occurs through
a  pooling  of  interests, prior  period  financial statements  are  restated to
include the accounts of companies acquired.

    Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the  current
year presentation.

    ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS

    In  accordance  with  the  purchase method  of  accounting,  the  assets and
liabilities of  purchased banking  and financial  organizations were  stated  at
estimated  fair values at the date of  acquisition. The excess of cost over fair
value of net assets  acquired has been  accounted for as  goodwill and is  being
amortized on the straight-line method ranging from 15 to 25 years.

    LOANS HELD FOR SALE

    Loans held for sale include mortgage and consumer loans and each is reported
at the lower of cost or aggregate market value.

    The  cost of over-the-counter options used  to hedge interest rate and price
fluctuations until mortgage loans are  sold is amortized straight-line over  the
option  period and recorded as a component of  the gain or loss on mortgage loan
sales. Commitment  fees  incurred on  contracts  to ensure  future  delivery  of
mortgage  loans into mortgage-backed securities are amortized straight-line over
the commitment  period and  recorded  as a  component of  the  gain or  loss  on
mortgage loan sales.

    SECURITIES

    At  December  31,  1993,  U.  S.  Bancorp  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities." SFAS No.  115 requires the classification of  securities
at  acquisition into  one of three  categories: held to  maturity, available for
sale, or trading.

    In accordance  with SFAS  No.  115, securities  are  classified as  held  to
maturity where U. S. Bancorp has the ability and positive intent to hold them to
maturity.   Securities  bought   and  held   principally  for   the  purpose  of

                                       44

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
sale in the  near term  are classified  as trading  securities. Investments  not
classified  as  trading  securities  nor  as  held  to  maturity  securities are
classified as securities available for  sale. Securities in this  classification
are available for future liquidity requirements.

    Securities  held to maturity are carried  at cost, adjusted for amortization
of premiums  and  accretion  of  discounts to  maturity.  Unrealized  losses  on
securities  held to  maturity due to  fluctuations in fair  value are recognized
when it  is  determined  that an  other  than  temporary decline  in  value  has
occurred. Realized gains and losses on sale of securities available for sale are
computed  on the specific identification  method. Trading account securities are
carried at fair  value. Realized  gains and losses  on sale  on trading  account
securities,  computed on the average cost method, and fair value adjustments are
included in noninterest revenue.

    Unrealized holding gains  and losses  on securities available  for sale  are
excluded  from earnings and are  reported net of tax  as a separate component of
shareholders' equity until realized.

    INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY CONTRACTS

    U. S. Bancorp uses  various interest rate contracts,  such as interest  rate
swaps,   futures,  forward  rate  agreements,  caps   and  floors,  as  part  of
asset/liability management or to hedge trading  accounts and to provide for  the
needs of its customers.

    Gains  and  losses  on  interest  rate  contracts  used  for asset/liability
management purposes are deferred and  recognized as interest income or  interest
expense  over the lives of the related assets or liabilities. For contracts used
to hedge trading activities,  gains and losses are  included in trading  account
income.  Income or  expense on interest  rate contracts used  to manage interest
rate exposure is recognized as an adjustment  of the yield over the life of  the
underlying assets or liabilities.

    Foreign  currency  contracts  are  valued  at  current  prevailing  rates of
exchange, and gains  or losses resulting  from such valuations  are included  in
noninterest revenue.

    ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

    The  allowance for credit losses is established to absorb known and inherent
losses primarily  resulting from  loans and  leases oustanding,  commitments  to
extend credit, standby letters of credit and other guarantees. Amounts are added
to  the allowance for  credit losses and  charged against earnings  to bring the
allowance to a level which, in management's judgment, is considered adequate  to
absorb  losses  inherent  in  the  portfolio.  Management  performs  a quarterly
analysis to  determine  the appropriate  level  of the  allowance,  taking  into
consideration  factors  such  as general  economic  conditions,  historical loss
experience, credit  concentrations and  trends  in portfolio  volume,  maturity,
delinquencies  and  nonaccruals. Actual  credit losses,  net of  recoveries, are
deducted  from  the  allowance.  While  management  uses  the  best  information
available on which to base estimates, future adjustments to the allowance may be
necessary  if  economic conditions,  particularly  in U.  S.  Bancorp's markets,
differ substantially from the assumptions used by management.

    PREMISES, FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT

    Premises, furniture  and  equipment  are stated  at  cost  less  accumulated
depreciation  and  amortization. Construction  costs and  the  cost of  funds to
finance major projects are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs are charged  to
expense  as incurred and the cost of improvements is capitalized. Provisions for
depreciation and  amortization  are  computed using  the  straight-line  method.
Estimated  useful lives range up  to 50 years for  buildings, three to ten years
for  furniture  and  equipment,  and  up   to  the  lease  term  for   leasehold
improvements.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
    OTHER REAL ESTATE AND EQUIPMENT OWNED

    Properties  acquired  by  foreclosure or  deed  in lieu  of  foreclosure are
carried at the  lower of  their recorded amounts  or fair  value less  estimated
costs of disposal in accordance with Statement of Position 92-3, "Accounting for
Foreclosed Assets." Any write-downs at, or prior to, the date of acquisition are
charged  to the  allowance for credit  losses. Subsequent  write-downs, gains or
losses recognized on the sale of these properties and net operating results  are
included in noninterest expenses.

    INCOME TAXES

    Income  taxes are accounted for using  the asset and liability method. Under
this method,  a deferred  tax asset  or  liability is  determined based  on  the
enacted  tax rates  which will  be in  effect when  the differences  between the
financial statement  carrying  amounts and  tax  bases of  existing  assets  and
liabilities  are expected to be reported in  U. S. Bancorp's income tax returns.
The deferred tax provision for the year  is equal to the change in the  deferred
tax  liability from the beginning to the end of the year. The effect on deferred
taxes of  a change  in tax  rates is  recognized in  income in  the period  that
includes the enactment date.

    TRUST DIVISION ASSETS

    Property  held  by  the Banks  in  fiduciary  or agency  capacity  for their
customers is not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet,  since
such items are not assets of the respective banks.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION

    Interest  income is  accrued as  earned. The  accrual of  interest income on
business loans ceases  when potential collection  difficulties are foreseen  and
collateral  is inadequate to cover principal and interest. When a loan is placed
on nonaccrual  status, interest  accrued but  not received  is reversed  against
interest  income.  If  management  determines  that  ultimate  collectibility of
principal is in doubt, cash receipts  on nonaccrual loans are applied to  reduce
the  principal  balance. A  loan  may be  returned  to accrual  status  when all
delinquent principal and interest become current in accordance with the terms of
the loan agreement or when the loan is  both well secured and in the process  of
collection.

    Bank  card loans  are charged  off upon  becoming 180  days past  due. Other
consumer loans are, in general, charged off  upon becoming 90 days past due  and
interest earned but not collected thereon is reversed at the time of charge-off.
Consequently, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status.

    Unearned  income on direct financing leases  is amortized to produce a level
yield on the remaining net receivable  balance. Income from leveraged leases  is
recognized  over  the  term  of  the  leases  based  on  the  unrecovered equity
investment.

    LOAN FEE INCOME

    Loan origination and  commitment fees  and certain  direct loan  origination
costs  are deferred and the  net amount amortized as  an adjustment of the yield
over the contractual  life of the  loans and included  in interest income.  Loan
fees  from loans held for sale are deferred and recognized as a component of the
gain or loss on  sale of the loans.  Loans and leases are  carried at cost  less
unamortized net loan fees. Commitment fees based on a percentage of a customer's
unused  line  of  credit and  fees  related  to standby  letters  of  credit are
recognized in noninterest revenue over the commitment period.

    MORTGAGE SERVICING

    Loan servicing  fees are  based  on a  percentage  of the  outstanding  loan
principal  balances being  serviced and are  included in income  as related loan
payments from mortgagors are collected.

    The difference between the actual service  fee rates and normal service  fee
rates  on  those  loans  which  are  sold  with  servicing  rights  retained  is
capitalized as excess  servicing fee  receivable, and  is amortized  based on  a
method  which relates the amortization to the  estimated life of these loans. In
the event of unanticipated

                                       46
<PAGE>
                         U. S. BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
prepayments, the excess servicing fee receivable is written down to the  present
value  (based on the  original discount rate) of  the estimated remaining future
excess servicing revenue through a reduction of servicing fee income.

    Costs associated with the acquisition  of loan servicing rights through  the
purchase  of servicing  contracts are deferred  and amortized on  a method which
relates the amortization of these costs  to the estimated net servicing  income.
In  the  event of  unanticipated prepayments,  the  future amortization  rate is
adjusted prospectively, such that the undiscounted future cash flows approximate
the expected future net servicing income.

    Monthly payments required  of U.  S. Bancorp under  mortgage loan  servicing
prepayment  hedges are  recorded as  a reduction  of servicing  income. Payments
received by U. S. Bancorp as the result of changes in prepayment experience  are
recorded as an increase to servicing income.

    COMPUTATIONS OF EARNINGS PER SHARE

    Earnings  per common share are based  on net income after preferred dividend
requirements and  the  weighted average  number  of common  shares  outstanding,
adjusted  for  stock splits  and  stock dividends.  The  dilutive effect  of the
assumed exercise of stock options outstanding is not material.

    STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

    For purposes of the  statement of cash flows,  U. S. Bancorp considers  cash
and  due from banks and federal funds  sold and security resell agreements to be
cash and cash  equivalents. Deposits placed  with other financial  institutions,
time  deposits  and lending  activities of  the  Banks are  reported net  in the
statement.

2.  Restructuring Charge
    In March of 1994, U. S. Bancorp's  Board of Directors approved a major  cost
reduction  and revenue enhancement program. This program included plans for a 10
percent reduction  in  staff,  and  plans to  eliminate  and  integrate  certain
operations  and facilities. Through an early retirement program, other severance
programs and attrition, U. S. Bancorp  accomplished the 10 percent reduction  in
full-time  equivalent employees  by the  end of  third quarter  1994. The pretax
expense of $100 million represented those incremental costs incurred as a result
of the restructuring plan.

    The restructure  charge  consists  of  $96.4  million  in  anticipated  cash
expenditures  and $3.6  million of non-cash  charges, mainly  the write-downs of
facilities. A  significant  portion of  the  cash outlays  associated  with  the
program  relate to enhanced retirement programs, which  will be funded over a 10
to 15 year  period as  contributions are  made to  the benefit  plans. The  most
significant  portion of  future expense  reductions will  consist of  savings of
employee compensation and benefits due to a reduction in employees.

    As of December 31, 1994, $18.9 million of the restructuring charge  remained
in other liabilities which represented $10.9 million related to staff reductions
that  were  initiated in  1994, $3.1  million related  to the  consolidation and
integration of facilities  in process, and  $4.9 million related  to other  cost
reduction  actions during 1994. At December  31, 1994, $48.8 million of employee
benefit plan liabilities related to  the enhanced retirement programs were  also
included in other liabilities.

3.  Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions
    The  Banks are  required to maintain  reserves against  customer deposits by
keeping balances with the Federal Reserve Bank in a noninterest-bearing account.
The average amount  of those reserve  balances for the  year ended December  31,
1994 was approximately $186 million.

    National  and state banking laws  and regulations place certain restrictions
on loans  or  advances  made by  the  banking  subsidiaries to  members  of  the
affiliated  group, including the parent company,  and also place restrictions on
dividends paid by the subsidiary banks.

3.  Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions (Continued)
    National banks can initiate dividend payments in a given year, without prior
regulatory approval,  equal to  net  profits, as  defined,  for that  year  plus
retained  net  profits for  the preceding  two years.  The subsidiary  banks can
distribute as dividends to the parent company in 1995 (in addition to their 1995
net income) approximately $210 million. Loans from a bank to a single  affiliate
may  not exceed 10 percent of the bank's equity capital, as defined. At December
31, 1994, the total  amount that could  be loaned to the  parent company by  its
banking  subsidiaries was approximately  $231 million. As a  result of the above
regulatory restrictions, net assets  of the subsidiary  banks not available  for
dividends or loans amounted to approximately $1.46 billion.

    U.  S. Bancorp's  loan classifications  for financial  reporting differ from
those for regulatory reporting. Loans are classified based on type of collateral
securing the loans for regulatory  purposes. Loan classifications for  financial
reporting  purposes are based on the purpose  and primary source of repayment of
the loans.

    The minimum future lease payments related to direct finance receivables  for
each  of  the years  1995  through 1999  are  $238 million,  $206  million, $146
million, $98 million and $50 million, respectively.

    The following  table summarizes  the  changes in  the allowance  for  credit

4.  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses (Continued)
    SFAS  No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," issued in
May 1993 and SFAS No. 118, an amendment of SFAS No. 114 issued in October  1994,
require  adoption no later  than January 1, 1995.  These statements require each
impaired loan within  its scope to  be measured  based on the  present value  of
expected  future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or,
as a practical  expedient, at  the loan's observable  market price  or the  fair
value,  less  expected costs  of  disposal, of  the  collateral if  the  loan is
collateral dependent.

    U. S. Bancorp does not anticipate that the January 1, 1995 adoption of  SFAS
No.  114 and No. 118 will have a material effect on its results of operations or
financial condition.

5.  Related Parties
    The Banks have granted loans to the officers and directors of U. S.  Bancorp
and  to their  associates. These  related party loans  are made  in the ordinary
course of business and, management believes,  do not involve more than a  normal
risk  of collectibility.  The aggregate dollar  amount of these  loans was $90.1
million and $112.4 million at December  31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During
1994,  $90.7  million  of new  loans  were  made and  repayments  totaled $113.0
million.

    U. S. BANCORP (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)

    All long-term debt of the parent company is unsecured. The medium-term notes
have fixed or variable rates ranging from 4.41% to 9.21% at December 31, 1994.

    The  8.125% notes due in  2002 and 7% notes due  in 2003 are subordinated to
all senior indebtedness of U. S. Bancorp. The notes are not redeemable by U.  S.
Bancorp, in whole or in part, prior to maturity and do not provide for a sinking
fund.

    At  December 31,  1994, U.  S. Bancorp  had $500  million borrowing capacity
under a $500 million subordinated shelf registration filed in 1993. In addition,
$648.2 million was available under an $800 million debt shelf registration filed
in 1991, of which $500 million has been designated as medium-term notes.

    BANKS

    The bank notes, issued by U. S. Bank of Oregon and U. S. Bank of  Washington
are  primarily floating rate,  unsecured notes with rates  ranging from 5.40% to
6.09% at December 31, 1994.  U. S. Bank of Oregon  and U. S. Bank of  Washington
together  have $779 million remaining uncommitted capacity at December 31, 1994,

11. Long-Term Debt (Continued)
    U. S. Bancorp's  subsidiaries, U. S.  Savings Bank of  Washington and  Heart
Federal Savings and Loan Association, borrow from the Federal Home Loan Banks of
Seattle and San Francisco. These banking subsidiaries pledge certain real estate
loans  and investment securities as collateral for these secured notes. Interest
rates ranged from 5.05% to 8.10% at December 31, 1994.

    The 7.75% notes due in 2002  are subordinated to deposits and certain  other
liabilities  of U. S. Bank  of Oregon and require  annual sinking fund payments.
Prepayments made in prior years have been used as credits against the  mandatory
annual  sinking  fund requirements  through  1996 and  part  of 1997.  The notes
require additional sinking fund payments of $80,000 in 1997 and $625,000 in each
following year. The notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at par, in whole
or in part,  at the option  of U.  S. Bank of  Oregon with the  approval of  the
Comptroller of the Currency.

    Mortgages  and other notes payable are primarily mortgages on bank premises.
Interest rates range from 7.5% to 12% and remaining maturities vary.

    Payments required to service U. S. Bancorp's long-term debt during the  next
five  years were as follows: 1995 - $494 million; 1996 - $58 million; 1997 - $86
million; 1998 - $23 million and 1999 - $4 million.

12. Employee Benefit Plans

    RETIREMENT PLANS

    U. S. Bancorp  provides a noncontributory  trusteed defined benefit  pension
plan  (Pension Plan) which covers substantially  all employees. Benefit plans of
companies acquired are  generally terminated,  with employees  covered by  those
plans  merged into U. S.  Bancorp plans. Benefits are  based on years of service
and highest average level of compensation for any five consecutive years out  of
the  last ten years of service. U.  S. Bancorp's funding policy is to contribute
annually an amount  between the  minimum required  under ERISA  and the  maximum
amount  that  is  deductible for  income  tax purposes.  Such  contributions are
intended to provide  not only for  benefits attributed to  service to date,  but
also for those expected to be earned in the future.

    U.  S. Bancorp also  maintains separate unfunded  supplemental pension plans
(Supplemental Plans) that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits
in excess  of  limits  imposed by  federal  tax  law on  benefit  payments  from
qualified plans and for certain compensation not covered in the Pension Plan.

    In  determining the projected  benefit obligation the  assumed discount rate
used was 8.5 percent at December 31,  1994, and 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent  at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The assumed rate of increase in future
salary  levels ranged from 5 percent to 9.5 percent. The expected long-term rate
of return on assets used in determining net periodic pension cost was 9 percent.
As a result of the sale of the mortgage subsidiary's loan production offices and
the termination of employees  through the restructuring  program, U. S.  Bancorp
recognized pension curtailment gains totaling $6.5 million in 1994.

    EMPLOYEE INVESTMENT PLAN

    U.  S. Bancorp sponsors  an Employee Investment  Plan which allows qualified
employees, at their option, to make  contributions of up to certain  percentages
of  pretax base  salary through  salary deductions  under Section  401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code.  A portion  of these contributions  is matched  by U.  S.
Bancorp. All

of  U. S. Bancorp's matching contributions are  invested in U. S. Bancorp common
stock. Employee contributions are invested, at the employees' direction, among a
variety of investment alternatives. Total expenses associated with the  Employee
Investment  Plan were $6.9 million, $9.3 million  and $7.4 million in 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

    OTHER POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

    U. S.  Bancorp  has a  benefit  plan which  provides  postretirement  health
benefits  to all employees who have attained the  age of 55 and have at least 10
years of service. Retiree  health care benefits  are offered under  self-insured
plans.  For  any  employee  retiring on  or  after  July 1,  1993,  the  plan is
contributory, with retirees' contributions adjusted annually to reflect  certain
cost-sharing provisions and benefit limitations. Retirees prior to July 1, 1993,
are  covered under a plan that  is noncontributory for retirees and contributory
for dependents.  In  1992, U.  S.  Bancorp  adopted SFAS  No.  106,  "Employers'
Accounting  for  Postretirement Benefits  Other  Than Pensions"  and  elected to
immediately recognize the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation measured
as of January 1, 1992, reducing income  on an after-tax basis by $54.9  million.
U.  S. Bancorp reserves the right to terminate  the plan or make plan changes at
any time.

    U. S. Bancorp  also provides postemployment  benefits other than  retirement
benefits  to  former  or  inactive employees,  their  beneficiaries  and covered
dependents. Those benefits include, but are not limited to, salary continuation,
supplemental  unemployment  benefits,  severance  benefits,   disability-related
benefits  (including workers'  compensation), job  training and  counseling, and
continuation of  benefits  such  as  health care  benefits  and  life  insurance
coverage. In 1992, U. S. Bancorp adopted SFAS No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment  Benefits." This accounting change reduced income on an after-tax
basis by $5.0 million.

    The following  table sets  forth the  status of  the plan,  reconciled  with
amounts  recognized in U. S.  Bancorp's balance sheet at  December 31, 1994, and
1993.

12. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)
    The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
benefit  obligation was 8.5 percent  at December 31, 1994,  and 7.25 percent and
8.5 percent at December  31, 1993 and 1992,  respectively. The 1994 health  care
trend  rate was  projected to  be 11.5 percent  for pre-65  participants and 8.5
percent for post-65 participants. These rates are assumed to decrease  gradually
until they reach 6 percent in the year 2001 and remain at that level thereafter.

    Increasing  the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point
in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of January 1, 1994 by $5.6 million and the aggregate of the service and interest
components of net periodic postretirement cost for 1994 by $457,000.

    STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

    U. S. Bancorp maintains various stock incentive plans which provide for  its
ability  to  grant stock  options, stock  appreciation rights,  restricted share
awards, performance shares and other  stock-based awards to directors,  officers
and  key  employees.  Under  the  terms  of  the  employee  and  officer  option
agreements, the option price is the fair market value at the time the option  is
granted;  the option  period cannot  exceed ten years  from the  grant date; and
options are exercisable under two vesting structures. Under the first structure,
options are exercisable 50 percent after  one year, 80 percent after two  years,
and  100  percent after  three years.  Under the  second structure,  options are
exercisable on the ninth anniversary of  the grant date subject to  acceleration
based  on achievement of  certain performance goals.  Non-employee directors may
elect to acquire "deferred compensation options"  in lieu of fees otherwise  due
for  board services  and may exercise  those options after  six months. Deferred
compensation options granted to non-employee directors are issued at 40  percent
of  market price on grant date. Upon  exercise, all option proceeds are credited
to the capital accounts.

    Stock option activity is summarized in the following table:

13. Mortgage Banking Activities
    On August 11, 1994, a significant portion  of the assets of U. S.  Bancorp's
subsidiary,  U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Company,  was sold. The assets sold included
$3.6 billion of the $4.3  billion residential mortgage loan servicing  portfolio
and  50 loan origination  offices in 10  states. This sale  resulted in a pretax
gain of $50.8 million  in the third  quarter of 1994. U.  S. Bancorp intends  to
continue   to  originate  mortgage  loans  through  the  branches  of  the  bank
subsidiaries and a loan by phone program.

    Changes in mortgage loan servicing rights purchased for the last three years
were as follows:

14. Shareholders' Equity
    In April  1994,  U. S.  Bancorp's  Board of  Directors  approved a  plan  to
repurchase  up to six million shares of U. S. Bancorp common stock over the next
five years. Through December 31, 1994,  2.2 million shares of common stock  were
acquired at a cost of $57.1 million.

    The Series A Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to July 23, 1997. On or
after  such date, the Series  A Preferred Stock will  be redeemable, in whole or
part, at the  option of U.  S. Bancorp at  a liquidating preference  of $25  per
share  plus  accrued  and unpaid  dividends.  Under current  regulations,  U. S.
Bancorp may  not exercise  its option  to redeem  the Series  A Preferred  Stock
without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

    The  preferred dividend requirement used in  the calculation of earnings per
common share was  $12,187,200 for the  years 1994 and  1993, and $5,349,000  for
1992.

15. Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Risk
    U.  S.  Bancorp and  certain subsidiaries  are  defendants in  various legal
proceedings. Management,  after reviewing  these  actions and  proceedings  with
counsel,  believes  that  the  outcome  of  such  proceedings  will  not  have a
materially adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position or results of
operations of U. S. Bancorp or its subsidiaries.

15. Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Risk (Continued)
    In the normal course of business,  U. S. Bancorp uses financial  instruments
with  off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers and to
reduce its  own exposure  to  fluctuations in  interest rates.  These  financial
instruments  include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and
financial guarantees,  interest  rate caps  and  floors written,  interest  rate
swaps,  and forward and futures contracts. These instruments involve, to varying
degrees, elements  of credit  and interest  rate risk  in excess  of the  amount
recognized  in the consolidated  financial statements. The  contract or notional
amounts of these instruments do not  represent the credit or interest rate  risk
associated  with these contracts, but rather give an indication of the volume of
the transactions.  Unless  noted  otherwise,  U. S.  Bancorp  does  not  require
collateral  or other security to  support financial instruments with off-balance
sheet credit risk.

    Credit risk is defined as the  possibility of sustaining a loss because  the
other  parties to a financial instrument fail  to perform in accordance with the
terms of the contract. U. S. Bancorp's exposure to credit loss, in the event  of
nonperformance  by the other party to  the financial instrument, for commitments
to extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  written
is  represented by  the contractual amount  of those instruments.  U. S. Bancorp
uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional  obligations
as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

    The  following  table summarizes  U. S.  Bancorp's credit  related financial
instruments, which  include both  commitments to  extend credit  and letters  of
credit, each of which is considered in U. S. Bancorp's liquidity risk management
practices.  For these  financial instruments, contract  amounts represent credit
risk.

</TABLE>

    Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments
generally  have  fixed expiration  dates or  other  termination clauses  and may
require payment of  a fee.  The majority  of commitments  had original  maturity
dates  of one  year or  less and represented  commitments to  make variable rate
loans. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being  drawn
upon,  the total  commitment amounts  do not  necessarily represent  future cash
requirements. U.  S. Bancorp  evaluates each  customer's creditworthiness  on  a
case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by U.
S.  Bancorp upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation
of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies  but may include  deposits held  in
financial  institutions, marketable securities,  accounts receivable, inventory,
property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.

    Standby letters of credit and  financial guarantees written are  conditional
commitments  issued by U. S. Bancorp to  guarantee the performance of a customer
to a third party.  These guarantees are primarily  issued to support public  and
private  borrowing  arrangements,  including  state  and  municipal obligations,
industrial development revenue bonds, corporate debt, and similar  transactions.
The  credit risk  involved in  issuing letters  of credit  and writing financial
guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities
to customers.  Generally, standby  letters of  credit and  financial  guarantees
written  are not  secured, but, when  required, collateral may  include cash and
securities. Approximately 88 percent  of standby letters  of credit at  December
31, 1994 expire in less than five years and 43 percent in less than one year.

    The  following  table  presents  a summary  of  U.  S.  Bancorp's derivative
financial instruments and  their related  credit exposure.  For these  financial
instruments,    contract   or   notional   amounts    exceed   the   amount   of

credit risk. Risk of  credit loss for these  financial instruments involves  the
risk  of dealing with counterparties and their  ability to meet the terms of the
contract. U. S. Bancorp  controls the credit risk  of these instruments  through
credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.

</TABLE>

    Interest  rate  derivative  financial  instruments are  used  to  reduce the
interest rate risk  of a specific  asset or  liability position or  to adjust  a
specific interest rate exposure that is identified by asset/liability management
monitoring processes. Income or expense on most derivative financial instruments
used  to manage  interest rate exposure  is recorded  on an accrual  basis as an
adjustment to the yield of the related interest rate exposures over the  periods
covered  by  the contracts.  If an  interest rate  swap that  is used  to manage
interest rate  risk  is terminated  early  and  the hedged  asset  remains,  any
resulting  gain or loss is deferred and  amortized as an adjustment to the yield
of the underlying  interest rate  exposure position over  the remaining  periods
originally  covered  by  the  terminated  swap.  Deferred  losses  on  the early
termination of interest  rate swaps used  to manage interest  rate risk  totaled
$560,000  as of December 31, 1994. This amount is scheduled to be amortized into
income in the following periods: $169,000 in 1995; $148,000 in 1996; $139,000 in
1997; and $104,000 thereafter.

    Not all  derivative  financial  instruments have  off-balance  sheet  credit
and/or  interest rate risk. Options written,  including caps and floors written,
do not expose U.  S. Bancorp to  credit risk, except as  noted below, since  the
counterparty  has already  performed according to  the terms of  the contract by
paying a premium up front.  However, credit risk arises  to the extent that  the
underlying  instrument that  U. S.  Bancorp is  obligated to  buy is  subject to
credit risk.

    Financial futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities
or money market instruments  in which the  seller agrees to  make delivery at  a
specified  future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield.
Initial margin requirements are met in cash or other instruments, and changes in
the contract values are settled daily. Futures contracts have little credit risk
because  futures  exchanges  are   the  counterparties.  These  contracts   have
maturities through March 2003.

    Futures contracts are purchased to hedge market price risks of variable rate
loans  and variable  rate liabilities  that are  not covered  by swap positions.
Futures contracts are  sold to hedge  market price risks  of interest rate  caps
written  for  customers, mortgage-backed  securities in  the available  for sale
portfolio, and certain investments held for trading purposes.

    Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed  and
floating   rate  interest  payment  obligations  without  the  exchange  of  the
underlying principal amounts. Interest rate swaps are principally used to  hedge
interest  rate risk related to LIBOR-based floating rate loans and variable rate
liabilities  such  as  certificates  of   deposit  and  term  funds   purchased.
Additionally,  interest rate swaps, with  notional amounts totaling $68 million,
were entered into as  customer accommodations and were  included in the  balance
disclosed

in  the table. Of this  total, $63.5 million was  matched by interest rate swaps
with major financial institutions.  Gains and losses  related to customer  swaps
are  not material.  The current  credit exposure on  interest rate  swaps is the
replacement cost  in the  event of  nonperformance by  counterparties for  those
contracts in a gain position.

    At  December 31,  1994, U. S.  Bancorp paid  a fixed rate  ranging from 4.21
percent to 8.48 percent and received  a variable rate ranging from 5.31  percent
to  7.70  percent on  interest rate  swaps with  notional amounts  totaling $768
million. For those transactions  where U. S. Bancorp  received a fixed rate  and
paid  a variable rate, the  fixed rate ranged from  3.82 percent to 9.75 percent
and the variable rate ranged from 5.1825 percent to 8.025 percent. The  notional
amounts  of such agreements totaled  $64 million at December  31, 1994. The swap
agreements have original  terms to maturity  of one to  ten years and  remaining
terms to maturity of five months to nine years.

    U.  S. Bancorp acts as a principal  in writing interest rate caps and floors
for customers. Purchased and written  options primarily represent interest  rate
caps  and  floors.  These interest  rate  caps  and floors  enable  customers to
transfer, modify, or  reduce their interest  rate risk and  obligate one of  the
parties  to make payments  if an interest  rate index exceeds  a specified upper
"capped" level or if the index falls  below a specified lower "floor" level.  As
principal,  U.  S. Bancorp  is exposed  to  loss should  a counterparty  fail to
perform as agreed. Normal credit reviews on each counterparty are performed, and
exposure to  the  interest rate  risk  inherent in  these  items is  managed  by
entering  into  offsetting positions  or other  hedging techniques.  Credit risk
exists for purchased  options and  is measured as  the replacement  cost in  the
event  of  nonperformance  by  counterparties  for  those  contracts  in  a gain
position, plus an amount for residual credit risk. Interest rate caps and floors
have maturities ranging from 1995 to the year 2000.

    Foreign exchange  contracts, or  forward commitments  to purchase  and  sell
foreign currencies, are agreements for delayed delivery of a foreign currency in
which  the  buyer agrees  to purchase  and the  seller agrees  to deliver,  at a
specified future date, a  specified amount at a  specified exchange rate. U.  S.
Bancorp  is party  to foreign  exchange spot and  forward contracts  to meet the
needs  of  its  customers.  Customer  transactions  are  generally  covered   by
offsetting positions to reduce risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates.
Foreign  exchange contracts generally relate to major foreign currencies and are
highly liquid. The foreign exchange contracts have original terms to maturity of
twelve months or less. Credit exposure  for foreign exchange contracts is  equal
to the unrealized gains in such contracts.

    In   conjunction   with   U.   S.   Bancorp's   mortgage   loan  operations,
mortgage-backed securities are sold for delivery in future months, and over  the
counter  options  on mortgage-backed  securities are  purchased to  hedge closed
mortgage loans and  to hedge  interest rate guarantee  commitments for  unclosed
mortgage  loans.  Mortgage  related  derivative  activities  have  been  reduced
significantly since  1993 as  a result  of the  sale of  the majority  of U.  S.
Bancorp's mortgage operations in 1994.

    To  hedge prepayment  risk in its  mortgage loan servicing  portfolio, U. S.
Bancorp entered into a hedging contract in  1993 with a notional amount of  $1.5
billion,  scheduled to terminate in September 1998. This contract was terminated
in 1994 and a loss  recognized in earnings simultaneously  with the sale of  the
majority of U. S. Bancorp's purchased mortgage loan servicing rights portfolio.

    Most  of U. S.  Bancorp's lending activity is  with customers located within
the Pacific  Northwest. An  economic  downturn in  the Pacific  Northwest  would
likely have a negative impact on U. S. Bancorp's results of operations depending
on the severity of the downturn. U. S. Bancorp maintains a diversified portfolio
and  does not have significant on- or off-balance sheet concentrations of credit
risk in any one industry.

16. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments
    The  following  disclosure  of  the   estimated  fair  value  of   financial
instruments  is  made  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards  No.  107,  "Disclosures  About  Fair  Value  of
Financial  Instruments". The estimated  fair value amounts  have been determined
using available market

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)
information  and  appropriate  valuation  methodologies.  However,  considerable
judgment  is  necessarily  required  to interpret  market  data  to  develop the
estimates of fair  value. Accordingly,  the estimates presented  herein are  not
necessarily  indicative of the amounts U. S.  Bancorp could realize in a current
market exchange.  The  use of  different  market assumptions  and/or  estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

    The  following methods and assumptions were  used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments  for which it is practicable to  estimate
that value. Potential tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized
gains and losses that would be incurred in an actual sale and/or settlement have
not been taken into consideration.

    CASH  AND  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.   For  these short-term  instruments, the
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

    SECURITIES AND  EQUITY  INVESTMENTS.    For  securities  held  to  maturity,
available  for sale,  or for trading  purposes, fair value  equals quoted market
price or dealer quotes. If quoted market  price is not available, fair value  is
estimated   using  quoted  market  prices   for  similar  securities  with  like
maturities, interest rate and type.

    The fair value of $44 million and $27 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, of various investments  in limited partnership equity  investments
was  not available through market sources,  and was not practicable to estimate.
In such cases, fair value indicated was equal to carrying value.

    LOANS.   Fair values  are estimated  for portfolios  of loans  with  similar
financial  characteristics. Loans  are segregated  by type,  such as commercial,
real estate, including residential mortgage,  consumer and bank card. Each  loan
category  is  further  segregated by  fixed  and variable  rate,  performing and
nonperforming categories. For variable  rate loans, carrying value  approximates
fair  value.  Fair  value  of  fixed rate  loans  is  calculated  by discounting
contractual cash flows.

    For performing fixed rate  loans, the discount rate  is estimated using  the
rates  currently offered for loans of  similar characteristics which reflect the
credit and interest  rate risk inherent  in the loan.  Performing loans  include
certain  loans that are internally classified largely due to weakening financial
strength of the borrowers or concern about specific industries. These loans have
been specifically provided  for in  the allowance  for credit  losses. The  fair
value of these loans is shown net of this allocated allowance. Consumer and bank
card  loans have no allocated allowance since they are charged-off upon becoming
90 and 180 days past due, respectively. The fair value of performing fixed  rate
loans,  except for performing residential mortgage  loans and consumer loans, is
calculated by  discounting contractual  cash flows.  For performing  residential
mortgage  and consumer loans, fair value is estimated by discounting contractual
cash flows adjusted  for prepayment  estimates. Acceleration of  the payment  of
principal  is based on the  monthly cash flow yield  as compared to the discount
rate. The  prepayment estimates  are  based upon  internal historical  data  for
consumer  loans, and  market prepayment  history for  mortgage-backed securities
with similar characteristics for real estate mortgage loans.

    Loans held for sale, primarily residential mortgage loans and student loans,
are carried on  the books  at the lower  of cost  or market. The  fair value  of
mortgage  loans is estimated  for the various loan  portfolios based upon quoted
market prices  for  securities backed  by  similar loans.  Commitments  to  sell
residential  mortgages, which  represent agreements  to sell  loans to permanent
investors at a  specific contractual  price or  yield, are  valued using  market
prices  for securities  backed by  similar loans and  are reflected  in the fair
value of the mortgage loans held for sale, to the extent that these  commitments
relate  to mortgage loans already originated. The fair value of student loans is
estimated to be equal to  the carrying value, as these  loans are sold within  a
short time of their origin.

    Fair  value for significant nonperforming loans is primarily based on recent
internal estimates or external appraisals. Fair value for smaller  nonperforming
loans   is   not   readily   available   through   market   sources   as   there

                                       63

are no quoted market prices. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of
these nonperforming loans because of  the significant cost. These  nonperforming
loans  were  carried on  the balance  sheet at  $23 million  and $35  million at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    The fair value estimate for bank card loans does not include the value  that
relates  to  estimated  cash flows  from  possible future  loans  generated from
existing cardholders over the remaining life of the portfolio.

    DEPOSIT LIABILITIES.  The  fair value of deposits  with no stated  maturity,
such  as noninterest-bearing  deposits, savings and  interest checking accounts,
and money  market accounts,  is equal  to the  amount payable  on demand  as  of
December  31, 1994 and 1993. The fair  value of certificates of deposit is based
on the  discounted  value  of  contractual cash  flows.  The  discount  rate  is
estimated  using the rates  currently offered for  deposits of similar remaining
maturities. The fair value  does not include the  benefit that results from  the
low  cost funding provided  by the deposit  liabilities compared to  the cost of
borrowing funds in the market.

    SHORT- AND  LONG-TERM  DEBT.    For federal  funds  purchased  and  security
repurchase  agreements, commercial paper and other short-term debt, the carrying
amount is a reasonable  estimate of fair value  because of the relatively  short
period  of  time between  the  origination of  the  instrument and  its expected
realization.

    The fair value of medium-term notes and underwritten senior and subordinated
debt is calculated based on the discounted value of the contractual cash  flows.
The  discount rate used is the result of the implied treasury forward rates plus
a risk premium. The risk premium was the difference between the rates  currently
offered for newly issued notes and the treasury yield curve at December 31, 1994
and 1993.

    ACCEPTANCES  AND  OTHER  ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES.   The  carrying  amount of
financial instruments in these classifications is a reasonable estimate of  fair
value due to their short-term nature. These classifications are not presented in
the table.

    PREFERRED  STOCK.  The fair value of  U. S. Bancorp's preferred stock is its
quoted market price.

    OFF-BALANCE  SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.   The amounts shown under carrying
value represent  accruals, deferred  gains or  losses, and  margin  requirements
arising  from the related unrecognized financial instruments. Fair values for U.
S. Bancorp's off-balance  sheet instruments  are based on  quoted market  prices
(futures);  current settlement value (foreign  exchange contracts and forwards);
fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreement  and the counterparties' credit standing  (loan
commitments);  or, if  there are no  relevant comparables, on  pricing models or
formulas using current assumptions (interest rate swaps and options).

    LIMITATIONS.  The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in  time
based  on  relevant  market  information  and  information  about  the financial
instruments. Because  no  market  exists  for a  significant  portion  of  these
financial  instruments, fair  value estimates  are based  on judgments regarding
future   expected   loss   experience,   current   economic   conditions,   risk
characteristics  of  various  financial instruments,  and  other  factors. These
estimates are  subjective in  nature and  involve uncertainties  and matters  of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot  be  determined  with precision.
Changes in assumptions  could significantly affect  the estimates.  Accordingly,
the  estimates presented  herein are  not necessarily  indicative of  what U. S.
Bancorp could realize in a current market exchange. In addition, the fair  value
estimates  are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments
without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and  the
value  of assets and liabilities that  are not considered financial instruments.
U. S. Bancorp  has significant assets  and liabilities that  are not  considered
financial  instruments, and they have not  been incorporated into the fair value
estimates. For  example, U.  S. Bancorp  has not  estimated fair  value for  the
mortgage  banking, bank card,  trust or brokerage  operations. Other significant
assets and liabilities  that are  not considered  financial instruments  include
deferred   tax  liabilities,   premises  and   equipment,  goodwill   and  other
intangibles.

Section 1.1. MEETINGS.  The regular Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of this
Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other
business as properly may come before the meeting shall be held in Portland,
Oregon, or other place duly authorized by the Board of Directors, on the third
Tuesday of April at such time as the Board of Directors may determine.

If for any cause an election of directors is not made on the same day as the
Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors shall order the election to be held on
some subsequent day as soon thereafter as practicable according to the
provisions of law, and notice thereof shall be given in the manner herein
provided for the Annual Meeting.

Business to be conducted at an Annual Meeting (other than procedural matters)
shall be limited to (i) business specified in the notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii)
business otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of
the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board, or (iii) business properly
brought before the meeting by a shareholder of record of any class of capital
stock entitled to vote upon such business, provided that such shareholder shall
first have given written notice, in the time and manner specified for
shareholder notice of nominations for directors set forth in Section 1.2 of
these Bylaws, briefly describing such business and stating his intention to
present such business at the Annual Meeting.

Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Board of Directors,
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice Chairman or the
President.  A special meeting shall be called upon receipt of a written demand
therefor stating the purpose for which the meeting is to be called by any
shareholder or shareholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent of
the stock entitled to vote at such meeting.  It shall be the duty of the
Secretary to send out notices of such meetings to be held in Portland, Oregon,
or other convenient place authorized by the Board of Directors and at such time
as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.  If the Board of Directors shall fail
to fix a time or place, the meeting shall be held at such time as shall be fixed
by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice Chairman,
the President, or the Secretary.  Business conducted at a special meeting (other
than procedural matters) shall be limited to the matters stated in the notice
thereof (or any supplement thereto).

(As amended 8/18/94 - Article V, Section 5.2 Stock Certificates)

Notice of such annual and special meetings shall be mailed postage prepaid not
less than ten nor more than sixty days prior to the date thereof, addressed to
each shareholder of record at his or her address appearing on the books of the
Corporation.

The certificate of the Secretary of this Corporation shall be sufficient proof
of the giving of said notice.

The Board of Directors may adopt rules governing the order of business and
conduct of any shareholders' meeting.  Subject to the effect of any such rules,
the Chairman of the Board (or other officer presiding at a shareholders'
meeting) shall have general authority to determine the order of business and, in
the Chairman's discretion, to regulate the conduct of such meeting.

Section 1.2. NOMINATIONS FOR DIRECTOR.  Nominations for election to the Board of
Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder of record
of any outstanding class of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of
directors.  Nominations, other than those made by or on behalf of the existing
Board of Directors, shall be made in writing and shall be delivered or mailed to
the Chairman of the Board of the Corporation not less than twenty-five days nor
more than sixty days prior to any meeting of shareholders called for the
election of directors, provided, however, that if less than thirty days' notice
of the meeting is given to shareholders, such nominations shall be mailed or
delivered to the Chairman of the Board not later than the close of business on
the fifth day following the day on which the notice of the meeting was mailed.

Section 1.3. DISPUTED Ballots.  In the event a dispute arises regarding the
validity or tabulation of a ballot, vote, or proxy, the chairman of the meeting
may appoint a committee of three directors or other persons who are not
employees of the Corporation to resolve the dispute.  The decision of the
committee shall be final and binding upon all parties to the dispute.

Section 1.4. Proxies.  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote
by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his or her duly authorized
attorney-in-fact.  Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the
Corporation before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after
11 months from the date of its execution unless otherwise expressly provided in
the proxy.

Section 1.5. OUORUM.  MANNER OF ACTING.  Shares entitled to vote as a separate
voting group may take action on a matter only if a quorum of those shares exists
with respect to the matter.  A

<PAGE>

majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of that voting
group for action on that matter.  If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other
than the election of directors, shall be approved by a voting group if the votes
cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing
the action unless the Oregon Business Corporation Act

                              - 2 -

(As amended 8/18/94 - Article V, Section 5.2. Stock Certificates)

or the articles of incorporation require a greater number of affirmative votes.
Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares
entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it shall be deemed
present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any
adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that
adjourned meeting.

Section 2.2. Number.  The Board shall consist of not less than five nor more
than twenty-five persons, the exact number within such minimum and maximum
limits to be fixed and determined from time to time by resolution of a majority
of the full Board; provided, however, that a majority of the full Board of
Directors may not increase the number of directors to a number which exceeds by
more than four the number of directors last elected by shareholders, but in no
event shall the number of directors exceed twenty-five.

Section 2.3. ORGANIZATION MEETING.  The Secretary, upon receiving the returns of
the Judges of Election as aforesaid, shall cause the same to be recorded upon
the minute book of the Corporation and shall notify the directors-elect of their
election.  Promptly after the adjournment of the meeting of the shareholders at
which they were elected, the newly elected Board shall meet at a convenient
place for the purpose of organizing and to transact such business as properly
may come before the Board and no notice of such organization meeting shall be
required.  If at that time there is not a quorum in attendance, the members
present may adjourn from time to time until a quorum is secured.

Section 2.4. REGULAR MEETINGS.  The Board of Directors may establish a schedule
of regular meetings for the transaction of business, the day and hour of which
may be specified by

<PAGE>

resolution adopted in advance of such regular meetings.  In the event of a
failure of the Board of Directors to designate such day and hour, the Chairman
of the Board may designate the day and hour upon which such meeting shall be
held, which shall be specified in the notice of such meeting.

Section 2.5. SPECIAL MEETINGS.  The Board of Directors may also hold special
meetings upon call of any officer who is a member of the Board of Directors, or
any three or more directors.  Notice of special meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be given by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation, or in case of their absence, refusal or inability to act, by any

three or more directors by giving 24 hours' notice to the last known address of
each director.  Calls for such special meetings must state in general terms the
object of the meeting.

Section 2.6. RETIREMENT.  Officer directors may be requested to resign from the
Board upon the date of their retirement as an officer of the Corporation.  Each
other member of the Board of Directors will not be eligible for re-election as a

<PAGE>

          5.2  TARGET AWARD.  For each Participant for each Plan Period, the
Executive Committee shall specify, prior to the beginning of the Plan Period, a
targeted incentive award (the "Target Award").  The Target Award may be
expressed, at the Executive Committee's discretion, as a fixed dollar amount or
as a percentage of a Participant's regular annualized base salary, as in effect
on the last day of the Plan Period.

          5.3  DESIGNATED COMPONENTS.  Awards under the Plan shall be based on
all or some of the following components:

     various Bancorp Operating Groups achieve specified performance levels.

     require a large degree of cooperation and joint involvement of more
     than one Operating Group or Strategic Business Unit.

For each Participant for each Plan Period, the Executive Committee shall
designate which of the Components will determine the Participant's Award for the
Plan Period and shall assign each Designated Component a Component Weighting
Percentage which may be any whole

                                      - 3 -
<PAGE>

number from zero to 100 percent.  The sum of the Component Weighting Percentages
for all the Designated Components for a Participant for a Plan Period shall
equal 100 percent.

          5.4  PARTICIPANT SCHEDULE.  For each Participant for each Plan Period,
the Executive Committee shall cause to be prepared and furnished to the
Participant as close as possible to the beginning of the Plan Period a schedule

     Component;

          (d)  The Participant's modifier goals, if any, and the respective
     Threshold, Target, and Outstanding Performance Levels for each
     modifier goal and a description of the method selected by the
     Executive Committee for combining the performance results for each
     modifier goal into a single Modifier Percentage for the Participant;

          (e)  An explanation (using examples) of how the Weighted
     Component Percentages for the Participant's Designated Components and
     the Modifier Percentage, if any, will be computed and how the
     Participant's Award will be determined.


                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>

          5.5  SUCCESS FACTORS.  Prior to the beginning of each Plan Period, the
Executive Committee shall determine a success factor or a combination of success
factors (generally not more than four) for each Component.  For each such
success factor, the Executive Committee shall specify a Threshold Performance
Level, a Target Performance Level, and an Outstanding Performance Level.  If the
Executive Committee selects two or more success factors for a particular
Component, the Executive Committee shall also specify a method of combining the
results of the separate success factors into a single Component Performance
Percentage.

          5.6  MODIFIER GOALS.  Prior to the beginning of each Plan Period, the
Executive Committee may determine for any Participant a modifier goal or a
combination of modifier goals to measure the performance of the Participant.
For each modifier goal, the Executive Committee shall specify a Threshold
Performance Level, a Target Performance Level, and an Outstanding Performance
Level.  If the Executive Committee selects two or more modifier goals for a
Participant, the Executive Committee shall also specify a method of combining
the results of the separate modifier goals into a single Modifier Percentage.

          5.7  PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGES.  As soon as possible after the
completion of each Plan Period, the Executive Committee shall determine:

          (a)  For each Component, a Component Performance Percentage
representing the degree to which success factors for that Component were
achieved; and

          (b)  For each Participant:

               (i)  The aggregate of the Weighted Component
          Percentages for the Participant's Designated Components for
          the Plan Period; and

                                      - 5 -
<PAGE>

               (ii)  A Modifier Percentage representing the degree to
          which any modifier goals for that Participant were achieved.

          5.7.1  COMPONENT PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE.  For each Component, based on
the level of achievement for each success factor, the Executive Committee shall
determine a Component Performance Percentage ranging from:

          -  0 percent, for performance below the specified Threshold
     Performance Level;

          -  A minimum value (not less than 50 percent), for performance
     equal to the specified Threshold Performance Level; through

          -  100 percent, for performance equal to the specified Target
     Performance Level; to

          -  A maximum value (not more than 150 percent), for performance
     equal to or greater than the specified Outstanding Performance Level.

If two or more success factors are specified for a Component, the Executive
Committee shall use the method specified pursuant to Section 5.5 for that
Component for that Plan Period to combine results into a single Component
Performance Percentage.

          5.7.2  WEIGHTED COMPONENT PERCENTAGES.  For each Designated Component
for each Participant, the Executive Committee shall compute a Weighted Component
Percentage equal to the Component Performance Percentage multiplied by the
Component Weighting Percentage designated for that Component.

          5.7.3  MODIFIER PERCENTAGES.  For each Participant for whom one or
more modifier goals are designated, the Executive Committee shall determine the
level of achievement with respect to each modifier goal specified for that
Participant.  Based on the


                                      - 6 -
<PAGE>

level of achievement for each modifier goal, the Executive Committee shall
determine a Modifier Percentage for each Participant ranging from:

          -  A minimum value (not less than 75 percent), for performance
     equal to or below the specified Threshold Performance Level; through

          -  100 percent, for performance equal to the specified Target
     Performance Level; to

          -  A maximum value (not more than 125 percent), for performance
     equal to or greater than the specified Outstanding Performance Level.
If two or more modifier goals are specified for a Participant, the Executive
Committee shall use the method specified pursuant to Section 5.6 for that Plan
Period to combine results into a single Modifier Percentage.

          5.7.4  DETERMINING PERFORMANCE LEVELS.  In determining the level of
achievement of success factors for any Component and of modifier goals for any
Participant, the Executive Committee may, in its sole discretion, take into
consideration developments, changes in circumstances, and nonrecurring and
extraordinary events that were not foreseen at the beginning of the Plan Period.

          5.8  CALCULATION OF AWARD.  The Executive Committee shall determine
the Award for each Participant for a Plan Period no later than three months
after the end of the Plan Period.  If a Participant's job position changes
during the Plan Period, the Executive Committee may increase or decrease the
amount of a Participant's Award to reflect the change.  Although Awards
generally shall be based on the procedures specified in this Article V, the
Executive Committee may adjust any Participant's Award to reflect additional or
extraordinary performance factors that, in the judgment of the Executive
Committee,


                                      - 7 -
<PAGE>

should be considered in the overall performance of the Participant and the
Participant's Operating Group and Strategic Business Unit or Strategic Support
Unit for the Plan Period.

          5.9  RIGHT TO RECEIVE AWARD.  A Participant must continue employment
with a Sponsoring Employer until the end of a Plan Period in order to be
entitled to receive an Award for that Plan Period in accordance with the terms
of the Plan.  If a Participant's employment with the Sponsoring Employers is
terminated before the end of the Plan Period for a reason other than death,
disability, Position Termination, or retirement, the Participant shall not be
entitled to any Award for that Plan Period.  If a Participant's employment with
the Sponsoring Employers is terminated before the end of the Plan Period due to
death, disability, Position Termination, or retirement, the Executive Committee

          9.2.1  TIME PERIOD FOR DENIAL NOTICE.  A decision shall be made on the
claim as soon as practicable and shall be communicated in writing by the Manager

extension of time for processing.  If there is an extension, the Claimant shall
be notified of the extension within 90 days of the date the claim was filed.
The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances and the date by
which a decision is expected.  The extension shall not exceed 90 days from the
end of the initial response period.

denied, the notice of denial shall indicate:

          (a)  The specific reasons for the denial;

          (b)  The specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on
     which the denial is based;

<PAGE>

denied as of the end of the 90-day or 180-day period for purposes of proceeding
to the review stage described in 9.3 and 9.4, below.

          9.3  REVIEW OF DENIED CLAIM.  If a Claimant receives a notice of
denial or, if the claim is deemed denied pursuant to 9.2 above, the Claimant may
request a review of the claim.  The request for review is made by personally
delivering or mailing a written request for review, prepared by either the
Claimant or an authorized representative, to the Executive Committee.  The
Claimant's request for review must be made within a reasonable period of time,
taking into consideration the nature of the benefit that is the subject of the
claim and other attendant circumstances.  In no event shall the period for
requesting review expire less than 60 days after receipt of the notice of denial
or the date on which the claim is deemed denied if no notice is received.  If
the written request for review is not made in a timely manner, the Claimant
shall be deemed to have waived the right to review.  The Claimant or a duly

Executive Committee after receipt of a timely filed request for review.  A
decision on review shall be made and furnished in writing to the Claimant.  The

the Claimant not later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review.
If an extension is required, the Claimant shall be notified of the extension
within 60 days after the request for review was filed.  The written decision
shall include the reasons for the decision with reference to the provisions of
the Plan upon which the decision is based.  The

<PAGE>

decision shall be final and binding upon the Claimant and the Sponsoring
Employers and all other persons involved.  If the decision on review is not
furnished within the applicable time period, the claim shall be deemed denied on
review.

          The scope of any subsequent review of the benefit claim, judicial or
otherwise, shall be limited to a determination as to whether the Executive
Committee acted arbitrarily or capriciously in the exercise of its discretion.
In no event shall any such further review be on a de novo basis because the
Executive Committee has discretionary authority to determine eligibility for
benefits and to construe the terms of this Plan.

                                    ARTICLE X

                              (Three-Year Benefit)

Mr. Gerry B. Cameron
Vice Chairman
U. S. Bancorp
111 S.W. Fifth Avenue, T-31
Portland, Oregon  97204

Dear Mr. Cameron:

          U. S. Bancorp (which, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is
referred to as "Bancorp") considers the establishment and maintenance of its key
management group to be essential to the best interests of Bancorp and its
shareholders.  Bancorp recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly-held
corporations, the possibility of a change in control may arise and that the
attendant uncertainty may result in the departure or distraction of key
management personnel to the detriment of Bancorp and its shareholders.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors of Bancorp (the "Board") has determined that
appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued
attention and dedication of key members of Bancorp's management without
distraction from the possibility of a change in control of Bancorp.  The Board
believes it important that, in the event of a proposal for transfer of control
of Bancorp, you be able to assess the proposal and advise the Board without
being influenced by the uncertainties of your own situation.  The Board also
considers Bancorp's management one of Bancorp's most valuable assets and wishes
to take appropriate steps to preserve the management group through the
uncertainties which may attend any potential transaction involving a change in
control.

          In order to induce you to remain in the employ of Bancorp, this letter
Agreement, which has been approved by the Board, sets forth the severance
compensation which Bancorp agrees will be provided to you in the event your
employment with Bancorp is terminated subsequent to a "Change In Control" of
Bancorp under the circumstances described below.

          1.  DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
will have the meanings set forth in this Section 1.

          "AGREEMENT" - This letter agreement, including any extensions of the
term of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.

subsidiaries.

         "BANCORP SHARES" - Shares of the $5 par value common stock of Bancorp.

not on an insured basis) providing medical, dental, health, disability income,
life insurance or other death benefits, or similar types of benefits to
employees of Bancorp.  Benefit Plan does not include any plan or arrangement
providing for vacation pay, bonuses or incentive compensation of any kind, or
current or deferred salary or similar compensation.

         "BOARD" - The Bancorp board of directors.

         "CAUSE" - Cause for termination shall mean commission of an act of
fraud, embezzlement, or theft constituting a felony or commission of an act (or
failure to take an action) intentionally against the interest of Bancorp which
causes Bancorp material injury.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than two-thirds of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of
the Board called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to you and an
opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard before the Board),
finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct
constituting Cause as defined in this Agreement and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.  The foregoing provisions shall not restrict the authority,
discretion, or power of the Board, by any action taken in compliance with
Bancorp's articles of incorporation and bylaws, to terminate your employment
with or without Cause.  Rather, the foregoing provisions merely define, for
purposes of your contractual rights and remedies under this Agreement, the
circumstances in which termination of your employment will constitute
termination for Cause.

         "CHANGE IN CONTROL" - A change in control of Bancorp shall mean:

    (a)  A change in control of a nature that would be required to be reported
in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A as in effect on the

liquidation or dissolution of Bancorp.

other reason, the date on which a Notice of Termination is given; provided that

    or position or positions as in effect immediately prior to the Change in
    Control, or a change in your duties or responsibilities which, in your
    reasonable judgment, is inconsistent with such status or position or
    positions, or any removal of you from or any failure to reappoint or reelect
    you to such position or positions, except in connection with the termination
    of your employment for Cause or Disability or as a result of your death or
    the termination by you other than for Good Reason;

    in the future under any of such Plans or deprive you of any material benefit
    enjoyed by you at the time of the Change in Control;

         (d)  the failure by Bancorp to provide and credit you with the number
    of paid vacation days to which you are then entitled in accordance with
    Bancorp's normal vacation policy as in effect immediately prior to the
    Change in Control;

         (e)  Bancorp's requiring you to be based anywhere more than 35 miles
    from where your office is located immediately prior to the Change in Control
    except for required travel on Bancorp's business to an extent substantially
    consistent with the business travel obligations which you undertook on
    behalf of Bancorp prior to the Change in Control;

         (f)  the failure by Bancorp to obtain from any successor the assent to
    this Agreement contemplated by subsection 6(a) hereof;

    not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements
    of this Agreement; and for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported
    termination shall be effective; or

         (h)  any refusal by Bancorp to continue to allow you to attend to

Control, the provisions of this Agreement regarding the payment of Severance
Payments shall apply.

         (b)  CONTINUATION OF SERVICES SUBSEQUENT TO CERTAIN OFFERS.  In the
    event a tender offer or exchange offer is made by a Person for more than
    30 percent of Bancorp's Voting Securities, you agree that you will not
    leave the employ of Bancorp (other than as a result of Disability) and
    will render services to Bancorp in the capacity in which you then serve
    until such tender offer or exchange offer has been abandoned or
    terminated or a Change in Control has occurred.  In the event that,
    during the period you are obligated to continue in the employ of Bancorp
    pursuant to this subsection 2(b), Bancorp reduces your compensation,
    your obligations under this subsection 2(b) shall terminate.

         (c)  TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.  Bancorp may terminate your employment
    for Cause whether or not a Change in Control has occurred.

         (d)  CONFIDENTIALITY.  You acknowledge that (i) by reason of the
    capacity in which you have been employed, you have financial information
    regarding Bancorp which has not been publicly disclosed and which is
    confidential to Bancorp, and (ii) disclosure of such financial
    information could cause irreparable harm to Bancorp.  You agree that you
    will not disclose, without prior written consent of Bancorp, any
    financial or other confidential business information regarding Bancorp
    which has not been publicly disclosed by Bancorp.


         3.  TERM OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall commence on the date
hereof and shall continue in effect until December 31, 1993; provided, however,
that commencing on January 1, 1994, and each January 1 thereafter, the term of
this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless at
least 90 days prior to such January 1, Bancorp or you shall have given notice
that this Agreement shall not be extended; and provided, further, that if a
Change in Control shall occur while this Agreement is in effect, the term of
this Agreement shall automatically be extended for a period of 3 calendar years
beyond the calendar year in which such Change in Control occurs.  Except as
provided in subsection 2(a) of this Agreement, this Agreement

Mr. Gerry B. Cameron                  - 8 -                        June 23, 1993

shall terminate if you or Bancorp terminate your employment prior to a Change in
Control.

         4.  TERMINATION FOLLOWING CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event that your
employment with Bancorp is terminated, whether by you or by Bancorp, within
3 years from the date of occurrence of any event constituting a Change in
Control (it being recognized that more than one such event may occur in which
case the 3-year period shall run from the date of occurrence of each such
event), you shall be entitled to the following respective benefits:

         (a)  DISABILITY.  During any period that you are unable to perform your
    duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental
    illness, you shall continue to receive your full base salary at the rate
    then in effect until your employment with Bancorp is terminated by Bancorp
    for Disability.  Thereafter, your benefits shall be determined in accordance
    with Bancorp's Disability Income Program.  If Bancorp's Disability Income
    Program is modified or terminated following a Change in Control, Bancorp
    shall substitute another plan or program with benefits applicable to you
    substantially similar to those provided by the Disability Income Program
    prior to its modification or termination.

         (b)  TERMINATION UPON DEATH.  In the event of your death while an
    employee of Bancorp, Bancorp shall pay to your representative your full base
    salary through the date of your death at the rate in effect on the date of
    the Change in Control, together with all benefits, including death benefits,
    to which you are then entitled under Plans in which you are a participant,
    and Bancorp shall have no further obligations to you under this Agreement.

         (c)  TERMINATION FOR CAUSE OR WITHOUT GOOD REASON.  If your employment
    is terminated by Bancorp for Cause, or by you other than for Good Reason,
    Bancorp shall pay you your full base salary through the Date of Termination
    at the rate in effect on the date the Change in Control occurs, together
    with all benefits to which you are then entitled under Plans in which you
    are a participant, and Bancorp shall have no further obligations to you
    under this Agreement.

         (d)  TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE OR WITH GOOD REASON.  If your employment
    with Bancorp is terminated (other than

    for Disability or upon your death) by Bancorp without Cause or by you with
    Good Reason, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7 and 12,
    Bancorp shall pay you, upon demand, the following amounts ("Severance
    Payments"):

              (i)  your full base salary through the Date of
         Termination at the rate in effect on the date the Change in
         Control occurs;

              (ii)  in lieu of any further salary payments to you for
         periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, an amount of
         severance pay equal to three times the sum of (A) your annual
         base salary, at the rate in effect on the date the Change in
         Control occurs, plus (B) the average annual incentive
         compensation (if any) paid to you or accrued to your benefit
         (prior to any deferrals) in respect of the two fiscal years
         last ended prior to the fiscal year in which the Change in
         Control occurs;

              (iii)  all legal fees and expenses incurred by you as a
         result of such termination (including all such fees and
         expenses, if any, incurred in contesting or disputing any such
         termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or
         benefit provided by this Agreement); and

              (iv)  reimbursement in full of all reasonable amounts
         paid or incurred by you for outplacement services in
         connection with obtaining other employment.

    The amount of Severance Payments otherwise payable pursuant to this
    Agreement shall be reduced by (A) amounts payable to you pursuant to
    Bancorp's Severance Benefits Plan or any successor plan providing
    severance benefits to Bancorp employees and (B) amounts payable to you
    (after any adjustment or reduction to reflect payments described in clause
    (A)) as salary continuation and incentive compensation pursuant to any
    employment agreement between you and Bancorp which is in effect as of the
    Date of Termination.  The payments provided for in this paragraph shall be
    made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination;
    provided, however, that if the amounts of such payments

<PAGE>
Mr. Gerry B. Cameron                 - 10 -                        June 23, 1993

    cannot be finally determined on or before such day, Bancorp shall pay to you
    on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by Bancorp, of the
    minimum amount of such payments, and shall pay the remainder of such
    payments (together with interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum) as
    soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event later than the
    30th day after the Date of Termination.  In the event that the amount of the
    estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been
    due, such excess shall constitute a loan by Bancorp to you, payable on the
    fifth day after demand by Bancorp (together with interest at the rate of
    10 percent per annum).

         (e)  RELATED BENEFITS.  Unless you die or your employment is terminated
    by Bancorp for Cause or Disability, or by you other than for Good Reason,
    Bancorp shall maintain in full force and effect, for the continued benefit\
    of you for three years after the Date of Termination, all Benefit Plans in
    which you were entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of
    Termination, provided that your continued participation is possible under
    the general terms and provisions of such Benefit Plans; provided, however,
    that if you become eligible to participate in a benefit plan, program, or
    arrangement of another employer which confers benefits upon you
    substantially similar to those provided by one or more Benefit Plans, you
    shall cease to receive benefits under this subparagraph in respect of such
    Benefit Plan or Plans.  In the event that your participation in any Benefit
    Plan is barred by the provisions of such Benefit Plan, Bancorp shall arrange
    to provide you with benefits substantially similar to those which you are
    entitled to receive under such Benefit Plan.

         (f)  NO MITIGATION.  You shall not be required to mitigate the amount
    of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or
    otherwise, nor, except as expressly set forth in subsection 4(e), shall the
    amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 be reduced by any
    compensation earned by you as the result of employment by another employer
    after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.

         5.  NOTICE.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other
    communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall
    be deemed to have been duly given when

<PAGE>
Mr. Gerry B. Cameron                 - 11 -                        June 23, 1993

delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses set forth on the first
page of this Agreement, or to such other address as either party may have
furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of
change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

         6.  SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

         (a)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
    upon, any corporate or other successor or assignee of Bancorp which
    shall acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation or
    purchase, or otherwise, all or substantially all of the business or
    assets of Bancorp.  Bancorp shall require any such successor, by an
    agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you,
    expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
    manner and to the same extent as Bancorp would be required to perform if
    no such succession had taken place.

         (b)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
    enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors,
    administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.
    If you should die while any amount would still be payable to you
    hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
    otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of
    this Agreement to your devisee, legatee, or other designee or, if there
    is no such designee, to your estate.

         7.  REDUCTION IN SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO AVOID EXCESS PARACHUTE TAX
PAYMENTS.

         (a)  REDUCTION.  In the event that any portion of the Total
    Payments received by you in connection with a Change in Control of
    Bancorp would not be deductible, in whole or in part, for federal income
    tax purposes as a result of Section 280G of the Code, the Severance
    Payments otherwise payable under this Agreement shall be reduced until
    (i) no portion of the Total Payments is not deductible pursuant to
    Section 280G of the Code or (ii) the Severance Payments are reduced to
    zero.

         (b)  APPLICATION.  For purposes of this limitation:

<PAGE>
Mr. Gerry B. Cameron                 - 12 -                        June 23, 1993

              (i)  No portion of the Total Payments, the receipts or
         enjoyment of which you have effectively waived in writing
         prior to the date of payment of the Severance Payments, shall
         be taken into account;

              (ii)  No portion of the Total Payments shall be taken
         into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel selected by
         Bancorp and reasonably acceptable to you ("Tax Counsel"), does
         not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
         Section 280G of the Code;

              (iii)  The Severance Payments shall be reduced only to
         the extent necessary so that the Total Payments (other than
         those referred to in paragraphs (b)(i) and (ii) above) in
         their entirety constitute, in the opinion of Tax Counsel,
         reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within
         the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code; and

              (iv)  The value of any noncash benefit or any deferred
         payment or benefit included in the Total Payments, and whether
         or not all or a portion of any payment or benefit is a
         "parachute payment" for purposes of paragraph (b)(ii) above,
         shall be determined by Bancorp's independent accountants in
         accordance with the principles of Section 280(G)(d)(3) and (4)
         of the Code.

         (c)  EFFECT ON OTHER AGREEMENTS.  In the event that any Other Agreement
    has a provision that requires a reduction in the Other Payment governed by
    such Other Agreement to avoid or eliminate an "excess parachute payment" for
    purposes of Section 280G of the Code, the reduction in Severance Payments
    pursuant to this Section 7 shall be given effect before any reduction in the
    Other Payment pursuant to the Other Agreement.  To the extent possible,
    Bancorp and you agree that reductions in benefits under any Bancorp Plan
    shall be reduced (only to the extent necessary to avoid a nondeductible
    excess parachute payment) in the following order of priority:

Mr. Gerry B. Cameron                 - 13 -                        June 23, 1993

              (i)  Severance Payments under this Agreement;

              (ii)  Benefit Plan benefit continuation;

              (iii)  Any benefit payable under Bancorp's Supplement
         Benefits Plan or a successor plan or a plan providing similar
         benefits; and

              (iv)  The acceleration in the exercisability of any stock
         option or other stock related award granted by Bancorp.

         8.  MISCELLANEOUS.  No provision of this Agreement may be modified,
waived, or discharged unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed
to in a writing signed by you and the Chairman of the Board or President of
Bancorp.  No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the
other party hereto of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this
Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same, or at any prior or
subsequent, time.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express
or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either
party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The validity,
interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Oregon.

         9.  VALIDITY.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

         10.  PAYMENTS DURING CONTROVERSY.  Notwithstanding the pendency of any
dispute or controversy, Bancorp will continue to pay you your full compensation
in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but
not limited to, base salary and installments of incentive compensation) and
continue you as a participant in all Plans in which you were participating when
the notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until the dispute is finally
resolved in accordance with the procedure described in Section 1 in connection
with the definition of "Date of Termination."  Amounts paid under this section
are in addition to all other amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be
offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.  You shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of your right to be paid until the Date
of

Termination during the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or
in connection with this Agreement.

         11.  WITHHOLDING.  Bancorp shall withhold from any payment of Severance
Payments or any other benefits under this Agreement all federal, state, and
local taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation
or ruling.

         12.  REGULATORY LIMITATIONS.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Bancorp shall have no obligation to make any payments to you
pursuant to Section 4 of  this Agreement if, or to the extent, such payments are
prohibited by any applicable law or regulation, including without limitation the
FDIC's regulations regarding Golden Parachute and Indemnification Payments
promulgated under the Comprehensive Thrift and Bank Fraud Prosecution and
Taxpayer Recovery Act of 1990.

         13.  EARLIER AGREEMENT SUPERSEDED.  This Agreement replaces and
completely supersedes the Change in Control Agreement (Two-Year Benefit) between
you and Bancorp dated April 16, 1992.

         If this letter correctly sets forth our agreement on the subject matter
hereof, kindly sign and return to Bancorp the enclosed copy of this letter,
which will then constitute our agreement on this subject.

                                  Sincerely,

                                  U. S. BANCORP

          1.1  ESTABLISHMENT; RESTATEMENT.  U. S. Bancorp, an Oregon corporation
("Bancorp"), established the U. S. Bancorp 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (the
"Plan") effective as of October 21, 1993, amended and restated the Plan
effective February 17, 1994, and further amended and restated the Plan in the
present form effective November 17, 1994, subject to shareholder approval as
provided in Article 17.

          1.2  PURPOSE.  The purpose of the Plan is to promote and advance the
interests of Bancorp and its shareholders by enabling Bancorp to attract,
retain, and reward key employees of Bancorp and its Subsidiaries.  It is also
intended to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such employees and
Bancorp's shareholders.  The Plan is designed to serve these purposes by
offering stock options and other equity-based incentive awards, thereby
providing a proprietary interest in pursuing the long-term growth,
profitability, and financial success of Bancorp.

          1.3  OTHER OPTION PLANS.  The Plan shall be separate from the
following existing plans (the "Prior Plans"):

          U. S. Bancorp 1973 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the "1973
     Plan")

          U. S. Bancorp 1984 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1984 Plan")

          U. S. Bancorp 1985 Stock Option and SAR Plan (the "1985 Plan")

The Plan shall neither affect the operation of the Prior Plans nor be affected
by the Prior Plans, except as follows:

          (a)  No further stock options will be granted under any of the
     Prior Plans after the date the Plan is approved by Bancorp's
     shareholders as described in Article 17; and

          (b)  The number of Shares which may be made subject to Awards
     under the Plan shall be adjusted, pursuant to Section 4.2, to reflect
     cancellation or expiration of options previously granted under the
     Prior Plans.

          (e)  Other Stock-Based Awards or combination awards governed by
      Article 11 of the Plan.

In the discretion of the Committee, any Award may be granted alone, in addition
to, or in tandem with other Awards under the Plan.

          6.2  GENERAL.  Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee
may cause Bancorp to grant Awards to such Participants, at such times, of such
types, in such amounts, for such periods, with such option prices, purchase
prices, or base prices, and subject to such terms, conditions, limitations, and
restrictions as the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem appropriate.
Awards may be granted as additional compensation to a Participant or in lieu of
other compensation to such Participant.  A Participant may receive more than one
Award and more than one type of Award under the Plan.

          6.3  NONUNIFORM DETERMINATIONS.  The Committee's determinations under
the Plan or under one or more Award Agreements, including without limitation,
(a) the selection of Participants to receive Awards, (b) the type, form, amount,
and timing of Awards, (c) the terms of specific Award Agreements, and (d)
elections and determinations made by the Committee with respect to exercise or
payments of Awards, need not be uniform and may be made by the Committee
selectively among Participants and Awards, whether or not Participants are
similarly situated.

          6.4  AWARD AGREEMENTS.  Each Award shall be evidenced by a written
Award Agreement between Bancorp and the Participant.  Award Agreements may,
subject to the provisions of the Plan, contain any provision approved by the
Committee.

          6.5  PROVISIONS GOVERNING ALL AWARDS.  All Awards shall be subject to
the following provisions:

          (a)  ALTERNATIVE AWARDS.  If any Awards are designated in their
       Award Agreements as alternative to each other, the exercise of all
       or part of one Award automatically shall cause an immediate equal
       (or pro rata) corresponding termination of the other alternative
       Award or Awards.

          (b)  RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDERS.  No Participant shall have any
       rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to an Award
       until such Shares are issued in the name of the Participant.

          (c)  EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.  Neither the adoption of the Plan nor
       the granting of any Award shall confer on any person the right to
       continued employment with Bancorp or any Subsidiary, nor shall it
       interfere in any way with the right of Bancorp or a Subsidiary to
       terminate such person's employment at any time for any reason,
       with or without cause.

          (d)  NONTRANSFERABLE.  Each Award (other than Shares after they
       Vest) shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws
       of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable (if exercise
       is required) during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the
       Participant or, in the event the Participant becomes legally
       incompetent, by the Participant's guardian or legal
       representative.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Awards may be
                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>
       surrendered to Bancorp pursuant to Section 6.5(h) in connection with the
       payment of the purchase or option price of another Award.

          (e)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  The terms and conditions under
       which an Award may be exercised, if at all, after a Participant's
       termination of employment shall be determined by the Committee and
       specified in the applicable Award Agreement.

          (f)  PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE AND WITHHOLDING.  The Committee,
       in its discretion, may include in any Award Agreement a provision
       permitting the Participant to pay the purchase or option price, if
       any, for the Shares or other property issuable pursuant to the
       Award, or the Participant's federal, state, or local tax, or tax
       withholding, obligation with respect to such issuance in whole or
       in part by any one or more of the following:

               (i)  By delivering previously owned Shares (including
          Restricted Shares or Performance Shares, whether or not
          Vested);

               (ii)  By surrendering other outstanding Vested Awards
          under the Plan denominated in Shares or in Share equivalent
          units;

               (iii)  By reducing the number of Shares or other
          property otherwise Vested and issuable pursuant to the
          Award;

               (iv)  By delivering to Bancorp a promissory note
          payable on such terms and over such period as the Committee
          shall determine;

               (v)  By delivery (in a form satisfactory to the
          Committee) of an irrevocable direction to a securities
          broker acceptable to the Committee:

                    (A)  To sell Shares subject to the Award and
               to deliver all or a part of the sales proceeds to
               Bancorp in payment of all or a part of the option
               price and taxes or withholding taxes attributable
               to the issuance; or

                    (B)  To pledge Shares subject to the Award to
               the broker as security for a loan and to deliver
               all or a part of the loan proceeds to Bancorp in
               payment of all or a part of the option
                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>
               price and taxes or withholding taxes attributable to the
               issuance; or

               (vi)  In any combination of the foregoing or in any
          other form approved by the Committee.

       If Restricted Shares or Performance Shares are surrendered in full
       or partial payment of the purchase or option price of Shares
       issuable under an Award, a corresponding number of the Shares
       issued upon exercise of the Award shall be Restricted Shares or
       Performance Shares subject to the same Restrictions as the
       surrendered Restricted Shares or Performance Shares.  Shares
       withheld or surrendered as described above shall be valued based
       on their Fair Market Value on the date of the transaction.  Any
       Shares withheld or surrendered with respect to a Reporting Person
       shall be subject to such additional conditions and limitations as
       the Committee may impose to comply with the requirements of the
       Exchange Act.

                    (g)  REPORTING PERSONS.  With respect to all
               Awards granted to Reporting Persons:

                         (i)  Options (or other Awards
                    requiring exercise) shall not be
                    exercisable until at least six months
                    after the date the Award was granted,
                    except in the case of the death or
                    Disability of the Participant; and

                         (ii)  Shares issued pursuant to any
                    Award (other than Options or other
                    Awards requiring exercise) may not be
                    sold by the Participant for at least six
                    months after acquisition, except in the
                    case of the death or Disability of the
                    Participant;

               provided, however, that (unless an Award Agreement
               expressly provides otherwise) the limitation of
               this Section 6.5(g) shall apply only if or to the
               extent required by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
               Act.  Award Agreements for Awards to Reporting
               Persons shall also comply with any future
               restrictions imposed by such Rule 16b-3.

                    (h)  SERVICE PERIODS.  At the time of
               granting Awards, the Committee may specify, by
               resolution or in the Award Agreement, the period
               or periods of service performed or to be performed
               by the Participant in connection with the grant of
               the Award.

                    (i)  CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS.  Each
               Award Agreement with respect to an Award granted
               after November 17, 1994, shall include a provision
               that as of a Change in Control Date:

                              (A)  An Option or other
                         Award requiring exercise shall
                         become fully and immediately
                         exercisable, notwithstanding
                         any other limitations on
                         exercise;

                              (B)  An Award subject to
                         Restrictions shall become
                         fully Vested; or

                              (C)  A Performance Share
                         or other Award subject to
                         Performance Goals (other than
                         an Option Award where the
                         exercisability of the Option
                         is wholly or partially based
                         on attaining Performance
                         Goals, which shall be governed
                         by paragraph A above) shall be
                         deemed to have been earned to
                         the extent of the greater of:

                                   (1)  A number
                              of Shares determined
                              by the Committee
                              based on the extent
                              to which the
                              Performance Goals
                              specified in the
                              Award Agreement have
                              been achieved during
                              the portion of the
                              Performance Cycle
                              ending on the last
                              day of the last
                              fiscal quarter of
                              Bancorp ending on or
                              before the Change in
                              Control Date; or

                                   (2)  A pro rata
                              number of Shares
                              equal to the product
                              of the Target Shares
                              identified in the
                              Award Agreement
                              multiplied by a
                              fraction with a
                              numerator equal to
                              the whole number of
                              calendar months
                              beginning on or
                              after the Grant Date
                              and ending on or
                              before the Change in
                              Control Date and a
                              denominator equal to
                              the number of
                              calendar months in

                              Award Agreement.

               Each Award Agreement with respect to outstanding
               Option Awards (other than Option Awards where the
               exercisability of the Option can be accelerated
               based on attaining Performance Goals) granted
               before November 17, 1994,

<PAGE>
               shall be amended to include similar Change in Control provisions.
               However, each Award Agreement that includes a Change in Control
               provision shall be subject to the following limitation:

                         If the Committee in good faith
                    adopts a resolution that (i) the use of
                    the pooling method of accounting with
                    respect to the Change in Control
                    transaction would be materially
                    beneficial to Bancorp, and (ii) the
                    acceleration of the exercisability,
                    Vesting, or earning of the Award in
                    connection with the Change in Control
                    would have a materially adverse effect
                    on Bancorp's ability to use the pooling
                    method of accounting with respect to the
                    Change in Control, then the Award shall
                    not be accelerated on account of the
                    Change in Control.

               Unless the Committee expressly provides otherwise
               in a specific Award Agreement, an Award shall
               become exercisable, become Vested, or become
               earned as of a Change in Control Date only if, or
               to the extent, such acceleration in the
               exercisability, Vesting, or earning of the Award
               does not result in an "excess parachute payment"
               within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                                     OPTIONS

          7.1  TYPES OF OPTIONS.  Options granted under the Plan may be in the
form of Statutory Options (including Incentive Stock Options) or Nonqualified
Options.  The grant of each Option and the Award Agreement governing each Option
shall identify the Option as an ISO, other Statutory Option, or an NQO.  In the
event the Code is amended to provide for tax-favored forms of Statutory Options
other than or in addition to Incentive Stock Options, the Committee may grant
Options under the Plan meeting the requirements of such forms of Statutory
Options.

          7.2  GENERAL; LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF OPTIONS.  Options shall be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Article 6 and this Article 7
and Award Agreements governing Options shall contain such additional terms and
conditions, not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan, as the
Committee shall deem desirable.  The number of Shares subject to Options granted
under the Plan to any Participant during any five-calendar-year period shall not
exceed 500,000.

          7.3  OPTION PRICE.  Each Award Agreement for Options shall state the
option exercise price per Share of Common Stock purchasable under the Option,
which shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on
the date an Option is granted.

<PAGE>
          7.4  OPTION TERM.  The Award Agreement for each Option shall specify
the term, which shall not exceed 10 years from the date of grant, during which
the Option may be exercised, as determined by the Committee.

          7.5  TIME OF EXERCISE.  The Award Agreement for each Option shall
specify, as determined by the Committee:

          (a)  The time or times when the Option shall become exercisable
       and whether the Option shall become exercisable in full or in
       graduated amounts based on: (i) continuation of employment over a
       period specified in the Award Agreement, (ii) satisfaction of
       performance goals or criteria specified in the Award Agreement, or
       (iii) a combination of continuation of employment and satisfaction
       of performance goals or criteria;

          (b)  Such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as to when
       the Option may be exercised as shall be determined by the
       Committee; and

          (c)  The extent, if any, that the Option shall remain
       exercisable after the Participant ceases to be an employee of
       Bancorp or a Subsidiary.

An Award Agreement for an Option may, in the discretion of the Committee,
provide whether, and to what extent, the time when an Option becomes exercisable
shall be accelerated or otherwise modified in the event of the death,
Disability, or Retirement of the Participant.  The Committee may, at any time in
its discretion, accelerate the time when all or any portion of an outstanding
Option becomes exercisable.

          7.6  SPECIAL RULES FOR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.  In the case of an
Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option, the terms of the Option and the
Award Agreement shall conform with the statutory and regulatory requirements
specified pursuant to Section 422 of the Code, as in effect on the date such ISO
is granted.  ISOs may be granted only to employees of Bancorp or a Subsidiary.
ISOs may not be granted under the Plan after ten years following the date
specified in Section 4.1, unless the ten-year limitation of Section 422(b)(2) of
the Code is removed or extended.

          7.7  RESTRICTED SHARES.  In the discretion of the Committee, the Award
Agreement for an Option may provide that the Shares issuable upon exercise of an
Option shall be Restricted Shares, subject to Restrictions specified in the
Award Agreement.

          7.8  RELOAD OPTIONS.  The Committee, in its discretion, may provide in
an Award Agreement for an Option that in the event all or a portion of the
Option is exercised by the Participant using previously acquired Shares, the
Participant shall automatically be granted (subject to the available pool of
Shares subject to grants of Awards as specified in Section 4.2 of the Plan) a
replacement Option (with an option price equal to the Fair Market Value of a
Share on the date of such exercise) for a number of Shares equal to (or equal to
a portion of) the number of Shares surrendered upon exercise of the Option.
Such

Reload Option features may be subject to such terms and conditions as the
Committee shall determine, including without limitation, a condition that the
Participant retain the Shares issued upon exercise of the Option for a specified
period of time.

                            STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

          8.1  GENERAL; LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SARS.  Stock Appreciation Rights
or SARs shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Article 6 and
this Article 8 and Award Agreements governing Stock Appreciation Rights shall
contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the express
terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable.  The number of Shares
subject to SARs granted under the Plan to any Participant during any
five-calendar-year period shall not exceed 500,000.

          8.2  NATURE OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT.  A Stock Appreciation Right
is an Award entitling a Participant to receive an amount equal to the excess
(or, if the Committee shall determine at the time of grant, a portion of the
excess) of the Fair Market Value of a Share of Common Stock on the date of
exercise of the SAR over the base price, as described below, on the date of
grant of the SAR, multiplied by the number of Shares with respect to which the
SAR shall have been exercised.  The base price shall be designated by the
Committee in the Award Agreement for the SAR and shall be the Fair Market Value
of a Share on the grant date of the SAR or such other higher price as the
Committee shall determine.

          8.3  EXERCISE.  A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by a
Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.  The
Committee may also provide that a SAR shall be automatically exercised on one or
more specified dates or upon the satisfaction of performance goals or criteria
or one or more other conditions specified by the Committee in the SAR Award
Agreement.  In the case of SARs granted to Reporting Persons, exercise of the
SAR shall be limited by the Committee to the extent required to comply with the
applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

          8.4  FORM OF PAYMENT.  Payment upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation
Right may be made in cash, in installments, in Shares, or in any other manner or
combination of such methods, or in any other form as the Committee, in its
discretion, shall determine.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                             RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS

          9.1  GENERAL.  Restricted Share Awards shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of Article 6 and this Article 9 and Award Agreements governing
Restricted Shares shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall
deem desirable.

          9.2  NATURE OF RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS.  A Restricted Share is an
Award of Shares transferred to a Participant subject to such terms and
conditions as the Committee deems appropriate, including, without limitation,
restrictions on the sale, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of such
Restricted Shares and may include a requirement that the Participant forfeit
such Restricted Shares back to Bancorp upon termination of Participant's
employment for specified reasons within a specified period of time or upon other
conditions, as set forth in the Award Agreement for such Restricted Shares.
Each Participant receiving a Restricted Share may be issued a stock certificate
in respect of such Shares, registered in the name of such Participant, and
bearing a legend referring to the Restrictions set forth in the Award Agreement,
and shall execute a stock power in blank with respect to the Shares evidenced by
such certificate.  The certificate evidencing such Restricted Shares and the
stock power shall be held in custody by Bancorp until the Restrictions thereon
shall have lapsed.

          9.3  RESTRICTION PERIOD.  Award Agreements for Restricted Share Awards
shall provide that Restricted Shares may not be transferred, and may provide
that, in order for a Participant to Vest in such Restricted Shares, the
Participant must remain in the employment of Bancorp or its Subsidiaries,
subject to relief for reasons specified in the Award Agreement, for a period
commencing on the grant date of the Award and ending on such later date or dates
as the Committee may designate at the time of the Award (the "Restriction
Period").  During the Restriction Period, a Participant may not sell, assign,
transfer, pledge, encumber, or otherwise dispose of a Restricted Share Award or
the Restricted Shares received under or governed by the Restricted Share Award
(other than surrender to Bancorp pursuant to Section 6.5(h)).  The Committee, in
its sole discretion, may provide for the lapse of restrictions in installments
during the Restriction Period.  Upon expiration of the applicable Restriction
Period (or lapse of Restrictions during the Restriction Period where the
Restrictions lapse in installments) the Participant shall be entitled to
settlement of the Restricted Share Award or portion thereof, as the case may be.
Although Restricted Share Awards shall usually Vest based on continued
employment and Performance Share Awards under Article 10 shall usually Vest
based on attainment of Performance Goals, the Committee, in its discretion, may
condition Vesting of Restricted Share Awards on attainment of Performance Goals
as well as continued employment.  In such case, the Restriction Period for such
a Restricted Share Award shall include the period prior to satisfaction of the
Performance Goals.  The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the Vesting
of any Restricted Share Award.

          9.4  FORFEITURE.  If a Participant ceases to be an employee of Bancorp
or a Subsidiary during the Restriction Period for any reason other than reasons
which may be specified in an Award Agreement (such as death, Disability, or
Retirement) or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions specified in an Award
Agreement, the Award Agreement may require that all non-Vested Restricted Shares
previously granted to the Participant be forfeited and returned to Bancorp.
                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>
          9.5  SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS.  Upon Vesting of a
Restricted Share Award, the legend on such Shares will be removed and the
Participant's stock power will be returned and the Shares will no longer be
Restricted Shares.

          9.6  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  A Participant shall have, with respect
to unforfeited Restricted Shares for which a certificate has been issued in the
Participant's name under a Restricted Share Award, all the rights of a
shareholder of Bancorp, including the right to vote the Shares, and the right to
receive any cash dividends.  Stock dividends issued with respect to Restricted
Shares shall be treated as additional Restricted Shares covered by the
Restricted Share Award and shall be subject to the same Restrictions.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                            PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

          10.1  GENERAL.  Performance Share Awards shall be subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in Article 6 and this Article 10 and Award Agreements
governing Performance Share Awards shall contain such other terms and conditions
not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall
deem desirable.

          10.2  NATURE OF PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS.  A Performance Share Award
is an Award of Shares granted to a Participant subject to such terms and
conditions as the Committee deems appropriate, including, without limitation,
the requirement that the Participant forfeit such Award or a portion thereof in
the event specified performance criteria are not met within a designated period
of time.  A Participant receiving a Performance Share Award may (but need not)
be issued a stock certificate in respect of such Shares, registered in the name
of Participant, and bearing a legend referring to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Award Agreement and shall execute a stock power in blank with
respect to the Shares evidenced by such certificate.  Any certificate evidencing
such Performance Shares and the stock power shall be held in custody by Bancorp
until the Performance Goals are satisfied.

          10.3  PERFORMANCE CYCLES.  For each Performance Share Award, the
Committee shall designate a performance period (the "Performance Cycle") with a
duration to be determined by the Committee in its discretion within which
specified Performance Goals are to be attained.  There may be several
Performance Cycles in existence at any one time and the duration of Performance
Cycles may differ from each other.

          10.4  PERFORMANCE GOALS.  The Committee shall establish Performance
Goals for each Performance Cycle on the basis of such criteria and to accomplish
such objectives as the Committee may from time to time select.  Performance
Goals selected by the Committee may include performance criteria for Bancorp, a
Subsidiary, or an operating group, division, or unit of Bancorp and its
Subsidiaries.  During any Performance Cycle, the Committee may adjust the
Performance Goals for such Performance Cycle as it deems equitable in
recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting Bancorp, changes in
                                     - 18 -

<PAGE>
applicable tax laws or accounting principles, or such other factors as the
Committee may determine.

          10.5  DETERMINATION OF AWARDS.  As soon as practicable after the end
of a Performance Cycle, the Committee shall determine the extent to which
Performance Share Awards have been earned on the basis of performance in
relation to the established Performance Goals.

          10.6  TIMING AND FORM OF PAYMENT.  Settlement of earned Performance
Shares shall be made to the Participant as soon as practicable after the
expiration of the Performance Cycle and the Committee's determination under
Section 10.5 by the issuance and delivery of unrestricted Shares equal to the
number of earned Performance Shares or by a combination of cash and Performance
Shares, as determined by the Committee.

          10.7  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Unless a stock certificate is issued
with respect to a Performance Share Award as provided in Section 10.2, a
Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to unearned
Performance Shares.  With respect to unearned Performance Shares for which a
certificate has been issued in the Participants name under a Performance Share
Award, a Participant shall have all the rights of a shareholder of Bancorp,
including the right to vote the Shares, and the right to receive any cash
dividends.  Stock dividends issued with respect to Performance Shares shall be
treated as additional Performance Shares covered by the Performance Share Award
and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions.

          10.8  AWARDS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  All Performance Share Awards to
executive officers of Bancorp and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
following specific requirements:

          (a)  The Performance Goals shall be Bancorp's Return on Average
       Assets ("ROAA") and the extent (expressed as a percentage) by
       which Bancorp's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") exceeds the
       median TSR of the Standard and Poors Regional Banks index (the
       "TSR Percentage").

          (b)  The maximum number of Shares which may be granted to any
       executive officer pursuant to Performance Share Awards granted in
       any calendar year shall not exceed 60,000 (subject to adjustment
       pursuant to Article 14.

          (c)  For Performance Share Awards granted prior to November 17,
       1994, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Date prior to the
       expiration of a Performance Cycle, the number of Performance
       Shares shall (except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.8(c)
       or in Section 10.8(d)) be determined based on the achievement of
       the ROAA and TSR Percentage goals during the portion of the
       Performance Cycle ending on the last day of the last fiscal
       quarter of Bancorp ending on or before the Change in Control
                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>
       Date.  However, if the Committee in good faith adopts a resolution that
       (i) the use of the pooling method of accounting with respect to the
       Change in Control transaction would be materially beneficial to Bancorp
       and (ii) the computation of earned Performance Shares as described in
       this Section 10.8(c) would have a materially adverse effect on Bancorp's
       ability to use the pooling method, then the provisions of this
       Section 10.8(c) shall not apply and the earned Performance Shares shall
       be computed based on the full Performance Cycle.

          (d)  Unless the Committee expressly provides otherwise in a
       specific Award Agreement, the acceleration of the earning of the
       Performance Shares pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 10.8(c)
       shall occur only if, or to the extent, such acceleration of the
       earning of the Performance Shares does not result in an "excess
       parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the
       Code.

                                   ARTICLE 11
                    OTHER STOCK BASED AND COMBINATION AWARDS

          11.1  OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS.  The Committee may grant other Awards
under the Plan pursuant to which Shares are or may in the future be acquired, or
Awards denominated in or measured by Share equivalent units, including Awards
valued using measures other than the market value of Shares.  Other Stock-Based
Awards are not restricted to any specified form or structure and may include,
without limitation, Share purchase warrants, other rights to acquire Shares, and
securities convertible into or redeemable for Shares.  The number of Shares
subject to Other Stock-Based Awards granted to any Participant during any
five-calendar-year period shall not exceed 500,000.  Such Other Stock-Based
Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, any other
type of Award granted under the Plan.

          11.2  COMBINATION AWARDS.   The Committee may also grant Awards under
the Plan in tandem or combination with other Awards or in exchange of Awards, or
in tandem or combination with, or as alternatives to, grants or rights under any
other employee plan of Bancorp, including the plan of any acquired entity.  No
action authorized by this section shall reduce the amount of any existing
benefits or change the terms and conditions thereof without the Participant's
consent.

                                   ARTICLE 12
                               DEFERRAL ELECTIONS

          If a Participant in the Plan who is eligible to participate in the
U. S. Bancorp 1991 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, or any successor or
other similar deferred compensation plan maintained by Bancorp or a Subsidiary,
makes an effective deferral election under such deferred compensation plan which
covers Awards under this Plan, the payment of cash (or, if permitted by such
deferred compensation plan, the delivery of
                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>
Shares) that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the
exercise, earn out, or Vesting of an Award under this Plan may be deferred under
the terms of the deferred compensation plan.

                                   ARTICLE 13
                              DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

          Restricted Share Awards and Performance Share Awards for which no
certificate is issued in the Participants name before Vesting (and other Awards
other than Options or Awards requiring exercise) may, at the discretion of the
Committee, earn dividend equivalents.  In respect of any such Award which is
outstanding on a dividend record date for Common Stock, the Participant may be
credited with an amount equal to the amount of cash or stock dividends that
would have been paid on the Shares covered by such Award, had such covered
Shares been issued and outstanding on such dividend record date.  The Committee
shall establish such rules and procedures governing the crediting of dividend
equivalents, including the timing, form of payment, and payment contingencies of
such dividend equivalents, as it deems are appropriate or necessary.

                                   ARTICLE 14
                ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, ETC.

          14.1  PLAN DOES NOT RESTRICT BANCORP.  The existence of the Plan and
the Awards granted under the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the
right or power of the Board or the shareholders of Bancorp to make or authorize
any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization, or other change in Bancorp's
capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Bancorp,
any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks ahead of or
affecting Bancorp's capital stock or the rights thereof, the dissolution or
liquidation of Bancorp or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets
or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding.

          14.2  ADJUSTMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE.   In the event of any change in
capitalization affecting the Common Stock of Bancorp, such as a stock dividend,
stock split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares or other form of reorganization, or any other change
affecting the Common Stock, such proportionate adjustments, if any, as the
Committee, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate to reflect such change,
shall be made with respect to the aggregate number of Shares for which Awards in
respect thereof may be granted under the Plan, the maximum number of Shares
which may be sold or awarded to any Participant, the number of Shares covered by
each outstanding Award, and the base price or purchase price per Share in
respect of outstanding Awards.  The Committee may also make such adjustments in
the number of Shares covered by, and price or other value of any outstanding
Awards in the event of a spin-off or other distribution (other than normal cash
dividends), of Bancorp assets to shareholders.

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

          Without further approval of Bancorp's shareholders, the Board may at
any time terminate the Plan, or may amend it from time to time in such respects
as the Board may deem advisable, except that the Board may not, without approval
of the shareholders, make any amendment which would (i) materially increase the
benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (ii) materially increase the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan
(except for adjustments pursuant to Article 14 of the Plan), or (iii) materially
modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.
Without further shareholder approval, the Board or the Committee may amend the
Plan to take into account changes in applicable securities, federal income tax
laws, and other applicable laws.  Further, should the provisions of Rule 16b-3,
or any successor rule, under the Exchange Act be amended, the Board or the
Committee, without further shareholder approval, may amend the Plan as necessary
to comply with any modifications to such rule.

                                   ARTICLE 16
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          16.1  TAX WITHHOLDING.  Bancorp shall have the right to deduct from
any settlement of any Award under the Plan, including the delivery or vesting of
Shares, any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be
withheld with respect to such payments or to take such other action as may be
necessary in the opinion of Bancorp to satisfy all obligations for the payment
of such taxes.  The recipient of any payment or distribution under the Plan
shall make arrangements satisfactory to Bancorp for the satisfaction of any such
withholding tax obligations.  Bancorp shall not be required to make any such
payment or distribution under the Plan until such obligations are satisfied.

          16.2  UNFUNDED PLAN.  The Plan shall be unfunded and Bancorp shall not
be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by
Awards under the Plan.  Any liability of Bancorp to any person with respect to
any Award under the Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations
that may be effected pursuant to the Plan.  No such obligation of Bancorp shall
be deemed to be secured by any pledge of, or other encumbrance on, any property
of Bancorp.

          16.3  PAYMENTS TO TRUST.  The Committee is authorized to cause to be
established a trust agreement or several trust agreements whereunder the
Committee may make payments of amounts due or to become due to Participants in
the Plan.

          16.4  ANNULMENT OF AWARDS.  Any Award Agreement may provide that the
grant of an Award payable in cash is revocable until cash is paid in settlement
thereof or that grant of an Award payable in Shares is revocable until the
Participant becomes entitled to the certificate (without Restriction or legend)
in settlement thereof.  In the event the employment of a Participant is
terminated for cause (as defined below), any Award which
                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>
is revocable shall be annulled as of the date of such termination for cause.
For the purpose of this Section 16.4, the term "for cause" shall have (in the
event the Participant has an employment agreement) the meaning set forth in the
Participant's employment agreement or otherwise means any discharge (or removal)
for material or flagrant violation of the policies and procedures of Bancorp or
for other job performance or conduct which is materially detrimental to the best
interests of Bancorp, as determined by the Committee.

          16.5  ENGAGING IN COMPETITION WITH BANCORP.  Any Award Agreement may
provide that, if a Participant terminates employment with Bancorp or a
Subsidiary for any reason whatsoever, and within a period of time (as specified
in the Award Agreement) after the date of such termination accepts employment
with any competitor of (or otherwise engages in competition with) Bancorp, the
Committee, in its sole discretion, may require such Participant to return to
Bancorp the economic value of any Award that is realized or obtained (measured
at the date of exercise, Vesting, or payment) by such Participant at any time
during the period beginning on the date that is six months prior to the date of
such Participant's termination of employment with Bancorp.

          16.6  OTHER BANCORP BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  Payments and
other benefits received by a Participant under an Award made pursuant to the
Plan shall not be deemed a part of a Participant's regular, recurring
compensation for purposes of the termination indemnity or severance pay law of
any state or country and shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the
determination of benefits under any other employee benefit plan or similar
arrangement provided by Bancorp or a Subsidiary unless expressly so provided by
the Award Agreement or by such other plan or arrangements.  Awards under the
Plan may be made in combination with or in tandem with, or as alternatives to,
grants, awards, or payments under any other Bancorp or Subsidiary plans,
arrangements, or programs.  The Plan notwithstanding, Bancorp or any Subsidiary
may adopt such other compensation programs and additional compensation
arrangements as it deems necessary to attract, retain, and reward employees for
their service with Bancorp and its Subsidiaries.

          16.7  SECURITIES LAW RESTRICTIONS.  No Shares shall be issued under
the Plan unless counsel for Bancorp shall be satisfied that such issuance will
be in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.
Certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan may be subject to such
stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable
under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is then
listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law.  The Committee may
cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate
reference to such restrictions.

          16.8  GOVERNING LAW.  Except with respect to references to the Code or
federal securities laws, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Oregon.

          The amendment and restatement of the Plan effective November 17, 1994,
is expressly subject to the approval of the Plan, as amended and restated, by
the holders of a majority of the Shares present, or represented, and entitled to
vote on such approval at the 1995 annual meeting of Bancorp's shareholders.

provided that no portion of such premiums are reimbursed or subsidized by any
other employer.  Such reimbursement and the criteria for eligibility shall be
subject to the same conditions and limits as are applicable to active employees
of U. S. Bancorp.
