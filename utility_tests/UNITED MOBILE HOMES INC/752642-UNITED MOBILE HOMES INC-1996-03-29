ITEM I - BUSINESS

General Development of Business

      United  Mobile  Homes, Inc. (the Company) owns and operates  twenty-one
mobile  home  parks  containing 4,920 sites.  The parks are  located  in  New
Jersey,  New  York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.  In January  1996,  the
Company acquired an additional mobile home park, bringing its total to twenty-
two mobile home parks consisting of over 5,000 sites.

      The  Company was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1968.   Its
executive  offices  are  located at 125 Wyckoff Road, Eatontown,  New  Jersey
07724.  Its telephone number is (908) 389-3890.

      Effective January 1, 1992, the Company elected to be taxed  as  a  real
estate  invest  trust (REIT) under Sections 856-858 of the  Internal  Revenue
Code.   The  Company received from the Internal Revenue Service  a  favorable
revenue ruling that it qualified as a REIT.  The Company will not be taxed on
the  portion of its income which is distributed to shareholders, provided  it
distributes  at  least 95% of its taxable income, has at  least  75%  of  its
assets  in  real estate investments and meets certain other requirements  for
qualification as a REIT.

Background

     Monmouth Capital Corporation, a publicly-owned Small Business Investment
Corporation,  that had owned approximately 66% of the Company's  stock,  spun
off  to  its shareholders in a registered distribution three shares of United
Mobile  Homes,  Inc.  for  each share of Monmouth Capital  Corporation.   The
Company  in  1984 and 1985 issued additional shares through rights offerings.
The Company has been in operation for twenty-seven years, the last eleven  of
which have been as a publicly-owned corporation.

Narrative Description of Business

      The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of mobile
home  parks - leasing mobile home spaces on a month-to-month basis to private
mobile home owners.  The Company also leases homes to tenants.

     A mobile home park community is designed to accommodate detached, single
family   manufactured   housing  units,  which  are  produced   off-site   by
manufacturers  and delivered by truck to the site.  Such dwellings,  referred
to  as mobile homes (which should be distinguished from travel trailers), are
manufactured  in a variety of styles and sizes.  Mobile homes, once  located,
are  rarely transported to another site; typically, a mobile home remains  on
site and is sold by its owner to a subsequent occupant.  This transaction  is
commonly  handled  through  a  broker  in  the  same  manner  that  the  more
traditional  single-family residence is sold.  Each owner of  a  mobile  home
leases the site on which the home is located from the Company.

                                    -2-

      Mobile  homes  are  being  accepted by  the  public  as  a  viable  and
economically  attractive  alternative  to  common  stick-built  single-family
housing.  During the past five years, approximately one-fifth of all  single-
family homes built and sold in the nation have been manufactured homes.

      The  size  of a modern mobile home community is limited, as  are  other
residential communities, by factors such as geography, topography, and  funds
available  for  development.  Generally, modern mobile home park  communities
contain  buildings  for  recreation,  green  areas,  and  other  common  area
facilities, which, as distinguished from tenant owned mobile homes,  are  the
property  of  the  park  owner.  In addition to  such  general  improvements,
certain  mobile home park communities include recreational improvements  such
as  swimming pools, tennis courts and playgrounds.  Municipal water and sewer
services  are  available to some mobile home parks, while other parks  supply
these  facilities  on  site.  The housing provided by the  mobile  home  park
community, therefore, includes not only the manufactured dwelling unit (owned
by  the  resident),  but also the physical community framework  and  services
provided by the mobile home park community.

      The  park  manager interviews prospective residents, ensures compliance
with park regulations, maintains public areas and community facilities and is
responsible  for  the overall appearance of the park.  The mobile  home  park
community,  once fully occupied, tends to achieve a stable rate of occupancy.
The  cost  of effort in moving a home once it is located in a park encourages
the  owner of the mobile home to resell his mobile home there rather than  to
remove  it  from  the  park.  This ability to produce relatively  predictable
income,  together  with  the  location of the park,  its  condition  and  its
appearance, are factors in the long-term appreciation of the park.

      The long-term industry trend may be toward condominium conversions.   A
change  from  investor park ownership to tenant ownership would  enhance  the
value  of existing manufactured home communities.  All of the Company's parks
are  located in areas of the country that have not yet accepted this concept.
Condominium  conversion is a long-term possibility and has no impact  on  the
Company's current operations.

Investment and Other Policies of the Company

      The Company may invest in improved and unimproved real property and may
develop  unimproved real property.  Such properties may be located throughout
the United States.  In the past, it has concentrated on the northeast.

      The  Company  has no restrictions on how it finances  new  mobile  home
parks.   It may finance parks by purchase money mortgages or other financing,
including first liens, wraparound mortgages or subordinated indebtedness.  In
connection  with  its  ongoing  activities,  the  Company  may  issue  notes,
mortgages  or  other  senior securities.  The Company  intends  to  use  both
secured and unsecured lines of credit.

      The  Company may issue securities for property, however, this  has  not
occurred to date, and it may repurchase or reacquire its shares from time  to
time  if  in  the  opinion  of  the Board of Directors  such  acquisition  is
advantageous to the Company.

                                    -3-
Property Maintenance and Improvement Policies

     It is the policy of the Company to properly maintain, modernize, expand,
and   make  improvements  to  its  properties  when  required.   The  Company
anticipates  that  renovation  expenditures  with  respect  to  its   present
properties   over  the  next  five  years  will  be  consistent   with   1995
expenditures.  It is the policy of the Company to maintain adequate insurance
coverage on all of its properties; and, in the opinion of the Company, all of
its properties are adequately insured where such insurance is available at  a
reasonable cost as determined by management.

General Risks of Real Estate Ownership

      The  Company's  investments  will be subject  to  the  risks  generally
associated with the ownership of real property, including the uncertainty  of
cash  flow  to  meet fixed obligations, adverse changes in national  economic
conditions, changes in the relative popularity (and thus the relative  price)
of  the Company's real estate investments when compared to other investments,
adverse  local market conditions due to changes in general or local  economic
conditions  or  neighborhood values, changes in interest  rates  and  in  the
availability  of  mortgage  funds, costs and terms  of  mortgage  funds,  the
financial  conditions of tenants and sellers of properties, changes  in  real
estate  tax  rates  and  other operating expenses (including  corrections  of
potential  environmental  issues  as  well  as  more  stringent  governmental
regulations  regarding  the  environment),  governmental  rules  and   fiscal
policies  including possible proposals for rent controls, as well as expenses
resulting  from  acts of God, uninsured losses and other  factors  which  are
beyond  the control of the Company.  The Company's investments are  primarily
in  rental properties and are subject to the risk or inability to attract  or
retain  tenants  with a consequent decline in rental income as  a  result  of
adverse changes in local real estate markets or other factors.

Competition for Mobile Home Park Investments

      The  Company  will be competing for mobile home park  investments  with
numerous other real estate entities, such as individuals, corporations,  real
estate  investment  trusts  and  other enterprises  engaged  in  real  estate
activities,  possibly including certain affiliates of the Company.   In  many
cases,  the  competing concerns may be larger and better  financed  than  the
Company,  making it difficult for the Company to secure new mobile home  park
investments.   Competition  among  private and  institutional  purchasers  of
mobile  home  park investments has increased substantially in  recent  years,
with resulting increases in the purchase price paid for mobile home parks and
consequent higher fixed costs.


                                    -4-

Environmental, Regulatory and Energy Problems

      The  availability of suitable investments and the cost of  construction
and  operation  of mobile home parks in which the Company may invest  may  be
adversely affected by legislative, regulatory, administrative and enforcement
action at the local, state and national levels in the areas, among others, of
housing  and  environmental controls.  In addition to  possible  increasingly
restrictive   zoning  regulations  and  related  land  use   controls,   such
restrictions may relate to air, ground and water quality standards,  wetlands
regulations,  noise  pollution  and indirect environmental  impacts  such  as
increased motor vehicle activity.

      The  Company  owns  and operates 10 mobile home park communities  which
either  have  their  own waste water treatment facility,  water  distribution
system, or both.  At these locations, the Company is subject to compliance of
monthly,  quarterly and yearly testing for contaminants as  outlined  by  the
individual state's Department of Environmental Protection Agencies.

      The  Company  must  also  comply  with  certain  Federal  Environmental
Protection Agency Regulations which may be more stringent than the state  and
local  governmental regulations.  The costs of such testing are  included  in
the  Company's operating expenses.  As of the date of this report, there  are
no  enforcement actions pending by any federal, state or local  environmental
agencies  and management believes that the Company is in compliance with  all
such regulations.

      Currently,  the Company is not subject to radon or asbestos  monitoring
requirements.

      Since most of the Company's mobile home parks are fully developed,  the
Company,  in its normal course of business, does not incur costs  related  to
local or state zoning issues.  Zoning regulations often restrict expansion of
the Company's parks, but allow continuing operation of existing parks.

      Rent  control now affects only two of the Company's mobile  home  parks
which are in New Jersey and has resulted in a slower growth of earnings  from
these properties.

Number of Employees

      On March 1, 1996, the Company had approximately 70 employees, including
Officers.  During the year, the Company hires approximately 20 part-time  and
full-time  temporary  employees  as  lifeguards,  grounds  keepers  and   for
emergency repairs.

                                    -5-

      Occupancy  rates are very stable with little year-to-year changes  once
the  community  is filled (generally 90% or greater occupancy).   It  is  the
Company's  experience  that, once a home is set up in the  community,  it  is
seldom moved.  The home if sold, is sold on-site to a new owner.

     Residents generally rent on a month-to-month basis.  Some residents have
one-year leases.  Southwind Village and Woodlawn Village (both in New Jersey)
are the only parks subject to local rent control laws.

      There are 14 sites at Sandy Valley which are under a consent order with
the  Federal  Government.  This order provides that, as sites become  vacant,
they  cannot  be  reused.The restrictions on use were known at  the  time  of
purchase,  and  the  item is not material to the operation  of  Sandy  Valley
Estates.

      In  connection  with  the  operation of its 4,920  sites,  the  Company
operates  approximately  275 rental units.  These  are  homes  owned  by  the
Company and rented to residents.  The Company engages in the rental of mobile
homes primarily in areas where the communities have existing vacancies.   The
rental  homes  produce income on both the home and for the site  which  might
otherwise be non-income producing.  The Company sells the older rental  homes
when the opportunity arises.

      During 1995, the Company commenced engineering for the construction  of
800 sites.  Due to the difficulties involved in the approval and construction
process,  it  is  difficult to predict the number  of  sites  which  will  be
completed  in  a  given  year.   The Company currently  has  61  sites  under
construction.

Significant Properties

      The  Company operates approximately $45,000,000 (at original  cost)  in
mobile  home properties.  These consist of 21 separate mobile home parks  and
related  equipment and improvements.  There are 4,920 sites in the 21  parks.
No  one  park  constitutes more than 10% of the total assets of the  Company.
Port  Royal  Village  with 402 sites, Sandy Valley Estates  with  327  sites,
Cedarcrest Mobile Home Park with 283 sites, Allentown Mobile Home  Park  with
414  sites  and  Heather Highlands with 457 sites are the larger  properties.
The following is a description of these properties:

                             PORT ROYAL VILLAGE

      The  Company acquired Port Royal Village in 1984.  This is a  402-space
mobile home park located in Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania.  The Company believes
this  to  be a sound acquisition for the following reasons:  (a) the park  is
well-maintained  with  city  water and its own sewer  plant,  as  well  as  a
swimming  pool  and  community building; (b) the park has  approximately  85%
occupancy; and (c) the park generates substantial revenues and net  operating
income.   Management  believes that this park is a  successful  and  valuable
mobile home park.

                            SANDY VALLEY ESTATES

      The Company acquired Sandy Valley Estates in 1985.  This is a 327-space
mobile home park located in Magnolia, Ohio.  The Company believes this to  be
an  excellent  park  because (a) the park is well-maintained  with  municipal
sewer;  (b)  the park has its own well system; (c) the park has approximately
94%  occupancy;  and (d) the park generates revenues with an average  monthly
rental  of  $191 per site, which rents are competitive with the other  mobile
home  parks  in  the  area.  The Company believes that  it  is  an  excellent
investment.

                                    -8-
                                 CEDARCREST

      On  July  15, 1986 the Company paid $760,000 to acquire 94.05%  of  the
partnership  interest  in  Cedarcrest Mobile Home Park  Associates,  Ltd.,  a
limited  partnership  that  owned a 283-space mobile  home  park  located  in
Vineland,  New Jersey.  On June 30, 1988 the Company paid $40,000 to  acquire
an additional 4.95% of the partnership interest, bringing the Company's total
ownership to 99% at November 30, 1988.  During 1989 the Company acquired  the
remaining 1% interest.

      The  Company  believes this to be an excellent park for  the  following
reasons:   (a)  the  park is well-maintained, (b) the mobile  home  park  has
municipal sewer and water service; and (c) the park is 100% occupied.   Rents
average $303 per month per site and they are competitive with other parks  in
the area.

      On  September 15, 1986 the Company paid $850,000 to all of the  limited
partners to acquire 97% of the partnership interests in Allentown Mobile Home
Park  Associates,  a limited partnership that owned a 414-space  mobile  home
park located in Memphis, Tennessee.

      Royal  Green, Inc., the General Partner of Allentown Mobile  Home  Park
Associates,  retained its 3% interest in the partnership until January,  1990
at which time the Company purchased the 3% interest for $25,500.

      The  Company  believes this to be a sound investment for the  following
reasons:   (a)  the property is well maintained; (b) the park  has  municipal
sewer and water service; and (c) rents are competitive with other mobile home
parks in the area.  Current occupancy is approximately 73%.  The Company  has
been  disappointed  that  it  has not brought occupancy  to  90%  or  higher.
Nevertheless, in the future, the Company anticipates that it will be able  to
increase occupancy.  The park has the potential to be fully occupied  in  one
of the nicest areas in Memphis.

                             HEATHER HIGHLANDS

      On January 30, 1992, the Company acquired an 88.36% interest in Heather
Highlands  Mobile  Home  Village  Associates,  L.P.,  a  limited  partnership
operating  a  457-space  mobile home park located in Pittston,  Pennsylvania.
The  partnership  has  partners  who  are  also  officers,  directors  and/or
shareholders  of  the  Company.  Mr. Eugene Landy,  Chairman  of  the  Board,
retained  the  remaining 11.64% limited partnership interest.   The  purchase
price  included total payments to the original limited partners of  $972,400,
$35,000 to Burtenn Inc., General Partner and assumption of net liabilities of
approximately   $1,500,000  for  a  total  purchase  price  of  approximately
$2,500,000.   This  purchase was based on an independent  appraisal  of  fair
market  value.   In January 1995, the Company purchased the remaining  11.64%
partnership  interest for $132,600.  This price per unit was the  same  price
previously paid to non-affiliated sellers.

      The  Company anticipates that the park will ultimately have  415  sites
since  the  use  of  double wide units reduce the total number  of  available
sites.

      The  Company  believes this to be a sound investment for the  following
reasons:   (a)  the property is well maintained; (b) the park  has  municipal
sewer and water service; and (c) rents are competitive with other mobile home
parks in the area.

      As  of  December 31, 1995, there were approximately 900 holders of  the
Company's common stock based on the number of record owners.

      For  the  years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, total dividends
paid by the Company amounted to $2,954,847 or $.525 per share, $2,277,742  or
$.425 per share and $1,648,643 or $.325 per share, respectively.

      On  January 15, 1996, the Company declared a dividend of $.15 per share
to be paid on March 15, 1996 to shareholders of record February 15, 1996.

      Future  dividend policy will depend on the Company's earnings,  capital
requirements,  financial condition, availability and cost of  bank  financing
and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  The Company
elected  REIT status beginning in 1992.  As a REIT, the Company must pay  out
at  least  95%  of  its taxable income in the form of a cash distribution  to
shareholders.

ITEM  7  -  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue and Expense

1995 vs. 1994

      Rental  and related income increased from $12,318,467 for the year ended
December 31, 1994 to $13,332,961 for the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily
due to rental increases to tenants, increased occupancy and the acquisition of
a new park in January 1995.  During 1995, the Company was able to obtain  rent
increases of $7.00 to $16.00 per month on most of its occupied sites.

      Overall occupancy rates are satisfactory with only five mobile home parks
experiencing  vacancies over ten percent.  Progress has been made to increase
occupancy at these parks.  The Company has purchased one park in 1995 and has
negotiated for the purchase of a 161-space park, which closed in January 1996.
The Company is also evaluating further expansion at selected parks in order to
increase the number of available sites.  Some of these parks are in various
stages of expansion.

      Park operating expenses increased from $5,454,387 for the year ended
December 31, 1994 to $5,883,793 for the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily
as a result of the acquisition of an additional park.  Park operating expenses
remained at 44% of gross revenues.

      The Company's income from park operations continues to show steady growth
rising from $6,864,080 in 1994 to $7,449,168 in 1995.

      General and administrative expenses decreased by 6% to $1,228,850 in 1995
primarily as a result of a decrease in personnel costs.

      Interest expense increased to $1,675,998 in 1995 from $1,519,527 in 1994.
This was primarily as a result of an increase in the principal amount 
outstanding offset by a decrease in the interest rate.   During  1995, the
Company negotiated new long-term debt.  Interest rates dropped from prime  plus
1% to a fixed rate of 7.5%.

      Depreciation expense increased from $1,799,169 in 1994 to $1,872,942  in
1995 due to the addition of a new park.

      For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company reported net income  of
$2,491,581 as compared to net income of $2,141,279 for the year ended  December
31,  1994.   The  Company is currently experiencing modest  inflation.   Modest
inflation  is  believed to have a favorable impact on the  Company's  financial
performance.  With modest inflation, the Company believes that it can  increase
rents  sufficiently to match increases in operating expenses.   High  rates  of
inflation (more than 10%) could result in an inability to raise rents  to  meet
rising costs and could create political problems such as the imposition of rent
controls.  The Company anticipates continuing profits in 1996.

                                     -13-

1994 vs. 1993

      Rental  and related income increased from $11,521,677 for the year  ended
December 31, 1993 to $12,318,467 for the year ended December 31, 1994 primarily
due  to  rental  increases to tenants.  During 1994, the Company  was  able  to
obtain  rent  increases of $6.00 to $19.00 per month on most  of  its  occupied
sites.  There were no significant trends or changes in overall occupancy during
1994.   Overall  occupancy rates are satisfactory with only  four  mobile  home
parks experiencing vacancies over ten percent.

      Park  operating  expenses increased from $5,113,740 for  the  year  ended
December  31, 1993 to $5,454,387 for the year ended December 31, 1994 primarily
due to increased personnel and utility costs.  Park operating expenses remained
at 44% of gross revenues.

      The  Company's income from park operations continue to show steady growth
rising from $6,407,937 in 1993 to $6,864,080 in 1994.

      General and administrative expenses remained relatively  stable  during
1994.

      Interest expense decreased to $1,519,527 in 1994 from $1,757,710 in 1993.
During  1994, the Company negotiated new long-term debt.  Interest rates  on  a
significant portion of the Company's debt dropped from prime plus 3%  to  prime
plus 1%.  The Company also reduced the principal amount outstanding.

     Depreciation expense remained relatively constant during 1994.

      For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company reported net income  of
$2,141,279  as  compared to $1,346,219 for the year ended  December  31,  1993.
Although interest rates have risen during 1994, the Company believes that these
rates  will  remain  relatively steady during 1995.  The Company  is  currently
experiencing  modest  inflation.   Modest  inflation  is  believed  to  have  a
favorable  impact  upon  the  Company's  financial  performance.   With  modest
inflation,  the  Company believes that it can increase  rents  sufficiently  to
match increases in operating expenses.  High rates of inflation (more than 10%)
could  result  in  an inability to raise rents to meet rising costs  and  could
create political problems such as the imposition of rent controls.



                                     -14-
Liquidity and Capital Resources

      As  a  real  estate  company,  the Company uses  funds  for  real  estate
acquisitions, real property improvements and amortization of debt  incurred  in
connection with such  acquisitions and improvements.  The  Company  generates
funds through cash flow from properties,  mortgages on properties and increases
in shareholder investments.   The Company  has  liquidity  available  from  a
combination  of  short  and  long-term  sources.   The  Company  currently  has
mortgages  payable totalling $17,707,635 secured by eight parks.   The  Company
also has a $500,000 line of credit with United Jersey Bank, N.A. (UJB), all  of
which  was  available at December 31, 1995.  The Company believes that  its  21
mobile  home parks have market values in excess of historical cost.  Management
believes that this provides significant additional borrowing capacity.

      Net  cash  provided by operating activities increased from $3,550,606  in
1993 to $4,343,548 in 1994 to $4,642,256 in 1995.  Cash flow was primarily used
for capital improvements, payment  of dividends,  and  the  purchase  of  an
additional park in 1995.  The Company meets maturing mortgage  obligations  by
using  a combination of cash flow and refinancing.  The dividend payments  were
primarily made from cash flow from operations.

      In addition to normal operating expenses,  the Company requires cash for
additional investments in mobile home parks, capital improvements, purchase  of
mobile homes   for rent, scheduled mortgage amortization and dividend
distributions.   As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 95% of its
taxable income.

      The  Company  estimates that it will purchase in  1996  approximately  50
mobile  homes  to be used as rentals for a total cost of $700,000.   Management
believes  that  these  mobile homes will each generate approximately  $300  per
month in rental income in addition to lot rent.

      Capital  improvements  include amounts needed to meet  environmental  and
regulatory  requirements in connection with the mobile home parks that  provide
water  or  sewer  service.   Excluding expansions,  the  Company  is  budgeting
approximately $1,000,000 in capital improvements for 1996.

      The  Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan  (Plan).
Cash received from the Plan is a significant additional source of liquidity and
capital  resources.   During 1995, the Company paid  $2,954,847  in  dividends.
Amounts  received under the Plan amounted to $3,031,970.  The  success  of  the
Plan  resulted  in  a  substantial improvement in the Company's  liquidity  and
capital resources in 1995.

      The  Company  has undeveloped land which it could develop over  the  next
three  years.   During 1995, additional acreage was purchased in Vineland,  New
Jersey  which  will  be used for expansion in the future.   In  addition,   the
Company  plans to continue acquiring additional mobile home parks.  On  January
10, 1996, the Company completed the purchase of Wood Valley Mobile Home Park, a
161-space  park  located  in Caledonia, Ohio.  The  total  purchase  price  was
$1,992,000.

      The Company believes that funds generated from operations,  together with
the  financing and refinancing of its properties,  will be adequate to meet its
needs over the next several years.

  Report of Board of Directors.
  
  Overview and Philosophy
  
         The  Company  has  a  Compensation  Committee  consisting  of  three
  independent  outside Directors.  This Committee is responsible  for  making
  recommendations   to   the   Board   of  Directors   concerning   executive
  compensation.   The  Compensation Committee takes into consideration  three
  major factors in setting compensation.
  
        The  first  consideration is the overall performance of the  Company.
  The  Board believes that the financial interests of the executive  officers
  should  be  aligned  with  the success of the  Company  and  the  financial
  interests  of  its shareholders.  Increases in funds from  operations,  the
  enhancement  of  the  Company's equity portfolio, and the  success  of  the
  Dividend  Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan all contribute to  increases
  in stock prices thereby maximizing shareholders' return.
  
        The  second consideration is the individual achievements made by each
  officer.  The Company is a small real estate investment trust (REIT).   The
  Board  of Directors is aware of the contributions made by each officer  and
  makes   an  evaluation  of  individual  performance  based  on  their   own
  familiarity with the officer.
  
        The final criteria in setting compensation is comparable wages in the
  industry.    In   this  regard,  the  REIT  industry  maintains   excellent
  statistics.
  
  Evaluation
  
       The Company had an excellent year.  The stock price rose from 7-3/8 at
  December  31,  1994 to 9-3/4 at December 31, 1995.  The Committee  reviewed
  the  progress  made  by  Mr. Eugene W. Landy, Chairman  of  the  Board,  in
  reducing the Company's costs of funds.  Mr. Eugene Landy was successful  in
  bringing the Company's long-term debt from a variable rate of prime plus 1%
  to a fixed rate of 7.5%.  Mr. Eugene Landy is under an employment agreement
  with  the  Company.  His base compensation under this contract is  $150,000
  per year.  (The Summary Compensation Table shows an annual compensation  to
  Mr.  Eugene  Landy of $150,000 plus $30,160 in director's and  other  legal
  fees  plus $130,000 accrual for pension and other benefits for a  total  of
  $310,160 in 1995.)  The Committee has decided to grant Mr. Eugene  Landy  a
  bonus of $15,000.
  
        The Committee also reviewed the progress made by Mr. Samuel A. Landy,
  President.  Net income and funds from operations increased by approximately
  16%  and  17%,  respectively.  The Committee also  noted  that  Mr.  Samuel
  Landy's  current compensation was less than the average salary received  by
  Presidents  of other REIT's.  Therefore, the Committee decided to  increase
  Mr. Samuel A. Landy's base compensation from $150,000 to $165,000 effective
  January 1, 1996 and to provide him with a five-year contract with scheduled
  increases  in  base compensation.  Mr. Samuel Landy will  also  be  granted
  stock  options for 25,000 shares in each year of the five-year contract  as
  well  as  other fringe benefits.  The Committee believes that an employment
  agreement with Mr. Samuel Landy is in the best interest of the Company  and
  its  shareholders  to  retain  and to ensure continuity  and  stability  of
  management.
  
                                     -22-
  
  Other Information.
  
        The Company had mortgages payable to Royal Green, Ltd., a partnership
  in  which Mr. Eugene W. Landy has a significant ownership interest.   These
  mortgages  were  repaid during 1994.  Interest expense on  these  mortgages
  amounted to $30,717 and $99,006 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
  
  COMPARATIVE STOCK PERFORMANCE.
  
       The line graph compares the total return of the Company's common stock
  for the last five years to the NAREIT All REIT Total Return Index published
  by  the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT)  and
  to  the S&P 500 Index for the same period.  The total return reflects stock
  price  appreciation  and dividend reinvestment for  all  three  comparative
  indices.  The information herein has been obtained from sources believed to

  The Board of Directors and Shareholders
  United Mobile Homes, Inc.:
  
  We have  audited  the consolidated  financial  statements of  United Mobile 
  Homes, Inc. as  listed in the accompanying  index.  In  connection with our
  audits of the consolidated  financial  statements, we also have audited the 
  financial  statement  schedule as listed in the accompanying  index.  These 
  financial   statements   and   financial   statement   schedule   are   the 
  responsibility  of the  Company's  management.   Our  responsibility  is to 
  express an  opinion on these financial  statements and financial  statement 
  schedule based on our audits.
  
  We  conducted  our  audits in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit  to
  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,
  evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
  statements.   An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting  principles
  used  and  significant estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating
  the  overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our  audits
  provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  
  In  our  opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred  to  above
  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  United
  Mobile Homes, Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its
  operations  and  its cash flows for each of the years  in  the  three  year
  period  ended  December  31,  1995 in conformity  with  generally  accepted
  accounting  principles.   Also  in  our  opinion,  the  related   financial
  statement  schedule, when considered in relation to the basic  consolidated
  financial  statements taken as a whole, presents fairly,  in  all  material
  respects, the information set forth therein.

BASIS  OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company
include  all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions
and  balances  have  been  eliminated in  consolidation.   In  preparing  the
consolidated  financial statements, management is required  to  make  certain
estimates  and  assumptions that affect the reported amounts  of  assets  and
liabilities, as well as contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates  of
the  consolidated balance sheets and revenue and expenses for the years  then
ended.   Actual  results could differ significantly from these estimates  and
assumptions.

                                   -32-
NOTE 2 - Continued

INVESTMENT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION - Property and  equipment
are  carried at cost. Depreciation for Sites and Building (15 to 27.5  years)
is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives  of  the assets.  Depreciation of Improvements to Sites and  Buildings,
Rental  Homes  and  Equipment  and Vehicles (3 to  27.5  years)  is  computed
principally  on  the straight-line method.  Land Development  Costs  are  not
depreciated until they are put in use, at which time they are capitalized  as
Sites or Site Improvements.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as
incurred and improvements are capitalized.  The costs and related accumulated
depreciation of property sold or otherwise disposed of are removed  from  the
accounts  and any gain or loss is reflected in the current year's results  of
operations.

UNAMORTIZED FINANCING COSTS - Legal fees and loan processing fees for new and
restructured mortgages are being amortized over the life of the related debt.
Amortization expenses charged to Other Expenses for the years ended  December
31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $251,554, $60,579 and $117,929, respectively.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents include certificates of
deposit and bank repurchase agreements with maturities of 90 days or less.

MINORITY  INVESTMENTS  -  The Company consolidates  the  results  of  certain
operations  that have minority interests.  On January 30, 1992,  the  Company
acquired  an 88.36% interest in a limited partnership.  On February 3,  1995,
the   Company  acquired  the  remaining  11.64%  interest  in  this   limited
partnership.

REVENUE  RECOGNITION  - The Company derives its income  from  the  rental  of
mobile  home  sites.  The Company also owns approximately  275  rental  units
which are rented to tenants.  Revenue is recognized on the accrual basis.

EARNINGS  PER  SHARE  - Net income per share is computed using  the  weighted
average number of shares outstanding, adjusted for the exercise, or potential
exercise, of any dilutive outstanding stock options (See Note 5).

RECENT  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS - In March 1995, the Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No.  121
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to  Be  Disposed Of" (SFAS 121), which is effective for financial  statements
issued   for   fiscal  years  beginning  after  December   15,   1995.    The
implementation of SFAS 121 is not expected to have a material impact  on  the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain amounts in the consolidated financial  statements
for  the  prior  years  have been reclassified to conform  to  the  statement
presentation for the current year.
                                   -33-

NOTE 3 - INVESTMENT PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

      On  January 26, 1995, the Company acquired Edgewood Mobile Home Park  a
218-space mobile home park located in Apollo, Pennsylvania.  This mobile home
park  was  purchased  from a partnership whose partners  are  also  Officers,
Directors  and  shareholders of the Company.  The purchase  price,  including
closing costs, totalled $1,810,906.  An additional $200,000 plus interest  at
8%  is  to  be  paid if the park generates, within a three year  time  limit,
$195,000 per year or more in operating income.  This purchase was based on an
independent appraisal of fair market value.

     On February 3, 1995, the Company purchased the remaining 11.64% interest
in  Heather Highlands Mobile Home Village Associates, L.P. from Mr. Eugene W.
Landy for $132,600.   This price per unit was the same price previously  paid
to  non-affiliated  sellers, which was based on an independent  appraisal  of
fair market value.

      On September 15, 1995, the Company purchased approximately ten acres of
vacant  land  adjacent  to one of its parks in Vineland,  New  Jersey  for  a
purchase price of $32,500.

      On  October 10, 1995, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 5.5
acres of vacant land for a sales price of $385,000.  This sale is schedule to
close in 1996.

   In  October, 1995 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".  This Statement  establishes
financial  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  stock-based   employee
compensation plans.

   SFAS  No.  123 provides for a "fair value based method" of accounting  for
employees  stock compensation plans.  However, SFAS No. 123 allows an  entity
to  continue  following APB Opinion No. 25 and thereby measuring compensation
cost  under  such  plans  using the "intrinsic value based  method"  provided
certain  pro-forma  footnote disclosure be made as if the  fair  value  based
method was adopted.

   On  January 1, 1996, the Company elected to continue following APB Opinion
No.  25.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not have a material impact on the
results of operations or financial position of the Company.

NOTE 6 - 401(K) PLAN

   Effective April 1, 1992, the Company instituted a 401(k) Plan (Plan).  All
full-time employees who are over 21 years old and have completed one year  of
service (as defined) are eligible for the Plan.  Under this Plan, an employee
may elect to defer his/her compensation (up to a maximum of 18%) and have  it
contributed  to  the Plan.  Employer contributions to the  Plan  are  at  the
discretion  of  the Company.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993,  the  Company  made
matching  contributions to the Plan of up to 50% of the first 6% of  employee
salary.   This  amounted to $34,056, $27,543 and $23,803 for 1995,  1994  and
1993, respectively.

the  Company  has distributed all of its income currently, no  provision  has
been made for Federal income or excise taxes for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993.

NOTE 11 - ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

   In  1990,  the Company converted the remaining oil heated mobile homes  at
Cedarcrest Mobile Home Park to gas heat.  To avoid any potential leakage into
the surrounding soils,  the remainder of the oil tanks was removed.  In order
to  encourage  tenants'  full  cooperation,   the  Company  entered  into  an
agreement  with South Jersey Gas Company to finance the tenants' purchase  of
new appliances and the actual cost of converting.  The Company guaranteed  up
to  $190,000  of  the  payments by the tenants.  In  addition,   the  Company
reimbursed  each  tenant  up  to  $530 for conversion  costs.   The  $190,000
guarantee was in the form of a cash deposit remitted to the utility  company.
As of December 31, 1995, all of this deposit was returned to the Company.


                                   -39-

NOTE 12 - LEGAL MATTERS

   There are no lawsuits pending against the Company that management believes
will  have  a  material  effect  on the financial  condition  or  results  of
operations of the Company.

   The  Company is a Defendant in various personal injury cases, all of which
are being defended by our insurance company.

   The  Company was also a Defendant in a case Jackson Township v.  Southwind
Village  Mobile  Home  Park.   The  Township  alleged  that  the  Company  is
wrongfully refusing to comply with the Township ordinance requiring operation
of  the  park  as a "senior citizen" mobile home park.  The Company  believes
that under Federal law, the Company cannot exclude families from the park.

  On June 15, 1995, the Company was granted a Summary Judgment Order allowing
families into Southwind Village Mobile Home Park in Jackson, New Jersey.   In
January  1996,  the  Company was awarded $70,000 for  legal  fees  and  other
damages.

   The Company was a Plaintiff in a lawsuit, United Mobile Homes, Inc., et al
v.  Bondy Oil, Inc., et al.  The Company spent approximately $200,000 in 1990
and  1991  to  remedy  contamination to soil from home heating  oil.   United
Mobile Homes, Inc. seeks to recover that money from the oil suppliers.   This
case was subsequently settled for $80,000 in January 1996.

   The  Company was a Plaintiff in a lawsuit, Heather Highlands  Mobile  Home
Village  v.  Jenkins Township Sanitary Authority.  Jenkins Township  Sanitary
Authority constructed public sewers and attempted to extract connection  fees
from  the  Company of over $150,000.  The Company challenged the legality  of
the  proposed  fees.  The Company settled this matter and has agreed  to  pay
Jenkins  Township Sanitary Authority $104,760 plus interest for  a  total  of
$111,042.

   On  June  7, 1995, a lawsuit was filed against the Company by  Stults  and
Associates,  Inc.  seeking  payment  of  $45,000  for  engineering   services
pertaining  to  the expansion of River Valley Estates in Marion,  Ohio.   The
Company  does not believe that any monies are owed and has filed  a  counter-
claim.

   On  January  17, 1996, a home owned by a resident at one of the  Company's
parks  exploded  due  to a gas leak in the resident's home.   This  explosion
damaged  other  surrounding resident owned homes.  This matter  is  currently
under investigation.
                                   -40-

NOTE 13 - SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

   Cash  paid  during the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994  and  1993  for
interest is as follows:

                           1995             1994         1993

            Interest    $ 1,701,454    $ 1,509,707    $ 1,742,074

   During  the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, land development
costs  of  $843,448, $294,283 and $63,171, respectively were  transferred  to
investment property and equipment and placed in service.

   During  the  year ended December 31, 1995, the Company purchased  Edgewood
Mobile Home Park.  This purchase calls for an additional $200,000 payment  if
certain  conditions  are  met.  This amount, which  is  included  in  accrued
liabilities, has been added to investment property and equipment.

   During  the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company  had
dividend  reinvestments of $1,302,811, $540,759 and $-0-, respectively  which
required no cash transfers.

NOTE 14 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The  Company is required to disclose certain information about fair values
of  financial  instruments, as defined in Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments."

Limitations

   Estimates of fair value are made at a specific point in time, based  upon,
where  available, relevant market prices and information about the  financial
instrument.  Such estimates do not include any premium or discount that could
result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of  a
particular  financial instrument.  For a portion of the  Company's  financial
instruments,  no  quoted market value exists.  Therefore, estimates  of  fair
value  are necessarily based on a number of significant assumptions (many  of
which  involve  events outside the control of management).  Such  assumptions
include   assessments  of  current  economic  conditions,   perceived   risks
associated with these financial instruments and their counterparties,  future
expected   loss  experience  and  other  factors.   Given  the  uncertainties
surrounding  these assumptions, the reported fair values represent  estimates
only  and, therefore, cannot be compared to the historical accounting  model.
Use  of  different  assumptions  or methodologies  is  likely  to  result  in
significantly different fair value estimates.

   The  fair  value  of  cash  and  cash equivalents  and  notes  receivables
approximates their current carrying amounts since all such items  are  short-
term  in  nature.   The  fair value of mortgages payable  approximates  their
current  carrying amounts since such amounts payable are at a current  market
rate of interest.
                                   -41-

NOTE 15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

  On January 10, 1996, the Company acquired Wood Valley Mobile Home Park from
an  unrelated  entity.   This  acquisition is a 161-space  mobile  home  park
located in Caledonia, Ohio.  The purchase price was $1,992,000.

   On January 9, 1996, the Company entered into a $1,000,000 mortgage payable
(River  Valley mortgage) to Bank One at an interest rate of prime.   Proceeds
from this mortgage were used to purchase Wood Valley Mobile Home Park.
