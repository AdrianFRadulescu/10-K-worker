Item 1. Business

     The registrant, United Grocers, Inc.  ("United" or "the Company"), a
wholesale grocery distributor, is an Oregon business corporation organized in
1915 which operates and is taxed as a cooperative.

     The Company supplies groceries and related products to independent retail
grocers located in Oregon, western Washington and northern California. 
United's goal is both to supply grocery products to retailers at prices which
enable them to compete effectively in the retail market, and to furnish them
other services, such as marketing assistance, engineering, accounting,
financing and insurance, which are important to the successful operation of a
retail grocery business.

     United also sells groceries and related products at wholesale through 35
Cash and Carry depots, principally to nonmember grocers, restaurants and
institutional buyers.  

     Consolidated revenues by principal product lines and services appear in
the following table:

     Financial data regarding the Company's industry segments is included in
the financial statements appearing in Item 8.

      United and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Grocers Insurance Group, Inc.,
Grocers Insurance Agency, Inc., Grocers Insurance Company, UGIC, Ltd., United
Workplace Consultants, Inc., Western Passage Express, Inc., United Store
Development, Ltd., Northwest Process, Inc., Western Security Services, Ltd.,
Premier Consulting, Inc., United Resources, Inc., U.G. Resources, Inc., and
B.A.T. Enterprises, Inc. provide a variety of services to members.

Marketing and Distribution

      Independent retail grocers within United's market area are eligible to
apply for membership.  All applicants for membership are subject to approval
by United's board of directors on the basis of financial responsibility and
operational ability.  On approval, applicants are required to purchase shares
of United's common stock.  United has approximately 253 members operating a
total of approximately 368 retail grocery stores.  

      Members receive periodic order guides indicating the price and
availability of various merchandise.  Members select the desired merchandise
and place their orders using United's computerized order system.  The
merchandise is picked up by the member or delivered by truck to the member's
retail facility.  

      No member or other customer of United accounts for as much as 10 percent
of its sales.  Management believes that the loss of any one or a few of its
members or other customers would not have a material effect on its business or
financial condition.

      Members are eligible to join United's group advertising programs. 
Members of advertising groups all do business under the group name, advertise
items jointly, are assessed fees for group marketing services, and take part
in group promotional programs.  Each advertising group has its own coordinator
and acts independently in passing upon applications of membership within the
group and deciding on promotional and advertising programs.

      United's Cash & Carry wholesale outlets provide a convenient, low-cost
method of purchasing groceries and institutional products for non-member
grocers, restaurants, and institutional buyers.  Cash & Carry customers select
their merchandise at the outlet much in the same manner that a customer at a
retail grocery store would.  Cash & Carry customers provide their own
transportation.

Supplies

      United purchases goods from a wide variety of sources ranging from local
farmers to large multinational corporations.  United attempts to obtain the
lowest possible price by pooling the buying power of its members.  United is
not dependent on any single supplier and the loss of any single supplier would
not have a material effect on its business.

      United is one of the five stockholders of Western Family Holding
Company, a corporation which pools the buying power of its stockholders in
order to obtain lower cost merchandise.  Purchases from Western Family Holding
Company, which account for about 12% of United's total purchases, are
distributed under labels such as "Western Family" and "Cottage."

Retail Services

      United provides a number of retail services to its members.  Services
which do not carry a specific fee or charge include marketing information,
merchandising assistance, competitive retail price reporting and developmental
services such as store site selection, design and engineering.

      United also offers its members, at a fee, complete bookkeeping,
accounting and tax services for their retail operations.  A computerized
payroll service is also available.  Other miscellaneous retail services which
generally carry a scheduled fee assessment include customized retail pricing,
retail shelf "unit pricing," and retail information service products.

      United, where appropriate, leases retail space and subleases the space
to qualified members to enable them to obtain prime commercial space.  At
September 29, 1995, United was obligated on 41 such leases.  Each such
sublease requires that the sublessee pay all charges which may be incurred by
United.  Lease insurance guaranteeing payment of rent in the event of default
covers a substantial amount of the lease payments.  United's subsidiary UGIC,
Ltd. provides lease insurance for 19 such subleases.  See "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information on these
subleases.

<PAGE>
Finance Services

      United's subsidiary, United Resources, Inc., makes loans and provides
other financial services to members.  Loans to members are generally made at
one and three quarters to two and one quarter percentage points over the prime
interest rate.  Such loans generally are for terms of one to ten years.  Loan
funds are obtained under a note purchase agreement with National Consumer
Cooperative Bank at rates varying with market interest rates.  At
September 29, 1995, the aggregate principal amount of member loans outstanding
due the subsidiary was $26,602,381.  The subsidiary's interest income for the
year then ended was approximately $3,117,000.  In the normal course of its
activities, United Resources, Inc., acquires retail stores through foreclosure
or purchase and operates them on a temporary basis.  United Resources owned
four such stores at September 29, 1995.  During 1995, United Resources
acquired two stores through foreclosure, purchased one store, and disposed of
three stores through sale or closure.

Insurance Services Overview

      Grocers Insurance Group, Inc. was formed on October 25, 1990, and is a
holding company for United's insurance-related subsidiaries.  Grocers
Insurance Group, Inc., assists in marketing insurance-related services offered
by those subsidiaries.

      Grocers Insurance Agency, Inc., is an insurance agency offering
property, casualty, crime, workers' compensation, group life, group health and
other types of insurance.  Sales of insurance, although primarily made to
members, are also made to nonmembers.  Commissions earned totaled
approximately $451,000 for the year ended September 29, 1995.

      Grocers Insurance Company (GIC), formerly United Employers Insurance
Co., underwrites insurance policies for property, casualty, and workers'
compensation.  Net premiums earned during 1995 increased to $20.7 million,
from $18.0 million in 1994.  GIC operates as a specialty insurer,
concentrating on grocery stores and food related businesses.  Currently
licensed in 24 states located primarily in the western region of the United
States, GIC has applications pending in several additional states,
concentrated in the Midwest.

    UGIC, Ltd. provides reinsurance services for property and casualty
insurance and workers' compensation.

    United Workplace Consultants, Inc., offers rehabilitation services to
insurance companies, principally those owned by United.  Service revenue for
the year ended September 29, 1995, was approximately $576,000.


Insurance Operations

    The following analysis of insurance operations is limited to Grocers
Insurance Company, the significant underwriting subsidiary of the Company.

Premiums Written

    An analysis of the GIC's premiums written during the last three years is
shown in the following table.
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                              $000
            Direct      Reinsurance Reinsurance Net
Year  Written     Assumed     Ceded       Written
- ----  -------     -------     -----       -------
<C>   <C>         <C>         <C>         <C>
1993  $24,431     $  716      $6,597      $18,550
1994   23,992        861       6,652       18,201
1995   27,809        698       7,364       21,143

</TABLE>

    The three states accounting for the largest amounts of direct premiums
written for the year ending September 29, 1995, were Oregon with 37%,
California with 23%, and Washington with 13%.  No other state accounted for
more than 7% of such premiums.  In 1995, there were no significant changes in
business, geographic mix or types of risks assumed.

Underwriting Results

    A commonly used industry measurement of property and casualty insurance
underwriting results is the combined loss and expense ratio.  This ratio is
the sum of the ratio of net incurred losses and related loss adjustment
expenses to net premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of underwriting
expenses to premiums written (expense ratio).  Underwriting results are
generally considered profitable when the combined ratio is under 100%.  The
industry computes this ratio on a calendar year statutory accounting basis for
comparison purposes.  The loss ratio, expense ratio, and combined ratio for
GIC for the last three calendar years are as follows:

            Loss        Expense     Combined
Year        Ratio       Ratio       Ratio
- ----        -----       -------     --------
1992        79.1%       21.6%       100.7%
1993        89.6%       13.0%       102.6%
1994        79.0%       21.9%       100.9%


These ratios compare to industry composite combined ratios of 114.6% for 1992,
105.5% for 1993, and 109.5% for 1994.

      There have been no unusually large gains or losses from underwriting or
investment operations during the year ending September 29, 1995.  There are no
effects from currency fluctuations, since all of GIC's business is transacted
within the United States.

Claims Operations

      GIC establishes estimates for reported claims on an individual case
basis.  Fast track types of reserving methods are not used.  The estimates are
based on GIC's experience within the grocery industry and specific knowledge
of facts regarding each individual claim.  These estimates are reviewed on a
regular basis or as additional information becomes available.

      Incurred But Not Reported ("IBNR") reserves are established for claims
which have occurred but are not yet reported to GIC as well as future
development on reported claims.  IBNR estimates are principally derived from
analysis of historical patterns of development of both paid and incurred
losses by line of business and accident years.  Independent professional
actuaries are engaged on an annual basis to analyze the overall reserving
accuracy of GIC.  IBNR reserves account for approximately 39% of GIC's total
unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses.

      Net Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses (LAE) for the last three
fiscal years are:

                              $000
                                          % Increase or
Year        Losses            LAE         Total (Decrease)
- ----        ------            ---         ----------------
1993        $23,747           $4,665      $28,412     13.9%
1994         22,968            4,671       27,639     (2.7)
1995         24,534            4,819       29,353      6.2 


For additional historical information on loss reserve development and
reconciliation of claims reserves, please refer to Appendix 1 and Appendix 2
to this report.

      During the year ending September 29, 1995, GIC adjusted reserves
recorded in prior years downward by approximately 10%, due to generally
favorable settlements on established case estimates for prior years claims and
an actuarially determined decrease in development factors previously used in
setting IBNR estimates.

      There have been no other significant changes in reserving assumptions.
GIC does not typically use structured settlements of any materiality.

Reinsurance

      In order to write policies above statutory limits, GIC reinsures limits
above $100,000 for all risks.  Multiple layers of reinsurance treaties are
placed with upper limits of $20 million for workers' compensation and
liability exposures, and limits of up to $3 million for property risks. 
Facultative reinsurance is purchased for property risks written with limits
above $3 million.

      GIC utilizes a reinsurance intermediary for assistance in the design and
placement of reinsurance coverage.  The structure of the reinsurance program
may vary slightly from year to year, but has remained essentially the same
since 1989.  Treaties are primarily placed on an excess basis, with an
additional surplus share treaty used for property risks.  Current reinsurers
on these main working layers are all rated A- or better by A.M. Best.

      GIC has not entered into any portfolio loss transfers or other types of
financial transactions involving loss reserves.

Risk Based Capital

      The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted,
effective December 31, 1994, a risk based capital formula for property and
casualty companies which will be used by insurance regulators in assessing the
capital adequacy of insurance companies.  The formula computes a required
level of capital based on the risks assumed by the insurer.  Various
regulatory actions are then prescribed if a company's ratio falls below its
minimum level.  The actions range from requiring the insurer to submit a
comprehensive action plan to the state of domicile to placing the insurer
under regulatory control.

      The ratio for GIC as determined at December 31, 1994 was significantly
above the levels which would require regulatory action.  Regulatory total
adjusted capital was $13.9 million: authorized control level risk based
capital is $1.5 million.

IRIS Ratios

      The NAIC produces an annual evaluation, the Insurance Regulatory
Information System (IRIS), utilizing data from the statutory annual statements
filed as of each December 31 with the state insurance departments.  The report
is intended to assist regulators in analysis of the financial conditions of
insurers and to aid in targeting troubled companies.  IRIS identifies eleven
industry values and specifies "unusual values" for each ratio that falls
outside a pre-determined range.  Regulators use the "unusual value"
designation as an indication of potential problems.

      GIC had no ratios designated as an "Unusual value" in its IRIS Report
for the year ended December 31, 1994.

A.M. Best Ratings

      A.M. Best Company, Inc., ratings are indications of the solvency of an
insurer and are derived from analysis of the financial conditions and
operations of a company relative to the insurance industry in general.  The
1994 A.M. Best letter ratings range from A++ ("Superior") to F ("In
Liquidation").  GIC applied for an initial rating in 1991 and was rated a B+. 
In 1994, GIC was upgraded to an A- rating, with a financial size category of
V. 
      GIC believes that the attainment of an "A-" rating has had a favorable
impact on the marketing of its policies.


Other Services

  Western Passage Express, Inc., provides freight services to United and
others.  Northwest Process, Inc., provides store displays, advertising
materials, and printing services.  U. G. Resources, Inc., leases retail space
which is subleased to member store operators.  Western Security Services,
Ltd., and Premier Consulting, Inc., provide various security and employment
management services.

Recent Acquisition Activity

      In January, 1995, United acquired the assets of Rich and Rhine, Inc., a
Portland based distributor of tobacco and candy products, for $3.3 million.  
The operations acquired from Rich and Rhine added approximately $29 million to
United's total revenue during the year ended September 29, 1995.

      Also in January, 1995, United acquired the assets of Commissary Cash &
Carry, Inc., for approximately $1.8 million.  The four stores owned by
Commissary were added to the Company's Cash & Carry division.  These stores
accounted for approximately $9.0 million in sales during the year ended
September 29, 1995.

      In December, 1995, United acquired the assets and related business of
the wholesale division of Bay Area Foods, Inc., doing business as Market
Wholesale Grocery ("Market Wholesale").  The acquired operations engage in
wholesale distribution of groceries and related merchandise to independent
grocers and restaurants located in California.  United purchased approximately
$36 million in wholesale-related assets, consisting principally of
inventories, accounts receivable, customer loans, and equipment.  United
assumed liabilities of approximately $16 million plus obligations under real
and personal property leases.  The real estate leases cover three warehouse
locations in Santa Rosa, Tracy, and Modesto, California.  Personal property
leases relate to tractors and trailer assets used in the business of Market
Wholesale.

      Estimated annual revenues from the acquired operations are approximately
$300 million.  As part of the acquisition, United entered into an agreement to
sell groceries and related merchandise to retail stores owned by the seller
for a period of five years.  Historically, the seller's retail stores have
accounted for 20% of the total wholesale volume of Market Wholesale.

Competition

      The grocery industry is characterized by intense competition.  In order
to compete effectively, a wholesale grocer must have the ability to meet
competitive market prices which fluctuate rapidly, provide a wide range of
perishable and nonperishable products, make prompt and efficient delivery and
provide the peripheral services which are required by modern supermarket
operations.

      United believes that it accounts for a larger volume of sales of
groceries than any other wholesaler in its grocery marketing area, which is
comprised of Oregon, the northernmost part of California and western
Washington.  United's principal competitors are two national grocery
wholesalers (which because of their operations in other areas are larger than
United) and three regional grocery wholesalers.

      The recent acquisition of the assets and business of Market Wholesale is
expected to shift a greater portion of the Company's wholesale volume to the
California market, and expand the Company's operations from Northern
California to additional regions of the state.  With the expansion of
operations, an additional regional grocery wholesaler will become a competitor
of the Company.

      Other competitors include a number of local grocery wholesalers, many of
whom are limited to special product lines, such as candy or produce, or sell
only to limited market segments, such as restaurants or institutions.  United
also competes with a significant number of producers which market their
products directly to retailers and with several chain store organizations
which control both their wholesale and retail operations.  United's
competitors range from small local businesses to businesses significantly
larger than United.  Based on information available to it, United estimates
that its members, many of whom are in competition with one another, account
for approximately 16% of the retail grocery market within United's marketing
area.  Although members are free to purchase from sources other than United, 
members generally purchase goods (except goods which United does not supply, 
such as beer and wine) principally from United.  United does not account for a
significant percentage of the national wholesale grocery market.

      Competition in the markets served by the Company's customers continues
to be intense.  The Company continues to respond with new programs to be more
price competitive and has increased item selection and variety in several
product areas.  Further, the Company's member volume allowance program has
been designed to share the savings associated with larger order efficiencies
from its member stores, thereby reducing the participating member's cost of
product.

      Recent trends in the results of the Company's member stores have
continued.  In general, members outside major metropolitan areas, and those
operating newer stores, price oriented or super store formats registered
various gains in volume.  Members operating average-sized conventional stores
generally registered small volume losses overall.  

      Like the grocery industry, the insurance industry is highly competitive.
Grocers Insurance Group is well positioned to serve the retail food industry.
Due to its specialization in the retail food business, Grocers Insurance Group
generally operates on lower expense ratios than most of its competitors,
allowing it to offer competitive prices for its policies.

Employees

      United employed approximately 1,700 persons at September 29, 1995. 
Approximately 880 of its employees are members of Teamster or other unions. 
Collective bargaining contracts with the unions are negotiated through an
employer association to which United and other major food distributors in its
marketing area belong.

      United's collective bargaining agreements expire in April, 1996.  The
Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.

      The acquisition of the assets and business of Market Wholesale increased
the number of persons employed by United by approximately 300.  Approximately
220 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Environment and Energy

      United's operations are not of a type which ordinarily result in the
discharge of significant quantities of pollutants.  United believes that its
operations substantially meet or exceed all applicable environmental
regulations.

      United has, for a number of years, maintained a program of collecting
waste paper products from its members and from its own operations.  This waste
paper is then sold to a paper company for recycling.  Members participating in
this program receive weekly credits reflecting their participation in the
program.

      United primarily uses electricity in the operation of its warehouses and
diesel fuel in the operation of its truck fleet.  United believes that it has
adequate sources of supply to meet its anticipated energy needs.  United's
energy suppliers have indicated that, because of the nature of United's
business, it would be entitled to priority in the event of any future energy
shortages.

Cost Savings

      By pooling the buying power of its members, United is able to purchase
goods in large quantities at prices lower than the prices generally available
to independent retail grocers.  The savings from the bulk purchases are passed
along to members in the form of rebates, allowances and patronage dividends.

      Sales to members are invoiced to their accounts at prices contained in
United's order guide.  A partnership incentive program results in the addition
or subtraction of a percentage of the member's weekly invoice cost based on
the member's average weekly purchases by department for the preceding four
weeks, excluding purchases of drop shipments.  The partnership incentive
percentages are designed to reflect the economies of scale realized by United
in servicing various sized accounts.

      Rebates and allowances are paid to members periodically based upon their
purchases of particular items or their promotional and advertising
performance.  Generally, such rebates and allowances stem from United's
margins and the merchandising or promotional programs of United's suppliers.  

      United also pays its members annual patronage dividends based on the
overage, or excess of revenues over expenses, on sales to members for the
year.  Each year United's board of directors determines the portion of the
overage which is to be distributed as patronage dividends.  Decisions
concerning the portion of the overage to be retained are based upon various
factors including United's future capital needs and the amount of earnings
available from operations not qualifying for distribution as patronage 
dividends.  The patronage dividends are allocated among the members in
proportion to the contribution to United's gross profit (before rebates and
allowances) attributable to their purchases from United.  The patronage
dividends are paid partly in cash and partly in Membership Stock.

Government Contract Business

      The Company does not generate significant business based upon contracts
with local, state or federal government entities.

Income Taxes

      United operates and is taxed as a cooperative.  Accordingly, patronage
dividends are not included in United's taxable income but are instead taxed to
the individual members receiving the patronage dividends.  The Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code") requires that not less than 20
percent of each member's patronage dividend be paid in cash.  United's
patronage dividend policy meets that requirement, providing for cash payments
of up to 100% of dividends based on ratios of the value of stock holdings by
member stores to their average weekly purchases, and total number of shares of
stock owned.  Patronage dividends not paid in cash are paid in additional
Membership Stock.  Members are required to agree to abide by all United's
bylaw provisions, including those applicable to federal income taxation of
patronage dividends.  Accordingly, members must report as taxable income the
total amount of patronage dividends, whether paid in cash or Membership Stock,
in the year such patronage dividends are received, and such amounts are not
taxable to United.  

      United is taxed on income which does not qualify for distribution as
patronage dividends and on the portion of overage which is not distributed to
members.  United's subsidiaries retain all profits (or losses) from their
operations and are part of the consolidated federal income tax return.

Item 2.  Properties

      United owns and operates two distribution centers.  Its main
distribution center, located in Milwaukie, Oregon, contains over 815,000
square feet of warehouse space situated on a 62-acre site, owned by United. 
Also at this location are 84,900 square feet of office space, a 20,000-square-

      United and its subsidiaries operate a truck fleet consisting of 168
tractor cabs and 362 dry freight and refrigerated semitrailers, including both
owned and leased units other than those acquired from Market Wholesale.  In
connection with its acquisition of Market Wholesale, United assumed leases
covering an additional 20 tractors and 31 trailers.

      United leases a mainframe computer, together with related peripheral
equipment, under various leases expiring in April, 1997.  The leases call for
annual rental of approximately $797,000.

      total members' equity at year end, stock to be issued from patronage and
      paid-in capital on such stock, unrealized gain on investments, and
      undistributed equity from investments accounted for on the equity method
      and dividing the resulting number by shares outstanding at year end.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Overview

            During fiscal year 1995, net sales and operations increased 6.7%
to $1,018.2 million.  This compares to an 8.8% increase in 1994 to $954.2
million.  Income before members' allowances, patronage dividends, and income
taxes decreased $0.7 million to $22.0 million (2.16% of sales).  This compares
to $22.7 million (2.38% of sales) and $20.6 million (2.35% of sales) in 1994
and 1993 respectively.

            During 1995, the increase in net sales and operations was
primarily attributable to the distribution segment which enjoyed increased
Cash & Carry unit volume and increased sales from the Company's acquisition of
Rich and Rhine, Inc.  In addition, the insurance segment generated increased
sales primarily due to increased premium volume from growth in policies
issued.  These gains in sales were offset by lower sales from company-owned
retail stores.

            In 1995, the Company had increased profits within its distribution
segment from its Cash & Carry and other nonmember distribution segment
operations, and lower operating losses at company-owned retail stores.  Within
the insurance segment, profits increased from agency operations and lease
insurance activities.  These profit gains were offset by higher interest
expenses due to higher borrowing rates and average levels of debt, increased
operating expenses in the distribution segment, and increased property losses
in Grocers Insurance Company.

            In December, 1995, United acquired the assets and related business
of the wholesale division of Bay Area Foods, Inc., doing business as Market
Wholesale Grocery.  Estimated annual revenues from the acquired operations are
approximately $300 million.

            In 1994, the increase in net sales and operations was primarily
attributed to increased Cash & Carry unit volume, and increased equipment
sales.  These gains in sales were offset by lower premium income of the
insurance segment.  1994 profit improvements were primarily due to increased
profits from Cash & Carry and service income areas, and gains in insurance
segment profits caused by improved loss experience.  These gains in profits
were offset by higher distribution segment operating expenses, increased
member allowances paid, and operating losses in retail store operations.

Net Sales and Operations

            During 1995, sales of the Company's distribution segment increased
6.5% to $997.0 million. The sales gain was primarily due to increased Cash &
Carry and equipment sales unit volume, and sales from Rich and Rhine, Inc.
Price changes during 1995 impacted warehouse sales by 2.8%.

            Cash & Carry sales increased 15.0% to $206.3 million compared to
$179.4 million in 1994.  Sales at new units contributed 7.4% to the sales
increase. 

            Sales at company-owned retail stores, which are primarily acquired
as a result of store finance operations, decreased $3.7 million to $42.5
million.  During the year, the company acquired three stores, and disposed of
three stores.  As a result, the number of company-owned retail stores remained
at four stores.

            In 1995, the insurance segment's net insurance premiums,
commissions, and fees increased $4.0 million to $22.8 million. The increase
was primarily attributed to increased policy volume, and earned lease
insurance premiums.

            During 1994, distribution segment sales increased 5.9% to
$936.2 million.  The sales gain was primarily attributed to increased unit
volume.  The insurance segment's net premiums, commissions, and fees decreased
$1.7 million due to lower commissions earned by Grocers Insurance Agency.

Gross Operating Income

            Gross operating income increased to $148.2 million (14.6% of
sales) in 1995 from $137.5 million (14.4% of sales) in 1994, and $127.5
million (14.5% of sales) in 1993.  The increase in gross operating income was
due to higher unit sales, gross margin improvements in Cash & Carry operations
from centralized pricing controls, and higher insurance commissions, fees, and
lease insurance premiums.  These improvements were offset by higher property
loss experience in Grocers Insurance Company, and lower retail store sales.

            In 1995, loss and loss adjustment expenses were 74.7% of total
premium income, compared to 64.7% and 83.3% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Operating, Selling, and Administrative Expenses

            In 1995, operating, selling, and administrative expenses increased
$8.3 million to $111.8 million (11.0% of sales).  In 1994 and 1993, these
expenses were $103.5 million (10.9% of sales), and $97.5 million (11.1% of
sales), respectively. The components of these expenses are summarized below:


<PAGE>
                                     Percent of Total Sales
                                    1995        1994        1993
                                    ----        ----        ----
Salaries & Wages                     6.1         6.0         6.3
Rents, Maintenance, and Repairs      1.7         1.7         1.6
Taxes, Other Than Income             0.8         0.9         0.9
Utilities, Supplies, & Services      1.1         1.6         1.5
Other Expenses                       1.0         0.5         0.5
Provision for Doubtful Accounts      0.2         0.2         0.3
Total                               11.0        10.9        11.1


            During 1995, total operating, selling, and administrative expenses
increased primarily due to higher unit volume in both the distribution and
insurance segments, higher software expenses, and amortization of covenants
not to compete and goodwill relating to recent acquisitions.

            Insurance segment operating expenses decreased to 32.3% of segment
net sales and operations.  In 1994 and 1993, insurance segment operating
expenses were 36.3% and 26.4% of segment net sales and operations,
respectively.

            Provision for doubtful accounts was $1.9 million (0.2% of sales)
in 1995.  This compares to $2.0 million (0.3% of sales) and $2.2 million (0.3%
of sales) in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

            Interest expense increased $3.6 million to $12.8 million (1.3% of
sales) in 1995.  This increase was due to higher levels of average debt, as
well as higher average borrowing rates.

Member Allowances and Dividends

            In 1995, total member allowances and dividends decreased 1.6% to
$19.9 million (2.0% of sales).  In 1994, total member allowances and dividends
increased 9.9% to $20.2 million (2.1% of sales).

            Total member allowances and dividends as a percent of member sales
decreased to 2.84% in 1995, compared to 2.90% in 1994, and 2.75% in 1993.

Net Income and Income Taxes

            In 1995, income before taxes was $2.2 million (0.2% of sales)
compared to $2.6 million (0.3% of sales) and $2.3 million (0.3% of sales) in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

            Net income after taxes was $1.4 million (0.1% of sales) in 1995, a
decrease of $0.2 million from $1.6 million (0.2% of sales) and $1.7 million
(0.2% of sales) in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow From Operating Activities

      In 1995, the Company used $14.9 million in cash in its operating
activities.  Increases in accounts receivable and inventories as a result of
increased volume and acquisitions, and investments by the Company in its new
information services platform were the major factors contributing to the use
of cash in operations.

Cash Flow From Investing Activities

      In 1995, the Company used $2.9 million in its investing activities, a
decrease of $13.4 million from the $16.3 million used in 1994. Cash
requirements of the Company's retail member finance activities were reduced in
1995 due to a $12.2 million increase in proceeds from the sale of member loans
under its Note Purchase Agreement during the year.  Purchases of property and
equipment increased to $10.4 million from $5.3 million in 1994.

      In fiscal year 1995, anticipated capital expenditures will approximate
$5.0 million, representing $1.0 million in replacement assets, $2.0 million
for new Cash & Carry units, and $2.0 million in continuing investments in
upgraded operations software.

Cash Flow From Financing Activities

      In 1995, the Company provided $17.8 million from its financing
activities by increasing its levels of senior debt to fund its operations.

Capital Structure and Resources

      The following table summarizes the Company's capital structure for the
last two years:
                                         Year Ended
                        -------------------------------------------------
                        September 29, 1995            September 30, 1994
                        $000        %                 $000        %
                        ------------------            ------------------
Average Short Term
Borrowings              $42,632     20.6              $34,775     17.7

End of Year Amounts
Senior Term Debt        $68,135     32.9              $67,597     34.4
Subordinated Debt       $53,844     26.0              $53,848     27.4
Equity                  $42,357     20.5              $40,425     20.5

Total                   206,968     100.0             $196,645    100.0

      In 1995, the Company's capital structure shifted towards greater use of
short-term borrowings, due to increased funding needs.  The present components
of the capital structure are within the Company's long-term targets for
funding sources.

      In 1995, the Company's working capital increased $7.2 million to $52.5
million.  The Company's main sources of funds include earnings, member capital
stock, capital investment notes, bank debt, private placement debt, and note
purchase programs.  As of September 29, 1995, the Company had $24.5 million in
unused credit lines available.  In addition, the Company had $8.4 million
available under its Note Purchase Agreement.

      The Company purchased the net assets of the wholesale operations of Bay
Area Foods, Inc., on December 14, 1995, for approximately $21 million. 
Funding for the acquisition was provided by increased bank credit.  The
Company anticipates refinancing the additional bank credit with new senior
debt or the securitization of eligible trade accounts receivable.

      Grocers Insurance Company investments are held to support the payment of
claims.  These investments are not available to the Company to meet its
capital needs due to restrictions imposed by insurance regulators regarding
intercompany loans and advances.

      In addition, state regulators require that Grocers Insurance Company
maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus.  As a result of these
regulatory requirements, $4.6 million of Grocers Insurance Company's equity
may not be paid as dividends to the Company.

Board of Directors
United Grocers, Inc. 


                         INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
Grocers, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 29, 1995 and September 30,
1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 1995. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Grocers,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 29, 1995 and September 30, 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 29, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for investments in 1994-95.  Also, as
discussed in Notes 4 and 11, the Company changed its method of accounting for
inventories in 1992-93 and for reinsurance in 1993-94.

                     UNITED GROCERS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995


1.    Summary of significant accounting policies

  a.  Reporting year

      United Grocers, Inc. (the Parent) and subsidiaries (the Company) reports
      on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks which is the fiscal year of the
      distribution segment.  The Parent's fiscal closing date is the Friday
      nearest September 30.  The fiscal year of the subsidiaries included in
      the insurance segment ends on September 30.

  b.  Organization

      The Parent operates primarily as a wholesale grocery cooperative.  The
      Parent's stock is owned by its member customers.  Sales to these members
      account for approximately 80% of the wholesale grocery sales.

  c.  Principles of consolidation

      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United
      Grocers, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as follows:  Grocers
      Insurance Group, Inc., Grocers Insurance Agency, Inc., UGIC, Ltd.,
      Grocers Insurance Company, United Workplace Consultants, Inc., Western
      Passage Express, Inc., Northwest Process, Inc., UG Resources, Inc.,
      United Resources, Inc., Affiliated General Agency, Inc., Premier
      Consulting, Inc., Western Security Services, Ltd., Rich and Rhine, Inc.
      (new in 1995) and BAT Enterprises, Inc.  All intercompany balances and
      transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  Investment in
      affiliated companies is stated at cost plus the Company's share of
      undistributed earnings since acquisition (see Note 16).

  d.  Investments

      Beginning in 1994-95, the Company accounts for investments in accordance
      with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,
      Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, issued
      May 1993.  See Note 2 for details.  Investments are primarily in non-
      equity securities.  The Company's intent is to hold most of these
      securities until maturity.  Sales and redemptions of investments are
      primarily the result of maturities.  Any realized gains or losses are
      usually the result of immaterial differences between the called amount
      and amortized cost.  The market value of these investments at September
      29, 1995 and September 30, 1994 is $41,610,228 and $36,487,841,
      respectively.  

  e.  Inventories and cost of sales

      Inventories relate primarily to the distribution operation and are
      valued at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of these inventories is
      determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  See Note 4 for
      change in accounting for inventories.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995


1.    Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

  e.  Inventories and cost of sales (continued)

      Cost of sales includes primarily the cost of distribution and insurance
      operations.  The distribution operation costs include the purchases of
      product net of allowances paid and received, less the net advertising
      department margins, plus the handling allowances made to members based
      upon the cost of servicing their accounts.  The insurance operation
      costs include losses reported, a provision for losses incurred but not
      reported and premium refunds.

  f.  Restricted assets and net assets

      Restricted assets and net assets that may not be transferred to the
      parent company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends by the
      insurance company subsidiary without the consent of various state
      insurance agencies as of September 29, 1995 are as follows:

         Cash and cash equivalents                    $   350,238
         Investments                                   17,284,345
                                                      -----------
         Total                                        $17,634,583
                                                      ===========

      In addition, although not formally restricted, the balance of the
      investments of $23,326,533 represents assets that have been accumulated
      for the possible payment of claims against the insurance reserves.

  g.  Property, plant and equipment

      Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost and includes
      expenditures for new facilities and those which substantially increase
      the useful lives of the existing plant and equipment.  The Company
      capitalizes interest as a component of the cost of significant
      construction projects.    During the year ended October 1, 1993,
      interest was capitalized in the amount of $64,929 out of a total
      interest of $8,281,946 which resulted in an increase in the net income
      of approximately $49,000.  No interest was capitalized in 1995 or 1994.

      Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
      estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Estimated useful lives
      are generally as follows:

         Buildings                                    40 - 75 years
         Building improvements                        Balance of building life
         Warehouse equipment                          5 - 20 years
         Truck equipment                              3 -  8 years
         Office equipment                             5 - 10 years

                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995

1.    Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

  h.  Amortization

      Long-term liability loan costs, software costs, goodwill, and non-
      competition agreements are being amortized and charged to operating
      expenses on a straight-line basis over five to twenty years.

  i.  Reinsurance

      In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the loss
      that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable
      underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various
      areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers. 
      Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
      with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.  Amounts
      paid for prospective reinsurance are reported as prepaid reinsurance
      premiums and amortized over the remaining contract period in proportion
      to the amount of insurance protection provided.

  j.  Income taxes

      The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax
      return.  Income tax expense is allocated among those companies with
      taxable income.  The Company operates and is taxed as a cooperative. 
      Accordingly, amounts distributed as patronage dividends are not included
      in its taxable income but are instead taxed to the individual members
      receiving the patronage dividends.  Deferred income taxes are recorded
      to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between
      the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
      amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax
      rates applicable to the years in which the differences are expected to
      affect taxable income.  In 1995 a valuation allowance of $2,994,000 was
      considered necessary for state NOL carryovers to reduce the deferred tax
      asset to the amount expected to be realized.  Income tax expense is the
      tax payable for the year and the change during the year in net deferred
      tax assets and liabilities.  See Note 9 for details.  

  k.  Earnings per common share

      The Company's policy is to distribute earnings only in the form of
      patronage dividends.  No dividends have ever been declared on the common
      stock of the Company, and all earnings not distributed as patronage
      dividends have been retained.  Earnings per common share are not shown
      because no earnings are available for the purpose of paying dividends on
      the common stock.

  l.  Treasury stock

      The Company uses the par value method of accounting for treasury stock. 
      Under Oregon corporation law, treasury stock must be canceled upon
      redemption.

1.    Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

  m.  Common stock

      The Company's board policy, subject to change without notice, requires
      the Company to repurchase on request the number of shares a member owns
      in excess of 4,000 shares.  The excess shares are repurchased over a
      five year period at the current adjusted book value each year, payable
      in cash.  At September 29, 1995 and September 30, 1994, there were
      18,229 and 22,409 shares, respectively, subject to repurchase in the
      amount of $1,084,626 and $1,277,313, respectively.  At September 29,
      1995 and September 30, 1994, there were 1,471 and 2,869 shares,
      respectively, held for possible redemption in the amount of $87,525 and
      $163,533, respectively.

  n.  Advertising costs

      The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the first time
      the advertising takes place.  Advertising expense for 1995, 1994 and
      1993 was $1,191,436, $1,027,214 and $981,399, respectively.

  o.  Statement of cash flows

      For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
      highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
      or less to be cash equivalents.

  p.  Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to
      conform to the current year classification.
                                       
2.    Investments

  Investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115 (see Note 1.d.) are classified
  and accounted for as follows:

      .  Held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost.
      .  Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
         and losses included in earnings.
      .  Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with
         unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a
         separate component of members' equity.

  SFAS No. 115 is not applied retroactively to prior years' financial
  statements.  The effect on retained earnings of initially applying this
  statement is reported as a change in accounting principle.  The cumulative
  effect as of October 1, 1994 was an unrealized loss of approximately
  $46,000.

  For the year ended September 29, 1995 (initial year of application) the
  gross proceeds from the sales of securities available-for-sale was
  $3,607,299.  The gross realized gains from these sales were $142,257. 
  There were no realized losses.  The method used to determine cost when
  calculating the realized gains was the amortized cost of the specific
  security sold.  There are no gains or losses included in earnings as a
  result of transfers of securities between categories.  There were no
  securities classified as trading securities during this initial year.

  During this initial year, because of changing market conditions, management
  decided to transfer certain securities from held-to-maturity category to
  the available-for-sale category.  The amortized cost of these securities at
  the time of transfer was $4,751,807 with a related net unrealized gain of
  $386,834.

  The amortized cost and estimated market value of debt securities at the
  balance sheet date, by contractual maturity, are shown below.  Expected
  maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may
  have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or
  prepayment penalties.

  The provision for doubtful accounts and notes charged to operating expenses
  for the three years ended September 29, 1995 amounted to $1,894,189,
  $1,992,589, and $2,182,551, respectively.

4.    Change in accounting for inventories

  The Company changed in 1992-93 its method of accounting for the cost of the
  general wholesale grocery category of inventories from the last-in, first-
  out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  The Company
  believes that the use of the FIFO method better matches current costs with
  current revenues and more appropriately reflects its financial condition. 
  This change has also been made for income tax purposes.

                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995


7.    Notes payable - bank

  Notes payable - bank consists of borrowings on bank lines of credit at a
  weighted average interest rate of 6.75% at September 29, 1995 and 5.72% at
  September 30, 1994.

  At September 29, 1995 and September 30, 1994, the Company had unused lines
  of credit totaling $24,500,000 and $19,000,000, respectively; and unused
  letters of credit totaling $350,000 at September 30, 1994, only.

  In April of 1993, the Company entered into a three year reverse interest
  swap agreement with a bank.  Under the agreement, the Company receives a
  fixed rate of 4.40% on $20 million (notional amount) and pays a floating
  rate based on LIBOR, as determined in six month intervals.  The transaction
  effectively changes a portion of the Company's interest rate exposure from
  a fixed rate to a floating rate basis, accordingly, all gains or losses
  have been recognized as adjustments to interest expense.  This swap
  agreement has been entered into with a major financial institution which is
  expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement thereby further
  mitigating the risk from the transaction.

   The Company has net operating loss carryovers of approximately $3,500,000
   to apply against future years' State income taxes, expiring in years 2007
   through 2010.  These operating loss carryovers are the result of the
   insurance company subsidiary being required to file a separate calendar
   year State tax return and not giving the parent the benefit of this offset
   on its State tax return.  The Company also has unused State energy tax
   credits of approximately $45,000, expiring in 1998.

10.    Members' patronage dividends

   The Company's income from sales to members, before income taxes and
   patronage dividends, is available, at the discretion of the Board of
   Directors, to be returned to the members in the form of patronage
   dividends.  As of year end, the Board of Directors voted to distribute the
   following in patronage dividends:

11. Reinsurance

    The Company in 1994 adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
    Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts, issued in December, 1992. 
    The Statement requires that transactions relating to reinsurance
    transactions be reported at gross amounts rather than net amounts.  The
    effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company is to
    gross up the insurance liabilities by reclassifying the ceded reinsurance
    amounts for reinsurance recoverables and prepaid reinsurance premiums as
    assets.

                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995


11. Reinsurance (continued)

    There is no effect or change to the consolidated income statement as the
    income statement classifications did not change.  Net premiums earned
    continue to be reported as net sales and operations while net losses and
    loss adjustment expenses continue to be reported as cost of sales.

    Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligation to
    policyholders.  Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could
    result in losses to the Company.  The Company evaluates the financial
    condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk
    arising from similar geographic regions, activities, or economic
    characteristics of the reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant
    losses from reinsurer insolvencies.

    Reinsurance amounts reflected in the financial statements are as follows:

12. Segment reporting

    The Company has two operating segments which are located primarily in the
    Pacific Northwest.  The distribution segment includes all operations
    relating to wholesale grocery and related product sales, retail grocery
    sales, service department revenues, and financing income and fees.  The
    insurance segment includes all operations relating to insurance
    underwriting, commissions, and reinsurance primarily to provide workers'
    compensation and property-casualty coverage.

    A summary of information about the Company's operations by segment before
    intersegment eliminations for the three years is as follows:

    For net sales and operations, wholesale grocery sales (primarily to
    members) during the three years ended September 29, 1995 accounted for
    approximately 93%, 95% and 93%, respectively, of the distribution total. 
    Premium revenue (primarily from members) accounted for approximately 96%,
    95% and 90%, respectively, of the insurance total.

    The change in the method of accounting for inventories (Note 4) related
    to and affected only the distribution segment.

13.    Retirement plans

   The Company has a Company-sponsored pension plan that covers substantially
   all of its salaried employees.  The Company also has separate Company-
   sponsored 401(k) plans for salaried and union employees.  The Company has
   made annual contributions to the plans equal to the amount annually
   accrued for pension expense.  The Company's funding policy is to satisfy
   the funding requirements of the Employees' Retirement Income Security Act.

   The Company also participates in several multi-employer pension plans for
   the benefit of its employees who are union members.  The data available
   from administrators of the multi-employer plans is not sufficient to
   determine the accumulated benefit obligation, nor the net assets
   attributable to the multi-employer plans in which the Company's union
   employees participate.

   The financial statements include pension expense for the company-sponsored
   pension plan as determined using Statement of Financial Accounting
   Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions.  The effect
   of SFAS 87 was a decrease of pension expense in the amount of $362,794 for
   1995, $546,894 for 1994, and $484,020 for 1993.  The Company's
   unrecognized net asset resulting from the initial application of SFAS 87
   is being amortized over eighteen years.
                                                                     
   In determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
   obligation, a discount rate of 8% and a future maximum compensation
   increase rate of 4% were used.  The expected long-term rate of return on
   assets was 8%.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995


13. Retirement plans (continued)

    In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides health benefits for
    certain retired salaried employees.  The Financial Accounting Standards
    Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
    Employer's Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. 
    This statement will require accrual of such benefits during the years an
    employee provides services.  The costs of these benefits are currently
    expensed on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The cost of this retiree health care
    is funded out of current operations and was approximately $349,000 in
    1995, $356,000 in 1994 and $282,000 in 1993.  The impact of this new
    standard has not been fully determined, but the change likely will result
    in a greater liability and expense being recognized for these benefits. 
    The Company has until 1995-96 to adopt this Statement because fewer than
    500 employees will be affected.  

14. Leases

    The Company is obligated under one hundred and thirteen significant
    leases in 1995.  Forty-one of these leases are for twenty to            
    twenty-five years with renewal options and involve supermarket properties
    which are subleased to members.  Six of these leases are subleased to
    affiliated companies.  The remaining leases represent property and
    equipment used by the Company.  The leases expire at various dates, the
    last expiring in 2018.  Rental expense for the three years consists of
    the following:

                                          1995          1994         1993

    (A)  Minimum payments are those required by the Company over the terms of
         the significant leases.

    (B)  Minimum receipts are those to be received by the Company from
         sublease agreements.

         Nineteen of the subleases as of September 29, 1995, are insured by
         the Company's foreign subsidiary, UGIC, Ltd.  The annual rental for
         these leases is approximately $1,900,000.  The total remaining
         minimum payments over the lease term for these same leases is
         approximately $26,900,000.

    The Company has sale-leaseback transactions for four cash and carry
    outlets.  The sales resulted in deferred gains of approximately
    $1,200,000 which are being amortized over the leaseback period of fifteen
    years.  The total remaining lease commitments are approximately
    $4,250,000 over fifteen years with an annual rental of approximately
    $310,000.

   grocery stores and are also members of the Company.

       C & K Market, Inc.                                         22%
       R.A.F. Limited Liability Company                           50%

   All of these affiliates are privately held companies for which no ready
   market values are available.  In management's opinion the equity interest
   as stated is equal to or less than the fair value of their interest in
   these affiliates.
   
17.    Concentrations of credit risk

   The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents in several banks located
   in the Pacific Northwest and a zero balance bank account located in the
   Midwest.  Each bank is covered by FDIC insurance; balances in excess of
   coverage are not insured.

   As a cooperative, the majority of the Company's accounts receivable
   represent sales to its members who are located throughout the Pacific
   Northwest.  These accounts are not generally secured by collateral but
   each member has stock holdings in the Company as well as patronage rebates
   which the Company could apply against account balances.

                 FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995


17.    Concentrations of credit risk (continued)

   The Company makes store financing loans to members from time to time
   mainly to finance the acquisition of grocery store properties and
   equipment.  These loans are represented by notes receivable which are
   secured by collateral consisting of personal property, securities and
   guarantees.  See Note 18a. for sale of notes subject to limited recourse
   provisions.

   The insurance subsidiaries have investments primarily in federal
   securities and state municipal bonds which are backed by the full faith
   and credit of the respective governmental agency.  See Note 2 for
   investment details.

18. Commitments and contingencies
                                                
    a.   The Company has entered into various agreements under which it sells
         certain of its notes receivable from members subject to limited
         recourse provisions.  These notes are secured by collateral which
         usually consists of personal property, securities and guarantees. 
         The Company in turn receives a monthly service fee. In 1995, 1994
         and 1993, the Company sold notes totaling approximately $20,800,000,
         $8,625,000 and $900,000, respectively.  The balances of transferred
         notes that were outstanding and subject to recourse provisions were
         $28,537,400, $13,652,000 and $13,441,000 at September 29, 1995,
         September 30, 1994 and October 1, 1993, respectively.

    b.   In connection with its loan activities to members, the Company has
         approved loan applications totaling approximately $12,700,000 for
         which funds have been committed, but not disbursed, as of September
         29, 1995.

    c.   The Company is guarantor of a covenant by a member as of September
         29, 1995 totaling $300,000 with annual principal payments of
         approximately $50,000.

    d.   The Company is a party to various litigation and claims arising in
         the ordinary course of business.  While the ultimate effect of such
         actions cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company expects that
         the outcome of these matters will not result in a material adverse
         effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results
         of operations.
    
19. Subsequent event

    In December 1995 the Company entered into a transaction to acquire
    certain assets and assume certain liabilities and property leases of a
    wholesale grocery operation in California.  The approximate net book
    value purchase amount was $19,200,000.  The approximate annual sales
    volume for this new operation is $300,000,000.

              (a)       Vested Benefits.  The present value of all benefits
vested under all Plans did not, as of the most recent valuation date of such
Plans, exceed the value of the assets of the Plans allocable to such vested
benefits by an amount which would represent a potential material liability of
Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries or affect materially the ability of
Borrower to perform this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents.

              (b)       Prohibited Transactions.  To the best of Borrower's
knowledge, no plan or trust created thereunder, or any trustee or
administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term
is defined in Section406 or Section2003(a) of ERISA) which could subject such
Plan or any other Plan, any trust created thereunder, or any trustee or
administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any Plan or any such trust to
the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section502 or
Section2003(a) of ERISA.

              (c)       Reportable Events.  There have been no "reportable
events" (as that term is defined in Section4043 of ERISA) whether or not
waived, since the effective date of ERISA.

              (d)       Funding Deficiency.  No Plan or trust created
thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is
defined in Section 302 of ERISA) whether or not waived, since the effective
date of ERISA.

              (e)       Violation of Code.  The required allocations and
contributions of all Plans will not violate Section 415 of the Code.

              2.14      Law Compliance.  Borrower is in compliance with all
applicable federal and state laws (including federal and state anti-trust laws
and laws relating to the environment and to the safety of the workplace) the
noncompliance with which could singly or in the aggregate have a material
adverse impact on the business, affairs, assets, financial condition or
business prospects of Borrower.

              2.15      Federal Reserve Regulations.  Borrower is not engaged
principally or as one of its important activities in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock (within the
meaning of Federal Reserve Regulation U), and no part of the proceeds of any
Advance will be used to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit
to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

              2.16      Title to Properties; Liens.  Borrower has good,
sufficient and legal title to all the properties and assets reflected in its
audited consolidated balance sheet dated as of December 30, 1994, except for
assets acquired or disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the
date of such audited consolidated balance sheet.  Except as permitted
hereunder, all such properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

              2.17      Disclosure.  No representation or warranty of Borrower
contained in this Agreement or any other document, certificate or written
statement furnished to the Banks by or on behalf of Borrower for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact (known
to Borrower in the case of any document not furnished by it) necessary in
order to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading. 
There is no fact known to Borrower (other than matters of a general economic
nature) which materially adversely affects the business, operations, property,
assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower, taken as a whole,
which has not been disclosed herein or pursuant hereto or in such other
documents, certificates and statements furnished to the Banks for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

              2.18      Environmental and Safety Health Matters.  To the best
knowledge of Borrower, Borrower is in compliance with all environmental laws
and Occupational Safety and Health Laws where failure to comply could have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Borrower to perform its obligations
hereunder.  Borrower has not received notice of any claims that it is not in
compliance in all material respects with the environmental laws where failure
to comply could have a material adverse effect on the ability of Borrower to
perform its obligations hereunder.

              2.19      Continued Effectiveness: Reaffirmation.  The foregoing
representations and warranties are now true in all material respects and,
except as herein provided, will continue to be true in all material respects
until all Indebtedness and obligations of Borrower to the Banks are fully paid
and discharged.  Borrower further represents and warrants to Agent and each
Bank that as of the date of this Agreement all representations and warranties
made or deemed made pursuant to the Prior Credit Agreement were true and
correct on and as of each date when made or deemed made thereunder and that as
of the moment immediately prior to this Agreement becoming effective, there
was no Default or Incipient Default (as such words were defined in the Prior
Credit Agreement) which had occurred and was continuing under the Prior Credit
Agreement.  Each time Borrower requests an Advance and each time Borrower
accepts an Advance hereunder, Borrower shall be deemed to have reaffirmed the
accuracy and completeness of the foregoing representations and warranties, and
with respect to any BA Loans, the representations and warranties contained in
the Banker's Acceptance Agreement, and Borrower shall be deemed to have
certified that Borrower is in every respect in compliance with this Agreement,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and that there then exists no Default
or Incipient Default.

            4.03  Requesting Revolving and Operating Advances.  Borrower shall
request each Revolving and Operating Advance either orally, telephonically, or
in writing.  Each request for an Advance must be made by a duly authorized
officer or employee, must specify the date, amount, Interest Rate and Interest
Period selected by Borrower to apply thereto, and must be received by Agent at

Each Revolving Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
increments of $100,000, and each Operating Advance shall be in the minimum
amount of $1,000,000 and increments of $100,000; provided, however, that Prime
Loans may be in any amount specified by Borrower so long as the applicable
maximum Revolving Line or Operating Line Commitment is not exceeded and
provided further that each Advance under a BA Loan shall be in increments of
$1,000,000.  Borrower may request Revolving and Operating Advances to repay
outstanding Revolving and Operating Advances at the end of the applicable
Interest Period of the Advance to be repaid.

            4.04  Funding Revolving and Operating Advances.  Upon receiving a
request from Borrower for a Revolving or Operating Advance, Agent shall
promptly notify the Banks by telephone that the request has been received and
thereafter confirm the same by telecopy.  Except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.07 with respect to BA Loans, the Banks promise to make their pro
rata share of each Advance in the same proportion that their Revolving Line
and Operating Line Commitments bear to the Total Revolving Line Commitment or
Total Operating Line Commitment, as applicable, available to Agent, no later
than noon, Seattle time, on the Advance date proposed by Borrower, and Agent
shall immediately thereafter make the entire Advance available to Borrower by
wiring the Advance to Borrower's general checking account to be maintained at
the Main Branch of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon, or at such other place as
may be designated by Borrower in writing.

            4.05  Interest Options.

            (a)   Revolving Advances shall be made to Borrower under one of
the following optional interest rates: Seafirst Prime Rate or the LIBOR Rate.

            (b)   Operating Advances shall be made to Borrower under one of
the following optional interest rates: Seafirst Prime Rate, LIBOR Rate, or the

            4.06  Repayment Promise.  Borrower hereby promises to pay to the
order of each Bank, through the Agent, at the address stated above in the
Recitals, or at such other address as Agent may hereafter designate in writing
to Borrower, (a) an amount equal to the principal amount of all Revolving and
Operating Advances at the end of the applicable Interest Period and in no
event later than the applicable Maturity Date, (b) interest on the outstanding
balance of all Seafirst Prime Loans at the Seafirst Prime Rate monthly in
arrears on the first day of each and every calendar month and in no event
later than the applicable Maturity Date, (c) interest on the outstanding
balances of all LIBOR Loans at the applicable LIBOR Rates on the expiration of
any Interest Period, or in the case of an Interest Period of six (6) months
for LIBOR Loans that are Revolving Advances, each three (3) month anniversary
of the commencement of that Interest Period, or at the applicable Maturity
Date, whichever occurs first, (d) interest on the outstanding balances of any
Loan, Advance or portion of either that shall not be paid when due hereunder
at a rate of interest equal to the Default Rate from the first day following
the date such payment shall have become due until paid, (e) all amounts owing
with respect to BA Loans in accordance with Section 4,07, (f) all fees and
additional amounts payable to the Banks hereunder, and (g) the amount of any
Revolving or Operating Advances to the extent necessary to cause the
outstanding Revolving and Operating Advances to be no greater than the
applicable limitations set forth in Sections 4.01 and 4.02.  This promise of
payment will be further evidenced by the Revolving Line Notes and the
Operating Line Notes.

            4.07 Special BA Loan Provisions.  All BA Loans shall be evidenced
by Banker's Acceptances created by the Banks in equal amounts.  With respect
to each Banker's Acceptance, Borrower agrees to pay the accepting Bank an
Acceptance Commission and to reimburse said Bank for expenses incurred by said
Bank including, but not limited, to wire charges, courier charges, and
postage.  The Acceptance Commission and expenses shall be collected at the
time the net proceeds of each Banker's Acceptance are made available to
Borrower.  The net proceeds of a Banker's Acceptance shall be the face amount
of the Banker's Acceptance minus the applicable Discount and minus the
Acceptance Commission.  The Banks shall make the net proceeds of their
respective Banker's Acceptances available to Borrower by transferring or
wiring them to Borrower's general checking account at the Main Branch of U.S.
Bank in Portland or such other account as may be designated in writing by
Borrower.  On the last day of the Interest Period of each BA Loan or on the
applicable Maturity Date, whichever first occurs, Borrower shall pay Agent, an
amount equal to the aggregate face amount of the Banker's Acceptances
comprising such BA Loan, to be applied in equal amounts to the applicable
Banker's Acceptances.  In the event Borrower does not pay the amount due with
respect to any BA Loan when due, Borrower shall be deemed to have made a
request to Agent for a Seafirst Prime Loan in an amount equal to such amount
due, and subject to the prior satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 3, each of the Banks shall make such Prime Loan pro rata in the same
proportion that its Operating Line Commitment bears to the Total Operating
Line Commitment, the proceeds of which shall be applied by Agent to repay such
BA Loan.  All BA Loans shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of
the Banker's Acceptance Agreement.

            4.08  Agent's Fee.  Borrower promises to pay to Agent an agent's
fee as agreed in writing between Agent and Borrower, in advance, throughout
the term of this Agreement payable upon execution of this Agreement and upon
each anniversary thereof.

            4.09  Commitment Fee.  Borrower promises to pay Agent, for the
benefit of the Banks, quarterly in arrears on the first Banking Day of each
calendar quarter a commitment fee equal to

                  (a)   25 basis points (one-quarter of one percent) per annum
times the average daily unused portion of the Total Revolving Line Commitment
during the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and

                  (b)   25 basis points (one-quarter of one percent per annum
times the average daily unused portion of the Total Operating Line Commitment
during the immediately preceding calendar quarter.

      Upon 60 days' advance written notice by Borrower to all of the Banks,
Borrower may reduce the maximum amount of the Total Revolving Line Commitment
and/or the Total Operating Line Commitment, provided, that after giving effect
to such reduction, the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
applicable Loans does not exceed the applicable Commitment then in effect. 
Any such reduction shall be in an amount not less than an amount equal to the
lesser of (a) One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), and (b) the applicable
Commitment then in effect, and shall permanently reduce each Bank's Revolving
Line Commitment or Operating Line Commitment, as applicable, in the same
proportion that such Bank's Revolving Line Commitment or Operating Line
Commitment bears to the Total Revolving Line Commitment or Total Operating
Line Commitment, as applicable.


                                   SECTION 5

                      U.S. BANK OVERNIGHT LINE OF CREDIT

            5.01  The Loans.  U.S. Bank agrees on the terms and conditions of
this Agreement to make Advances (the "Overnight Advances") of up to
$10,000,000 (the "Overnight Line Commitment") available to Borrower from time
to time on any Banking Day during the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the earlier of the applicable Maturity Date or the termination of
the Commitment pursuant to Section 9.01 (the "Overnight Line Commitment
Period").  As this Commitment is for a revolving line of credit, Borrower may
receive Advances, repay them and receive additional Advances at all times
until the applicable Maturity Date as long as the aggregate of the Overnight
Advances outstanding at any one time from U.S. Bank does not exceed
$10,000,000, and no Default or Incipient Default has occurred.  All Overnight
Advances and repayments shall be made by and to U.S. Bank in accordance with
Section 6.11.  In no event shall U.S. Bank be required to have aggregate
Overnight Advances outstanding at any one time in excess of the Overnight Line
Commitment.

            5.02  Requesting Overnight Advances.  Borrower shall request each
Overnight Advance orally, telephonically, or in writing.  Each request for an
Advance must be made by a duly authorized officer or employee, must specify
the date, amount, Interest Rate and Interest Period selected by Borrower to
apply thereto, and must be received by U.S. Bank not later than 10:00 a.m.
Portland time on the Banking Day of the requested loan.  Each Advance under
Section 5 shall be in the minimum amount of $100,000 provided, however, that
Prime Advances may be in any amount specified by Borrower so long as the
Overnight Line Commitment is not thereby exceeded.  Borrower may request
Overnight Advances to repay outstanding Overnight Advances at the end of the
applicable Interest Period of the Advance to be repaid.

            5.03  Funding Overnight Advances; Reporting 
Requirements.  Upon receiving a request from Borrower for an Overnight
Advance, U.S. Bank shall make the Advance available to Borrower by wiring the
Advance to Borrower's general checking account at the Main Branch of U.S. Bank
in Portland, Oregon, or at such other place as may be designated by Borrower
in writing. U.S. Bank shall provide Seafirst promptly upon request information
with respect to Overnight Advances made to Borrower, including without
limitation information regarding date, amount, Interest Rate, Interest Period,
and payments made by Borrower with respect to such Advances.

            5.04  Interest Options.  Overnight Advances shall be made to
Borrower under one of the following optional interest rates: U.S. Bank Prime
Rate or Interim Rate.

            5.05  Repayment Promise.  Borrower hereby promises to pay to U.S.
Bank's order, at the address stated above, or such other address as U.S. Bank
may hereafter designate in writing to Borrower, (a) an amount equal to the
principal amount of all Overnight Advances at the end of the applicable
Interest Period and in no event later than the applicable Maturity Date, (b)
interest on the outstanding balance of all U.S. Bank Prime Loans at the U.S.
Bank Prime Rate monthly on the first day of each and every calendar month and
in no event later than the applicable Maturity Date, (c) interest on the
outstanding balances of all Interim Loans at the Interim Rate at the end of
the applicable Interest Period and in no event later than the applicable
Maturity Date, (d) interest on the outstanding balances of any Loan, Advance
or portion of either that shall not be paid when due hereunder at a rate of
interest equal to the Default Rate from the first day following the date such
payment shall have become due until paid, (e) all fees and additional amounts
payable to U.S. Bank hereunder, and (f) the amount of any Overnight Advances
to the extent necessary to cause the outstanding Overnight Advances to be no
greater than the applicable limitations set forth in Section 5.01. This
promise of payment will be further evidenced by the Overnight Line Note.

            5.06  Commitment Fee.  Borrower promises to pay U.S. Bank
quarterly in arrears on the first Banking Day of each calendar quarter a
commitment fee equal to 25 basis points (one-quarter of one percent) per annum
times the average daily unused portion of the Overnight Line Commitment during
the immediately preceding calendar quarter.  Upon 60 days advance written
notice by Borrower to Agent and the Banks, Borrower may permanently reduce the
amount of the Overnight Line of Credit.


                                   SECTION 6

                  PAYMENT PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL BANKS

            6.01  Prepayments.  Any Prime Loan may be prepaid in whole or in
part at any time.  Borrower may not prepay a BA Loan or an Interim Loan.  Any
LIBOR Loan may be prepaid in full at any time on the number of Banking Days
notice provided in Section 4.03 and 5.02 for requesting Advances with respect
to such Loan, provided, that prepayment on a date other than the final day of
the Interest Period shall be subject to payment of compensation as set out in
Section 6.02.  The notice of such prepayment shall specify the Loan to be
prepaid, the date and amount of prepayment, and the applicable Interest Rate
and Interest Period relating to such Loan.  Any prepayment shall be
accompanied by all interest accrued thereon to the date of such prepayment.

            6.02  Additional Payment in the Event of Prepayment or Failure to
Borrow or Prepay.  Borrower agrees, upon demand by any Bank (which demand
shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for the
calculations of the amount being claimed) to pay such Bank such additional
amount as may be necessary to compensate the Bank for any loss or additional
expense which such Bank may sustain or incur (including, without limitation,
any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or maintain, LIBOR Loans
or Interim Loans and any loss of the Bank's margin) as reasonably determined
by the Bank, as a result of:

                  (a)   any payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Loan or Interim
Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan;
or

                  (b)   any failure of Borrower to borrow any LIBOR Loan or
Interim Loan on a date specified in a request made therefor pursuant to
Sections 4.03 or 5.02.

      For purposes of the foregoing clause (a), the payment required hereunder
shall apply in all circumstances where a Loan is paid prior to the end of the
Interest Period, regardless of whether such payment is voluntary, required in
order to cause outstanding Advances to be no greater than the applicable
Commitments, or the result of the Agent's or either Bank's collection efforts
or the acceleration of such Loans.

            6.03  Change in Circumstances.  The Banks have provided Borrower
the prerogative of choosing Interest Rates other than the Seafirst Prime Rate
or the U.S. Bank Prime Rate based on current legal and economic circumstances. 
However, if there is a future change in circumstances beyond the control of
the Banks, either by reason of market conditions or applicable law, rule,
regulation or interpretation by Government Authority or central bank, whether
or not it has the force of law, which makes unlawful, impossible or
impractical for any Bank to continue to offer to its customers one or more of
such Interest Rates and any Bank in fact no longer offers such Interest Rates
to its customers, then the Interest Rate so affected shall immediately become
unavailable hereunder, the Loan or Loans to which such Interest Rate is
applicable will be considered prepaid as of the date of such illegality,
impossibility or impracticality, and Borrower shall select a new Interest Rate
and Interest Period to be applicable.  If no selection is made within three
Banking Days following notice by any Bank to Borrower of such illegality,
impossibility or impracticality and the unavailability of the affected
Interest Rate, the Seafirst Prime Rate shall be applicable.

            6.04  Increased Costs.  If any Bank determines that either (i) any
Requirement of Law or the introduction of or any change in any Requirement of
Law or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Government
Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof from the
date hereof or (ii) compliance with any guideline or request from any such
Government Authority (whether or not having the force of law) has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Bank or
any corporation controlling such Bank as a consequence of or with reference to
this Agreement or the making of Loans or the advance by such Bank of any other
sums hereunder, below the rate which the Bank or such other corporation could
have achieved but for the introduction, change or compliance (taking into
account the policies of the Bank or corporation with regard to capital), then
Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Bank, pay to the Bank
within five (5) Banking Days after the date specified in such notice and
demand, additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank or other
corporation for such reduction, together with interest on each such amount
from the date said amount is due until payment in full thereof at the Seafirst
Prime Rate.  A certificate as to such amounts, submitted to Borrower by the
Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
The Banks agree to notify Borrower of any circumstances that would cause
Borrower to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 6.04, provided
that failure to give such notice shall not affect Borrower's obligation to pay
such additional amounts hereunder.

      Without in any way limiting the foregoing, if any reserve (including,
without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System), special deposit, or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank's
applicable lending office shall be imposed or deemed applicable or any other
condition affecting its LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make LIBOR Loans
shall be imposed on any Bank or its applicable lending office or the London
interbank LIBOR market; and as a result thereof there shall be any increase in
the cost to such Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding, or maintaining
LIBOR Loans (except to the extent already included in the determination of the
applicable LIBOR Rate), or there shall be a reduction in the amount received
or receivable by that Bank or its applicable lending office, then Borrower
shall from time to time, upon written notice from and demand by that Bank in
accordance with the foregoing paragraph, pay to that Bank, within five Banking
Days after the date specified in such notice and demand, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate the Bank or other corporation for such reduction,
together with interest on each such amount from the date such amount is due
until payment in full thereof at the Seafirst Prime Rate.

            6.05  Capital Adequacy.  If any Bank shall reasonably determine
that adoption, or application in the instance of the Risk Based Capital Rules,
of any law, rule, regulation, directive, interpretation, treaty or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof, whether or not having the force of law, increases the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank and such increase is based upon the
existence of the Bank's obligations hereunder and as a result thereof the rate
of return on the Bank's capital or assets is reduced below that which the Bank
would have achieved but for such adoption or change, then from time to time,
upon demand from the Bank, Borrower shall pay to such Bank such amount or
amounts as will compensate the Bank for such reduction (which amount shall not
include any amounts with respect to penalties imposed on the Bank).  The
determination of any amount to be paid by Borrower under this section shall
take into consideration the policies of the Bank making demand, or any
corporation controlling the Bank, with respect to capital adequacy and shall
be based upon any reasonable averaging, attribution and allocation methods.  A
certificate of the Bank setting forth the amount or amounts as shall be
necessary to compensate the Bank as specified in this subsection shall be
delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            6.06  Costs and Expenses.  Borrower promises to pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Banks and Agent in connection
with the closing, administration and collection of the credit facilities
herein provided.  Such costs and expenses specifically include the Banks' and
Agent's reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection
with preparation of the Loan Documents, collection of Advances, interest, fees
and costs, and enforcement of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, whether
or not litigation is involved.

            6.07  Authorized Officers.  The list of officers and employees
initially authorized to request Advances, is attached hereto as Exhibit B. 
Borrower may amend that list from time to time by supplements executed by the
president and the chief financial officer.  The Agent and Banks may act in
reliance upon any oral, telephonic, or written, request believed in good faith
to have been authorized by any of the persons identified on Exhibit B.

            6.08  Binding Requests.  Each request for each Advance shall be
irrevocable and binding on Borrower and, in respect of any Advance comprised
of Interim Loans, LIBOR Loans or BA Loans specified in such request, if such
Advances are not made as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the
date specified for such Advance the applicable conditions set forth in
Sections 3, 4, or 5, Borrower shall indemnify the Banks against any loss or
expense incurred by the Banks as a result of such failure, including, without
limitation, any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Banks to fund the
Advance to be made by it.

            6.09  The Notes.

                  (a)   The Revolving Advances shall be evidenced by and
repayable with interest in accordance with amended and restated promissory
notes in the form of Exhibits C-1 and C-2 hereto, payable to the order of each
Bank, dated the date of this Agreement and in the principal amount of such
Bank's Revolving Line Commitment (the "Revolving Line Notes").

                  (b)   The Operating Advances shall be evidenced by and
repayable with interest in accordance with amended and restated promissory
notes in the form of Exhibits D-1 and D-2 hereto, payable to the order of each
Bank, dated the date of this Agreement and in the principal amount of such
Bank's Operating Line Commitment (the "Operating Line Notes").

                  (c)   The Overnight Advances shall be evidenced by and
repayable with interest in accordance with an amended and restated promissory
note in the form of Exhibit E hereto, payable to the order of U.S. Bank, dated
the date of this Agreement and in the principal amount of the Overnight Line
Commitment (the "Overnight Line Note").

      Each Bank shall record in its records, or at its option on the schedule
attached to its Note, the date and amount of each Advance, the Interest Rate
applicable to such Advance and the Interest Period.  The aggregate unpaid
principal amount so recorded shall be presumptive evidence of the principal
amount owing and unpaid on the Notes.  The failure to so record any such
amount or error in so recording such amount shall not, however, limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower hereunder or under the Notes to
repay the principal amount of the Advances together with all interest accruing
thereon.

            6.10  Manner of Payments.

                  (a)   All payments of principal and interest on any
Revolving or Operating Advance and the Revolving and Operating Line Notes and
all other amounts payable hereunder by Borrower to the Banks shall be made by
paying the same in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds to Agent in
Seattle not later than noon Seattle time on the date on which such payment is
due.  Any payment made after noon Seattle time on any Banking Day shall be
deemed to have been received on the next Banking Day and interest shall accrue
on that day.

                  (b)   All payments of principal and interest on any
Overnight Advance and the Overnight Note and all other amounts payable
hereunder by Borrower to U.S. Bank in respect of the Overnight Commitment
shall be made by paying the same in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available
funds to U.S. Bank not later than 3:00 p.m., Portland time, on the date on
which such payment is due.  Any payment made after 3:00 p.m., Portland time,
on any Banking Day shall be deemed to have been received on the next Banking
Day and interest shall accrue on that day.

                  (c)    All computations of interest and fees shall be made
on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including
the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which
such interest or fees are payable.

                  (d)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note
shall be due other than on a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Banking Day and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may
be; unless, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
the case of any payment which is due on the last day of an Interest Period,
such extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following
calendar month, in which case such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Banking Day.

            6.11  Application of Proceeds.

                  (a)   Before Default.  Any payment made by Borrower or
received for Borrower's account shall be applied as follows if after applying
such payment no Default or Incipient Payment Default shall have occurred and
be continuing:

                        (i)   Payments made by Borrower to, or received for
Borrower's account by, U.S. Bank shall be applied to amounts due in respect of
Overnight Advances in accordance with the following priorities:

                              (A)   First, to expenses and indemnities due
to U.S. Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

                              (B)   Second, to fees due to U.S. Bank under
Section 5.06;

                              (C)   Third, to interest due on any Overnight
Advances;

                              (D)   Fourth, to repay principal then due in
respect of Overnight Advances;

                              (E)   Fifth, to prepay principal of such of the
Overnight Advances as may be designated by Borrower if such prepayment is
permitted in a notice provided contemporaneously with any such payment and, in
the absence of any such designation, as U.S. Bank may elect; and

                              (F)   Sixth, if all amounts due to U.S. Bank in
respect of the Overnight Advances have been paid in full and such Advances
have been fully repaid, U.S. Bank shall immediately transfer amounts
remaining, if any, to Agent for application pursuant to Section 6.11(a)(ii).

                        (ii)  Payments made by Borrower to, or received for
Borrower's account by Agent shall be applied to amounts due in respect of
Revolving Advances and Operating Advances in accordance with the following
priorities:

                              (A)   First, to expenses and indemnities due to
Agent, Seafirst and U.S. Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Documents;

                              (B)   Second, to fees due to Agent and Banks
under Sections 4.08 and 4.09;

                              (C)   Third, to interest due on any Operating
Advance or Revolving Advance;

                              (D)   Fourth, to repay principal then due in
respect of the Operating Advances and Revolving Advances;

                              (E)   Fifth, to prepay principal of such of the
Revolving or Operating Advances as may be designated by Borrower in a notice
provided contemporaneously with any such payment and, in the absence of any
such designation, to such of the Revolving Advances as Agent may elect until
all Revolving Advances are paid in full and, thereafter, to such of the
Operating Advances as Agent may elect; and

                              (F)   Sixth, if all amounts due to Banks in
respect of the Revolving Advances and the Operating Advances have been paid in
full and such Advances have been fully repaid, Agent shall immediately
transfer amounts remaining, if any, to U.S. Bank for application pursuant to
Section 6.11(a)(i).

                  (b)   Payments after Default.  Any payment made by Borrower
or received or obtained for Borrower's account (whether received by U.S. Bank,
Seafirst, or Agent) shall be applied as follows if after applying such payment
a Default or Incipient Payment Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

                        (i)   On the date of such payment, the Revolving Line
of Credit, the Operating Line of Credit and the Overnight Line of Credit shall
each be assigned a percentage (such Line of Credit's "Default
Payment Percentage") which shall be a fraction (expressed as a decimal) for
which the numerator is the sum of (A) all fees, expenses, indemnities and
interest accrued under or in respect of such Line of Credit through such date
(whether or not then due) and (B) the outstanding principal balance for all
Advances made under such Line of Credit, and the denominator is the sum of (A)
all fees, expenses, indemnities and interest accrued under the Loan Documents
through such date (whether or not then due) and (B) the outstanding principal
balance for all Advances.  For purposes of Section 6.11(b), fees, expenses and
indemnities which are not incurred in respect of any one Line of Credit or
which are incurred in respect of more than one Line of Credit, shall be deemed
to have been accrued in respect of the Revolving Line of Credit.

                        (ii)  A portion of each payment equal to the product
of the Line of Credit's Default Payment percentage and the total amount of the
payment made shall be applied to the Indebtedness incurred in respect of such
Line of Credit in the following order of priority:

                              (A)   First, to expenses and indemnities accrued
thereunder;

                              (B)   Second, to fees due in respect thereof;

                              (C)   Third, to interest due on any Advances
made thereunder;

                              (D)   Fourth, to repay the principal then due in
respect of any Advances made thereunder; and

                              (E)   Fifth, to prepay principal of such of the
Advances as are made thereunder and as are selected by the Requisite Banks for
payment or, in the case of Advances made under the Overnight Line of Credit,
as are selected by U.S. Bank for payment.

                        (iii)  Banks each agree to immediately advise Agent as
to any payment received from Borrower or for Borrower's account and, if after
applying such payment a Default or Incipient Payment Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, to immediately disburse such payment (or portions
thereof) to the other Banks in accordance with instructions received from
Agent, which instructions shall be drawn to result in an application of
proceeds as herein provided for.

                  (c)    Setoffs. If any Bank shall obtain any payment for
Borrower's account through the exercise of any right of counterclaim, setoff,
banker's lien or similar rights, in excess of that portion of the payment to
which it would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of
Sections 6.11(a), 6.11(b), and 6.11(d), such Bank shall forthwith purchase
from the other Banks such participations in the Advances made by them as shall
be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment with
them in the same proportion as such payment would have been shared had it been
received as a voluntary payment from Borrower pursuant to the terms of
Section 6.11(a) or (b) as the case may be.  If any of such excess payment is
afterwards recovered from such purchasing Bank, the purchase of the
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored, without
interest, to the extent of such recovery.  Borrower authorizes the purchase of
such participations and agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation
from another Bank may exercise all of its rights to payment (including the
right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank
were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  (d)   General Provisions.  Where, pursuant to the foregoing
Sections 6.11(a) and 6.11(b), amounts are to be applied to Borrower's
obligations to pay commitment fees, interest or principal in respect of any
particular Revolving Advance or Operating Advance, the amount to be so applied
shall be applied to Borrower's obligations and disbursed to the Banks pro rata
in the same proportion that their respective Commitments bear to the sum of
all Commitments for the applicable Line of Credit, and Agent will remit such
amounts to the other Banks promptly upon the receipt thereof.  Whenever
pursuant to the terms of Section 6.11(a) or (b) above, the Agent or any Bank
is authorized to elect particular loans for prepayment, it shall, to the
extent consistent with the foregoing order of priority elect to cause Prime
Loans to be prepaid prior to the prepayment of any other Loans.  As used in
this Section 6.11 "Incipient Payment Default" shall mean an event which but
for the passage of time would constitute a Default described in Section 8.01.

                                   SECTION 7

                             BORROWER'S COVENANTS

            At all times prior to the later of (a) the latest Maturity Date or
(b) the date on which all obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the
Loan Documents have been performed in full, Borrower agrees to do all of the
following unless the Requisite Banks or all Banks, as applicable pursuant to
Section 11.09 hereof, shall otherwise give their prior consent in writing:

            7.01  Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc.  Borrower will
preserve and maintain its corporate existence, rights, and privileges in
Oregon and will qualify and remain qualified as a foreign corporation in
Washington and California and in each other jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary or advisable in view of the business and operations
of Borrower or the ownership of its properties.

            7.02  Compliance With Laws.  Borrower will comply in all material
respects with all laws, regulations, rules, and orders of any Government
Authority applicable to Borrower or to its operations or property, except any
thereof whose validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings upon stay of execution of the enforcement thereof.

            7.03  Other Obligations.  Borrower will pay and discharge before
the same shall become delinquent (after giving effect to all applicable grace
periods) all Indebtedness, Taxes, and other obligations for which Borrower is
liable or to which its income or property is subject and all claims for labor
and materials or supplies which, if unpaid, might become by law a lien upon
the assets of Borrower, except any thereof whose validity or amount is being
contested in good faith by Borrower in appropriate proceedings, and except
other Indebtedness, Taxes, and other obligations which, in the aggregate do
not exceed $1,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing exceptions to
this covenant shall not extend to any obligation of Borrower identified in
Sections 7,17 or 8.11.

            7.04  Visitation; Records.  Borrower will keep adequate records
and books in which complete entries will be made, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied, reflecting all financial
transactions of Borrower.  At any reasonable time and from time to time
Borrower will permit the Agent and Banks to examine and make copies of and
abstracts from Borrower's records and books and to visit the properties of
Borrower and to discuss the affairs, finances, and accounts of Borrower with
any of its officers.

            7.05  Financial Information.  Borrower will deliver to the Banks
and the Agent (a) as soon as available and in any event within 120 days after
the end of each fiscal year of Borrower, the consolidated balance sheet of
Borrower as of the end of such fiscal year and the related consolidated
statements of income and retained earnings and statement of changes in the
financial position of Borrower for such year, accompanied by the audit report
thereon by independent, certified public accountants acceptable to the Banks
(which report shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied and shall not be qualified by
reason of restricted or limited examination of any material portion of
Borrower's records and shall contain no disclaimer of opinion or adverse
opinion); (b) as soon as available and in any event within 60 days after the
end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of Borrower, the unaudited
consolidated and consolidating balance sheet and statement of income and
retained earnings of Borrower as of the end of such fiscal quarter (including
the fiscal year to the end of such fiscal quarter), accompanied by a
certificate of the chief financial officer of Borrower that such unaudited
consolidated and consolidating balance sheet and statement of income and
retained earnings have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied and present fairly the financial
position and the results of operations of Borrower as of the end of and for
such fiscal quarter and setting forth calculations demonstrating that at the
end of such quarter Borrower was in compliance with Sections 7.08 through
7.13, inclusive, and Sections 7.15, and further stating that as of the close
of such fiscal quarter no Default or Incipient Default had occurred and was
continuing; and (c) such other statements, reports, and other information as
the Banks may reasonably request concerning the financial condition of
Borrower.

            7.06  Notification.  Promptly after learning thereof Borrower will
provide the Banks and the Agent with (a) the details of any action,
proceeding, investigation, or claim against or affecting Borrower instituted
before any court, arbitrator, or Government Authority or, to Borrower's
knowledge threatened to be instituted, which, after taking into account the
likelihood of success, might reasonably result in a judgment or order against
Borrower (in excess of insurance coverage and when combined with all other
pending or threatened claims) of more than $1,000,000; (b) if Borrower or any
member of the Controlled Group gives or is required to give notice to the PBGC
of any "reportable event" (as defined in subsections (b)(1)(2)(5)(6) of
Section 403 of ERISA) with respect to any Plan (or the Internal Revenue
Service gives notice to the PBGC of any "Reportable Event" as defined in
subsection (c)(2) of Section 4043 of ERISA and Borrower attains knowledge
thereof) which might constitute grounds for termination of such Plan under
Title IV of ERISA, or knows that the plan administrator of any Plan has given
or is required to give notice of any such reportable event, a copy of the
notice of such reportable event given or required to be given to the PBGC; (c)
notice thereof if any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement
proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; and (d)
notice thereof if any Default or Incipient Default occurs, together with a
statement of the action Borrower is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

            7.07  Additional Payments; Additional Acts.  From time to time,
Borrower will (a) pay or reimburse the Agent and Banks on request for all
Taxes imposed on this Agreement (other than taxes based on the Agent's or any
Bank's net income, items of tax preference, or gross receipts) and for all
expenses, including legal fees, actually incurred by the Agent or any Bank in
connection with the preparation or modification of this Agreement, the Notes,
the Banker's Acceptance Agreement, or the other Loan Documents hereunder or
the enforcement by judicial proceedings or otherwise of any rights of the
Agent or any Bank hereunder or under the Notes, the Banker's Acceptance
Agreement, or the other Loan Documents; and (b) obtain and promptly furnish to
each of the Banks and the Agent evidence of all such Government Approvals as
may be required to enable Borrower to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement, the Notes, the Banker's Acceptance Agreement, or the other Loan
Documents.

            7.08  Working Capital.  Borrower shall maintain, on a consolidated
basis, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.3 to
1.0. For purposes of this Section 7.08 current assets shall not include (i)
any deferred assets other than prepaid items such as insurance, Taxes, or
other similar items; (ii) any amounts due from corporations which are
subsidiaries of Borrower or of any other Person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Borrower; and (iii)
an amount equal to the appropriate deduction for depreciation, depletions,
obsolescence, amortization, valuation, contingency, or other reserves
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  For
purposes of this Section 7.08, current liabilities shall not include Funded
Debt maturing within one year from the date of determination whether or not
extendable at the option of Borrower.

            7.09  Funded Debt.  Borrower shall maintain on a consolidated
basis a ratio of Funded Debt to Total Capitalization of not more than 0.8 to 1
and a ratio of Funded Debt minus Subordinated Debt to Total Capitalization of
not more than .55 to 1. "Funded Debt" means Indebtedness which matures by its
terms more than one year from the date it was originally incurred, or is
unconditionally renewable or extendable at the option of the debtor to a date
more than one year from such date, or which arises under a revolving credit or
similar agreement obligating the lender or lenders to extend credit over a
period of more than one year from such date including the current portion of
such Indebtedness.  "Total Capitalization" means the sum of Members' Equity
and Funded Debt.  "Members' Equity" means, as of any date of determination,
the consolidated balance sheet "members equity" of Borrower determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. 
"Subordinated Debt" means Indebtedness of Borrower which by its terms provides
that no payments or distributions may be made thereon or in respect thereto at
any time when a default has occurred and is continuing under a document
providing for repayment of Indebtedness of Borrower for borrowed money (other
than such Subordinated Debt) or for the payment by Borrower of the purchase
price of tangible property.

            7.10  Fixed Charge Coverage.  Borrower shall maintain on a
consolidated basis a ratio of Fixed Charge Coverage (for the four most recent
fiscal quarters) of at least 1.4 to 1.0. "Fixed Charge Coverage" means for any
period the ratio derived from dividing (a) the sum of net income for such
period (before income taxes, patronage dividends, and extraordinary items)
plus Fixed Charges by (b) Fixed Charges.  "Fixed Charges" means the sum of (a)
interest expense on all Indebtedness, (b) the amortization of any discount
applied in advancing Funded Debt to Borrower, and (c) gross rental expense net
of pass-through rental income from Borrower's members.

            7.11  Liens.  Borrower shall not create, assume, or suffer to
exist any Lien upon its assets except (i) Liens on Borrower's Milwaukee,
Oregon, and Medford, Oregon, properties securing mortgage indebtedness
relating to such properties and any extensions, refinancing, or renewals
thereof in an amount not exceeding the amount of such indebtedness prior to
such extension, refinancing, or renewal; (ii) capital lease obligations; (iii)
Liens to secure indebtedness for the deferred price of property acquired after
the date hereof, but only if such Liens are limited to such property and its
proceeds; (iv) Liens imposed by law (such as mechanic's liens) incurred in
good faith in the ordinary course of business which are not delinquent or
which remain payable without penalty or the validity or amount of which are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceeding upon stay of execution
of the enforcement thereof; or (v) deposits or pledges under worker's
compensation, unemployment insurance, social security, or similar laws or made
to secure the performance of bids, tenders, contracts (except for the
repayment of borrowed money) or leases, or to secure statutory obligations or
surety or appeal bonds or to secure indemnity, performance, or other similar
bonds given in the ordinary course of business.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Borrower shall not pledge, grant a security
interest in, or otherwise permit a Lien to encumber all or any portion of its
accounts receivables, chattel paper, documents, instruments, general
intangibles, or inventories.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the total
amount secured by all Liens (excluding the Liens described in clause (iii)
above) shall not at any time exceed 15 percent of Borrower's Consolidated Net
Tangible Assets as of such time.  "Consolidated Net Tangible Assets" shall be,
on a consolidated basis, the difference between total assets and current
liabilities, excluding, however, from the determination of total assets (i)
all assets which should be classified as intangible assets (such as good will,
patents, trademarks, copyrights, and franchises) and (ii) to the extent not
already deducted from total assets, all reserves including those for deferred
income taxes, depreciation, obsolescence, or amortization of properties, and
(iii) all capital stock or other investments by Borrower in any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Borrower other than in (x) UGIC, Ltd., Borrower's
Bermuda investment subsidiary, or (y) a subsidiary having all or substantially
all of its operations in the United States.

            7.12  Minimum Capital and Subordinated Debt.  Borrower shall
maintain the sum of Subordinated Debt and Members' Equity at a total of not
less than $75,000,000.

            7.13  Member Notes Receivable Ratio.  Borrower shall maintain, on
a consolidated basis, a Member Portfolio at not more than 150% of Consolidated
Net Tangible Assets.  "Member Portfolio" means the sum of (i) all Indebtedness
of members to Borrower or any of its subsidiaries which have not been sold;
plus (ii) all investments by Borrower or any of its subsidiaries in Borrower's
members; plus (iii) all Indebtedness of members of Borrower or any of its
subsidiaries which have been sold with recourse to Borrower or any of its
subsidiaries at 50% or greater.  As used herein, "Consolidated Net Tangible
Assets" shall have the meaning given in Section 7.11.

            7.14  Liquidation, Merger, Sale of Assets, Etc.  
Borrower shall not liquidate, dissolve, or enter into any merger,
consolidation, joint venture, partnership, or other combination nor sell,
lease, dispose of such portion of its business or assets (excepting sales of
goods in the ordinary course of business and excepting sales of notes pursuant
to note purchase agreements) as constitutes a substantial portion thereof
provided, however, so long as no Default or Incipient Default shall have
occurred and be continuing or will occur as a result of such merger or
consolidation, Borrower may merge or consolidate with any Person provided that
the surviving Person be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing
under the laws of any state in the United States and provided further that
such surviving corporation expressly assume Borrower's obligations under this
Agreement in a writing delivered to the Banks.  Without limitation on the
foregoing, Borrower, and its consolidated subsidiaries, shall not in any
fiscal year sell in excess of 10 percent of their Consolidated Net Tangible
Assets; unless the proceeds of such sale or sales are reinvested within 12
months in assets to be owned and utilized by Borrower in the ordinary course
of its business; provided, however, in determining compliance with the
foregoing requirement, sales of the following assets will be disregarded: (a)
individual assets having a book value of less than $250,000, not to exceed in
the aggregate One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) in any
fiscal year, and (b) Indebtedness of Borrower's members to Borrower incurred
in Borrower's equipment, store and inventory financing for such members.

$6,000,000 and (b) 50 percent of Borrower's consolidated cumulative net income
between September 29, 1990, and the date of determination.  "Contingent
Indebtedness" shall, as of any date of determination, mean the sum of (i)
guaranties of the obligations of others (excluding the guaranty of lease
obligations of Borrower's members to the extent such lease obligations are
insured) and (ii) the product of (x) the Portfolio Loss Factor and (y) the
total principal amount of indebtedness owed by Borrower's members to Borrower
in respect of store and equipment financing which has been sold by Borrower on
a recourse basis.  The term "Portfolio Loss Factor" shall mean the greater of
(i) five times the average for the three most recently ended fiscal years of
Borrower of the actual losses incurred during each such fiscal year on the
portfolio of indebtedness owed to Borrower (or to a buyer of such indebtedness
from Borrower) by members for equipment and store financing divided by the
average principal amount of such portfolio during such fiscal year or (ii)
3 percent.

directly or indirectly enter into or permit to exist any transaction
(including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease, or exchange of any
property) with any of Borrower's Affiliates on terms that are less favorable

are not Affiliates.  Borrower will not permit or suffer by any Affiliate it
directly or indirectly controls the sale or other disposition of substantially
all the assets of such Affiliate, except in the ordinary course of such
Affiliate's business; and Borrower will not permit or suffer the sale or
issuance by any such Affiliate of any of its stock of any class, except to
Borrower.  An "Affiliate" is any Person (or group of related Persons) that (a)
directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by or under common control
with Borrower, or (b) owns more than 5 percent of Borrower's voting stock, or
(c) is a director or officer of Borrower.

            7.17  ERISA Compliance.  Neither Borrower nor any member of the
Controlled Group nor any Plan of any of them will: (a) engage in any
"prohibited transaction" as such term is defined in Section406 or
Section2003(a) of ERISA; (b) incur any "accumulated funding deficiencies" (as
such term is defined in Section302 of ERISA) whether or not waived; (c)
terminate any "employee pension benefit plan," as such term is used in ERISA,
in a manner which could result in the imposition of a Lien on any property of
Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group pursuant to Section4068 of
ERISA; or (d) violate state or federal securities laws applicable to any Plan.

            7.18  No Name Change, Etc.  Borrower will not change its name,
identity, or corporate structure in any manner.

            7.19  Relocation of Offices.  Borrower will give Agent at least 60

Placement.  Borrower will promptly provide to Banks a copy of each Private
Placement Agreement and shall notify the Banks at least five (5) days in
advance of the execution thereof.  Borrower will not agree to or permit to be
made any amendments to nor request any waivers of the terms of any Private
Placement Agreement if such a waiver or waivers pertains to an increase in the
commitment amounts thereunder or to the terms of repayment thereof or of any
promissory notes issued thereunder.  Borrower shall give to Agent, for
distribution to each of the Banks prompt written notice and a copy of any
anticipated amendment to or requested waiver of any financial covenants
contained in or reduction in the commitment amounts under each Private
Placement Agreement, and shall give to Agent for distribution to the Banks a
substantially contemporaneous confirming notice and a copy of any amendment or
waiver actually made or granted.  Borrower shall not make any prepayments in
respect of any Private Placement Agreement or any of the promissory notes
issued pursuant thereto.

properties and operations policies of insurance carried with responsible
companies in such amounts and covering all such risks as shall be customary in
the industry.

preserve all of its properties in good working order and condition, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and will from time to time make all needed repairs,
renewals or replacements so that the efficiency of such properties shall be
fully maintained and preserved.

            7.24  Insurance Company.  Borrower shall cause Grocers Insurance
Company, an Oregon corporation or any successor thereto ("GIC"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Grocers Insurance Group, which in turn is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Borrower, to (a) comply in all material respects
with all laws, regulations, rules and orders of any Government Authority
applicable to GIC, except any thereof whose validity is being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings upon stay of execution of the
enforcement thereof, and (b) keep in force upon all of its operations policies
of reinsurance carried with responsible companies in such amounts and covering

      Upon any Default hereunder, the Agent and the Banks shall have the right
to exercise any one or more of the following remedies in addition to such
other remedies as may be available under law:

            9.01  Termination.  Agent, may, and shall upon the request of the
Requisite Banks, immediately terminate the Commitments; provided, however,
that in the case of any event described in Sections 8.06, 8.07 or 8.08, the
Commitments shall automatically terminate.

            9.02  Acceleration.  Agent, may, and shall upon the request of the
Requisite Banks, declare the principal of and the interest on any Loan and the
Notes and all other sums payable by Borrower under the Loan Documents to be
immediately due and payable, whereupon the same shall become immediately due
and payable without protest, presentment or demand, all of which are hereby
expressly waived, provided, however, that in the case of any event described
in Sections 8.06, 8.07 and 8.08, the principal of, and accrued interest on,
the Notes shall become immediately due and payable, both as to principal and
interest, without presentment, demand, protest, all of which are hereby
expressly waived, anything contained herein or in the Notes to the contrary
notwithstanding.  Agent shall use its best efforts to provide same day notice
of acceleration to Borrower, provided, however, that failure to give such
notice shall not affect the rights of the Agent and Banks hereunder.

            9.03  Specific Remedies.  The Agent and Banks may exercise or
pursue any remedy or cause of action permitted by this Agreement, the Notes,
the Banker's Acceptance Agreement, any Loan Document or applicable law.  The

Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive, and the exercise or partial
exercise of any right, power or remedy shall not preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

                                  SECTION 10

                                    AGENCY

          10.01   Appointment; Successor Agent.

                  (a)   The Banks hereby appoint Agent to act as
administrative agent in connection with the Loans provided for in this
Agreement.  Agent shall have such powers as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out its rights and responsibilities as agent as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto.

                  (b)   Agent may give written notice of resignation at any
time to the Banks and Borrower and may be removed at any time with cause by
the Requisite Banks.  Upon such resignation or removal, the Requisite Banks
shall have the right to appoint a successor agent.  If no successor agent
shall have been so appointed by the Requisite Banks and shall have accepted
such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agents giving of
notice of resignation or the Requisite Banks' removal of the retiring Agent,
then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor agent,
which shall be (i) a Bank, or (ii) a bank organized under the laws of the
United States or of any state thereof, or any affiliate of such bank, and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least Five Hundred Million Dollars
($500,000,000).  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by
a successor agent, such successor agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement.  Until the acceptance by such a successor
agent, the retiring Agent shall continue as "Agent" hereunder.  After any
retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent shall become
effective, the provisions of this Section 10 shall bind it and inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Agreement.

          10.02   Immunities. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, nor by reason of this
Agreement be a trustee or fiduciary for the Banks (except that the foregoing
disclaimer pertaining to Agent not being a trustee or fiduciary shall not
apply with respect to money actually received by Agent from Borrower which
under the terms of the Loan Documents is to be remitted to Banks).  Agent
shall not be responsible to the Banks for any recitals, statements,
representations, or warranties contained in this Agreement, the Notes, or the
other Loan Documents, or in any certificate or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by the Banks under the Loan Documents, or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency of
this Agreement, the Notes, or the other Loan Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for therein, or for any failure by Borrower to perform
any of its obligations thereunder.  Agent may employ agents and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible, except as to money or
securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
or agents shall be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          10.03   Reliance by Agent.  Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
certification, notice, or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone, telex, facsimile, telegram, or cable) believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper
person or persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants, and other experts selected by Agent.  As to any
matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, including enforcement or
collection of the Loans and the Advances, Agent shall not be required to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or
refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining)
upon the instructions of the Requisite Banks, and such instruction shall be
binding upon all Banks, provided that Agent shall not be required to take any
action which exposes it to personal liability or which is contrary to the Loan
Documents or applicable law, and provided further, that this Section 10 shall
not be amended without the prior written consent of Agent (acting for its own
account).

          10.04   Rights as a Lender.  With respect to the Loans made by it,
Seafirst in its capacity as a lender shall have the same rights and powers
hereunder as the Banks.  Whenever this Agreement calls for a unanimous
decision by the Banks or for a decision by the Requisite Banks, Seafirst, as
lender, shall be entitled to vote its proportionate share.  Seafirst, as
lender, and its affiliates may (without having to account therefor to the
Banks) accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind
of banking, trust, or other business with Borrower and any of its affiliates
as if it were not acting as Agent, and Seafirst, as lender, may accept fees
and other consideration from Borrower for services in connection with the Loan
Documents or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks
except that the Banks shall be entitled to their share of the commitment fees
specified in Section 4.09 of this Agreement, pro rata, in the same proportion
that their respective Revolving Line and Operating Line Commitments bear to
the Total Revolving Line Commitment or all Total Operating Line Commitment, as
applicable, for which such items are received.  U. S. Bank shall be entitled
to its fees specified in Section 5.06.  The agent's fee specified in
Section 4.08 of this Agreement shall be exclusively the property of Agent.

          10.05   Defaults.  Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of
the occurrence of a Default (other than the nonpayment of principal, interest,
or fees on the Revolving or Operating Loans) unless Agent has received notice
from Borrower or any Bank specifying such Default or officers of Seafirst
acting in their capacity as officers of Agent with respect to Borrower's
account have actual knowledge of the occurrence of a Default.  Agent shall
(subject to Section 10.08) take such action with respect to any Default or
Incipient Default as shall be decided by the Requisite Banks.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Agent shall comply with Sections 9.01, 9.02, and
11.09.

          10.06   Indemnification.  The Banks agree to indemnify Agent (to the
extent not reimbursed by Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents, but without
limiting the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents), pro rata, in
the same proportion that their respective Commitments bear to the sum of all
Commitments of all Banks, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by, or asserted against Agent, in any way relating to or arising out
of the Loan Documents or any other documents contemplated hereby or the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding, unless a Default has occurred and
is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the
performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or of any such other documents, provided that the Banks shall not
be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent.

          10.07   Non-Reliance on Agent.  The Banks agree that they have,
independently and without reliance on Agent, and based on such documents and
information as they have deemed appropriate, made their own credit analysis of
Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and that they will,
independently and without reliance upon Agent, and based on such documents and
information as they shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make their
own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.  Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by Borrower of the Loan Documents or any other
document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or
books of Borrower.  Except for notices, reports, and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by Agent
hereunder, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide the
Banks with any (credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial
condition, or business of Borrower which may come into the possession of Agent
or any of its affiliates.

            10.08 Failure to Act.  Except for action expressly required of
Agent hereunder, Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act under the Loan Documents unless it shall be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Banks, pro rata, in the same proportion that their
respective Commitments bear to the sum of all Commitments of all Banks,
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by Agent by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

            10.09 Records.  Agent agrees to keep at all times proper books of
account and records reflecting the interest of the Banks in the Revolving and
Operating Loans, which records shall be accessible for inspection by Banks at
all times during normal business hours.

            10.10 Satisfaction of Loans.  Agent may accept payment in full of
the Loans according to their terms and shall be entitled to satisfy or assign
the Notes upon such payment in full, but any such assignment shall be without
recourse and without representation or warranty, either express or implied.

            10.11 Information.  Agent agrees to provide the Banks promptly
upon request with the following credit information during the term of the
Loans: (a) accrual status; and (b) status of payments of principal, interest,
and fees for the Revolving and Operating Loans.  Agent also agrees to provide
the Banks promptly after receipt thereof with financial statements and other
documents received by Agent from Borrower or Banks under the Loan Documents
except where Borrower is obligated to deliver such statements and other
documents directly to the Banks under the terms of the Loan Documents.


                                  SECTION 11

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            11.01 Assignment.  Borrower may not assign, pledge, transfer,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without all of the Banks' prior written consent.  A breach of this
provision, directly or indirectly, also shall be a Default and shall not vest
any rights in the purported transferee.  The Banks each agree that they will
not sell, transfer, encumber, or assign all or any part of their interest in
the Loans without the prior written approval of the Agent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld.  However, the Banks each may assign their
interest in the Loans or sell participation or syndication interests in the
Loans without the consent or approval of Borrower.

            11.02 Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement and the Notes shall
benefit and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the Banks
and Borrower.

            11.03 Conflict.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Notes, the Banker's Acceptance Agreement, and the other Loan Documents are
intended to complement and supplement each other and are to be construed so as
to be consistent and complementary but in the event of direct conflict, the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail.

            11.04 Notices.  Except for requests for Advances under
Section 4.03 and 5.02 hereof, any notice required or allowed hereunder shall
be effective only if given in writing by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by courier delivery where a receipt is obtained, at the address
stated above or at such other address as a party hereafter may state by
written notice.

            11.05 Captions. The captions are merely for convenience and are
not a substantive part of this Agreement.

            11.06 Recitals.  The recitals are incorporated into this Agreement
by this reference.

            11.07 Exhibits.  The exhibits are incorporated into this Agreement
by this reference.

            11.08 Complete and Final Agreement.  This Agreement is the
complete and final agreement of the parties superseding all previous oral and
written agreements and understandings and no provision can or will be waived
or modified by conduct or oral agreement either before or after execution of
this Agreement.  There is no ambiguity in this Agreement which would justify
the use of parol evidence.

            11.09  Modifications, Consents and Waivers.  No failure or delay
on the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising any power or right under
any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power under any Loan Document preclude
any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or
power.  The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.  No amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by
Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed or consented to by the Requisite Banks, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment,
modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the
Banks, do any of the following: (i) waive any of the conditions specified in
Section 3; (ii) increase the Commitment of any Bank or subject the Banks to
any additional obligation; (iii) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the
Notes or any fees hereunder; (iv) postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees hereunder; (v) take any
action which requires the signing of all the Banks pursuant to the terms of
any Loan Document; (vi) change the percentage of the Commitments, or the
number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take
any action under any Loan Document; or (vii) amend, modify or waive
Sections 7.05, 7.08 through 7.15, or this Section 11.09; and, provided,
further, that no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by Agent, in addition to the Banks required hereinabove to
take such action, affect the rights and duties of Agent under any Loan
Document.  No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle
the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

            11.10 Right of Setoff.  Upon the occurrence of a Default, the
Banks shall have the right, but not the obligation, to setoff and apply all
deposits of every kind held by the Banks and their affiliates or obligations
owed by the Banks and their affiliates to Borrower against the Indebtedness
and obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
Documents.

            11.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Attorney's Fees.  Washington
law shall govern construction and enforcement of this Agreement, the Notes and
the other Loan Documents.  If suit or action should be instituted to enforce
the terms of this Agreement, the Notes, the Loan Documents or any of them, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to such sum from the other party as the
court shall adjudge reasonable attorney's fees at trial, on appeal or on any
review thereof.

            11.12 Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Immunities.  Borrower
hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in Seattle, King County, Washington, in any action or proceeding
brought to enforce or otherwise arising out of or relating to any Loan
Document and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any
such action or proceeding in any such forum, and hereby further irrevocably
waives any claim that any such forum is an inconvenient forum.

            11.13 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is
hereafter determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall be
deemed deleted without invalidating the remaining provisions and, to the
extent permitted by law, Borrower waives any provision of law which renders
any provision illegal or unenforceable.

            11.14 Other Debt.  Borrower expressly agrees that the payment and
performance of the Indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement, the Notes and the
other Loan Documents shall not be inferior or subordinate to, but rather shall
rank no less than pari passu with, all other Indebtedness of Borrower, except
to the extent such other Indebtedness shall be secured by a Lien described in
Section 7.11 hereof.

            11.15 Computation of Time Periods.  In the computation of periods
of time from a date to a later date, "from" means "from and including" and
"to" and "until" each means "to but excluding."

            11.16 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be deemed a single
original.

            11.17 Notice.  Borrower is hereby given the following notice:

                 ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN 
                    MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT OR TO FORBEAR FROM

                             AMENDED AND RESTATED
                         BANKER'S ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT


            This Amended and Restated Banker's Acceptance Agreement (this
"Agreement") is entered into as of this 31st day of May, 1995, by the
undersigned pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement of even date
herewith (the "Credit Agreement") among United Grocers, Inc. ("Customer"),
United States National Bank of Oregon ("U.S. Bank") and Seattle-First National
Bank ("Seafirst") (collectively, the "Banks") and Seafirst as "Agent" for the
Banks.  This Agreement amends and restates that certain prior Banker's
Acceptance Agreement made by and among the parties hereto as of July 31, 1991.

            In consideration of the Banks accepting in accordance with the
Credit Agreement drafts drawn on the Banks by Customer, Customer hereby agrees
as follows:

            1.    Credit Agreement.  All of the terms of the Credit Agreement
are incorporated herein by this reference.  All terms capitalized in this
Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Credit
Agreement.

            2.    Warranties.  With respect to each draft presented for
acceptance, Customer warrants and agrees that:

                  (a)   Each draft presented for acceptance and discounting
will be an Eligible Draft.  "Eligible Draft" means a draft that is eligible
for discount under the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. Section 372) and is
eligible for purchase under rules and regulations established from time to
time by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

                  (b)   The draft will grow out of one or more transactions
involving the importation or exportation of goods or will grow out of one or
more transactions involving the domestic shipment of goods, or the draft will
be secured throughout the life of the draft by warehouse receipts or similar
documents conveying or securing title and covering readily marketable staples.

                  (c)   Completion of each transaction related to a draft is
anticipated to occur on or before the maturity date of such draft.

                  (d)   The maturity of each draft will be consistent with the
period usually and reasonably necessary to finance transactions of such kind.

                  (e)   Customer holds a sales contract, purchase order or
letter of credit for each transaction underlying the acceptance, and holds
shipping documents conveying or securing title to the goods shipped.

                  (f)   No drafts other than the presented draft have been or
shall be outstanding with respect to goods covered by any presented draft.

                  (g)   The draft is payable in United States dollars and its
amount does not exceed the lesser of the sales price or fair market value of
the goods and the tenor of the draft does not exceed 92 days' sight to run.

                  (h)   If a draft is accepted by the Banks and discounted,
the proceeds will be used solely to finance and consummate the shipping or
storage of the goods.

                  (i)   The information furnished the Banks by Customer upon
request for financing is true and complete.

                  (j)   No security interest in the goods pertaining to the
drafts shall be granted by Customer to any party except the Banks and there
will be no other financing of such goods outstanding during the life of the
accepted draft related thereto.

                  (k)   The minimum amount of any draft issued by either Bank
shall be $500,000 and all drafts shall be in even multiples of $500,000.  All
drafts issued by a Bank in response to a request from Customer shall be in
equal amounts to the other Bank.

            3.    Requests for Financing.  Each request for a draft should be
made to:

                  Seattle-First National Bank

                  Attention:  Brenda Little, Agency Officer

or to such other place as Agent may designate.  Such requests may be oral,
telephonic, telegraphic, electronic, or in writing in the format described in
Schedule 1 attached hereto.  If a request is made orally or by telephonic

communication request was made.  All requests must be by persons authorized to
make such requests by Customer as shown on Exhibit B to the Credit Agreement
or any substitute or additional personnel hereafter specified in writing by
Customer.  The Banks may act in reliance upon any oral, telephonic, or written
request believed in good faith to have been authorized by any of the persons
identified on Exhibit B to the Credit Agreement.  The Banks shall not be
responsible for (a) any loss, costs, or expenses incurred by Borrower in
connection with any drafts, documents, or instruments delivered by Borrower to
either Bank in connection herewith; (b) any default, negligence, misfeasance,

the Banks with presigned, prenumbered but otherwise blank drafts, Customer

behalf in accordance with Customer's instructions.  Banks each will
acknowledge receipt of all such incomplete drafts received by it and hold them
in safekeeping prior to completion.

            5.    Disbursement.  Banks will deposit the net proceeds of each
draft accepted and discounted by it to Customer's account Number 020-0011-757
with U.S. Bank's Main branch in Portland, or such other account as Customer

amount of the draft less the applicable Discount and less the Acceptance
Commission.

Seattle, or such other place as Agent may instruct in United States currency
the following:

                  (a)   the face amount of each draft accepted by either Bank
payable on maturity of the draft in immediately available funds;

                  (b)   the Banks' applicable fees or commissions in effect at
the time of the service for which they are charged, payable on demand;

                  (c)   all costs and expenses, including wire charges,
courier charges, postage, and reasonable attorney fees and legal costs,
incurred by either Bank in connection with any draft accepted by, either Bank
or in connection with this Agreement, payable on demand; and

                  (d)   interest on any of the above amounts not paid when due
from the date due until paid at the highest rate permitted by law not
exceeding the Seafirst Prime Rate (changing as the Seafirst Prime Rate
changes) plus 2 percent per annum, payable on demand.

            7.    Covenants.  Customer agrees as follows:

                  (a)   To maintain complete and accurate records and books of
account concerning the transactions giving rise to any drafts accepted by
either Bank.

                  (b)   To permit the Agent, the Banks or their respective
agents to examine or inspect Customer's books and records of account at such
reasonable times as they may request.

                  (c) To provide the Banks with such information as Banks may
reasonably request with respect to the Customer's financial condition, the
transaction giving rise to any draft, or any of the matters provided for
herein.

                  (d)   To procure promptly any necessary licenses for the
shipment of, or for the payment for, the goods constituting the subject matter
of the draft and to comply with all domestic laws, regulations, and orders
relating to the transactions out of which the drafts arise.

                  (e)   To maintain in good condition and repair all goods
constituting the subject matter of the draft and to insure the same, and
Customer's records and writings evidencing or relating to such goods, against
all risks normally insured against in Customer's business or in the particular
transaction or as Banks may reasonably require, and to assign to or make the
loss payable to the Agent or Banks if the Banks so request.

                  (f)   Upon request, to furnish the Banks with such trade
documents and other evidence deemed necessary by the Banks to establish that
the presented draft is an Eligible Draft.

                  (g)   To indemnify the Banks from: (i) all loss or damage to
either Bank arising out of their acceptance of, or any other action taken by
either Bank in connection with, the drafts other than loss or damage resulting
from such Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (ii) all costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys' fees whether
on trial or appeal) arising out of either Bank's acceptance of the drafts or
incident to the collection of amounts owed by Customer on the drafts or the
enforcement of the Banks' rights.

                  (h)   To indemnify the Banks from any penalties and/or
reserve assessments, both current and retroactive, which the Banks or either
of them may from time to time be required to pay by any branch, agency, or
department of the federal government in connection with any draft if the draft
is accepted and it is later determined that such draft is not an Eligible
Draft.

            8.    Events of Default.  The occurrence of any of the following
shall constitute an Event of Default:

                  (a)   Customer fails to pay when due any obligation
hereunder or otherwise owing to Seafirst or U.S. Bank;

                  (b)   Customer breaches any other covenant herein;

                  (c)   Any oral or written representation, warranty, or other
statement made by Customer to the Banks shall prove false or materially
misleading; or

                  (d)   A Default occurs under the Credit Agreement.

Upon any Event of Default, at the Banks' option, the Banks may declare any and
all indebtedness owing by Borrower with respect to a draft to be immediately
due and payable without notice or demand and/or exercise any right or remedy
available at law and shall have all rights specified under the Credit
Agreement.

            9.    Authority.  The termination of authority granted to any of
the Banks' employees or Customer's employees at any time designated to act for
any purpose on any Bank's behalf or Customer's behalf hereunder, shall not
affect any action taken by such employee prior to receipt by the Banks or by
Customer, as the case may be, of written notice terminating such employee's
authority.

            10.   Modifications.  Customer agrees that in the event of any
mutually agreed modification of the terms of any draft, this Agreement shall
be effective with respect to such draft as modified.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of
the date first written above.

                                PROMISSORY NOTE


$18,750,000                                                Seattle, Washington
                                                               May 31, 1995   

            For value received, UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon corporation
("Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of SEATTLE-FIRST NATIONAL BANK, a
national banking association ("Seafirst) at its offices at 701 Fifth Avenue,
Seattle, Washington 98104, or at such other address as the holder of this Note
may designate in writing, the principal amount of each Advance made to
Borrower by Seafirst, as agent for itself, under Section 4.01 of the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement of even date herewith between Borrower,
Seafirst, and United States National Bank of Oregon (the "Credit Agreement"),
payable on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, together with
interest from the date hereof as follows:  (a) interest on the outstanding
balances of all Seafirst Prime Loans at the Seafirst Prime Rate monthly in
arrears on the first day of each and every calendar month and in no event
later than the applicable Maturity Date, and (b) interest on the outstanding
balances of all LIBOR Loans at the LIBOR Rates applicable thereto on the
expiration of the applicable Interest Period or in the case of an Interest
Period of six (6) months, each three- (3-) month anniversary of the
commencement of that Interest Period, or at the applicable Maturity Date,
whichever first occurs.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Advances and all interest shall
be due and payable no later than the applicable Maturity Date.  All payments
shall be applied in accordance with Section 6.11 of the Credit Agreement.

            Upon the occurrence of a Default, as defined in the Credit
Agreement, the  holder of this Note may declare the entire amount owing under
this Note immediately due and payable.  All amounts not paid when due shall
bear interest at the "Default Rate" specified in the Credit Agreement.  The
failure of the holder of this Note promptly to exercise the holder's rights
hereunder in the event any default shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights while such default continues nor a waiver of such rights in connection
with any future default.  Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, notice,
and protest.

            In the event the holder of this Note retains an attorney(s) for
the purpose of collecting the indebtedness evidenced by this Note, Borrower
shall pay holder's reasonable attorney fees and collection costs, even though
no civil action is filed on this Note.  If an action is filed, Borrower shall
pay such additional sum as the trial judge and any appellate court may adjudge
reasonable as attorney fees in the action, including any appeal, along with
statutory costs and disbursements and together with interest on said sums at
the Default Rate from the date the fees, costs, and disbursements are
incurred.

<PAGE>
            This Note is governed in all respects by the terms of the Credit
Agreement, as amended from time to time.  The combined outstanding principal
balances owed on this Note drawn by Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement
may not exceed at any one time $18,750,000.  All terms capitalized herein
shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Credit Agreement.  This
Note continues, amends and restates that prior Promissory Note made by
Borrower in favor of Seafirst as of March 13, 1992, as the same was amended
from time to time thereafter.

    Days of receipt of such notice, Guarantor shall make a Guaranty Payment
    to the Buyer in the amount of such Liquidation Loss; provided, however,
    that Guarantor's obligation to make a Guaranty Payment shall be limited
    to first, the then available Guaranty Amount, and if the Guaranty Amount
    is exhausted, the then available Holdback Guaranty Amount.

          (e)   A new subsection (d) is added to Section 7.01 of the
Agreement and reads as follows:

          (d)   The parties to this Agreement hereby expressly acknowledge
    that the Guaranty Amount will be available to support the Holdback
    Guaranty to the extent the Holdback Guaranty Amount has been exhausted
    and conversely, that the Holdback Guaranty Amount will be available to
    support Guarantor's Guaranty hereunder to the extent the Guaranty Amount
    is exhausted.

          (f)   A new Termination Event is added as subsection (h) of
Section 10.01 of the Agreement and reads as follows:

          (h)   Termination Event under Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement.  A
    Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing under the
    Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement.

          (g)   Section 10.02 of the Agreement is amended to read as follows:

          SECTION 10.02     Consequences of Termination Event.  If any
    Termination Event shall occur and be continuing, then in any such case
    and at any time thereafter so long as such Termination Event shall be
    continuing, the Buyer may, at its option, immediately terminate Buyer's
    obligations to make Incremental Purchases and to accept Renewal Notes
    hereunder.

          In addition, upon the occurrence of any Termination Event specified
    in (c), (d) or (e) of Section 10.01 or a Termination Event arising out of
    Servicer's or Guarantor's insolvency or involvement in a voluntary or
    involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, subject to the provisions of
    Section 11.15, this Agreement shall automatically and immediately
    terminate.

          Thereafter, and before exercising any other remedies provided
    herein or by applicable law, Buyer may, at its option, require that
    Seller repurchase all Loans and related Property Notes for the Purchase
    Amount within two 2 Business Days of receipt of notice from the Buyer of
    its election to cause the repurchase of all Loans.  In addition, Buyer
    may pursue all other rights and remedies available herein and by
    applicable law including, without limitation, its rights to pursue
    collection from the Seller in an amount equal to the applicable Purchase
    Amount.

          (h)   A new Section 11.15 is added to the Agreement and reads as
follows:

          SECTION 11.15     Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall
    terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the reduction of the aggregate
    Principal Balance of the Loans (including Liquidated Loans as to which
    there remain unpaid Liquidation Losses) to zero or (ii) the date on which
    this Agreement is automatically terminated following the occurrence of
    any of the specified Termination Events pursuant to Section 10.02;
    provided, however, that (a) the rights accrued to the Buyer prior to such
    termination, (b) the obligations of the Guarantor under this Agreement,
    and (c) the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 11.02 shall
    be continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

          2.    Capitalized Terms.  Capitalized terms used in this Second

                          INSTALLMENT NOTE


$----------------                          ----------------------


          THE UNDERSIGNED ("Borrowers"), jointly and severally, promise to
pay to the order of ----------------------, a ------------ corporation
("Payee"), at ----------------------
- -------------------------, or to its assigns (the "Bank"), or at such other
address as the Bank may specify to the Borrowers in writing, the sum of ------
- -------------------------------------
($----------), payable in ------------ (---) consecutive monthly installments
of ----------------------------- ($-----------), the first payment to be made
on -------------------- with subsequent payments to be made on the same day of
each month thereafter until the final payment becomes due on -----------------
- -----.

          The outstanding principal balance will bear interest at a fixed
rate of ---------- percent.  The interest rate will be assessed at Prime rate
plus -------- percentage points and will be adjusted every six months using
the prime rate published by
- ------------------ plus ------- percentage points.  Any such change in the
interest rate will cause a change in the monthly payment to ensure payment in
full of the existing balance over the remaining amortization period.  Interest
shall be payable monthly on the same day as the principal, until the whole
sum, principal and interest, has been paid.

          This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time.  All such
prepayments will be applied first to the payment of other charges, fees, and
expenses under this Note and any other Related Document, as defined below,
second to the payment of accrued interest, and third to principal installments
due hereunder in inverse order of maturity.

          This Note is issued in connection with and is subject to the terms
of a security agreement between the Borrowers and
- ------------------/United Grocers, Inc., and to additional documents
guaranteeing the obligations hereunder or granting liens to secure same. 
Reference is made to such loan agreement and additional documents for other
terms under which amounts payable hereunder may become immediately due and
owing.  Although ---------------------- may sell, assign, or otherwise
transfer this Note to a third party, this Note will continue to be subject to
the loan agreement and such other documents.

          The Borrowers agree that until this Note is paid in full Borrowers
shall (1) do all things necessary to maintain its status as a member in good
standing of Untied Grocers, Inc., and (2) purchase product through United
Grocers, Inc., to the extent that a certain percentage may be required in the
Related Documents or other agreements that may exist between Borrowers, Payee,
or United Grocers, Inc.

          The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute an
Event of Default under this Note:  (i) any default in the payment of this
Note; (ii) any breach or default under other Related Documents or other
agreements that may exist between Borrower, Payee, or United Grocers, Inc.;
(iii) Borrowers fail to purchase the required percentage of product from
United Grocers, Inc., that may be required in the Related Documents or other
agreements that exist between Borrowers, Payee, or United Grocers, Inc.; (iv)
Borrowers shall no longer be a member in good standing of United Grocers,
Inc.; (v) either the Payee or Bank in good faith shall believe the prospect of
payment of this Note is substantially impaired due to a materially adverse
change in Borrowers' financial condition.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default and at any time thereafter, the holder of this Note may, at its
option, declare this Note to be immediately due and payable and thereupon this
Note shall become due and payable for the entire unpaid principal balance of
this Note plus accrued interest and other charges on this Note without any
presentment, demand, protest, or other notice of any kind.  If this Note is
placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, Borrowers promise and agree
to pay the reasonable attorney fees and collection costs of the holder of this
Note even though no suit or action is filed hereon; if a suit or an action is
filed, the Borrowers must pay such reasonable attorney fees as shall be fixed
by the court or courts in which the suit or action, including any appeal
therein, is tried, heard, and decided.  The Borrowers agree that their
obligations hereunder are absolute and unconditional and shall continue for so
long as any amounts payable hereunder remain unpaid, without any defense or
set off.

                              SUBLEASE AGREEMENT


    THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT entered into this 15th day of December, 1993, by
and between UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon corporation, hereinafter
designated as Sublessor, and Robert A. Lamb and Gale Lasko, partners in
Wilsonville Partnership, hereinafter jointly and severally designated as
Sublessee;

                              W I T N E S S E T H

    WHEREAS, the Sublessor has entered into a Lease dated February 7, 1985,
with United Southwest Development, for a supermarket located in Troutdale
Plaza at Troutdale Road and Stark Street, City of Troutdale, County of
Multnomah, State of Oregon, commencing on the date set forth in the attached
Exhibit "A," a copy of which is hereby incorporated by reference, as fully as
if its terms and conditions were herein set forth.  Lessor's interest in said
lease having been assigned to Paul Rex Holland, December, 1991.

    WHEREAS, Sublessee's desire to sublet said premises to and through
March 31, 2005, commencing on December 14, 1993, and Sublessor is willing to
so sublet in accordance with the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;
now, therefore,

    IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

    (1)   Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessees those premises described
in said Exhibit "A," for the term described. 

          1.1   The Sublessees, so long as they are not in default hereunder,
shall be granted the right to exercise the renewal options contained in
Exhibit "A," as set forth in said Exhibit, upon the condition that Sublessees
are not in default and provide Sublessor with lease guaranty insurance for the
renewal term.  Said insurance shall be in form and substance acceptable to
Sublessor and shall designate Sublessor as the insured thereunder.

    (2)   Sublessees covenant and agree to pay for the whole of said term the
same rental, together with all affirmative covenants including, without
limitation, those pertaining to basic rent, percentage of gross sales, taxes,
assessments, insurance and all of the covenants and obligations to be
performed by Sublessees, as set forth in said Exhibit "A," and to make such
payments and provide such performance when due by the terms of the lease and
amendments thereto.

    (3)   Sublessees shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all rental, or
security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and conditions of said
Exhibits "A."

    (4)   Sublessees shall be bound by the same responsibilities, rights,
privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in Exhibit "A", except for
provisions of paragraph 45 and paragraph 3, which rights are retained by
Sublessors, and covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor
harmless from any and all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may
incur by virtue of said Exhibit "A," and/or Sublessees' occupancy of the
premises.  Furthermore, Sublessees shall be bound by any subsequent amendment,
revision, supplement or addition to the prime lease between Sublessor and the
prime Lessor, and to keep the Sublessor indemnified against all actions,
claims and demands whatsoever in respect to said exhibit "A," and Sublessees
use of the demised premises.

    4.1   Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessees acknowledge that provisions
for extension options and assignment and subletting in the Lease are
applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor only.  Sublessees will not assign
this Sublease or sublet the premises without the prior written consent of
Sublessor which may be granted or withheld in its absolute discretion.  A
direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a majority of the
voting stock of a corporate Sublessees, by whatever demands, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purposes of this paragraph.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sublessee's desire to transfer by sale,
gift, or as a result of death, its interest herein to its lawful issue, the
Sublessor shall not unreasonably withhold consent to such a transfer,
provided, such transferee agrees that it holds such interest subject to the
restrictions and conditions contained in this sublease agreement.

    4.2   Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

          (a)   Membership in United Grocers, Inc.  Upon execution and during
the term hereof, Sublessees agree to maintain or cause to be maintained the
membership of the store in good standing in United Grocers, in accordance with
the Bylaws of United Grocers, as long as this Sublease remains in effect
 
          (b)   Purchases from Sublessor.  Sublessees agree that throughout
the term of the Sublease and any extensions or renewals thereof, except as
hereinafter provided, Sublessees will purchase from Sublessor not less than
fifty-eight percent (58%) of its retail sales of all goods and merchandise
required by it for resale on the premises to the extent that Sublessor shall
now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and merchandise to the
Sublessees, and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessees' requirements at such
prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered by
Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor carrying on businesses similar to
that of the Sublessees in Portland, Oregon.  If, at any time, the Sublessees
contend that Sublessor is not able to supply particular goods or merchandise
customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in Portland, or that terms offered
by Sublessor are not reasonably comparable to those offered by Sublessor to
other purchasers described above, the Sublessees shall so advise Sublessor in
writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days
after receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not advise Sublessees that the terms and
conditions offered are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other
purchasers, Sublessees shall be free to secure such specified goods and
merchandise from any source which it desires.  If Sublessor demonstrates that
it is offering reasonably comparable terms, and Sublessees nonetheless
purchase from another source, such purchase or purchases shall not be an
exception from the 58% requirement specified above.  If the above percentage
requirements are not complied with, it shall constitute a default hereunder. 
In the event of a breach of this purchase covenant, Sublessor may terminate
this sublease and, in addition to the remedies hereinafter offered Sublessor,
Sublessee agrees to pay Sublessor, as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty
or forfeiture, a sum computed as follows:

                1.    The average weekly purchases from the date of the
    agreement to the date of the breach shall be determined;

                2.    the average weekly purchases so determined shall then
    be multiplied by the number of weeks from the date of the breach to the
    end of the term of the purchase agreement; and

                3.    The computed sum shall be multiplied by two and
    one-quarter percent (2-1/4%) to determine the liquidated damages due and
    owing Sublessor by reason of Sublessee's default.  Said sum shall become
    immediately due and owing within 15 days from date of written notice of
    the liquidated damages.

          (c)   Sublessees covenant that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, and for an additional period of six (6) months thereafter, Sublessees
shall not directly or indirectly sell or permit the sale of the store and the
owners of Sublessees shall not directly or indirectly sell controlling
interests in Sublessees (whether in one or a series of related transactions)
without first offering to sell said store or controlling interest, as the case
may be, to Sublessor upon the same terms and conditions as the Sublessees or
their owners, as the case may be, are prepared to accept from a third party. 
Prior to such sale by the Sublessees or their owners, the Sublessees shall
first notify Sublessor of the desire to sell the store or controlling interest
in the Sublessees and of all the terms and conditions of such sale and shall
provide to Sublessor all documents, instruments, agreements, offers,
acceptances, appraisals, inventories, equipment lists, leases, financial
statements and such other material and information as Sublessor may reasonably
request to aid in its decision to exercise or decline its right to purchase as
hereinafter provided.  Within 30 days following receipt of such notice of
desire to sell and all materials and information reasonably requested by
Sublessor, Sublessor shall advise Sublessees whether Sublessor elects to
purchase or declines to purchase the store or such controlling interest upon
the offered terms and conditions.  If Sublessor shall elect to purchase,
Sublessor shall purchase and the Sublessees or their owners shall sell, such
retail grocery business or such controlling interest, as the case may be, all
on the terms set forth in the offer.  If Sublessor declines the purchase, the
Sublessees or their owners shall be free to sell the store or controlling
interest, as the case may be, upon (and only upon) the terms and conditions
offered as aforesaid to Sublessor; provided that such sale is consummated
within 120 days following the date Sublessor declined the purchase, and if
such sale is not consummated in accordance with the offered terms and
conditions within said 120-day period, the provisions of this paragraph shall
apply again and no subsequent sale of any portion of the offered store or
controlling interest may be effected without again offering the same to
Sublessor as provided herein.  Sublessor may waive its rights under this
section provided such waiver is in writing.  The foregoing provisions shall
not apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of Sublessees, or transfers of assets to a
corporation or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest to a trust
as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor; provided such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or
controlling interest subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph.

          (d)   Sublessees represent and warrant that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agree to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.

          (e)   Sublessees hereby represent and warrant to Sublessor that the
financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to Sublessor in
connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true, correct,
complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements fairly
and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.

    (5)   Security Agreement.

          5.1 Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessees and Sublessor
agree that this Sublease shall constitute a security agreement within the
meaning of the Oregon Uniform Commercial Code (hereinafter referred to as the

Sublessor) presently or hereafter held by or deposited with Sublessor by
Sublessees;

                (b)   any and all patronage rebates and rebate notes
representing patronage rebates (as defined in the Bylaws of Sublessor) earned
or hereafter earned by reason of patronage of Sublessor by Sublessees;

                (c)   subject to liens securing purchase money financing
therefor as described in Exhibit "X," all trade, store and other fixtures and
all leasehold improvements and all equipment and other personal property of
Sublessees used or useful in the operation of the store in or on the premises,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired including, without limitation, the
property described in Exhibit "Y", attached hereto, if any; and 

                (d)   all replacements of substitutions for, and additions to
the foregoing, and the proceeds thereof (all of said personal property and the
replacements, substitutions and additions thereto and the proceeds thereof
being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Collateral"), and
that a security interest in and to the Collateral is hereby granted to the
Sublessor, and the Collateral and all of the Sublessees' right, title and
interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all to secure all
presently existing or hereafter incurred direct, indirect, absolute or
contingent indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of Sublessees to
Sublessor (referred to as "the Obligations" herein) including, but not limited
to, the payment of all rent and other sums and the performance of all other
obligations of Sublessees under the Sublease, all renewals and extensions
thereof, the price of goods, services and merchandise purchased by Sublessees
from Sublessor from time to time, and all costs of collection, legal expenses
and attorneys' fees paid or incurred by Sublessor in enforcing any rights in
respect to the Obligations or in connection with assembling, collecting,
selling or otherwise dealing with or realizing upon the Collateral.

    5.2   Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and without limiting
the force or effect of any other covenants, representations and warranties of
Sublessees contained in this Sublease, Sublessees hereby covenant, represent
and warrant to and with Sublessor as follows:
 
          (a)   Sublessees are the owners of the Collateral free and clear of
liens, security interests and encumbrances of every kind and description,
except liens, security interests and encumbrances securing indebtedness to
Sublessor and liens described on Exhibit "X," hereto to which Secured Party
has consented ("Permitted Liens").
 
          (b)   Sublessees will not sell, dispose of, encumber or permit any
other security interest, lien or encumbrance to attach to the Collateral
except the security interest of Sublessor and the Permitted Liens.
 
          (c)   All tangible Collateral shall be kept at Sublessees' place(s)

to be removed therefrom without the prior written consent of Sublessor.

          (d)   Sublessees shall keep the tangible Collateral at all times
insured against risks of loss or damage by fire (including so-called extended
coverage), theft and such other casualties as Sublessor may reasonably
require, all in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms,
for such periods and written by such companies or underwriters as Sublessor
may approve.  All such policies of insurance shall name Sublessor as loss
payee thereon as its rates may appear and shall provide for at least 30 days'
prior written notice of modification or cancellation to Sublessor.  Sublessees
shall furnish Sublessor with certificates of such insurance or other evidence
satisfactory to Sublessor as to compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph.  Sublessor may act as attorney-in-fact for Sublessees in making,
adjusting and settling claims under and canceling such insurance and endorsing
Sublessees' name on any drafts drawn by insurers of the Collateral.

          (e)   Sublessees will keep the Collateral in good order and repair,
shall not waste or destroy the Collateral or any part thereof, and shall not
use the Collateral in violation of any statute, ordinance or policy of
insurance thereon.  Sublessor may examine and inspect the Collateral at any
reasonable time or times, wherever located.

          (f)   Sublessees will pay promptly when due all taxes and
assessments upon the Collateral or for its use or operation or upon this
Sublease or upon any instruments evidencing the Obligations.

          (g) Sublessees will pay promptly when due all indebtedness secured
by any lien or other security interest in the Collateral, whether superior or
junior to the security interest established hereby.

          5.3   Additional Remedies.  Upon any default hereunder and at any
time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), Sublessor at
its option may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable and shall
have the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of
Oregon (the "Code"), including without limitation the right to take immediate
and exclusive possession of the Collateral.

          5.4   Financing Statements.  Sublessees will at their own cost and
expense, upon demand, furnish to Sublessor such financing statements and other
documents in form satisfactory to Sublessor and will do all such acts and
things as Sublessor may at any time or from time to time request or as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain a perfected security
interest in the Collateral.

          5.5   Attorneys' Fees.  In the event of the institution of any suit
or action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, Sublessees shall and do hereby agree to pay, in addition to the costs

proceedings or on any appeal from any judgment or decree entered therein.

    (6)   Default. The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:

under the Lease or any other default under the Lease which continues for up to
one-half of the cure period as defined in the lease, provided with respect
thereto in the Lease;

          6.2   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due rent or any other

furnished to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessees is false in any
material respect when made or furnished;

          6.4   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due and/or satisfy any
other present or hereinafter incurred indebtedness or obligation of Sublessees
to Sublessor, including but not limited to those arising from Sublessees'
purchases of goods and services from Sublessor any other loans or leases
Sublessees may have or enter into with Sublessor, and Sublessees' obligations
under the Bylaws of Sublessor and its application for membership in Sublessor;

          6.5   If Sublessees vacate or abandon the premises or allow the
premises to remain vacant or unoccupied;

    (7)   Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:

          7.1 Sublessor shall have the right at its election then or at any
time thereafter, upon notice to Sublessees, to terminate this Sublease or to
Sublessees' rights of possession in the premises without terminating this
Sublease;
 
          7.2   Sublessor shall have the immediate right, whether or not the
Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1, to re-enter and
repossess the premises or any part thereof by force, summary proceedings,
ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, and without any liability
on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;
 
          7.3   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to), whether
or not this Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1,
resublet the premises, or any part thereof, in the name of Sublessees,
Sublessor or otherwise, without notice to Sublessees, for such term or terms
and for such uses as Sublessor, in its absolute discretion, may determine and
may collect and receive rents payable by reason of such resubletting (without
any liability for any failure to collect such rents);

          7.4   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessees hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until repaid; and

          7.5   Sublessor may exercise any and all other rights and remedies
afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have as provided herein, pursuant to
the laws of the State of Oregon.  In addition to the other remedies provided
above, Sublessor shall be entitled to current damages and final damages as
provided in paragraph (8) below, and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened
violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a decree
compelling performance of this Sublease.

          7.6   No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession
of the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any
part thereof, whether pursuant to the above paragraph or by operation of law
or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessees of their liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or resubletting.

    (8)   Damages.

          8.1   Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessees for
the period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and, thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether or
not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessees
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessees in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any, of any
resubletting effected for the account of Sublessees, after deducting from such
proceeds all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
such resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession costs,
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, employee expenses,
alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting). 
Sublessees will pay such current damages on the days on which rent would have
been payable under this Sublease in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the
same from Sublessees on each such day.

          8.2   Final Damages.  At any time after such expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to paragraph 8.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessees, and Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessees' default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of such
demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely difficult
to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the
rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease from the date
of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which Sublessees shall have
satisfied in full their obligations under paragraph 8.1 to pay current
damages) for what would be the then unexpired term in the absence of such
expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value at an
assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum over (b) the then net
rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an assumed intern
rate of seven percent (7%) per annum for the same period.  Rental value shall
be established by reference to the terms and conditions upon which Sublessor
resublets the premises if such resubletting is accomplished within a
reasonable period of time after such expiration, or repossession, and
otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's estimates and assumptions of
fact regarding market and other relevant circumstances, which shall govern
unless shown to be erroneous.  If any statute or rule of law shall validly
limit the amount of such liquidated final damages to less than the amount
above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be entitled to the maximum amount allowable
under such statute or rule of law.

    (9)   Rights Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. 
No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to
have been made whether due in the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless
expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.

    (10)  Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be given
under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when, and only
when, the same is in writing and has been deposited in the United States Mail,
with postage prepaid, to be forwarded by registered or certified mail and
addressed to the party to be notified at the address appearing below its
signature.  Such addresses may be changed from time to time by serving of
notice as above provided.

    (11)  Right of Refusal: If, during the term of this sublease, or any
extension hereof, Sublessee or any successor to Sublessee shall receive a bona
fide offer to purchase the business being operated under this sublease, i.e.,
goodwill, fixtures and/or equipment and inventory or the property of which the
premises are a part, which offer is acceptable to Sublessee, Sublessor shall
have the right to purchase the business (or the property) upon the same terms
and conditions.  Sublessee agrees to immediately, upon receipt of such offer,
to give Sublessor written notice of the terms and conditions thereof, and the
Sublessor shall have the right, for thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice, to exercise its option to purchase under the identical terms and
conditions of such offer.  Sublessor's exercise of its option shall be given
in writing, within said thirty-day period.


    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed the foregoing Sublease
Agreement the day and year first above written.

                             W I T N E S S E T H:

          WHEREAS, Sublessees desire to sublet said premises for a period of
20 years, commencing on date set forth in paragraph 8 of Exhibit "A," and
Sublessor is willing to so sublet in accordance with the terms and conditions

          IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

          (1)   Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessees those premises

covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any
and all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of
said Exhibit "A," and/or Sublessees' occupancy of the premises.  Furthermore,
Sublessees shall be bound by any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement or
addition to the prime lease between Sublessor and the prime Lessor, and to
keep the Sublessor indemnified against all actions, claims and demands
whatsoever in respect to said Exhibit "A," and Sublessees use of the demised
premises.

          (5)    Default. The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:

                5.1   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due rent or any
other amount due under the Lease or to perform when due any other obligation
of Sublessor under the Lease or any other default under the Lease which
continues for up to one-half of the cure period provided with respect thereto
in the Lease;

                5.2   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due rent or any
other amount due under this Sublease or to perform when due any other
obligation of Sublessees hereunder;

                5.3   If any warranty, representation or statement made or
furnished to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessees is false in any
material respect when made or furnished;

                5.4   Any default under any document securing or guarantying
the obligations of Sublessees under this Sublease;

                5.5   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due and/or

of Sublessees to Sublessor, including but not limited to those arising from
Sublessees' purchases of goods and services from Sublessor any other loans or
leases Sublessees may have or enter into with Sublessor, and Sublessees'
obligations under the Bylaws of Sublessor and its application for membership
in Sublessor;

                5.6   If Sublessees vacate or abandon the premises or allow
the premises to remain vacant or unoccupied;

                5.7  If Sublessees make an assignment for the benefit of

bankruptcy is filed against Sublessees, or Sublessees are adjudicated a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for
all or part of Sublessees' assets, or a petition or answer is filed by or
against Sublessees seeking or acquiescing in any reorganization, liquidation
or similar relief under any federal, state or local law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors; and 

                5.8   If Sublessees sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
substantial portion of the assets of Sublessees located at or associated with
the store, other than inventory sold at retail in the ordinary course of
business (i.e., at the full retail price customarily charged therefor or at a
reduced price pursuant to a retail sale in which the price reduction and sale
duration are typical of sales of other retail grocery businesses similarly
situated).

          (6)    Remedies. In the event of any default under this Sublease:

                6.1   Sublessor shall have the right, at its election then or
at any time thereafter, upon notice to Sublessees, to terminate this Sublease
or to terminate Sublessees' rights of possession in the premises without
terminating this Sublease;

                6.2   Sublessor shall have the immediate right, whether or
not the Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 6.1, to
re-enter and repossess the premises or any part thereof by force, summary
proceedings, ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, all without
any liability on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;

                6.3  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to),
whether or not this Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph
6.1, resublet the premises, or any part thereof, in the name of Sublessees,
Sublessor or otherwise, without notice to Sublessees, for such term or terms
and for such uses as Sublessor, in its absolute discretion, may determine and
may collect and receive rents payable by reason of such resubletting (without
any liability for any failure to collect such rents);

                6.4  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to)
procure any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay
any sums required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be
required of Sublessees hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest
at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until
repaid; and 

                6.5  Sublessor may exercise any and all other rights and
remedies afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease and any and
all other rights and remedies Sublessor may have pursuant to the laws of the
state of Oregon.  In addition to the other remedies provided above, Sublessor
shall be entitled to current damages and final damages as provided in
paragraph (7) below, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to
injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened
violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a decree
compelling performance of this Sublease.

                6.6  No expiration or termination of this Sublease,
repossession of the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the
premises or any part thereof, whether pursuant to the above paragraph or by
operation of law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessees of their liabilities
and obligations under this sublease, all of which shall survive such
expiration, termination, repossession or resubletting.

    (7)  Damages.

                7.1    Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessees for
the period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and, thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether or
not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessees
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessees in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any, of any
resubletting effected for the account of Sublessees, after deducting from such
proceeds all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
such resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession costs,
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, employee expenses,
alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting). 
Sublessees will pay such current damages on the days on which rent would have
been payable under this Sublease in the absence of such expiration, termina-
tion or repossession, and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the same from
Sublessees on each such day.

                7.2   Final Damages.  At any time after any such expiration
or termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to paragraph 7.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessees, and Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessees' default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of such
demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely difficult
to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the
rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease from the date
of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which Sublessees shall have
satisfied in full their obligations under paragraph 7.1 to pay current
damages) for what.would be the then unexpired term in the absence of such
expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value at an
assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, over (b) the then net
rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an assumed
interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum for the same period.  Rental
value shall be established by reference to the terms and conditions upon which
Sublessor resublets the premises if such resubletting is accomplished within a
reasonable period of time after such expiration, termination or repossession,
and otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's estimates and
assumptions of fact regarding market and other relevant circumstances, which
shall govern unless shown to be erroneous.  If any statute or rule of law
shall validly limit the amount of such liquidated final damages to less than
the amount above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be entitled to the maximum
amount allowable under such statute or rule of law.

    (8)   Rights Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. 
No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to
have been made whether due to the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless
expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.

    (9)   Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessees acknowledge that provisions
for extension options and assignment and subletting in the Lease are
applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor only.  Sublessees will not assign
this Sublease or sublet the premises without the prior written consent of
Sublessor which may be granted or withheld in its absolute discretion.  A
direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a majority of the
voting stock of a corporate Sublessees, by whatever demands, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purposes of this paragraph.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sublessees desire to transfer by
sale, gift, or as a result of death, its interest herein to its lawful issue,
the Sublessor shall not unreasonably withhold consent to such a transfer,
provided, such transferee agrees that it holds such interest subject to the
restrictions and conditions contained in this sublease agreement.

    (10)  Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

          10.1  Sublessees agree to maintain or cause to be maintained the
membership of the store in good standing in Sublessor, in accordance with the
Bylaws of Sublessor, as long as this Sublease remains in effect.
 
          10.2  Sublessees agree that throughout the term of the Sublease and
any extensions or renewals thereof, except as hereinafter provided, Sublessees
will purchase from Sublessor not less than 58 percent of its retail sales of
all goods and merchandise required by it for resale on the premises to the
extent that Sublessor shall now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and
merchandise to the Sublessees, and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessees'
requirements at such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to
those offered by Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor carrying on
businesses similar to that of the Sublessees in Portland, Oregon.  If, at-any
time, the Sublessees contend that Sublessor is not able to supply particular
goods or merchandise customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in
_____________, Oregon, or that terms offered by
Sublessor are not reasonably comparable to those offered by Sublessor to other
purchasers described above, the Sublessees shall so advise Sublessor in
writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days
after receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not advise Sublessees that the terms and
conditions offered are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other
purchasers, Sublessees shall be free to secure such specified goods and
merchandise from any source which it desires.  If Sublessor asserts that it is
offering reasonably comparable terms, and Sublessees nonetheless purchase from
another source, such purchase shall be a default under this paragraph.

          10.3  Sublessees covenant that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, and for an additional period of six (6) months thereafter, Sublessees
shall not directly or indirectly sell or permit the sale of the store and the
owners of Sublessees shall not directly or indirectly sell controlling
interests in Sublessees (whether in one or a series of related transactions)
without first offering to sell said store or controlling interest, as the case
may be, to Sublessor upon the same terms and conditions as the Sublessees or
their owners, as the case may be, are prepared to accept from a third party. 
Prior to such sale by the Sublessees or their owners, the Sublessees shall
first notify Sublessor of the desire to sell the store or controlling interest
in the Sublessees and of all the terms and conditions of such sale and shall
provide to Sublessor all documents, instruments, agreements, offers,
acceptances, appraisals, inventories, equipment lists, leases, financial
statements and such other material and information as Sublessor may reasonably
request to aid in its decision to exercise or decline its right to purchase as
hereinafter provided.  Within 30 days following receipt of such notice of
desire to sell and all materials and information reasonably requested by
Sublessor, Sublessor shall advise Sublessees whether Sublessor elects to
purchase or declines to purchase the store or such controlling interest upon
the offered terms and conditions.  If Sublessor shall elect to purchase,
Sublessor shall purchase and the Sublessees or their owners shall sell, such
retail grocery business or such controlling interest, as the case may be, all
on the terms set forth in the offer.  If Sublessor declines the purchase, the
Sublessees or their owners shall be free to sell the store or controlling
interest, as the case may be, upon (and only upon) the terms and conditions
offered as aforesaid to Sublessor; provided that such sale is consummated
within 120 days following the date Sublessor declined the purchase, and if
such sale is not consummated in accordance with the offered terms and
conditions within said 120-day period, the provisions of this paragraph shall
apply again and no subsequent sale of any portion of the offered store or
controlling interest may be effected without again offering the same to
Sublessor as provided herein.  Sublessor may waive its rights under this
section provided such waiver is in writing.  The foregoing provisions shall
not apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of Sublessees, or transfers of assets to a
corporation or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest to a trust
as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor; provided such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or
controlling interest subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph.

          10.4  Sublessees represent and warrant that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agree to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.

          10.5   Sublessees hereby represent and warrant to Sublessor that
the financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to
Sublessor in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements
fairly and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.

    (11)  Security Agreement.

    11.1  Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessees and Sublessor agree
that this Sublease shall constitute a security agreement within the meaning of

as described in Exhibit "X," all trade, store and other fixtures and all
leasehold improvements and all equipment and other personal property of
Sublessees used or useful in the operation of the store in or on the premises,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired including, without limitation, the

          (d)   all replacements of substitutions for, and additions to the
foregoing, and the proceeds thereof (all of said personal property and the
replacements, substitutions and additions thereto and the proceeds thereof
being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Collateral"), and
that a security interest in and to the Collateral is hereby granted to the
Sublessor, and the Collateral and all of the Sublessees' right, title and
interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all to secure all
presently existing or hereafter incurred direct, indirect, absolute or
contingent indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of Sublessees to
Sublessor (referred to as "the Obligations" herein) including, but not limited
to, the payment of all rent and other sums and the performance of all other
obligations of Sublessees under this Sublease, all renewals and extensions
thereof, the price of goods, services and merchandise purchased by Sublessees
from Sublessor from time to time, and all costs of collection, legal expenses
and attorneys' fees paid or incurred by Sublessor in enforcing any rights in
respect to the Obligations or in connection with assembling, collecting,
selling or otherwise dealing with or realizing upon the Collateral. 

          11.2  Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and without
limiting the force or effect of any other covenants, representations and
warranties of Sublessees contained in this Sublease, Sublessees hereby
covenant, represent and warrant to and with Sublessor as follows:

                (a)    Sublessees are the owners of the Collateral free and

indebtedness to Sublessor and liens described on Exhibit "X" hereto to which
Secured Party has consented ("Permitted Liens").

permit any other security interest, lien or encumbrance to attach to the
Collateral except the security interest of Sublessor and the Permitted Liens.

                (c)    All tangible Collateral shall be kept at Sublessees'
place(s) of business located on the premises, and Sublessees shall not permit
the same to be removed therefrom without the prior written consent of
Sublessor.

                (d)    Sublessees shall keep the tangible Collateral at all
times insured against risks of loss or damage by fire (including so-called
extended coverage), theft and such other casualties as Sublessor may
reasonably require, all in such  amounts, under such forms of policies, upon
such terms, for such periods and written by such companies or underwriters as
Sublessor may approve.  All such policies of insurance shall name Sublessor as
loss payee thereon as its interest may appear and shall provide for at least
30 days' prior written notice of modification or cancellation to Sublessor. 
Sublessees shall furnish Sublessor with certificates of such insurance or
other evidence satisfactory to Sublessor as to compliance with the provisions
of this paragraph.  Sublessor may act as attorney-in-fact for Sublessees in
making, adjusting and settling claims under and cancelling such insurance and
endorsing Sublessees' name on any drafts drawn by insurers of the Collateral.

                (e)    Sublessees will keep the Collateral in good order and

reasonable time or times, wherever located.

                (f)   Sublessees will pay promptly when due all taxes and
assessments upon the Collateral or for its use or operation or upon this
Sublease or upon any instruments evidencing the Obligations.

                (g)   Sublessees will pay promptly when due all indebtedness
secured by any lien or other security interest in the Collateral, whether
superior or junior to the security interest established hereby.

          11.3   Additional Remedies.  Upon any default hereunder and at any
time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), Sublessor at
its option may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable and shall
have the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of
Oregon (the "Code"), including without limitation the right to take immediate
and exclusive possession of the Collateral.

          11.4  Financing Statements.  Sublessees will at their own cost and
expense, upon demand, furnish to Sublessor such statements and other documents
in form satisfactory to Sublessor and will do all such acts and things as

or appropriate to establish and maintain a perfected security interest in the
Collateral.

                              SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

          THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT entered into this 15th day of March, 1994,
by and between UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon corporation, hereinafter
designated as Sublessor, and Al Mancasola Grocery Markets, Inc, a California
Corporation, and John Allen Mancasola and Ronald L. and Sue V. Mancasola,
husband and wife, hereinafter jointly and severally designated as Sublessee;
                                  WITNESSETH
          WHEREAS, the Sublessor has entered into a Lease dated March 14,

supermarket located at 14001 Lakeridge Circle, Magalia, CA., commencing on the

incorporated by reference, as fully as if its terms and conditions were herein
set forth.
          WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublet said premises for a period of
20 years, commencing November 1, 1993, to and including October 31, 2013, and
Sublessor is willing to so sublet in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth; now, therefore,
          IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:
          (1)   Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessee those premises
described in said Exhibit "A," for the term of 20 years.

                1.1   The Sublessees, so long as they are not in default
hereunder, shall be granted the right to exercise the renewal options
contained in Exhibit "A," as set forth in paragraphs 3 and 7 of said Exhibit,
upon the condition that Sublessees are not in default.  It is acknowledged by
Sublessee that such option may require lease guaranty insurance for the
renewal term.  Said insurance shall be in form and substance acceptable to
Sublessor and shall designate Sublessor as the insured thereunder.

          (2)   Sublessee covenants and agrees to pay for the whole of said
term the same rental, together with all affirmative covenants including,
without limitation, those pertaining to basic rent, percentage of gross sales,
taxes, assessments, insurance and all of the covenants and obligations to be
performed by Sublessees, as set forth in said Exhibit "A," and to make such
payments and provide such performance when due by the terms of the lease and
amendments thereto.

          (3)   Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all
rental, or security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and conditions
of said Exhibits "A."

          (4)   Sublessee shall be bound by the same responsibilities,
rights, privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in Exhibit "A",
except for provisions of paragraph 46, which rights are retained by Sublessor,
and covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from
any and all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by
virtue of said Exhibit "A," and/or Sublessee's occupancy of the premises. 
Furthermore, Sublessees shall be bound by any subsequent amendment, revision,
supplement or addition to the prime lease between Sublessor and the prime
Lessor except any amendment, revision, supplement or addition which would
materially and adversely affect the financial obligations of Sublessee
pursuant to this lease, and to keep the Sublessor indemnified against all
actions, claims and demands whatsoever in respect to said exhibit "A," and
Sublessee's use of the demised premises.

          4.1   Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessee acknowledges that
provisions for extension options and assignment and subletting in the Lease
are applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor only, subject to the
conditions expressed in paragraph 1.1 hereof.  Sublessees will not assign this
Sublease or sublet the premises without the prior written consent of Sublessor
which may be granted or withheld in its absolute discretion.  A direct or
indirect transfer of ownership and control of a majority of the voting stock
of a corporate Sublessee, by whatever demands, shall be deemed an assignment
of this Sublease for the purposes of this paragraph.  Provided however, that
Sublessor agrees to not withhold consent unreasonably if such subletting is
intended for third party concessionaires operating inside of the building as a
supplement to the normal grocery store activity, and no more than a total of
seven (7) percent of the total area of the store shall be sublet.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sublessee's desire to transfer by
sale, gift, or as a result of death, its interest herein to its lawful issue
or immediate family member, the Sublessor shall not unreasonably withhold
consent to such a transfer, provided, such transferee agrees that it holds
such interest subject to the restrictions and conditions contained in this
sublease agreement.

          4.2    Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

                (a)   Membership in United Grocers, Inc.  Upon execution and
during the term hereof, Sublessee agrees to maintain or cause to be maintained
the membership of the store in good standing in United Grocers, in accordance
with the Bylaws of United Grocers, as long as this Sublease remains in effect.

                (b)   Purchases from Sublessor.  Sublessee agrees that
throughout the term of the Sublease and any extensions or renewals thereof,
except as hereinafter provided, Sublessee will purchase from Sublessor not
less than fifty-eight percent (58%) of its retail sales of all goods and
merchandise required by it for resale on the premises to the extent that
Sublessor shall now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and merchandise
to the Sublessee, and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessee's requirements at
such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered by
Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor carrying on businesses similar to
that of the Sublessees in the Magalia/Chico area of northern California.  If,
at any time, the Sublessee contends that Sublessor is not able to supply
particular goods or merchandise customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in
the Magalia/Chico area of northern California, or that the terms offered by
Sublessor are not reasonably comparable to those offered by Sublessor to other
purchasers described above, the Sublessee shall so advise Sublessor in
writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days
after receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not advise Sublessees that the terms and
conditions offered are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other
purchasers, Sublessee shall be free to secure such specified goods and
merchandise from any source which it desires.  If Sublessor demonstrates that
it is offering reasonably comparable terms, and Sublessee nonetheless
purchases from another source, such purchase or purchases shall not be an
exception from the 58% requirement specified above.  If the above percentage
requirements are not complied with, it shall constitute a default hereunder. 
In the event of a breach of this purchase covenant, Sublessor may terminate
this sublease and, in addition to the remedies hereinafter offered Sublessor,
Sublessee agrees to pay Sublessor, as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty
or forfeiture, a sum computed as follows:

                      1.    The average weekly purchases from the date of the
agreement to the date of the breach shall be determined;

                       2.   The average weekly purchases so determined shall
then be multiplied by the number of weeks from the date of the breach to the
end of the term of the purchase agreement; and

                      3.     The computed sum shall be multiplied by two and
one-quarter percent (2-1/4 %) to determine the liquidated damages due and
owing Sublessor by reason of Sublessee's default.  Said sum shall become
immediately due and owing within 15 days from date of written notice of the
liquidated damages.

                (c)   Sublessee covenants that as long as this Sublease
remains in effect, and for an additional period of six (6) months thereafter,
Sublessee shall not directly or indirectly sell or permit the sale of the
store and the owners of Sublessee shall not directly or indirectly sell
controlling interests in Sublessee (whether in one or a series of related
transactions) without first offering to sell said store or controlling
interest, as the case may be, to Sublessor upon the same terms and conditions
as the Sublessees or their owners, as the case may be, are prepared to accept
from a third party.  Prior to such sale by the Sublessees or their owners, the
Sublessees shall first notify Sublessor of the desire to sell the store or
controlling interest in the Sublessees and of all the terms and conditions of
such sale and shall provide to Sublessor all documents, instruments,
agreements, offers, acceptances, appraisals, inventories, equipment lists,
leases, financial statements and such other material and information in
Sublessee's possession as Sublessor may reasonably request to aid in its
decision to exercise or decline its right to purchase as hereinafter provided. 
Within 30 days following receipt of such notice of desire to sell and all
materials and information reasonably requested by Sublessor, Sublessor shall
advise Sublessee whether Sublessor elects to purchase or declines to purchase
the store or such controlling interest upon the offered terms and conditions. 
If Sublessor shall elect to purchase, Sublessor shall purchase and the
Sublessees or their owners shall sell, such retail grocery business or such
controlling interest, as the case may be, all on the terms set forth in the
offer.  If Sublessor declines the purchase, the Sublessees or their owners
shall be free to sell the store or controlling interest, as the case may be,
upon (and only upon) the terms and conditions offered as aforesaid to
Sublessor; provided that such sale is consummated within 120 days following
the date Sublessor declined the purchase, and if such sale is not consummated
in accordance with the offered terms and conditions within said 120-day
period, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply again and no subsequent
sale of any portion of the offered store or controlling interest may be
effected without again offering the same to Sublessor as provided herein. 
Sublessor may waive its rights under this section provided such waiver is in
writing.  The foregoing provisions shall not apply to transfers of assets or
interests by sale, gift or as a result of death to the lawful issue or
immediate family members of Sublessees, or transfers of assets to a
corporation or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest to a trust
as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor; provided such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or
controlling interest subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph.
                (d)   Sublessees represent and warrant that there are no
brokers, finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation in connection with this Sublease, and agree to hold Sublessor
harmless from any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.

                (e)    Sublessees hereby represent and warrant to Sublessor
that the financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to
Sublessor in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements
fairly and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.

          (5)   Security Agreement.

                5.1   Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessees and
Sublessor agree that this Sublease shall constitute a security agreement

of Sublessor) presently or hereafter held by or deposited with Sublessor by
Sublessees;

                      (b)    any and all patronage rebates and rebate notes
representing patronage rebates (as defined in the Bylaws of Sublessor) earned
or hereafter earned by reason of patronage of Sublessor by Sublessees;

                      (c)   subject to liens securing purchase money
financing therefor as described in Exhibit "X," all trade, store and other
fixtures and all leasehold improvements and all equipment and other personal
property of Sublessee used or useful in the operation of the store in or on
the premises, whether now owned or hereafter acquired including, without
limitation, the property described in Exhibit "Y", attached hereto, if any;
and

                      (d) all replacements of substitutions for, and
additions to the foregoing, and the proceeds thereof (all of said personal
property and the replacements, substitutions and additions thereto and the
proceeds thereof being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Collateral"), and that a security interest in and to the Collateral is hereby
granted to the Sublessor, and the Collateral and all of the Sublessee's right,
title and interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all to secure
all presently existing or hereafter incurred direct, indirect, absolute or
contingent indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of Sublessee to
Sublessor (referred to as "the Obligations" herein) including, but not limited
to, the payment of all rent and other sums and the performance of all other
obligations of Sublessee under this Sublease, all renewals and extensions
thereof, the price of goods, services and merchandise purchased by Sublessees
from Sublessor from time to time, and all costs of collection, legal expenses
and attorneys' fees paid or incurred by Sublessor in enforcing any rights in
respect to the Obligations or in connection with assembling, collecting,
selling or otherwise dealing with or realizing upon the Collateral.

           5.2   Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and without
limiting the force or effect of any other covenants, representations and
warranties of Sublessee contained in this Sublease, Sublessee hereby covenant,
represent and warrant to and with Sublessor as follows:

                (a)   Sublessees are the owners of the Collateral free and
clear of liens, security interests and encumbrances of every kind and
description, except liens, security interests and encumbrances securing
indebtedness to Sublessor and liens described on Exhibit "X," hereto to which
Secured Party has consented ("Permitted Liens").

                (b)   Sublessees will not sell, dispose of, encumber or
permit any other security interest, lien or encumbrance, other than security
interests, liens or encumbrances junior to Sublessor's security interest to
attach to the Collateral except the security interest of Sublessor and the
Permitted Liens.

                (c)   All tangible Collateral shall be kept at Sublessee's
place(s) of business located on the premises, and Sublessee shall not permit
the same to be removed therefrom without the prior written consent of
Sublessor, except sales in the ordinary course of grocery business.

                (d)   Sublessee shall keep the tangible Collateral at all
times insured against risks of loss or damage by fire (including so-called
extended coverage), theft and such other casualties as Sublessor may
reasonably require, all in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon
such terms, for such periods and written by such companies or underwriters as
Sublessor may approve.  All such policies of insurance shall name Sublessor as
loss payee thereon as its interest may appear and shall provide for at least
30 days' prior written notice of modification or cancellation to Sublessor. 
Sublessee shall furnish Sublessor with certificates of such insurance or other
evidence satisfactory to Sublessor as to compliance with the provisions of
this paragraph.  Sublessor may act as attorney-in-fact for Sublessee in
making, adjusting and settling claims under and canceling such insurance and
endorsing Sublessee's name on any drafts drawn by insurers of the Collateral.

                (e)   Sublessee will keep the Collateral in good order and
repair. shall not waste or destroy the Collateral or any part thereof, and

reasonable time or times, wherever located.

assessments upon the Collateral or for its use or operation or upon this
Sublease or upon any instruments evidencing the Obligations.

          (g)   Sublessee will pay promptly when due all indebtedness secured
by any lien or other security interest in the Collateral, whether superior or
junior to the security interest established hereby.

          5.3   Additional Remedies.  Upon any default hereunder and at any
time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), Sublessor at
its option may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable and shall
have the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of
California (the "Code"), including without limitation the right to take
immediate and exclusive possession of the Collateral.

          5.4   Financing Statements.  Sublessees will at their own cost and
expense, upon demand, furnish to Sublessor such financing statements and other
documents in form satisfactory to Sublessor and will do all such acts and
things as Sublessor may at any time or from time to time request or as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain a perfected security
interest in the Collateral.

          5.5   Attorneys' Fees.  In the event of the institution of any suit
or action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, Sublessees shall and do hereby agree to pay, in addition to the costs
and disbursements provided by statute, reasonable attorneys' fees in such
proceedings or on any appeal from any judgment or decree entered therein.

          (6)   Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:

          6.1   Any failure by Sublessee to pay, when due, rent or any other
amount due under the Lease or to perform any other obligation of Sublessor
under the Lease or any other default under the Lease which continues for up to
one-half of the cure period as defined in the Lease, provided with respect
thereto in the Lease;

          6.2    Any failure by Sublessee to pay when due rent or any other
amount due under this Sublease or to perform when due any other obligation of
Sublessee hereunder;

          6.3   If any warranty, representation or statement made or
furnished to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee is false in any
material respect when made or furnished;
          6.4   Any failure by Sublessee to pay when due and/or satisfy any
other present or hereinafter incurred indebtedness or obligation of Sublessee
to Sublessor, including but not limited to those arising from Sublessee's
purchases of goods and services from Sublessor any other loans or leases
Sublessees may have or enter into with Sublessor, and Sublessees' obligations
under the Bylaws of Sublessor and its application for membership in Sublessor;

          6.5   If Sublessee vacates or abandon the premises or allow the
premises to remain vacant or unoccupied;

or insolvent, or a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for all or
part of Sublessee's assets, or a petition or answer is filed by or against

course of the business of the grocery store.

          6.8   Provided, that Sublessee shall not be in default pursuant to
paragraph 6.2 or 6.4 unless and until Sublessor has given written notice of
the exact nature of Sublessee's breech and Sublessee thereafter fails to cure
said breach within a ten (10) day period, as long as Sublessee commences to
cure said breech within said ten (10) day period and thereafter diligently
prosecutes said cure to completion.  Further provided that if the terms of
default of the main lease are in conflict with this provision, and Sublessee
has not cured under those terms, Sublessor may declare this sublease in
default and exercise such remedies as defined by this Sublease.

          (7)   Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:

          7.1   Sublessor shall have the right, at its election then or at
any time thereafter, upon notice to Sublessee, to terminate this Sublease or
to terminate Sublessee's rights of possession in the premises without
terminating this Sublease;

          7.2   Sublessor shall have the immediate right, whether or not the
Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1, to re-enter and
repossess the premises or any part thereof by force, summary proceedings,
ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, all without any liability
on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;

          7.3   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to), whether
or not this Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1,
resublet the premises, or any part thereof, in the name of Sublessee,
Sublessor or otherwise, without notice to Sublessee, for such term or terms
and for such uses as Sublessor, in its absolute discretion, may determine and
may collect and receive rents payable by reason of such resubletting (without
any liability for any failure to collect such rents);

          7.4   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until repaid; and

          7.5   Sublessor may exercise any and all other rights and remedies
afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have as provided herein, pursuant to
the laws of the State of California.  In addition to the other remedies
provided above, Sublessor shall be entitled to current damages and final
damages as provided in paragraph (8) below, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or
threatened violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a
decree compelling performance of this Sublease.

          7.6   No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession
of the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any
part thereof, whether pursuant to the above paragraph or by operation of law
or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessees of their liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or resubletting.

          (8)   Damages.

          8.1   Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, Sublessee will pay
to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessee for the
period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and, thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether or
not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessees
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessee in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any, of any
resubletting effected for the account of Sublessee, after deducting from such
proceeds all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
such resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession costs,
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, employee expenses,
alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting). 
Sublessee will pay such current damages on the days on which rent would have
been payable under this Sublease in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the
same from Sublessees on each such day.

          8.2   Final Damages.  At any time after any such expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to paragraph 8.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessees, and Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessees' default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of such
demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely difficult
to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the
rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease from the date
of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which Sublessee shall have
satisfied in full their obligations under paragraph 8.1 to pay current
damages) for what would be the then unexpired term in the absence of such
expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value at an
assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, over (b) the then net
rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an assumed
interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum for the same period.  Rental
value shall be established by reference to the terms and conditions upon which
Sublessor resublets the premises if such resubletting is accomplished within a
reasonable period of time after such expiration, termination or repossession,
and otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's estimates and
assumptions of fact regarding market and other relevant circumstances, which
shall govern unless shown to be erroneous.  If any statute or rule of law
shall validly limit the amount of such liquidated final damages to less than
the amount above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be entitled to the maximum
amount allowable under such statute or rule of law.

          (9)   Rights Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of
Sublessor to insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or
agreement or to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this
Sublease shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the
future.  No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be
deemed to have been made whether due in the receipt of rent or otherwise,
unless expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.

          (10)  Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be
given under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when,
and only when, the same is in writing and has been deposited in the United
States Mail, with postage prepaid, to be forwarded by registered or certified
mail and addressed to the party to be notified at the address appearing below
its signature.  Such addresses may be changed from time to time by serving of
notice as above provided.

          (11)  Right of Refusal:  If, during the term of this sublease, or
any extension hereof, Sublessee or any successor to Sublessee shall receive a
bona fide offer to purchase the business being operated under this sublease,
i.e., goodwill, fixtures and/or equipment and inventory or the property of
which the premises are a part, which offer is acceptable to Sublessee,
Sublessor shall have the right to purchase the business (or the property) upon
the same terms and conditions.  Sublessee agrees to immediately, upon receipt
of such offer, to give Sublessor written notice of the terms and conditions
thereof, and the Sublessor shall have the right, for thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice, to exercise its option to purchase under the identical
terms and conditions of such offer.  Sublessor's exercise of its option shall
be given in writing, within said thirty-day period.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed the foregoing
Sublease Agreement the day and year first above written.

_____________, 1994, by and between UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon
corporation, hereinafter designated as Sublessor, and David D. and Marilyn K.
Neal and Matthew L. Marcott and Pamela Marcott Garcia and Marcott Holdings,

corporation, for a supermarket located in Silverton, Oregon (more particularly
described in exhibit "A" attached to said lease), commencing on the date set
forth in the attached Exhibit "A," a copy of which is hereby incorporated by
reference, as fully as if its terms and conditions were herein set forth.
          WHEREAS, Sublessees desire to sublet said premises for a period of
20 years, commencing on date set forth in paragraph 3 of Exhibit "A," and
Sublessor is willing to so sublet in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth; now, therefore,
          IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:
          (1)   Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessees those premises
described in said Exhibit "A," for the term of 20 years.
                1.1   The Sublessees, so long as they are not in default
hereunder and further provided that no event or condition exists that, with
the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute default, shall be
granted the right to exercise the renewal options contained in Exhibit "A," as
set forth in paragraph 5 of said Exhibit.
          (2)   Sublessees covenant and agree to pay for the whole of said
term the rental hereinafter provided, together with all affirmative covenants
including, without limitation, those pertaining to minimum rent, Common Area
Charges (CAM), percentage of gross sales, taxes, assessments, insurance and
all of the covenants and obligations to be performed by Lessee, as set forth
in said Exhibit "A," and to make such payments and provide such performance
when due by the terms of the lease and amendments thereto.
          (3)   Sublessees shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all
rental or security deposits and all other sums except minimum rent, as
required pursuant to the terms and conditions of said Exhibits "A", and shall
pay rent to Sublessor, in accordance with the "Sublease Rent Schedule"
attached hereto.  All such rental payments to Sublessor shall be made without
offset, adjustment or deduction of any kind.
          (4)   Sublessees shall be bound by the same responsibilities,
rights, privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in Exhibit "A" and
covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any
and all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of
said Exhibit "A," and/or Sublessees' occupancy of the premises.  Furthermore,
Sublessees shall be bound by any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement or
addition to the prime lease between Sublessor and the prime Lessor, and to
keep the Sublessor indemnified against all actions, claims and demands
whatsoever in respect to said exhibit "A," and Sublessees use of the demised
premises.
          4.1   Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessees acknowledge that
provisions for extension options and assignment and subletting in the Lease
are applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor only.  Sublessees will not
assign this Sublease or sublet the premises without the prior written consent
of Sublessor which may be granted or withheld in its absolute discretion. A
direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a majority of the
voting stock of a corporate Sublessees, by whatever demands, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purposes of this paragraph.
          4.2   Covenants, Representations and Warranties.
                (a)   Membership in United Grocers, Inc.  Upon execution and
during the term hereof, Sublessees agree to maintain or cause to be maintained
the membership of the store in good standing in United Grocers, in accordance
with the Bylaws of United Grocers, as long as this Sublease remains in effect.
                (b)   Purchases from Sublessor.  Sublessees agree that
throughout the term of the Sublease and any extensions or renewals thereof,
except as hereinafter provided, Sublessees will purchase from Sublessor not
less than fifty-eight percent (58%) of its retail sales of all goods and
merchandise required by it for resale on the premises to the extent that
Sublessor shall now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and merchandise
to the Sublessees, and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessees' requirements
at such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered
by Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor carrying on businesses similar
to that of the Sublessees in the Silverton or Salem areas of the state of
Oregon.  If, at any time, the Sublessees contend that Sublessor is not able to
supply particular goods or merchandise customarily stocked by retail
supermarkets in the Salem - Silverton area, or that terms offered by Sublessor
are not reasonably comparable to those offered by Sublessor to other
purchasers described above, the Sublessees shall so advise Sublessor in
writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days
after receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not advise Sublessees that the terms and
conditions offered are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other
purchasers, Sublessees shall be free to secure such specified goods and
merchandise from any source which it desires.  If Sublessor demonstrates that
it is offering reasonably comparable terms, and Sublessees nonetheless
purchase from another source, such purchase or purchases shall not be an
exception from the 58% requirement specified above.  If the above percentage
requirements are not complied with, it shall constitute a default hereunder. 
In the event of a breach of this purchase covenant, Sublessor may terminate
this sublease and, in addition to the remedies hereinafter offered Sublessor,
Sublessee agrees to pay Sublessor, as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty
or forfeiture, a sum computed as follows:
                      1.  The average weekly purchases from the date of the
          agreement to the date of the breach shall be determined;
                      2.  the average weekly purchases so determined shall
          then be multiplied by the number of weeks from the date of the
          breach to the end of the term of the purchase agreement; and
                      3.  The computed sum shall be multiplied by two and
          one-quarter percent (2-1/4%) to determine the liquidated damages
          due and owing Sublessor by reason of Sublessee's default.  Said sum
          shall become immediately due and owing within 15 days from date of
          written notice of the liquidated damages.
                (c)  Sublessees covenant that as long as this Sublease
remains in effect, and for an additional period of six (6) months thereafter,
Sublessees shall not directly or indirectly sell or permit the sale of the
store and the owners of Sublessees shall not directly or indirectly sell
controlling interests in Sublessees (whether in one or a series of related
transactions) without first offering to sell said store or controlling
interest, as the case may be, to Sublessor upon the same terms and conditions
as the Sublessees or their owners, as the case may be, are prepared to accept
from a third party.  Prior to such sale by the Sublessees or their owners, the
Sublessees shall first notify Sublessor of the desire to sell the store or
controlling interest in the Sublessees and of all the terms and conditions of
such sale and shall provide to Sublessor all documents, instruments,
agreements, offers, acceptances, appraisals, inventories, equipment lists,
leases, financial statements and such other material and information as
Sublessor may reasonably request to aid in its decision to exercise or decline
its right to purchase as hereinafter provided.  Within 30 days following
receipt of such notice of desire to sell and all materials and information
reasonably requested by Sublessor, Sublessor shall advise Sublessees whether
Sublessor elects to purchase or declines to purchase the store or such
controlling interest upon the offered terms and conditions.  If Sublessor
shall elect to purchase, Sublessor shall purchase and the Sublessees or their
owners shall sell, such retain grocery business or such controlling interest,
as the case may be, all on the terms set forth in the offer.  If Sublessor
declines the purchase, the Sublessees or their owners shall be free to sell
the store or controlling interest, as the case may be, upon (and only upon)
the terms and conditions offered as aforesaid to Sublessor; provided that such
sale is consummated within 120 days following the date Sublessor declined the
purchase, and if such sale is not consummated in accordance with the offered
terms and conditions within said 120-day period, the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply again and no subsequent sale of any portion of the
offered store or controlling interest may be effected without again offering
the same to Sublessor as provided herein.  Sublessor may waive its rights
under this section provided such waiver is in writing.  The foregoing
provisions shall not apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift
or as a result of death to the lawful issue of Sublessees, or transfers of
assets to a corporation or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest
to a trust as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by
the transferor; provided such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or
controlling interest subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph.
                (d)  Sublessees represent and warrant that there are no
brokers, finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation in connection with this Sublease, and agree to hold Sublessor
harmless from any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.
                (e)  Sublessees hereby represent and warrant to Sublessor
that the financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to
Sublessor in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements
fairly and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.
          (5)   Security Agreement.
                5.1   Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessees and
Sublessor agree that this Sublease shall constitute a security agreement

property of Sublessees used or useful in the operation of the store in or on
the premises, whether now owned or hereafter acquired including, without
limitation, the property described in Exhibit "Y", attached hereto, if any;
and
                      (d)   all replacements of substitutions for, and
additions to the foregoing, and the proceeds thereof (all of said personal
property and the replacements, substitutions and additions thereto and the
proceeds thereof being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Collateral"), and that a security interest in and to the Collateral is hereby
granted to the Sublessor, and the Collateral and all of the Sublessees' right,
title and interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all to secure
all presently existing or hereafter incurred direct, indirect, absolute or
contingent indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of Sublessees to
Sublessor (referred to as "the Obligations" herein) including, but not limited
to, the payment of all rent and other sums and the performance of all other
obligations of Sublessees under this Sublease, all renewals and extensions
thereof, the price of goods, services and merchandise purchased by Sublessees
from Sublessor from time to time, and all costs of collection, legal expenses
and attorneys' fees paid or incurred by Sublessor in enforcing any rights in
respect to the Obligations or in connection with assembling, collecting,
selling or otherwise dealing with or realizing upon the Collateral.
                5.2   Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and
without limiting the force or effect of any other covenants, representations
and warranties of Sublessees contained in this Sublease, Sublessees hereby
covenant, represent and warrant to and with Sublessor as follows:

extended coverage), theft and such other casualties as Sublessor may
reasonably require, all in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon
such terms, for such periods and written by such companies or underwriters as

other evidence satisfactory to Sublessor as to compliance with the provisions

                7.1   Sublessor shall have the right, at its election then or
at any time thereafter, upon notice to Sublessees, to terminate this Sublease
or to terminate Sublessees' rights of possession in the premises without
terminating this Sublease;
                7.2   Sublessor shall have the immediate right, whether or
not the Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1, to re-

proceedings, ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, all without
any liability on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;
                7.3   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to),
whether or not this Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph

and for such uses as Sublessor, in its absolute discretion, may determine and
may collect and receive rents payable by reason of such resubletting (without
any liability for any failure to collect such rents);
                7.4   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to)

to the laws of the State of Oregon.  In addition to the other remedies
provided above, Sublessor shall be entitled to current damages and final
damages as provided in paragraph (8) below, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or
threatened violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a
decree compelling performance of this Sublease.
                7.6   No expiration or termination of this Sublease,
repossession of the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the
premises or any part thereof, whether pursuant to the above paragraph or by
operation of law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessees of their liabilities
and obligations under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such
expiration, termination, repossession or resubletting.
          (8)   Damages.
                8.1   Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessees for
the period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and, thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether or
not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessees
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessees in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any, of any
resubletting effected for the account of Sublessees, after deducting from such
proceeds all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
such resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession costs,
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, employee expenses,
alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting). 
Sublessees will pay such current damages on the days on which rent would have
been payable under this Sublease in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the
same from Sublessees on each such day.
                8.2   Final Damages.  At any time after any such expiration
or termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to paragraph 8.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessees, and Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessees' default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of such
demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely difficult
to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the
rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease from the date
of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which Sublessees shall have
satisfied in full their obligations under paragraph 8.1 to pay current
damages) for what would be the then unexpired term in the absence of such
expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value at an
assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, over (b) the then net
rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an assumed
interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum for the same period.  Rental
value shall be established by reference to the terms and conditions upon which
Sublessor resublets the premises if such resubletting is accomplished within a
reasonable period of time after such expiration, termination or repossession,
and otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's estimates and
assumptions of fact regarding market and other relevant circumstances, which
shall govern unless shown to be erroneous.  If any statute or rule of law
shall validly limit the amount of such liquidated final damages to less than
the amount above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be entitled to the maximum
amount allowable under such statute or rule of law.
          (9)   Rights Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of
Sublessor to insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or
agreement or to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this
Sublease shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the
future.  No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be
deemed to have been made whether due in the receipt of rent or otherwise,
unless expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.
          (10)  Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be
given under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when,
and only when, the same is in writing and has been deposited in the United
States Mail, with postage prepaid, to be forwarded by registered or certified
mail and addressed to the party to be notified at the address appearing below
its signature.  Such addresses may be changed from time to time by serving of
notice as above provided.
          (11)  Right of Refusal:  If, during the term of this sublease, or
any extension hereof, Sublessee or any successor to Sublessee shall receive a
bona fide offer to purchase the business being operated under this sublease,
i. e., goodwill, fixtures and/or equipment and inventory or the property of
which the premises are a part, which offer is acceptable to Sublessee,
Sublessor shall have the right to purchase the business (or the property) upon
the same terms and conditions.  Sublessee agrees to immediately, upon receipt
of such offer, to give Sublessor written notice of the terms and conditions
thereof, and the Sublessor shall have the right, for thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice, to exercise its option to purchase under the identical
terms and conditions of such offer.  Sublessor's exercise of its option shall
be given in writing, within said thirty-day period.
          (12)  Additional Provisions.

DEFAULT PROVISIONS:
- ------------------

          Time is of the essence of this contract.  A default shall occur if:

Purchaser has received 10 days' written notice of the delinquency;
          b)    Purchaser fails to perform any other obligation imposed by

          c)    Purchaser becomes insolvent, a receiver is appointed to take

makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or files a voluntary petition
in bankruptcy, or Purchaser is the subject of an involuntary petition in
bankruptcy which is not dismissed within 90 days.  If Purchaser consists of
more than one person or entity, the occurrence of any of these events as to
any one such person or entity shall constitute a default hereunder;
          d)    Notice shall be directed to Purchaser to Post Office
Box 1103, Corvallis, OR 97330.
          In the event of a default, Seller may take any one or more of the

Purchaser fail to so surrender the property, Seller may at his option treat
Purchaser as tenant holding over unlawfully after the expiration of a lease
and Purchaser may be ousted and removed as such.
          The remedies provided above shall be nonexclusive and in addition
to any other remedies provided by law.
RECEIVER:
- --------

          Seller shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver as a
matter of right whether or not the apparent value of the property exceeds the
amount of the balance due hereunder, and any receiver appointed may serve

as receiver.  Upon taking possession of all or any part of the property the

property and make expenditures for all maintenance and improvements as in its
judgment are proper;

expenses, the receiver may borrow, from Seller or otherwise, such sums as it
deems necessary for the purposes stated in this paragraph, and repayment of
such sums shall be secured by this contract.  The amounts borrowed or advanced
shall bear interest at same rate as the balance of the purchase price
hereunder from the date of expenditure until repaid and shall be payable by
Purchaser on demand.

by Seller or by any agent of Seller and that Purchaser takes said property and
the improvements thereon in the condition existing at the time of this
agreement.
WAIVER:
- ------

          Failure by Seller at any time to require performance by Purchaser
of any of the provisions hereof shall in no way affect Seller's rights
hereunder to enforce the same, nor shall any waiver by Seller of any breach
hereof be held to be a waiver of any succeeding breach, or a waiver of this
nonwaiver clause.
ASSIGNMENT:
- ----------

          Purchaser shall not assign this agreement, his rights hereunder or
in the property covered hereby without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent Seller shall not unreasonably withhold.

provisions, this document is the entire, final and complete agreement of the
parties pertaining to the sale and purchase of the property, and supersedes

    (1)   Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessees those premises described
in said Exhibit "A," for the term of 20 years.

          1.1   The Sublessees, so long as they are not in default hereunder,
shall be granted the right to exercise the renewal options contained in
Exhibit "A," as set forth in paragraphs 3 and 7 of said Exhibit, upon the
condition that Sublessees are not in default and provide Sublessor with lease
guaranty insurance for the renewal term.  Said insurance shall be in form and
substance acceptable to Sublessor and shall designate Sublessor as the insured
thereunder.

    (2)   Sublessees covenant and agree to pay for the whole of said term the
same rental, together with all affirmative covenants including, without
limitation, those pertaining to basic rent, percentage of gross sales, taxes,
assessments, insurance and all of the covenants and obligations to be
performed by Sublessees, as set forth in said Exhibit "A," and to make such
payments and provide such performance when due by the terms of the lease and
amendments thereto.

    (3)   Sublessees shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all rental, or
security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and conditions of said
Exhibit "A."

    (4)   Sublessees shall be bound by the same responsibilities, rights,

covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any
and all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sublessee's desire to transfer by sale,
gift, or as a result of death, its interest herein to its lawful issue, the
Sublessor shall not unreasonably withhold consent to such a transfer,
provided, such transferee agrees that it holds such interest subject to the
restrictions and conditions contained in this sublease agreement.

    4.2   Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

          (a)   Membership in United Grocers, Inc.  Upon execution and during
the term hereof, Sublessees agree to maintain or cause to be maintained the
membership of the store in good standing in United Grocers, in accordance with
the Bylaws of United Grocers, as long as this Sublease remains in effect.

          (b)   Purchases from Sublessor.  Sublessees agree that throughout
the term of the Sublease and any extensions or renewals thereof, except as
hereinafter provided, Sublessees will purchase from Sublessor not less than
fifty-five percent (55%), based on a quarterly basis, of its retail sales of
all goods and merchandise required by it for resale on the premises to the
extent that Sublessor shall now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and
merchandise to the Sublessees, and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessees'
requirements at such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to
those offered by Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor carrying on
businesses similar to that of the Sublessees in Oroville, California.  If, at
any time, the Sublessees contend that Sublessor is not able to supply
particular goods or merchandise customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in
the Oroville, California area, or that terms offered by Sublessor are not
reasonably comparable to those offered by Sublessor to other purchasers
described above, the Sublessees shall so advise Sublessor in writing,
specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days after
receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not advise Sublessees that the terms and
conditions offered are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other
purchasers, Sublessees shall be free to secure such specified goods and
merchandise from any source which it desires.  If Sublessor demonstrates that
it is offering reasonably comparable terms, and Sublessees nonetheless
purchase from another source, such purchase or purchases shall not be an
exception from the 55% requirement specified above.  If the above percentage
requirements are not complied with, it shall constitute a default hereunder. 
In the event of a breach of this purchase covenant, Sublessor may terminate
this sublease and, in addition to the remedies hereinafter offered Sublessor,
Sublessee agrees to pay Sublessor, as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty
or forfeiture, a sum computed as follows:

                1.    The average weekly purchases from the date of the
    agreement to the date of the breach shall be determined;

                2.    the average weekly purchases so determined shall then
    be multiplied by the number of weeks from the date of the breach to the
    end of the term of the purchase agreement; and determine the liquidated
    damages due and owing Sublessor by reason of Sublessee's default.  Said
    sum shall become immediately due and owing within 15 days from date of
    written notice of the liquidated damages.

          (c)   Sublessees covenant that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, and for an additional period of six (6) months thereafter, Sublessees
shall not directly or indirectly sell or permit the sale of the store and the
owners of Sublessees shall not directly or indirectly sell controlling
interests in Sublessees (whether in one or a series of related transactions)
without first offering to sell said store or controlling interest, as the case
may be, to Sublessor upon the same terms and conditions as the Sublessees or
their owners, as the case may be, are prepared to accept from a third party. 
Prior to such sale by the Sublessees or their owners, the Sublessees shall
first notify Sublessor of the desire to sell the store or controlling interest
in the Sublessees and of all the terms and conditions of such sale and shall
provide to Sublessor all documents, instruments, agreements, offers,
acceptances, appraisals, inventories, equipment lists, leases, financial
statements and such other material and information as Sublessor may reasonably
request to aid in its decision to exercise or decline its right to purchase as
hereinafter provided.  Within 30 days following receipt of such notice of
desire to sell and all materials and information reasonably requested by
Sublessor, Sublessor shall advise Sublessees whether Sublessor elects to
purchase or declines to purchase the store or such controlling interest upon
the offered terms and conditions.  If Sublessor shall elect to purchase,
Sublessor shall purchase and the Sublessees or their owners shall sell, such
retail grocery business or such controlling interest, as the case may be, all
on the terms set forth in the offer.  If Sublessor declines the purchase, the
Sublessees or their owners shall be free to sell the store or controlling
interest, as the case may be, upon (and only upon) the terms and conditions
offered as aforesaid to Sublessor; provided that such sale is consummated
within 120 days following the date Sublessor declined the purchase, and if
such sale is not consummated in accordance with the offered terms and
conditions within said 120-day period, the provisions of this paragraph shall
apply again and no subsequent sale of any portion of the offered store or
controlling interest may be effected without again offering the same to
Sublessor as provided herein.  Sublessor may waive its rights under this
section provided such waiver is in writing.  The foregoing provisions shall
not apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of Sublessees, or transfers of assets to a
corporation or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest to a trust
as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor; provided such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or
controlling interest subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph.

          (d)   Sublessees represent and warrant that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agree to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.

          (e)   Sublessees hereby represent and warrant to Sublessor that the
financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to Sublessor in
connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true, correct,
complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements fairly
and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.

    (5)   Security Agreement.

          5.1   Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessees and Sublessor
agree that this Sublease shall constitute a security agreement within the
meaning of the California Uniform Commercial Code (hereinafter referred to as
the "Code") with respect to:

                (a) required cash deposits (as defined in the Bylaws of
Sublessor) presently or hereafter held by or deposited with Sublessor by
Sublessees;

                (b) any and all patronage rebates and rebate notes 
representing patronage rebates (as defined in the Bylaws of Sublessor) earned
or hereafter earned by reason of patronage of Sublessor by Sublessees;

                (c) subject to liens securing purchase money financing
therefor as described in Exhibit "X," all trade, store and other fixtures and
all leasehold improvements and all equipment and other personal property of
Sublessees used or useful in the operation of the store in or on the premises,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired including, without limitation, the
property described in Exhibit "Y', attached hereto, if any; and

                (d) all replacements of substitutions for, and additions to
the foregoing, and the proceeds thereof (all of said personal property and the
replacements, substitutions and additions thereto and the proceeds thereof
being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Collateral"), and
that a security interest in and to the Collateral is hereby granted to the
Sublessor, and the Collateral and all of the Sublessees' right title and
interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all to secure all
presently existing or hereafter incurred direct indirect, absolute or
contingent indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of Sublessees to
Sublessor (referred to as "the Obligations" herein) including, but not limited
to, the payment of all rent and other sums and the performance of all other
obligations of Sublessees under this Sublease, all renewals and extensions
thereof, the price of goods, services and merchandise purchased by Sublessees
from Sublessor from time to time, and all costs of collection, legal expenses
and attorneys' fees paid or incurred by Sublessor in enforcing any rights in
respect to the Obligations or in connection with assembling, collecting,
selling or otherwise dealing with or realizing upon the Collateral.

          5.2   Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and without
limiting the force or effect of any other covenants, representations and
warranties of Sublessees contained in this Sublease, Sublessees hereby
covenant, represent and warrant to and with Sublessor as follows:

                (a) Sublessees are the owners of the Collateral free and
clear of liens, security interests and encumbrances of every kind and
description, except liens, security interests and encumbrances securing
indebtedness to Sublessor and liens described on Exhibit "X," hereto to which
Secured Party has consented ("Permitted Liens").

                (b) Sublessees will not sell, dispose of, encumber or permit
any other security interest, lien or encumbrance to attach to the Collateral
except the security interest of Sublessor and the Permitted Liens, for the
notes or any note extensions.

                (c) Sublessor warrants that Sublessor is the legal Lessee of
the property and that the sublease is allowed pursuant to the terms of
Sublessor's primary lease; and,

                (d) Sublessor warrants and agrees to hold Sublessees harmless
as to any and all liabilities that Sublessor may owe to the owner of the
leased premises.  Not withstanding the foregoing, in the event the sublessee's
are liable under the master lease, this will not apply.

                (e) All tangible Collateral shall be kept at Sublessees'
place(s) of business located on the premises, and Sublessees shall not permit
the same to be removed therefrom without the prior written consent of
Sublessor.

                (f) Sublessees shall keep the tangible Collateral at all
times insured against risks of loss or damage by fire (including so-called
extended coverage), theft and such other casualties as Sublessor may
reasonably require, all in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon
such terms, for such periods and written by such companies or underwriters as
Sublessor may approve.  All such policies of insurance shall name Sublessor as
loss payee thereon as its interest may appear and shall provide for at least
30 days' prior written notice of modification or cancellation to Sublessor. 
Sublessees shall furnish Sublessor with certificates of such insurance or
other evidence satisfactory to Sublessor as to compliance with the provisions
of this paragraph.  Sublessor may act as attorney-in-fact for Sublessees in
making, adjusting, and settling claims under and canceling such insurance and
endorsing Sublessees' name on any drafts drawn by insurers of the Collateral.

                (g) Sublessees will keep the Collateral in good order and
repair, shall not waste or destroy the Collateral or any part thereof, and
shall not use the Collateral in violation of any statute, ordinance or policy
of insurance thereon.  Sublessor may examine and inspect the Collateral at any
reasonable time or times, wherever located.

                (h) Sublessees will pay promptly when due all taxes and
assessments upon the Collateral or for its use or operation or upon this
Sublease or upon any instruments evidencing the Obligations.

                (i) Sublessees will pay promptly when due all indebtedness
secured by any lien or other security interest in the Collateral, whether
superior or junior to the security interest established hereby.

          5.3   Additional Remedies.  Upon any default hereunder and at any
time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), Sublessor at
its option may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable and shall
have the remedies within 10 days of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code of California (the "Code"), including without limitation the
right to take immediate and exclusive possession of the Collateral.

          5.4   Financing Statements.  Sublessees will at their own cost and
expense, upon demand, furnish to Sublessor such financing statements and other
documents in form satisfactory to Sublessor and will do all such acts and
things as Sublessor may at any time or from time to time request or as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain a perfected security
interest in the existing and replacement Collateral.

          5.5   Attorneys' Fees.  In the event of the institution of any suit
or action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, the prevailing party hereby agrees to pay, in addition to the costs
and disbursements provided by statute, reasonable attorneys' fees in such
proceedings or on any appeal from any judgment or decree entered therein.

    (6) Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:

          6.1  Any failure by Sublessees to pay, when due, rent or  any other
amount due under the Lease or to perform any other obligation of Sublessor
under the Lease or any other default under  the Lease which continues for up
to one-half of the cure period as  defined in the lease, provided with respect
thereto in the Lease;

          6.2   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due rent or any other
amount due under this Sublease or to perform when due any other obligation of
Sublessees hereunder;

          6.3   If any warranty, representation or statement made or
furnished to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessees is false in any
material respect when made or furnished;

          6.4   Any failure by Sublessees to pay when due and/or satisfy any
other present or hereinafter incurred indebtedness or obligation of Sublessees
to Sublessor, including but not limited to those arising from Sublessees'
purchases of goods and services from Sublessor any other loans or leases
Sublessees may have or enter into with Sublessor, and Sublessees' obligations
under the Bylaws of Sublessor and its application for membership in Sublessor;

          6.5   If Sublessees vacate or abandon the premises or allow the
premises to remain vacant or unoccupied;

          6.6   If Sublessees make an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or if, with or without Sublessees' acquiescence, a petition in
bankruptcy is filed against Sublessees, or Sublessees are adjudicated a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for
all or part of Sublessees' assets, or a petition or answer is filed by or
against Sublessees seeking or acquiescing in any reorganization, liquidation
or similar relief under any federal, state or local law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors; and

          6.7   If Sublessees sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
substantial portion of the secured assets of Sublessees located at or
associated with the store, other than inventory sold at retail in the ordinary
course of business.

    (7) Remedies.  In the event of any uncured default under this Sublease:

          7.1  Sublessor shall have the right at its election then or at any
time thereafter, upon notice to Sublessees, to terminate this Sublease or to
terminate Sublessees' rights of possession in  the premises without
terminating this Sublease;

          7.2   Sublessor shall have the immediate right whether or not the
Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1, to re-enter and
repossess the premises or any part thereof by force, summary proceedings,
ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, all without any liability
on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;

          7.3   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to), whether
or not this Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7. 1,
resublet the premises, or any part thereof, in the name of Sublessees,
Sublessor or otherwise, without notice to Sublessees, for such term or terms
and for such uses as Sublessor, in its absolute discretion, may determine and
may collect and receive rents payable by reason of such resubletting (without
any liability for any failure to collect such rents);

          7.4   Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessees hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until repaid; and

          7.5   Sublessor may exercise any and all other rights and remedies
afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have as provided herein, pursuant to
the laws of the state of California.  In addition to the other remedies
provided above, Sublessor shall be entitled to current damages and final
damages as provided in paragraph (8) below, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or
threatened violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a
decree compelling performance of this Sublease.

          7.6   No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession
of the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any
part thereof, whether pursuant to the above paragraph or by operation of law
or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessees of their liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or resubletting.
    (8)   Damages.

          8.1   Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default Sublessees will pay
to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessees for the
period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and, thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether or
not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessees
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessees in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any, of any
resubletting effected for the account of Sublessees, after deducting from such
proceeds all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
such resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession costs,
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, employee expenses,
alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting). 
Sublessees will pay such current damages on the days on which rent would have
been payable under this Sublease in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the
same from Sublessees on each such day.

          8.2   Final Damages.  At any time after any such expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to paragraph 8.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessees, and Sublessees will
pay to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessees' default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of such
demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely difficult
to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the
rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease from the date
of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which Sublessees shall have
satisfied in full their obligations under paragraph 8.1 to pay current
damages) for what would be the then unexpired term in the absence of such
expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value at an
assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, over (b) the then net
rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an assumed
interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum for the same period.  Rental
value shall be established by reference to the terms and conditions upon which
Sublessor resublets the premises if such resubletting is accomplished within a
reasonable period of time after such expiration, termination or repossession,
and otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's estimates and
assumptions of fact regarding market and other relevant circumstances, which
shall govern unless shown to be erroneous.  If any statute or rule of law
shall validly limit the amount of such liquidated final damages to less than
the amount above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be entitled to the maximum
amount allowable under such statute or rule of law.

    (9)   Rights Cumulative. Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right power or remedy contained in this Sublease shall
not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future.  No
waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to have
been made whether due in the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless expressed in
writing and signed by Sublessor.

    (10)  Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be given
under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when, and only
when, the same is in writing and has been deposited in the United States Mail,
with postage prepaid, to be forwarded by registered or certified mail and
addressed to the party to be notified at the address appearing below its
signature.  Such addresses may be changed from time to time by serving of
notice as above provided.

    (11) Right of Refusal: If, during the term of this sublease, or any
extension hereof, Sublessee or any successor to Sublessee shall receive a bona
fide offer to purchase the business being operated under this sublease, or the
property of which the premises are a part, which offer is acceptable to
Sublessee, Sublessor shall have the right to purchase the business (or the
property) upon the same terms and conditions.  Sublessee agrees, immediately
upon receipt of such offer, to give Sublessor written notice of the terms and
conditions thereof, and the Sublessor shall have the right for thirty (30)
days after receipt of such notice, to exercise its option to purchase under
the identical terms and conditions of such offer.  Sublessor's exercise of its
option shall be given in writing, within said thirty-day period.

    (12)   Additional Provisions.

                None

                                                          Exhibit 10.K1

                              SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

    THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT is entered into this 1st day of February, 1994,
by and between UNITED RESOURCES, INC., an Oregon corporation ("Sublessor") and
R.A.F. LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, an Oregon limited liability company
("Sublessee").  
RECITALS:
    A.  Sublessor has entered into a Sublease for a term commencing October
15, 1991, and expiring August 1, 2011, with United Grocers, Inc. ("Lessor"),
for a supermarket located in the Heritage Plaza, Albany, Oregon, a copy of
which is attached hereto, marked as Exhibit "A," and by this reference
incorporated herein, as fully as if its terms and conditions were herein set
forth.  
    B.  Sublessee desires to sublet the premises commencing on February 2,
1994, and expiring August 1, 2011, and Sublessor is willing to sublease the
premises in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein.  
    NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:  
    1.  Sublease Terms and Options.  Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessee
those premises described in Exhibit "A," for the term remaining as described
therein.  
          1.1  Provided the Sublessee has performed all of its obligations to
be performed under this Sublease and is not in default thereunder, and further
provided the Sublessee (R.A.F.) has extended its duration by amending its
operating agreement to extend its duration beyond August 1, 2011, to a date
through the renewal term, and provided the Sublessor has exercised its option
to extend its Sublease, then in that event, the Sublessee may exercise the
renewal option contained in Exhibit A.  The rental rate during such renewal
term shall be in an amount equal to that determined under the master lease.
                In the event Sublessor exercises it option to renew, it shall
give Sublessee written notice of said exercise, within five days from the date
of exercise.
    2.  Rental.  Sublessee covenants and agrees to pay the rental for the
whole of the term, and to perform all affirmative covenants including, without
limitation, those pertaining to taxes, assessments, insurance, and all of the
covenants and obligations to be performed by Sublessor as Lessee, as set forth
in Exhibit "A," and to make such payments and provide such performance when
due by the terms of the Lease and any amendments thereto.  Basic rental will
be paid in accordance with the Schedule attached hereto, marked as Schedule
"A-1," and by this reference incorporated herein.  To the extent the basic
rent in Schedule "A-1" is less than the basic rental in the prime Lease,
Sublessor agrees to indemnify and hold Sublessee harmless from the obligation
to pay the same.  
    3.  Deposits.  Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all
rentals, or security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Exhibit "A," prorated as of February 2, 1994.
    4.  Indemnity and Hold Harmless.  Sublessee shall be bound by the same
responsibilities, rights, privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in
Exhibit "A" except as otherwise provided herein, and covenants and agrees to
fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any and all responsibility
and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of Exhibit "A," and/or
Sublessee's occupancy of the premises.  Furthermore, Sublessee shall be bound
by any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement, or addition to the prime
Lease between Sublessor and the prime Lessor with Sublessee's prior written
consent, and to keep the Sublessor indemnified against all actions, claims and
demands whatsoever in respect to said Exhibit "A," and Sublessee's use of the
demised premises.  
    5.  Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:  
          5.1  Any failure by Sublessee to pay the rent when due, or any
failure by Sublessee to perform any other obligation contained in this
Sublease, or to pay any other amount due under the Lease or to perform any
other obligation of Sublessor under the Lease when due which would constitute
a default under the Lease and which continues for the cure period provided
with respect thereto in the Lease;  
          5.2  If any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished
to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee is false in any material respect
when made or furnished;  
          5.3  If Sublessee makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, or Sublessee is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or a trustee,
receiver or liquidator is appointed for all or part of Sublessee's assets, or
a petition or answer is filed by or against Sublessee seeking or acquiescing
in any reorganization, liquidation or similar relief under any federal, state
or local law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors.  
    6.  Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:  
          6.1  Sublessor may exercise any and all rights and remedies
afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease, and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have pursuant to this Sublease and the
laws of the state of Oregon.  
          6.2  If a default occurs, this Sublease may be terminated at the
option of the Sublessor by written notice to the Sublessee.  The notice may be
given before, after or within the grace period for a default.  
          6.3  If the Sublease is terminated for any reason, Sublessee's
liability to Sublessor for damages shall survive such termination and
Sublessor may re-enter, take possession of the premises, and remove any
persons or property by legal action or by self-help with the use of reasonable
force.  
          6.4  Following re-entry or abandonment, Sublessor may: 
                (a)  make any suitable alterations or refurbish the premises,
or both, or change the character or use of the premises, but Sublessor shall
not be required to relet for any use or purpose (other than that specified in
the prime Lease) which the Sublessor may reasonably consider injurious to the
premises, or to any tenant which Sublessor may reasonably consider
objectionable;  
                (b)  relet all or part of the premises, alone or in
conjunction with other properties, for a term longer or shorter than the term
of this Sublease, upon any reasonable terms and conditions, including the
granting of some rent-free occupancy or other rent concession.  
          6.5  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the time of such payment until
repaid.  
          6.6  No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession of
the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any part
thereof, whether pursuant to the terms of this Sublease or any operation of
law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessee of its liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or subletting.  
    7.  Damages.  Whether or not an election is made to terminate the
Sublease, Sublessor shall be entitled to recover immediately without waiting
until the due date of any future rent, or until the date is fixed for
expiration of the Sublease term, the same amount of damages as set forth in
the prime Lease as though the Sublessor were the prime Lessor and the
Sublessee were the prime Lessee.  
    8.  Rights Cumulative; Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. 
No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to
have been made whether due to the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless
expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.  
    9.  Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessee acknowledges that except as
provided herein, the provisions for extension, options and assignment and
subletting in the prime Lease are applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor
only.  Sublessee will not assign this Sublease or sublet the premises without
the prior written consent of Sublessor which will not be unreasonably
withheld.  A direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a
majority of the voting stock of Sublessee, by whatever means, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purpose of this paragraph.  
    10.  Covenants, Representations and Warranties.  
          10.1  Sublessee agrees that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, should Sublessee ever desire to sell the store operated on the
premises, except for a sale unto Wright's Foodliner, Inc., it shall give
Sublessor the first opportunity to purchase the same at its fair market value;
provided, however, if Sublessor does not elect to purchase the store for its
fair market value as agreeable to Sublessee within 60 days after receipt of
written notice of Sublessee's intent to sell, Sublessee may thereafter sell
the store to anyone upon such terms and conditions as are acceptable to
Sublessee.  The foregoing provisions do not apply to transfers of assets or
interests by sale, gift or as a result of death to the lawful issue of the
owners of Sublessee, or transfers of assets to a corporation or partnership,
or transfers of a controlling interest to a trust, as long as such
corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the transferor and such
transferee agrees that it holds such assets or controlling interest subject to
the restrictions named in this section.  
          10.2  Sublessee agrees that throughout the term of this Sublease
and any extensions or renewals thereof, except as hereinafter provided, to
purchase from United Grocers, Inc., not less than 45 percent of its retail
sales of all goods and merchandise required by it for resale on the premises
to the extent that United Grocers, Inc., shall now or hereafter be able to
supply such goods and merchandise to Sublessee, and United Grocers, Inc. will
supply all of Sublessee's requirements at such prices and on such terms as are
reasonably comparable to those offered by United Grocers, Inc. to other
purchasers from United Grocers, Inc., carrying on businesses similar to that
of the Sublessee in Linn County, Oregon.  If, at any time, Sublessee contends
that United Grocers, Inc., is not able to supply particular goods or
merchandise customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in Linn County, Oregon,
or that terms offered by United Grocers, Inc., are not reasonably comparable
to those offered by United Grocers, Inc., to other such purchasers, the
Sublessee shall so advise United Grocers, Inc., in writing, specifying such
contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days after the receipt of such
notice, United Grocers, Inc., does not offer to supply goods or merchandise so
specified or does not advise Sublessee that the terms and conditions offered
are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other purchasers, Sublessee
shall be free to secure such specified goods and merchandise from any other
source it desires.  If United Grocers, Inc., asserts that it is offering
reasonably comparable terms and prices and Sublessee nonetheless purchases
from another source, such purchase shall be a default under this section.  
          10.3  Sublessee represents and warrants that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agrees to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.  
          10.4  Sublessee hereby represents and warrants to Sublessor that
the financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to
Sublessor in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements
fairly and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.  
          10.5  Sublessor represents and warrants that it has performed all
of the obligations which the Lessee is required to perform under the terms of
the Lease to which this Sublease pertains, as of the date of this Sublease,
and that the Lease is in full force and effect and not in default in any
respect.  Further, Sublessor represents that there is nothing as a result of
which the passage of time or the giving of notice would constitute a default
for actions which have already occurred prior to the date of this Sublease.  
    11.  Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the institution of any suit or
action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, the prevailing party shall recover and the losing party hereby agrees
to pay, in addition to the costs and disbursements provided by statute,
reasonable attorney's fees in such proceedings or on any appeal from any
judgment or decree entered herein.  
    12.  Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be given
under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when, and only
when, the same is in writing and either personally delivered or by mail if it
has been deposited in the United States mail, with postage prepaid, to be
forwarded by registered or certified mail and addressed to the party to be
notified at the address appearing below its signature.  Such addresses may be
changed from time to time by notice as above provided.  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed the foregoing Sublease the
day and year first herein written.

    NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

    1.    Sublease Terms and Options.  Sublessor hereby sublets unto
Sublessee those premises described in Exhibit "A", for the 10 year term

paragraphs 3 and 7 of said Exhibit.

    2.    Rental.  Sublessee covenants and agrees to pay for the whole of
said term the same rental, together with all affirmative covenants including,
without limitation, those pertaining to basic rent, percentage of gross sales,
taxes, assessments, insurance and all of the covenants and obligations to be
performed by Sublessee, as set forth in said Exhibit "A", and to make such
payments and provide such performance when due by the terms of the lease and
amendments thereto.

    3.    Deposits.  Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all
rentals, or security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and
conditions of said Exhibit "A".

    4.    Indemnity and Hold Harmless.  Sublessee shall be bound by the same
responsibilities, rights, privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in
Exhibit "A", and covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor
harmless from any and all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may
incur by virtue of said Exhibit "A", and/or Sublessee's occupancy of the

Sublease.

          5.1   Any failure by Sublessee to pay the rent when due or to pay

Sublessor under the Lease when due which would constitute a default under the
Lease and which continues for the cure period provided with respect thereto in
the Lease;

          5.2   If any warranty, representation or statement made or
furnished to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee is false in any
material respect when made or furnished;

          5.3   If Sublessee makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, or Sublessee is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or a trustee,
receiver or liquidator is appointed for all or part of Sublessee's assets, or

or local law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors.

    6.    Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:

          6.1   Sublessor may exercise any and all rights and remedies

other rights and remedies Sublessor may have pursuant to the laws of the State
of Oregon.

          6.2   If a default occurs, this Sublease may be terminated at the
option of the Sublessor by written notice to the Sublessee.  The notice may be
given before, after, or within the grace period for a default.

          6.3   If the Sublease is terminated for any reason, Sublessee's
liability to Sublessor for damages shall survive such termination, and
Sublessor may re-enter, take possession of the premises, and remove any
persons or property by legal action or by self-help with the use of reasonable
force.

          6.4   Following re-entry or abandonment, Sublessor may:

                (a)   make any suitable alterations or refurbish the
premises, or both, or change the character or use of the premises, but
Sublessor shall not be required to relet for any use or purpose (other than
that specified in the prime Lease) which the Sublessor may reasonably consider
injurious to the premises, or to any tenant which Sublessor may reasonably
consider objectionable;

                (b)   relet all or part of the premises, alone or in
conjunction with other properties, or a term longer or shorter than the term

granting of some rent-free occupancy or other rent concession.

any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until repaid.

          6.6   No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession
of the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any
part thereof, whether pursuant to the terms of this Sublease or any operation
of law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessee of its liabilities and
obligations under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration,
termination, repossession or resubletting.

    7.    Damages.  Whether or not an election is made to terminate the
Sublease, Sublessor shall be entitled to recover immediately without waiting
until the due date of any future rent, or until the date is fixed for
expiration of the Sublease term, the same amount of damages as set forth in
the prime Lease as though the Sublessor were the prime lessor and the
Sublessee were the prime lessee.

    8.    Rights Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease

the prior written consent of Sublessor which will not be unreasonable
withheld.  A direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a
majority of the voting stock of Sublessee, by whatever means, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purpose of this paragraph.

    10.   Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

          10.1  Sublessee agrees that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, should Sublessee ever desire to sell the store operated on the
premises, it shall give Sublessor the first opportunity to purchase the same

purchase the store for its fair market value as agreeable to Sublessee within
sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of Sublessee's intent to sell,
Sublessee may thereafter sell the store to anyone upon such terms and
conditions as are acceptable to Sublessee.  The foregoing provisions do not
apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of the owners of Sublessee or transfers of assets to
a corporation or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest to a
trust, as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor and such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or controlling
interest subject to the restrictions named in this section.

merchandise required by it for resale on the premises to the extent that

such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered by
Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor, carrying on businesses similar
to that of the Sublessee in Lane County, Oregon.  If, at any time, Sublessee
contends that Sublessor is not able to supply particular goods or merchandise
customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in Lane Country, Oregon, or that
terms offered by Sublessor are not reasonably comparable to those offered by
Sublessor to other such purchasers, the Sublessee shall so advise Sublessor in
writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days
after the receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not offer to supply goods or merchandise so
specified or does not advise Sublessee that the terms and conditions offered
are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other purchasers, Sublessee
shall be free to secure such specified goods and merchandise from any other
source which it desires.  If Sublessor asserts that it is offering reasonably
comparable terms and prices and Sublessee nonetheless purchases from another
source, such purchase shall be a default under this Section.

          10.3  Sublessee represents and warrants that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agrees to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.

          10.4  Sublease hereby represents and warrants to Sublessor that the
financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to Sublessor in

results of operations reflected herein.

action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, the prevailing party shall recover and the losing party hereby agrees

                              SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

    THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT is entered into this 27th day of October, 1991,
by and between UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon corporation (Sublessor) and
WRIGHT'S FOODLINER, INC., an Oregon corporation (Sublessee).  
RECITALS:

    A.  Sublessor has entered into a Lease for a 20-year term commencing 7-
15, 1987, with KIVCO, an Oregon partnership, for a supermarket located in the
Delta Oaks Shopping Center, City of Eugene, County of Lane, State of Oregon, a
copy of which is marked Exhibit A attached hereto and by this reference
incorporated herein, as fully as if its terms and conditions were herein set
forth.  

    B.  On July 17, 1987, KIVCO assigned its interest in the lease referred
to in Recital A to D.M. Stevenson Ranch, a Washington limited partnership. 

    C.  Sublessee desires to sublet the premises commencing on October 28,
1991, and Sublessor is willing to sublease the premises in accordance with the
terms and conditions contained herein.  

    NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:  

    1.  Sublease Terms and Options.  Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessee
those premises described in Exhibit A, for the term remaining as described
therein.  

          1.1  So long as it is not in default hereunder, the Sublessee may
exercise the renewal options contained in Exhibit A as set forth in paragraphs
3 and 7 of said Exhibit.  

    2.  Rental.  Sublessee covenants and agrees to pay the same rental for
the whole of the term, together with all affirmative covenants including,
without limitation, those pertaining to basic rent, percentage of gross sales,
taxes, assessments, insurance and all of the covenants and obligations to be
performed by Sublessor as lessee, as set forth in Exhibit A, and to make such
payments and provide such performance when due by the terms of the lease and
any amendments thereto.    

    3.  Deposits.  Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all
rentals, or security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Exhibit A, prorated as of October 28, 1991.

    4.  Indemnity and Hold Harmless.  Except as provided in paragraph 5,
Sublessee shall be bound by the same responsibilities, rights, privileges and
duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in Exhibit A, and covenants and agrees to
fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any and all responsibility
and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of Exhibit A, and/or
Sublessee's occupancy of the premises.  Furthermore, Sublessee shall be bound
by any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement, or addition to the prime
lease between Sublessor and the prime Lessor, and to keep the Sublessor
indemnified against all actions, claims and demands whatsoever in respect to
said Exhibit A, and Sublessee's use of the demised premises.  

    5.    Roof Repair and Replacement.  In consideration for the payment by
the prime Lessor of $26,400, Sublessor agreed to accept the responsibility for
all repairs and replacement of the roofing for the premises during the lease
term and any extensions thereof.

          5.1   If Sublessor pays the sum of $26,400 plus interest to
Sublessee within forty-five (45) days after this Sublease Agreement is
executed, Sublessee will be fully responsible for and pay for any and all
repairs and replacement to the roofing of the demised premises during the term
of the sublease or any extensions thereof.  Interest will be calculated at the
average 6-month certificate of deposit rate at the U.S. National Bank on
$26,400 for the period commencing on the date Sublessor received the $26,400
until the money is transferred to Sublessee.

          5.2   If Sublessor does not pay the sum of $26,400 plus interest to
Sublessee within 45 days after this Sublease Agreement is executed, Sublessor
shall remain fully responsible for any and all roof repairs and replacements
for the premises during the sublease term and any extensions thereof.

    6.  Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease.

          6.1  Any failure by Sublessee to pay the rent when due, or any
failure by Sublessee to perform any other obligation contained in this
Sublease, or to pay any other amount due under the Lease or to perform any
other obligation of Sublessor under the Lease when due which would constitute
a default under the Lease and which continues for the cure period provided
with respect thereto in the Lease;  

          6.2  If any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished
to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee is false in any material respect
when made or furnished;  

          6.3  If Sublessee makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, or Sublessee is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or a trustee,
receiver or liquidator is appointed for all or part of Sublessee's assets, or
a petition or answer is filed by or against Sublessee seeking or acquiescing
in any reorganization, liquidation or similar relief under any federal, state
or local law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors.  

    7.  Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:  


          7.1  Sublessor may exercise any and all rights and remedies
afforded to the prime lessor upon default under the lease, and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have pursuant to the laws of the State
of Oregon.  

          7.2  If a default occurs, this Sublease may be terminated at the
option of the Sublessor by written notice to the Sublessee.  The notice may be
given before, after or within the grace period for a default.  

          7.3  If the Sublease is terminated for any reason, Sublessee's
liability to Sublessor for damages shall survive such termination and
Sublessor may re-enter, take possession of the premises, and remove any
persons or property by legal action or by self-help with the use of reasonable
force.  

          7.4  Following re-entry or abandonment, Sublessor may:  
                (a)  make any suitable alterations or refurbish the premises,
or both, or change the character or use of the premises, but Sublessor shall
not be required to relet for any use or purpose (other than that specified in
the prime Lease) which the Sublessor may reasonably consider injurious to the
premises, or to any tenant which Sublessor may reasonably consider
objectionable;  

                (b)  relet all or part of the premises, alone or in
conjunction with other properties, for a term longer or shorter than the term
of this Sublease, upon any reasonable terms and conditions, including the
granting of some rent-free occupancy or other rent concession.  

          7.5  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of 12 per-cent (12%) per annum from the time of such payment until
repaid.  

          7.6  No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession of
the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any part
thereof, whether pursuant to the terms of this Sublease or any operation of
law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessee of its liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or subletting.  

    8.  Damages.  Whether or not an election is made to terminate the
Sublease, Sublessor shall be entitled to recover immediately without waiting
until the due date of any future rent, or until the date is fixed for
expiration of the Sublease term, the same amount of damages as set forth in
the prime Lease as though the Sublessor were the prime lessor and the
Sublessee were the prime lessee.  

    9.  Rights Cumulative; Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. 
No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to
have been made whether due to the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless
expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.  

    10.  Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessee acknowledges that except as
provided herein, the provisions for extension, options and assignment and
subletting in the prime Lease are applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor
only.  Sublessee will not assign this Sublease or sublet the premises without
the prior written consent of Sublessor which will not be unreasonably
withheld.  A direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a
majority of the voting stock of Sublessee, by whatever means, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purpose of this paragraph.  

    11.  Covenants, Representations and Warranties.  

          11.1  Sublessee agrees that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, should Sublessee ever desire to sell the store operated on the
premises, it shall give Sublessor the first opportunity to purchase the same
at its fair market value; provided, however, if Sublessor does not elect to
purchase the store for its fair market value as agreeable to Sublessee within
sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of Sublessee's intent to sell,
Sublessee may thereafter sell the store to anyone upon such terms and
conditions as are acceptable to Sublessee.  The foregoing provisions do not
apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of the owners of Sublessee, or transfers of assets
to a corporation or partnership, or transfers of a controlling interest to a
trust, as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor and such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or controlling
interest subject to the restrictions named in this section.  

          11.2  Sublessee agrees that throughout the term of this Sublease
and any extensions or renewals thereof, except as hereinafter provided, to
purchase from Sublessor not less than 25% of its retail sales of all goods and
merchandise required by it for resale on the premises to the extent that
Sublessor shall now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and merchandise
to Sublessee, and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessee's requirements at
such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered by
Sublessor to other purchasers from Sublessor, carrying on businesses similar
to that of the Sublessee in Lane County, Oregon.  If, at any time, Sublessee
contends that Sublessor is not able to supply particular goods or merchandise
customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in Lane County, Oregon, or that
terms offered by Sublessor are not reasonably comparable to those offered by
Sublessor to other such purchasers, the Sublessee shall so advise Sublessor in
writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within 30 days
after the receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or
merchandise so specified or does not advise Sublessee that the terms and
conditions offered are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other
purchasers, Sublessee shall be free to secure such specified goods and
merchandise from any other source it desires.  If Sublessor asserts that it is
offering reasonably comparable terms and prices and Sublessee nonetheless
purchases from another source, such purchase shall be a default under this
section.  

          11.3  Sublessee represents and warrants that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agrees to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.  

          11.4  Sublessee hereby represents and warrants to Sublessor that
the financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to
Sublessor in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements
fairly and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.  

          11.5  Sublessor represents and warrants that it has performed all
of the obligations which the Lessee is required to perform under the terms of
the lease to which this sublease pertains, as of the date of this sublease,
and that the lease is in full force and effect and not in default in any
respects.  Further, Sublessor represents that there is nothing as a result of
which the passage of time or the giving of notice would constitute a default
for actions which have already occurred prior to the date of this sublease.  

    12.  Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the institution of any suit or
action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, the prevailing party shall recover and the losing party hereby agrees
to pay, in addition to the costs and disbursements provided by statute,
reasonable attorney's fees in such proceedings or on any appeal from any
judgment or decree entered herein.  

    13.  Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be given
under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when, and only
when, the same is in writing and either personally delivered or by mail if it
has been deposited in the United States mail, with postage prepaid, to be
forwarded by registered or certified mail and addressed to the party to be
notified at the address appearing below its signature.  Such addresses may be
changed from time to time by notice as above provided.  


    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed the foregoing Sublease
Agreement the day and year first above written.

                              SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

    THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT is entered into this 30th day of June, 1993, by
and between UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon corporation ("Sublessor") and
WRIGHT'S FOODLINER, INC., an Oregon corporation ("Sublessee").  
RECITALS:
    A.  Sublessor has entered into a Lease for a ten (10) year term
commencing April 1, 1989, with Portland Fixture Limited Partnership and
Commercial Development Co., as tenants in common ("Lessor"), for a supermarket
located in the Lighthouse Square 
Shopping Center, Lincoln City, Oregon, a copy of which is attached hereto,
marked as Exhibit "A," and by this reference incorporated herein, as fully as
if its terms and conditions were herein set forth.  
    B.  On December 27, 1991, Lessor assigned its interest in the Lease
referred to in Recital A to The Steven and Margo Wiesberg Family Trust Under
Declaration of Trust dated November 12, 1991, The Jason Family 1986 Inter
Vivos Family Trust, Marvin J. Gross and Judith Gross, husband and wife, as
individuals, and Mario Jason and Madaline Jason, husband and wife, dba
Lighthouse Square Shopping Center.  
    C.  Sublessee desires to sublet the premises commencing on June 30, 1993,
and Sublessor is willing to sublease the premises in accordance with the terms
and conditions contained herein.  
    NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:  
    1.  Sublease Terms and Options.  Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessee
those premises described in Exhibit "A," for the term remaining as described
therein.  
          1.1  So long as it is not in default hereunder, the Sublessee may
exercise the renewal options contained in Exhibit "A," as set forth in
paragraphs 3 and 7 of said Exhibit.  
    2.  Rental.  Sublessee covenants and agrees to pay the rental for the
whole of the term, and to perform all affirmative covenants including, without
limitation, those pertaining to taxes, assessments, insurance, and all of the
covenants and obligations to be performed by Sublessor as Lessee, as set forth
in Exhibit "A," and to make such payments and provide such performance when
due by the terms of the Lease and any amendments thereto.  Basic rental will
be paid in accordance with the Schedule attached hereto, marked as Schedule
"A-1," and by this reference incorporated herein.  To the extent the basic
rent in Schedule "A-1" is less than the basic rental in the prime Lease,
Sublessor agrees to indemnify and hold Sublessee harmless from the obligation
to pay the same.  
    3.  Deposits.  Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all
rentals, or security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Exhibit "A," prorated as of June 30, 1993.  
    4.  Indemnity and Hold Harmless.  Sublessee shall be bound by the same
responsibilities, rights, privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in
Exhibit "A" except as otherwise provided herein, and covenants and agrees to
fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any and all responsibility
and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of Exhibit "A," and/or
Sublessee's occupancy of the premises.  Furthermore, Sublessee shall be bound
by any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement, or addition to the prime
Lease between Sublessor and the prime Lessor with Sublessee's prior written
consent, and to keep the Sublessor indemnified against all actions, claims and
demands whatsoever in respect to said Exhibit "A," and Sublessee's use of the
demised premises.  
    5.  Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:  
          5.1  Any failure by Sublessee to pay the rent when due, or any
failure by Sublessee to perform any other obligation contained in this
Sublease, or to pay any other amount due under the Lease or to perform any
other obligation of Sublessor under the Lease when due which would constitute
a default under the Lease and which continues for the cure period provided
with respect thereto in the Lease;  
          5.2  If any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished
to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee is false in any material respect
when made or furnished;  
          5.3  If Sublessee makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, or Sublessee is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or a trustee,
receiver or liquidator is appointed for all or part of Sublessee's assets, or
a petition or answer is filed by or against Sublessee seeking or acquiescing
in any reorganization, liquidation or similar relief under any federal, state
or local law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors.  
    6.  Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:  
          6.1  Sublessor may exercise any and all rights and remedies
afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease, and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have pursuant to the laws of the state
of Oregon.  
          6.2  If a default occurs, this Sublease may be terminated at the
option of the Sublessor by written notice to the Sublessee.  The notice may be
given before, after or within the grace period for a default.  
          6.3  If the Sublease is terminated for any reason, Sublessee's
liability to Sublessor for damages shall survive such termination and
Sublessor may re-enter, take possession of the premises, and remove any
persons or property by legal action or by self-help with the use of reasonable
force.  
          6.4  Following re-entry or abandonment, Sublessor may: 
                (a)  make any suitable alterations or refurbish the premises,
or both, or change the character or use of the premises, but Sublessor shall
not be required to relet for any use or purpose (other than that specified in
the prime Lease) which the Sublessor may reasonably consider injurious to the
premises, or to any tenant which Sublessor may reasonably consider
objectionable;  
                (b)  relet all or part of the premises, alone or in
conjunction with other properties, for a term longer or shorter than the term
of this Sublease, upon any reasonable terms and conditions, including the
granting of some rent-free occupancy or other rent concession.  
          6.5  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any sums
required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be required
of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest at the
rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the time of such payment until
repaid.  
          6.6  No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession of
the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any part
thereof, whether pursuant to the terms of this Sublease or any operation of
law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessee of its liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or subletting.  
    7.  Damages.  Whether or not an election is made to terminate the
Sublease, Sublessor shall be entitled to recover immediately without waiting
until the due date of any future rent, or until the date is fixed for
expiration of the Sublease term, the same amount of damages as set forth in
the prime Lease as though the Sublessor were the prime Lessor and the
Sublessee were the prime Lessee.  
    8.  Rights Cumulative; Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or
to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. 
No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to
have been made whether due to the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless
expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.  
    9.  Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessee acknowledges that except as
provided herein, the provisions for extension, options and assignment and
subletting in the prime Lease are applicable to the prime Lessor and Sublessor
only.  Sublessee will not assign this Sublease or sublet the premises without
the prior written consent of Sublessor which will not be unreasonably
withheld.  A direct or indirect transfer of ownership and control of a
majority of the voting stock of Sublessee, by whatever means, shall be deemed
an assignment of this Sublease for the purpose of this paragraph.  
    10.  Covenants, Representations and Warranties.  
          10.1  Sublessee agrees that as long as this Sublease remains in

60 days after receipt of written notice of Sublessee's intent to sell,
Sublessee may thereafter sell the store to anyone upon such terms and
conditions as are acceptable to Sublessee.  The foregoing provisions do not
apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of the owners of Sublessee, or transfers of assets
to a corporation or partnership, or transfers of a controlling interest to a
trust, as long as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the
transferor and such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or controlling
interest subject to the restrictions named in this section.  
          10.2  Sublessee agrees that throughout the term of this Sublease
and any extensions or renewals thereof, except as hereinafter provided, to

to secure such specified goods and merchandise from any other source it
desires.  If Sublessor asserts that it is offering reasonably comparable terms
and prices and Sublessee nonetheless purchases from another source, such
purchase shall be a default under this section.  
          10.3  Sublessee represents and warrants that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation
in connection with this Sublease, and agrees to hold Sublessor harmless from
any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.  
          10.4  Sublessee hereby represents and warrants to Sublessor that
the financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to
Sublessor in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements

of the obligations which the Lessee is required to perform under the terms of
the Lease to which this Sublease pertains, as of the date of this Sublease,

    13.  Conditions Subsequent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided above, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irrespective of
the closing of this transaction, until March 31, 1999, it is subject to the

                                THE COMMITMENT

            SECTION 2.01      Agreement to Purchase and Sell Loans. (a) At the
time of each Incremental Purchase pursuant to Section 2.01A hereof, Seller
does hereby assign, sell, set-over, transfer and otherwise convey to the
Buyer, without recourse (but subject to Seller's covenants, representations,
warranties and indemnities specifically provided herein), all of Seller's
right, title and interest in, to and under (i) each Loan purchased on the date
of such Incremental Purchase and any and all moneys of whatsoever nature
payable pursuant to each such Loan after the applicable Cut-Off Date,
including payments on the related Note, all Insurance Proceeds, any Net
Liquidation Proceeds, other Collections, and any other amounts payable in
connection with the termination of such Loan, (ii) all rights, powers, and

arising out of any default by the Obligor under such Loan, including all
rights to exercise any election or option or to make any decision or
determination or to give or receive any notice, consent, approval or waiver

item of Collateral pledged to secure any such Loan, all additions,

the foregoing of any nature whatsoever, including all Insurance Proceeds and
Net Liquidation Proceeds (with each Renewal Loan, related Renewal Note and
Related Documents conveyed by Seller and accepted by Buyer pursuant to
Section 3.02 hereof, collectively, the "Property").  The foregoing transfer,
sale, assignment and conveyance does not constitute and is not intended to
result in the creation, or an assumption by the Buyer, of any obligation of
Seller or any other Person in connection with any Loan, the related Note,
Related Documents or Collateral or under any agreement or instrument relating
thereto, including any obligation to any Obligor.

            (b)   In connection with each transfer, sale and assignment of
Loans, the Buyer hereby directs Seller to deliver to the Buyer as of the date
of each Incremental Purchase the Loan Files with respect to the Loans
transferred and sold on the date of each such Incremental Purchase, which
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

                  (i)   the original Notes, endorsed by Seller as follows: 
"Pay to the order of National Consumer Cooperative Bank, without recourse" and
signed by a Responsible Officer of Seller, with all prior and intervening
endorsements showing a complete chain of endorsement from the originator to
Seller, if Seller was not the originator, together with all originals or
copies of Renewal Notes in Seller's possession;

                  (ii)  executed original counterparts of the Related
Documents, together with executed originals of all modifications or amendments
thereof;

                  (iii)  irrevocable power of attorney of Seller to the Buyer
to execute, deliver, file, record or otherwise deal with the Collateral for
the Loans in accordance with this Agreement.  The power of attorney will be
delegated by the Buyer to the Servicer and will permit the Buyer (or Servicer
on its behalf) to prepare, execute and file of record UCC financing statements
and other notices;

                  (iv)  documents evidencing or related to any insurance
policies;

                  (v)   With respect to Loans secured by mortgages on real
property, Buyer shall have received (A) either:  (i) the original mortgage,
with evidence of recording thereon, (ii) a copy of the mortgage certified as a
true copy by a Responsible Officer of Seller where the original has been
transmitted for recording until such time as the original is returned by the
public recording officer or duly licensed title or escrow officer or (iii) a
copy of the mortgage certified by the public recording office in those
instances where the original recorded mortgage has been lost; (B) either:  (i)
the original assignment of mortgage from Seller endorsed as follows: 
"National Consumer Cooperative Bank," with evidence of recording thereon
(provided, however, that where permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction
wherein the mortgaged property is located, the assignment of mortgage may be
effected by one or more blanket assignments for Loans secured by mortgaged
properties located in the same county), or (ii) a copy of such assignment of
mortgage certified as a true copy by a Responsible Officer of Seller where the
original has been transmitted for recording (provided, however, that where the
original assignment or mortgage is not being delivered to the Buyer, each such
Responsible Officer may complete one or more blanket certificates attaching
copies of one or more assignments of mortgage relating to the mortgages
originated by Seller); and (C) either:  (i) originals of all intervening
assignments, if any, showing a complete chain of title from the originator to
Seller, including warehousing assignments, with evidence of recording thereon
if such assignments were recorded, (ii) copies of any assignments certified as
true copies by a Responsible Officer of Seller where the originals have been
submitted for recording until such time as the originals are returned by the
public recording officer, or (iii) copies of any assignments certified by the
public recording office in any instances where the original recorded
assignments have been lost; and (D) all available documentation relating to
appraisals and environmental surveys;

                  (vi)  copies of all UCC-1 financing statements (or UCC-3
amendments to financing statements) identifying each Loan, related Collateral
and Related Documents and naming the Buyer as secured party and Seller as
debtor, to be filed in Oregon, Washington and California.

            (c)   In addition, concurrently with or prior to each Incremental
Purchase, Seller agrees to cause any UCC-1 financing statements, UCC-3
assignments or other instruments necessary to perfect the ownership or
security interests granted and assigned by Seller to the Buyer in the Loans
and other Property transferred and sold on the date of each such Incremental
Purchase (other than UCC-1 financing statements naming the Obligors under the
Loans as debtors) to be filed or recorded in all such appropriate places as
are required to protect the Buyer's interest in such Loans and such other
Property, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing statements or
other evidence of such filings to the Buyer.  Seller and Buyer agree that with
respect to each Loan, Related Document and item of Primary Collateral, Seller
will make all filings and take all such other actions necessary to perfect
Buyer's first priority security interest therein, and, with respect to each
item of Collateral which is not Primary Collateral, Seller will make all
filings and take all such other actions necessary to perfect Buyer's security
interest therein to the same level of priority enjoyed by the Seller at the
time of the Incremental Purchase of the related Loan.

            (d)   It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that
each conveyance of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Property
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a purchase and sale and not a
loan.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the conveyance of the Property to
the Buyer hereunder is characterized by any third party as a pledge, the
parties intend that Seller shall be deemed hereunder to have granted to the
Buyer a first priority perfected security interest in all of Seller's right,
title and interest in, to and under the Loans, the Notes, the related
Collateral and Related Documents, and all monies due or to become due with
respect thereto after the applicable Cut-Off Date, and that this Agreement
shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.

            (e)   If the Buyer determines that any documents or documents
constituting a part of a Loan File are missing or defective (that is,
mutilated, damaged, defaced, incomplete, improperly dated, clearly forged or
otherwise physically altered) with respect to any Loan in any respect which
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Buyer, then the Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller, whereupon Seller shall have a period of 30 days,
within which to correct or cure any such defect.  If any such material defect
has not been corrected or cured in all material respects as described below,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller will repurchase
the related Loan from the Buyer at a price equal to the sum (without
duplication) of (i) the difference between (A) the Purchase Price then paid
for such Loan and (B) the aggregate of the principal portion of the Monthly
Payments then received and retained by Buyer (after taking into account any
payment of principal made by the related Obligor on such day), (ii) an amount
equal to the interest accrued at the applicable Loan Interest Rate on such
Repurchased Loan through the last day of the Due Period during which such
repurchase occurs, to the extent such amount was not previously received
during such Due Period from the Obligor as a Monthly Payment (the "Repurchase
Amount").  The Repurchase Amount shall be paid by Seller to the Buyer in
immediately available funds by the last day of the Due Period during which
such repurchase obligation arises and, upon receipt by the Buyer of such
deposit, the Buyer shall release or cause to be released to Seller the related
Loan Files and shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered
such instruments of transfer or assignment of such Loan, the security interest
in the related Property, in each case without recourse, representation or
warranty, as Seller shall reasonably request (as shall be prepared by and at
the expense of Seller).  It is understood and agreed that the obligation of
Seller to repurchase any Loan as to which a material defect in a constituent
document exists and to make the related payments as described in this
Section 2.01(e) shall, together with the indemnification rights contained in
Section 10.02 and the right of Buyer to be reimbursed for reasonable fees and
expenses incurred in effecting this repurchase, constitute the sole remedies
against Seller with respect to such defective Loan available to the Buyer.

            SECTION 2.01A     Incremental Purchase.  (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, including Sections 3.04 and 3.05 hereof, the Seller may
at any time prior to December 31, 1995 (or such later date as is approved by
Buyer) sell to the Buyer and the Buyer shall purchase from the Seller certain
identified Loans and Property related thereto (each, an "Incremental
Purchase"); provided, however, that no Incremental Purchase shall be for a
principal amount of less than $2,000,000 (other than the final Incremental
Purchase which may be in such lesser amount as agreed to by Buyer or such
other lesser amount as is approved by Buyer) and provided further, that the
Buyer shall not be obligated to make an Incremental Purchase (or any portion
thereof) to the extent such Purchase (or any portion thereof), together with
all previous Incremental Purchases, would exceed the Maximum Purchase Amount.

            (b)   The Seller shall provide the Buyer with written notice of
its intention to request an Incremental Purchase in the form of Exhibit E
hereto no later than ten (10) Business Days before each Incremental Purchase
and shall provide the Buyer with at least five (5) Business Days to review the
Loan Files relating to each Incremental Purchase.  Upon satisfaction of all
terms and conditions contained herein, Buyer shall pay to the Seller the
Purchase Price of each Incremental Purchase on the applicable Closing Date.

            SECTION 2.02      Agreement to Accept Renewal Notes. (a) Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including delivery of the
Renewal Notes and satisfaction of the other delivery and filing requirements
set forth in Section 2.01 hereof no later than five (5) Business Days before
the applicable Renewal Date, and upon at least 30 days' written notice from
Seller, the Buyer agrees to accept on any Renewal Date such Renewal Loans as
Seller shall have caused Obligors of the related Prior Notes to execute and
deliver.

            (b)   The parties to this Agreement intend that the conveyance of
each Renewal Loan and related Property by Seller and acceptance thereof by
Buyer shall constitute a purchase and sale and not a loan.

            (c)   If any document or documents constituting part of a Loan
File relating to a Renewal Loan are missing or defective as described in
section 2.01(e) hereof, the Buyer shall have the same rights against Seller as
provided in such Section 2.01(e).

or (2) the date on which the Guaranty Amount has been reduced to zero. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall make further payments to the
Purchase Price of Loans on and after the occurrence of any of the events
specified in the preceding sentence at such time as the aggregate unpaid
Purchase Price of the Loans exceeds the aggregate Principal Balance of the
Loans (including Liquidated Loans as to which there remain unpaid Liquidation
Losses).  Such further payments to the Purchase Price shall be made to the
extent of such excess on the Monthly Payment Dates from the amounts described
in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 3.01.

            SECTION 3.02      Acceptance - Renewal Loans.  For each Loan with
provisions for renewal on a Renewal Date, no later than thirty (30) days
before the Renewal Date for such Loan, Seller shall provide Buyer with a
notice that (i) identifies the Loan and related Note by original dated date,
face amount, Loan Interest Rate, and name of Obligor, (ii) identifies the
Renewal Date of such Loan, and (iii) states whether all or any part of the
Principal Balance of such Loan will be renewed on the Renewal Date, and if the
Loan is to be renewed, the anticipated Renewal Balance.  No later than five
(5) Business Days before the Renewal Date for any Loan to be renewed, the
Seller shall deliver to the Buyer the Renewal Note and other documents
required by Section 2.01 hereof.  On the applicable Renewal Date for any Loan
which is to be renewed, Buyer shall, subject to satisfaction of the delivery
requirements of Section 2.02 and the conditions set out in Section 3.04,
accept a Renewal Note from Seller (in lieu of receiving the Renewal Balance)
as payment in full of a portion of the Outstanding Balance of the Prior Note
equal to the Renewal Balance.  In the event that Seller has caused a Renewal
Note to be executed but the conditions precedent to acceptance thereof set out
in Section 3.04 have not been satisfied or waived by the Renewal Date, Seller
shall on such Renewal Date repurchase such Renewal Loan on the same terms as
stated in Section 2.01(e).

            SECTION 3.03      Effective Date.  Each sale made pursuant to
Sections 2.01 and 2.01A shall be effective, and all right, title and interest
in the Loans and the related Property so sold shall pass to the Buyer at such
time as Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price in respect thereof.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            SECTION 4.01      Seller's Corporate Representations and
Warranties.  Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of each Closing Date
and as of any Renewal Date as follows:

            (a)   Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oregon, is doing business
only under the corporate and "doing business as" names listed in Exhibit G
hereto, and is qualified to do business in each other jurisdiction where the
conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties requires such
qualification, and has full corporate power, authority and legal right to
carry on its business as presently conducted, to own and operate its
properties and assets, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to
sell the Loans and related Property.

            (b)   The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of
this Agreement and any assignment, the endorsement the Notes and the sale of
any Loans, related Notes and Related Documents and the security interest in
the related Collateral hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action of Seller, do not require any shareholder approval or the
approval or consent of any trustee or the holders of any Debt of Seller,
except such as have been obtained (certified copies thereof having been
delivered to Buyer), do not contravene any law, regulation, rule or order
binding on it or its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws and do not contravene
the provisions of or constitute a default under any indenture, mortgage,
contract or other agreement or instrument to which Seller is a party or by
which Seller or any of the Loans, related Notes or Related Documents may be
bound or affected.

            (c)   No Government Approval or filing or registration with any
Governmental Authority is required for the making and performance by Seller of
this Agreement or any assignment or the endorsement of the Notes or in
connection with the sale of the Loans and related Property contemplated
hereby, except such as have been heretofore obtained and are in full force and
effect (certified copies thereof having been delivered to Buyer).

            (d)   This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Seller and constitutes, and any assignment and any endorsement of a Note when
duly executed and delivered will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with its
terms.

            (e)   Except as described in Exhibit H hereto, there are no
actions, proceedings, investigations, or claims against or affecting Seller
now pending before any court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority (nor
to the knowledge of Seller has any thereof been threatened nor does any basis
exist therefor) which if determined adversely to the Seller would be likely to
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of
Seller or on Seller's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement,
or under an endorsement of any Note.  With respect to the litigation described
in Exhibit H hereto, a determination in such litigation that is materially
adverse to the Seller or Guarantor would not have a material adverse effect on
the financial condition or operations of Seller or on Seller's ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, or under any assignment or
endorsement of any Note.

            (f)   The consolidated balance sheet of the Seller and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries at October 1, 1994, and the related statements of
income and retained earnings of Seller and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries for
the fiscal year then ended, copies of which have been furnished to Buyer,
fairly present the financial condition of Seller and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries as at such date and the results of operations of Seller and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended, all in accordance
with U.S. GAAP consistently applied.  Since that date, there has been no
material adverse change in the financial condition or operations of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

            (g)   Seller has good and marketable title to each of the
properties and assets reflected in its balance sheet referred to in
Section 4.01(f) except such as have been since sold or otherwise disposed of
in the ordinary course of business.

            (h)   Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates is
in material breach of or default under any agreement or agreements to which it
is a party or which are binding on it or any of its assets and which provide
for the payment of monies, the delivery of goods or the provision of services
in amounts or with values in the aggregate in excess of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000).

            (i)   The present value of all benefits vested under all Pension
Plans did not, as of the most recent valuation date of such Pension Plans,
exceed the value of the assets of the Pension Plans allocable to such vested
benefits by an amount which would represent a potential material liability of
Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries or affect materially the ability of
the Seller to perform this Agreement; no Plan or trust created thereunder, or
any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 or Section 2003(a) of
ERISA) which could subject such Plan or any other Plan, any trust created
thereunder, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with
any Plan or any such trust to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 502 or Section 2003(a) of ERISA; no Pension Plan or trust
created thereunder has been terminated, and there have been no "reportable
events" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) since the effective
date of ERISA; no Pension Plan or trust created thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of
ERISA) whether or not waived, since the effective date of ERISA; and the
required allocations and contributions to Pension Plans will not violate
Section 415 of the Code.

            (j)   Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been duly
filed in all places where filing is necessary and all other or additional acts
have been taken as are necessary to perfect the Buyer's interests arising
hereunder and under the assignments in and to the Loans and related Property
and the lien created hereby constitutes a valid and perfected lien of first
priority in and to all of the Loans and related Property (other than in
Collateral which is not Primary Collateral or not governed by the Uniform
Commercial Code, in which case the Buyer has only such interest as the Seller
had and disclosed to the Buyer on the applicable Closing Date and other than
Seller's security interest in its capital stock and patronage dividends) and
is enforceable against all third parties (other than third parties whose
interests in Collateral which is not Primary Collateral are prior to Seller's
interests therein on the applicable Closing Date) in all jurisdictions as
security for all obligations of the Seller to the Buyer under this Agreement.

            (k)   Seller has good and marketable title to the Loans and
related Notes designated for sale to the Buyer hereunder, the Related
Documents and the proceeds thereof, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances and Seller has not transferred in any manner whatever to any
Person (other than Buyer) and has not created or permitted any lien, pledge,
charge, security interest, ownership interest, participation interest or any
other interest of any nature whatever (other than in favor of the Buyer) in
respect of the Loans, the related Notes, the Related Documents or the proceeds
thereof.

            (l)   Seller's chief executive offices and the offices where such
Seller keeps records concerning the Loans and related Property are located at
6433 S.E. Lake Road, Portland, Oregon or such other location to which such
offices are moved pursuant to Section 6.01(m) hereof.

            (m)   This Agreement, the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01(f) and all other instruments, documents, certificates and
statements furnished to the Buyer by the Seller, taken as a whole, do not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading.

            (n)   Seller is "eligible" to borrow from NCB under the provisions
of the Bank Act. 

            SECTION 4.02      Seller's Closing Date Representations and
Warranties with respect to Loans.  Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as
of each Closing Date with respect to Loans transferred and sold on such
Closing Date as follows:

            (a)   The information with respect to each Loan set forth in the
applicable Loan Schedule, together with any documentation supporting such
information, is true and correct;

            (b)   With respect to each Loan, there exists only one original
Note.  Such original Note and all of the other original or certified

applicable Closing Date;

Payments on such Loan are payable on the first day of each month in U.S.
Dollars by an Obligor domiciled in the United States;

a variable rate based on the Prime Rate or LIBOR, adjusted at least annually,
or (ii) a fixed rate that has been approved by NCB in its sole discretion, and
each Note having a variable Loan Interest Rate will have a minimum Loan
Interest Rate (A) in the case of a variable rate based on the Prime Rate, the
Prime Rate minus 100 basis points and (B) in the case of a variable rate based
on LIBOR, LIBOR plus 175 basis points;

            (e)   Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment herein
contemplated, the applicable Seller held good and indefeasible title to, and
was the sole owner of, each Loan conveyed by Seller, subject to no liens,
charges, mortgages, encumbrances or rights of others or other liens which will
be released simultaneously with such transfer and assignment; and immediately
upon the transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the Buyer will hold good
and indefeasible title, to, and be the sole owner of, each Loan subject to no
liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances or rights of others;

            (f)   No Obligor has been delinquent (after giving effect to any
grace period) in payments on its Loan, any other loan made by the Seller or
Buyer to such Obligor, or any open account at any time in the three months
preceding the applicable Closing Date;

            (g)   No Obligor has been delinquent in payments on its Loan, any
other loan made by Seller or Buyer to such Obligor, or any open account for a
period in excess of 45 days at any time during the year (or if originated less
than one year earlier, since the date of origination) preceding the applicable
Closing Date;

            (h)   The Loan is not subject to any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, nor will the
operation of any of the terms of the related Note, Related Document or any
related Collateral, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the
related Note, Related Document or any related Collateral unenforceable in
whole or in part, or subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim
or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto;

            (i)   Each Loan at the time it was made complied and, as of the
applicable Closing Date, complied in all material respects with applicable
state and federal laws and regulations, including, without limitation, usury,
equal credit opportunity, disclosure and recording laws;

            (j)   At least one of the Obligors with respect to each Loan (i)

Seller's knowledge, shall have provided to Seller complete and accurate
information relating to Obligor's financial condition and shall have suffered
no material adverse changes in its financial condition or otherwise since the
date the Loan was originated;

            (k)   Each Loan has a remaining term to maturity of no greater
than 10 years from the applicable Closing Date;

            (l)   The Note related to each Loan provides that the principal be
amortized monthly over the term of such Note with an amortization period of no
greater than 10 years and with either level monthly payments of principal and
interest or principal plus interest, provided that, in the case of a Loan with
(i) an amortization period longer than its term to maturity (but in no event
longer than a 10-year amortization period) and (ii) renewal provisions, a
balloon payment at maturity or on the Renewal Date, as applicable, is
permissible;

            (m)   Each Loan, related Note, related Collateral and Related
Documents pursuant to which Collateral is pledged to a Seller is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Obligor thereof and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except only as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding or action in equity
or at law), none of which will prevent the ultimate realization of the
security provided by the Collateral or Related Document, and all parties to
each Loan had full legal capacity to execute all Related Documents and convey
the property therein purported to be conveyed;

            (n)   The terms of the Loan, related Note and each Related
Document pursuant to which Collateral was pledged have not been impaired,
altered or modified in any respect, except by written instrument which has
been recorded, if necessary, to protect the interest of the Buyer and which
has been delivered to the Buyer;

            (o)   The proceeds of the Loan have been fully disbursed, and
there is no obligation on the part of the Seller to make future advances
thereunder.  Any and all requirements as to disbursements of any escrow funds
therefor have been complied with.  All costs, fees and expenses incurred in

            (p)   The Obligor with respect to each Loan and each other member
of its Obligor Group has a positive net worth as accounted for under U.S.

the federal bankruptcy laws;

            (q)   There is no default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration existing under the Loan, related Note or Related Document and no
event which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any
grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach, violation or event
of acceleration, and the Seller has not waived any such default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration;

            (r)   Each Loan requires each of the Obligor and Loan Guarantor
thereunder at its own costs and expense to maintain the Collateral pledged to
secure the related Loan in good repair, condition and working order, and to
the best knowledge of the Seller, each Obligor and Loan Guarantor under a Loan
is currently in compliance with this requirement;

            (s)   Seller has, or on the applicable Closing Date will have, (1)
a first priority perfected security interest in each item of Primary
Collateral, free from any lien, security interest, encumbrance or other right,
title or interest of any Person, and (2) a perfected security interest in each
other item of Collateral, subject to the prior liens, security interests and
encumbrances existing on, and identified to and approved by the Buyer on the
applicable Closing Date.  Seller shall, on the applicable Closing Date,
transfer its security interest in the Primary Collateral and such other
Collateral as is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code or required by the
Buyer subject however to the rights of the holder of title in and to such
Collateral and of the Obligors in such Collateral pledged under the Related
Documents (and, in the case of Collateral which is not Primary Collateral,
holders of prior liens), and Seller, as agent for the Buyer, shall defend the
Buyer's security interest in and to Collateral against all claims and demands
of all Persons at any time claiming the same or any interest therein adverse
to that of the Obligors or the Buyer.

            (t)   Either (i) the Obligor and Loan Guarantor has, under the
terms of each Loan, consented to a sale and assignment of the Loan, the
related Note and Related Documents and the sale or grant of a security
interest in and to the Loan and the Collateral relating thereto, or (ii) none
of the Loan, the related Note or any Related Documents requires the consent of
approval of notice to the Obligor or Loan Guarantor with respect to the
assignment and transfer by Seller of Seller's right, title and interest in and
to the Loan, the related Note, any Related Document and Collateral;

            (u)   The Notes and Related Documents delivered to Buyer on the
applicable Closing Date are true, correct, and complete original counterparts
of all instruments and documents evidencing or in any way relating to the Loan
and related indebtedness referred to therein; except as approved by the Buyer,
such Notes and Related Documents are in substantially the form of the
documents attached hereto as Exhibit I; except as included with the
instruments and documents so delivered, such Notes and such Related Documents
have not been amended; and each such Note and Related Document to which
Obligor or Loan Guarantor is a party bears the original signature of such
Obligor and Loan Guarantor;

            (v)   Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been duly
filed in all places where filing is necessary, and all other or additional
acts have been taken as are necessary to perfect Seller's security interests
arising pursuant to the Related Documents in the Primary Collateral and such
other Collateral as is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code or is required
by Buyer and such security interests constitute a valid and perfected lien in
and to all of the Collateral of first priority (subject to no prior or equal
liens or interests) in the case of all Primary Collateral and of the same
level of priority as that enjoyed by the Seller on the applicable Closing Date
in the case of all other Collateral as is governed by the Uniform Commercial
Code or required by Buyer, and will be enforceable against all third parties
in all jurisdictions as security for the respective obligations of Obligors to
Seller under their respective Notes and Related Documents;

            (w)   Seller has heretofore caused all copies of the Loans,
related Notes and Related Documents in its possession to be separately
identified and distinguished from Seller's other loans, and on the applicable
Closing Date, the Seller will cause each copy of each Note, related Collateral
and Related Document in its possession to be identified with an appropriate
legend clearly disclosing the fact that such Loan, the related Notes, Related
Documents and the Seller's security interest in the related Collateral have
been sold and assigned to the Buyer and the Buyer is the owner thereof, and
any original copies of any Note, related Collateral or Related Document coming
into the possession of the Seller will be delivered to the Buyer;

            (x)   With respect to any Loan secured by a mortgage on real
property, each mortgage is a valid and subsisting lien of record on the
mortgaged property subject only to a first mortgage lien on such mortgaged
property previously disclosed to Buyer and subject in all cases to such
exceptions that are generally acceptable to prudent and experienced lenders in
connection with their regular commercial lending activities, and such other
exceptions to which similar properties are commonly subject and which do not
individually, or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the
benefits of the security intended to be provided by such mortgage;

            (y)   With respect to each Loan secured by a mortgage on real
property, each original mortgage was recorded, and all subsequent assignments
of the original mortgage have been recorded in the appropriate jurisdictions
wherein such recordation is necessary to perfect the lien thereof as against
creditors of Seller; and

            (z)   The Aggregate Exposure listed with respect to each Loan and
related Obligor Group in the applicable Loan Schedule is true and correct and
is in no case greater than $4,000,000;

            SECTION 4.3 Seller's Renewal Date Representations and Warranties. 
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of each Renewal Date on which the
Seller has designated any Renewal Note for acceptance as follows:

            (a)   As of the applicable Renewal Date, all applicable
representations and warranties in Section 4.02 hereof are confirmed as to such
Renewal Loan.

            (b)   As of the applicable Renewal Date, each Obligor of the
applicable Renewal Loan is not in default of its payment obligations under the
Prior Note or under the Related Documents, and is not in default of its
nonmonetary obligations under such Note or Related Documents.

            (c)   As of the applicable Renewal Date, no event has occurred and
is continuing which would permit the Seller to accelerate the maturity of any
Obligor's obligations under the applicable Renewal Loan or under the Prior
Note or the Related Documents.

            (d)   The Notes and Related Documents delivered to Buyer on or
prior to the applicable Renewal Date are true, correct, and complete original
counterparts of all instruments and documents evidencing or in any way
relating to the Loan and the related Indebtedness referred to therein; except
as included with the instruments and documents so delivered, such Notes and
Related Documents have not been amended; and each such Note and each such
Related Document to which an Obligor or Loan Guarantor is a party bears the
original signature of the Obligor or Loan Guarantor.

            (e)   The Loans and Notes designated by Seller as Renewal Loans
and Notes together with the Related Documents to which Obligors or Loan
Guarantors are parties have been duly executed by their respective Obligors or
Loan Guarantors and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of
their respective Obligors and Loan Guarantors enforceable against such
Obligors and Loan Guarantors in accordance with their respective terms.

            (f)   Each amount identified in a notice provided pursuant to the
terms of Section 3.02 as the "anticipated Renewal Balance" correctly
identifies the amount of the outstanding Principal Balance evidenced by the
Note to be accepted as of such Renewal Date and there are no offsets or
defenses to the payment of such amount that may be asserted against the Seller
either by way of defense or counterclaim.

            (g)   Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been duly
filed in all places where filing is necessary, and all other or additional
acts have been taken as are necessary to perfect the Seller's security
interests arising pursuant to the Related Documents in the Collateral and such
security interests constitute a valid and perfected lien in and to all of the
Collateral of first priority (subject to no prior or equal liens or interests)
in the case of all Primary Collateral and of the same level of priority as
that enjoyed by the Seller on the Closing Date on which the Loan was first
sold and assigned hereunder in the case of all other Collateral, and will be
enforceable against all third parties in all jurisdictions as security for the
respective obligations of Obligors to the Seller under their respective Notes
and Related Documents.

            (h)   No Renewal Loan, related Renewal Note or any Related
Document, alone or in connection with Seller's prior course of conduct,
expressly or impliedly requires Seller or any other Person to make additional
advances thereunder.

            (i)   The Note related to the Renewal Note provides for full
amortization over its remaining term to maturity.

            SECTION 4.04      Buyer's Representations and Warranties.  Buyer
represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

            (a)   Buyer is a financial institution duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America,
and has full corporate power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and to purchase the Loans and related Property.

            (b)   Execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement and the purchase of the Loans and related Property hereunder have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Buyer, do not
require any shareholder approval or the approval or consent of any trustee or
the holders of any Indebtedness of Buyer, do not contravene any law,
regulation, rule or order binding on it or its Articles of Association or
Bylaws and do not contravene the provisions of or constitute a default under
any indenture, mortgage, contract or other agreement or instrument to which
Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its properties may be bound or
affected.

            (c)   No Government Approval or filing or registration with any
Governmental Authority is required for the making and performance by Buyer of
this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

            (d)   This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with its terms.

            SECTION 4.05      Repurchase Upon Breach of Certain
Representations and Warranties.  (a)  The representations and warranties and
agreements of the Seller set forth in Sections 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 with
respect to the Seller and each Loan and related Property shall continue so
long as such Loan remains outstanding.  Upon discovery by either Seller or
Buyer that any of such representations or warranties was incorrect as of the
time made, the party making such discovery shall give prompt notice to the
other party.  In the event any defect, misrepresentation or omission
materially and adversely affects the interest of the Buyer, the Seller shall
eliminate or cure the circumstance or condition causing the defect within 10
days of the discovery thereof or, repurchase such Loan and the related
Property.

                                   ARTICLE V

                           SERVICING AND COLLECTION

            Subject to the provisions of Section 8.03, at all times prior to
the later of (a) the Termination Date or (b) the date on which all obligations
of the Seller under this Agreement have been performed in full, the following
terms and provisions of this Article V shall apply.

            SECTION 5.01      Servicing; Delegation of Authority to Buyer and
Servicer.  (a)  The Buyer appoints the Servicer to act as the Buyer's
exclusive agent for performing all of the servicing and administrative
functions with respect to the Loans, the related Notes, the Related Documents
and the related Collateral not specifically reserved to the Buyer pursuant to
subsection (b) of this Section 5.01.  The Servicer hereby accepts such
appointment and agrees to perform such Loan servicing and administrative
duties as are specifically enumerated herein as well as those not reserved to
the Buyer pursuant to subsection (b).

            (b)   The Buyer reserves the right to perform, and the Servicer
shall have no obligation to perform, the following servicing and
administrative functions with respect to the Loans and this Agreement: (i)
data services, including invoicing and billing Obligors, calculating Loan
Interest Rates, Monthly Payments and amortization schedules with respect to
the Notes, and posting Collections received from or on behalf of Obligors;
(ii) accounting services, including maintenance of the records relating to
Loan Collections and performance; (iii) bookkeeping services; (iv) determining
the Guaranty Amount and the Repurchase Amount due from time to time; and (v)
determining monthly, in connection with each Payment Date, the Available
Funds, the Periodic Payment, the Applicable Rate, the Servicing Fee and the
Guaranty Fee and (vi) maintaining the Account.

            (c)   The Servicer shall use the same diligence and practices in
servicing the Loans, the related Collateral and the Related Documents as it
uses in servicing and collecting indebtedness evidenced by notes and related
documents held for its own account and, in any event, shall endeavor to
collect or cause to be collected from each Obligor the amounts as and when due
and owing under such Obligor's Note and Related Documents.  In performing its
duties hereunder, and subject to the specific limitations set forth herein,
Servicer shall act in accordance with its Credit and Collection Policy and
shall take such actions with respect to the Loans, Notes and Related Documents
as, in its reasonable business judgment, it may deem advisable to maintain or
enhance receipt of timely Collections thereunder.  Promptly upon the request
of Servicer, Buyer agrees to execute and deliver such documents and take such
further acts (at Servicer's expense) as Servicer may reasonably request to
confirm and evidence the agency granted to Servicer pursuant to this
Section 5.01.

            (d)   Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Servicer shall deliver to the Buyer a list certified by its secretary or
one of its assistant secretaries of the Servicing Officers and employees of
the Servicer involved in or responsible for, the administration and servicing
of the Loans, which list shall from time to time be updated by the Servicer
and which may be relied upon until so updated; provided that if the Servicer
has previously provided such a list to the Buyer and such list does not
require updating, the Servicer shall confirm the accuracy of the
previously-delivered list.

            SECTION 5.02      Maintenance of System; Collection and
Maintenance of Information.  (a)  Servicer shall arrange and maintain with
respect to the Loans, related Notes and Related Documents, data processing,
accounting and related services adequate for the effective and timely
performance of its servicing obligations hereunder in accordance with good
business practices and in compliance with all applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations.

            (b)   With respect to each Loan and related Obligor, Servicer
shall collect the following information:  (i) within 120 days of the end of
each fiscal year of such Obligor, annual financial statements; (ii) within 50
days of the end of each fiscal quarter of such Obligor, interim financial
statements, together with a certificate of an authorized officer of such
Obligor, to the effect that the accompanying interim financial statements are
true and correct in all material respects; and (iii) evidence of continued
perfection of Buyer's security interest in the related Collateral.  Servicer
shall maintain the foregoing information and shall make the same available to
the Buyer or its nominees or agents upon reasonable request.

            SECTION 5.03      Maintenance of Lien Priority.  So long as
Servicer is required to act as Buyer's agent for performing certain servicing
obligations with respect to the Loans, Servicer agrees to take all actions,
including lien searches and continuation statement filings, necessary or
desirable to ensure that the liens arising pursuant to the Related Documents
and securing repayment of any Obligor's indebtedness evidenced by a related
Note will be maintained as continuously perfected first priority (except in
the case of Collateral which is not Primary Collateral, in which event the
Servicer shall take all actions to maintain the priority sold and assigned
hereunder) security interests (except as otherwise approved by Buyer) in all
applicable jurisdictions.

            SECTION 5.04      Obligor Inquiries; Credit and Collection
Policies.  (a)  Servicer agrees to accept primary responsibility for
telephonic and face-to-face communications with Obligors concerning the Loans,
related Notes and Related Collateral.  In the event Obligor inquiries require
consideration by the Buyer, the Servicer agrees to coordinate with the Buyer
and the Obligors so as to provide prompt and appropriate responses to
Obligors' inquiries or concerns.

            (b)   Servicer agrees to follow, maintain and apply the credit,
extension and collection policies identified in the Credit and Collection
Policy in all material respects unless any order of any court, arbitrator or
other Governmental Authority or any determination of or change in any
applicable federal, state or local law or regulation should require otherwise
or unless Buyer shall otherwise consent in writing, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Servicer is not authorized to and agrees that it will not without the Buyer's
prior written consent, (i) amend, extend, release, modify, or waive the terms
or conditions of any Loan, related Note or of any Related Document; (ii)
release any Collateral pledged in support of any Obligor's obligations under a
Note or Related Document (other than Seller's capital stock and patronage
dividends); or (iii) grant or permit to be granted any rebate, refund, credit
or other adjustment in respect of a Obligor's obligation under any Note or any
Related Document.

            SECTION 5.05      Obligor Defaults.  Upon the Servicer's becoming
aware of any Obligor Default, Servicer agrees to promptly give any notice to
Obligor required to commence the running of any applicable cure period
following a default in the performance by Obligor of its obligations under the
Loan, the related Note and Related Documents.  If an Obligor Default shall
occur and be continuing or if a Loan shall otherwise become a Defaulted Loan,
Servicer shall promptly undertake the collection of such Obligor's
indebtedness in accordance with its Credit and Collection Policy.  Without
limiting the foregoing the Servicer shall commence liquidation of the
Collateral pledged to secure such Obligor's obligations under its Loan within
thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such Obligor's Default or upon a Loan
becoming a Defaulted Loan, unless Servicer receives notice from the Seller of
its election to repurchase such Loan pursuant to Section 7.02 of this
Agreement.  Buyer shall promptly notify Servicer of any payment default by an
Obligor under the related Note and Servicer shall promptly notify Buyer,
Seller and Guarantor of the occurrence of any other Obligor Default or of a
Loan becoming a Defaulted Loan for a reason other than a payment default.  In
its efforts to collect the indebtedness evidenced by any Note, Servicer shall
in all events proceed in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner
and when seeking to realize on Collateral pledged by any Obligor, shall
proceed in such a fashion as to preserve to Buyer its rights to seek
collection of a deficiency against such Obligor if the sale of the Collateral
is insufficient to pay such Obligor's obligations in full.

            Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to assume the
servicing obligations of the Servicer hereunder in connection with the
liquidation of a Defaulted Loan and related Property and Servicer shall
cooperate with Buyer in effecting such transfer of obligations and liquidation
of Collateral.  If Buyer assumes the servicing obligations with respect to the
liquidation of a Defaulted Loan, Buyer shall proceed as a prudent and
experienced servicer would under the circumstances and shall be entitled to
reimbursement for its reasonable fees and expenses in performing such
obligations in accordance with Section 5.10 hereof.

            SECTION 5.06      Servicer Reports; Annual Compliance Report.  (a) 
On the Business Day preceding each Payment Date, Servicer shall deliver to
Buyer a report relating to the Loans identifying any event occurring during
the preceding Due Period of which Servicer has actual knowledge which
materially impairs or might reasonably be expected materially to impair any
Obligor's ability to repay the Debt relating to any Loan and evidenced by a
Note or to perform its obligations under any Related Document or which has or
might reasonably be expected to substantially reduce the value of the
Collateral or to impair the Buyer's lien thereon.  In addition to the
foregoing, from time to time upon request of Buyer, the Servicer will deliver
to Buyer such other statements, lists, reports and other information as the
Buyer may reasonably request, and, to the extent any such information must be
obtained by Servicer from a third party, as the Servicer may reasonably be
expected to obtain.

            (b)   At the time of delivery of its annual audited financial
statements pursuant to Section 6.01(e) hereof, the Servicer shall also deliver
to the Buyer a certificate of a Responsible Officer to the effect that a
review of the activities of the Servicer during the same annual period as that
covered by the annual financial statements, and of its performance under this
Agreement during such period has been made under the supervision of the
officers executing such certificate with a view to determining whether during
such period the Servicer had performed and observed all of its obligations
under this Agreement, and either (i) stating that based on such review no
Servicer Default under this Agreement has occurred, or (ii) if a Servicer
Default has occurred, specifying such Servicer Default and the nature and
status thereof.

            (c)   Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of
Servicer, unless Buyer has in its sole discretion waived this delivery
requirement for any year, Servicer shall deliver to Buyer a report of a firm
of independent public accountants selected by the Servicer, which firm is
either of nationally recognized standing or acceptable to Buyer, to the effect
that such firm has examined certain documents and records relating to the
servicing of the Loans and related Property under this Agreement and that, on
the basis of such examination conducted substantially in compliance with
generally accepted audit standards, nothing came to their attention which
caused them to believe that the Servicer has not serviced the Loans and
related Property in accordance with its Credit and Collection Policy or
otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, except for such insignificant
exceptions or errors on records that, in the opinion of such firm, it is not
required to report.  The Servicer shall provide a copy of such accountant's
reports to Buyer.

            SECTION 5.07      Lockboxes.  The Servicer hereby agrees (i) to
instruct all Obligors to cause all Monthly Payments, Payaheads and Principal
Prepayments on account of Loans to be mailed directly to a Permitted Lockbox;
and (ii) to use its best effort not to suffer or permit any funds other than
such Monthly Payments, Payaheads and Principal Prepayments to be mailed to
Permitted Lockboxes or deposited into related Lockbox Accounts;

            SECTION 5.08      Payment of Guaranty Fees and Servicing Fees. 
(a)  On each Payment Date, the Buyer shall remit (i) to Servicer the Servicing
Fee and (ii) to Guarantor the Guaranty Fee; provided, however, that upon the
occurrence and continuation of a Servicer Default or a Guarantor Default, the
Buyer shall not be required to remit the Servicing Fee to the Servicer and
provided further, that if there shall have occurred and be continuing a
Servicer Default under Section 8.01 (other than under Section 8.01(b)) or a
Guarantor Default, the Buyer shall not be required to remit the Guaranty Fee
to the Guarantor.

            (b)   The Buyer shall be entitled to retain on each Payment Date
from amounts received as (i) Collections and other Available Funds (other than
Guaranty Payments) during the related Due Period and (ii) Guaranty Payments on
or before such Payment Date, the Periodic Payment; provided, however, that
upon the occurrence and continuation of a Servicer Default (other than a
Servicer Default under Section 8.01(b), in which event Buyer or a Successor
Servicer shall retain the Servicing Fee) or a Guarantor Default, the Buyer
shall be entitled to retain all Collections and other Available Funds.

            (c)   Buyer shall determine the Periodic Payment for each Payment
Date using the following methodology.

                  (1)   As used herein and in the Guaranty Agreement,
      "Periodic Payment" means for any Payment Date the sum of, for each Loan,
      (a) the principal portion of the Monthly Payment actually received
      during the related Due Period, other than the portion of the Principal
      Balance of a Prior Note which, at the time it became due, constituted
      the Renewal Balance under a Renewal Note; (b) any Principal Prepayment,
      Payahead, Insurance Proceeds and Net Liquidation Proceeds actually
      received during the related Due Period; (c) the principal portion of any
      Guaranty Payment or Repurchase Proceeds with respect to the related Due
      Period; and (d) the Monthly Interest Amount for the related Interest
      Accrual Period.

                  (2)   As used herein, in the Servicing Agreement and the
      Guaranty Agreement, "Monthly Interest Amount" on any Payment Date shall
      mean an amount equal to the sum of, for each Loan the product of (i) the
      Principal Balance of such Loan during the related Due Period, times (ii)
      the Applicable Rate times (iii) a fraction, the denominator of which is
      three hundred sixty (360), and the numerator of which is the actual
      number of days in the related Interest Accrual Period.

            SECTION 5.09      Applicable Rate.  As used in this Agreement and
the Guaranty Agreement, "Applicable Rate" for each Loan shall be determined as
follows.  The Applicable Rate shall be established as of each LIBOR
Determination Date and shall be applicable for the next succeeding Interest
Accrual Period without regard to changes thereafter occurring during such
Interest Accrual Period in the principal amounts outstanding under the Notes,
in the Principal Balance of Loans purchased, or in LIBOR.  Buyer shall, after
the determination of the Applicable Rate on each LIBOR Determination Date,
notify Seller, Servicer and Guarantor of such Applicable Rate; provided,
however, that any failure of Buyer to give such notice shall not affect
Seller's, Servicer's or Guarantor's obligations hereunder or under the
Guaranty Agreement.

            The Applicable Rate for each Loan shall be computed and applied on
the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days for the actual number of
days occurring in the applicable Interest Accrual Period.  For each Interest
Accrual Period, the Applicable Rate shall mean an interest rate per annum
equal to the sum of (a) 140 basis points and (b) LIBOR in effect on the
applicable LIBOR Determination Date.  For purposes hereof, the Buyer will
determine LIBOR by 12:00 noon, Eastern Standard Time, on each LIBOR
Determination Date on the basis of quotations provided by four Reference Banks
as of 11:00 A.M. (London time) on such LIBOR Determination Date as such
quotations appear on the display designated as page "LIBO" on the appropriate
display on the Bloomberg Financial Markets System (or such other page as may
replace the LIBO page on that service for the purpose of displaying London
interbank offered rates of major banks).  LIBOR as determined by Buyer is the
arithmetic mean of such quotations (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
whole multiple of 0.0625% per annum).  If on any LIBOR Determination Date at
least two but fewer than all of the Reference Banks provide quotations, LIBOR
will be determined in accordance with the provisions set forth above on the
basis of the offered quotations of those Reference Banks providing such
quotations.  If on the LIBOR Determination Date only one or none of the
Reference Banks provides such offered quotations, LIBOR will be:  (i) the rate
per annum (rounded, as aforesaid) that the Buyer determines to be either (x)
the arithmetic mean of the offered quotations that leading banks in the City
of New York selected by Buyer are quoting at or about 11:00 A.M. London time
on the relevant LIBOR Determination Date for one month Dollar deposits to the
principal London office of each of the Reference Banks or those of them (being
at least two in number) to which such offered quotations are, in the opinion
of Buyer, being so quoted or (y) in the event that Buyer can determine no such
arithmetic mean, the arithmetic mean of the offered quotations that leading
banks in the City of New York selected by Buyer are quoting at or about
11:00 A.M. London time on such LIBOR Determination Date to leading European
banks for one month Dollar deposits; or (ii) if the banks selected as
aforesaid by Buyer are not quoting as described in clause (i) above, LIBOR for
such Interest Accrual Period will be LIBOR as determined on the previous LIBOR
Determination Date.  "Reference Banks" shall mean four major banks in the
London interbank market selected by Buyer.

            SECTION 5.10      Computation and Payment of Servicing Fees;
Servicer's Expenses.  The Servicing Fee for each Payment Date shall be an
amount equal to the sum of, for each Loan, the product of .50% times (ii) the
average outstanding Principal Balance of such Loan during the related Due
Period, times (iii) a fraction, the denominator of which is 360 and the
numerator of which is the actual number of days in the related Due Period.

            In addition, as additional compensation for performing its
obligations hereunder, the Servicer will be entitled to be paid all late
payment charges, to the extent collected from Obligors.  The Servicer shall
pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing activities as
herein provided, including expenses of any repossession or remarketing of
Collateral, payment of the premiums for any insurance policy, real property,
personal property and sales taxes on the Collateral, payment of fees and
disbursements of independent certified public accountants and payment of
expenses incurred in connection with reports to Buyer and shall be entitled to
reimbursement for such expenses out of Collections and other Available Funds,
and to the extent such moneys are insufficient, from a remittance from the

due, or (iv) fail generally to pay its debts as they become due, or (v) take
any action (or suffer any action to be taken by its directors or shareholders)
looking to the dissolution or liquidation of Servicer or any Affiliate or
Subsidiary thereof; or

            (f)   ERISA.  Servicer or any member of the Controlled Group shall
fail to pay when due an amount or amounts aggregating in excess of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) which it shall have become liable to pay to the PBGC or
to a Plan under Section 515 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA; or notice of intent
to terminate a Plan or Plans (other than a multi-employer plan, as defined in
Section 4001(3) or ERISA), having aggregate Unfunded Vested Liabilities in
excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) shall be filed under Title IV of
ERISA by the Servicer, any member of the Controlled Group, any plan
administrator or any combination of the foregoing; or the PBGC shall institute
proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to terminate any such Plan or Plans;

then, in the event of any Servicer Default, so long as the Servicer Default
shall not have been remedied, the Buyer may, by notice given to the Servicer,
terminate all of the rights and powers of the Servicer under this Agreement,
including without limitation all rights of the Servicer to receive the
Servicing Fee.  Upon the giving of such notice, all rights and powers of the
Servicer under this Agreement shall vest in the Buyer, and the Buyer is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of the Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments (including
any notices to Obligors deemed necessary or advisable by the Buyer), and to do
or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect such
vesting, and the Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Buyer in effecting the
termination of the Servicer's rights and responsibilities hereunder and shall
promptly provide to the successor servicer appointed under Section 8.02 (the
"Successor Servicer") all documents and records (electronic and otherwise)
reasonably requested to enable it to assume the servicing functions hereunder.

            SECTION 8.02      Buyer to Act; Appointment of Successor. On and
after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 8.01 or in the event of a resignation of the Servicer pursuant to
Section 5.11, the Buyer shall be the successor in all respects to the Servicer
in its capacity as Servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set
forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the responsibilities,
duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms
and provisions hereof, however, that the Buyer shall have no obligation
whatsoever in respect of any liability incurred by the Servicer at or prior to
the time of receipt by the Servicer of said notice.  As compensation therefor
the Buyer shall be entitled to receive any and all funds, including the
Servicing Fee, which the Servicer would have been entitled to receive if the
Servicer had continued to act hereunder.  However, if the Buyer is unable or
unwilling to act as Successor Servicer hereunder, the Buyer may appoint any
Person with a net worth of at least $10,000,000 and whose regular business
includes the servicing of loans similar to the Loans as the Successor Servicer
hereunder in the assumption of all or part of the servicing functions
hereunder.  In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Buyer may
make such arrangements for the compensation of such Successor Servicer from
payments on the Loans and related Property as the Buyer and such Successor
Servicer shall agree; provided, that no such compensation shall be in excess
of that permitted the Servicer hereunder or such amount as is commercially
reasonable at the time in question.  The Buyer and such Successor Servicer
shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary
to effectuate any such succession.

            SECTION 8.03      Effects of Servicing Transfer.  (a)  Upon any
termination of the rights and powers of the Servicer pursuant to either
Section 5.14 or Section 8.01 and the Buyer's succeeding to the rights and
obligations of the Servicer hereunder, the Buyer can unilaterally terminate
this Agreement.

            (b)   Upon any termination of the rights and powers of the
Servicer pursuant to either Section 5.14 or Section 8.01 and the vesting in
either the Buyer or a Successor Servicer of the rights and obligations of the
Servicer as described in Section 8.01 and 8.02, the Servicer shall have no
additional obligations or liabilities for acts or omissions of the Successor
Servicer or otherwise relating to its performance of its obligations under
this Agreement after the date of such termination.

            (c)   Upon the occurrence and continuation of any Servicer
Default, the Buyer shall not be required to pay the Servicer the Servicing
Fee.  Further, upon the occurrence and continuation of a Servicer Default
(other than a Servicer Default under Section 8.01(b)), the Buyer shall not be
required to pay the Guarantor the Guaranty Fee.

been given to Seller by the Buyer; or

failure shall remain unremedied for thirty (30) days after written notice

Section 9.01(c) or this Section 9.01(d) without the petition being dismissed
prior to that time; or

            (e)   Insolvency, Etc.  Either Seller, Guarantor or any Affiliate

Title IV of ERISA to terminate any such Plan or Plans.

            (g)   Servicer Default.  A Servicer Default shall occur and such
Servicer Default would materially and adversely affect the interest of the
Buyer.

            (h)   Termination Event under Existing Loan Purchase Agreement.  A
Termination Event under the Existing Loan Purchase Agreement shall have
occurred and be continuing.

            SECTION 9.02      Consequences of Termination Event.  If any
Termination Event shall occur and be continuing, then in any such case and at
any time thereafter so long as any such Termination Event shall be continuing,
the Buyer may, at its option, immediately terminate the Buyer's commitment to
accept Renewal Notes and to make any Incremental Purchases hereunder.

            In addition, upon the occurrence of any Termination Event

out of Servicer's or Guarantor's insolvency or involvement in a voluntary or
involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, subject to the provisions of Section 10.13,
this Agreement shall automatically and immediately terminate.

occurrence of a Termination Event, the Buyer shall have all remedies provided
by law and without limiting the generality of the foregoing shall have the
following remedies:  (a) the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            SECTION 10.01     Further Assurances.  Each party hereto agrees to
execute and deliver to the other party and to perform all such other acts as
the other party may reasonably request to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees
to endorse without recourse the Note related to any Loan being resold to
Seller pursuant to Articles II, IV or VII, and to execute assignments and
related Uniform Commercial Code financing statements to evidence the
assignment of the Related Documents to Seller.

            SECTION 10.02     Indemnities.      (a)  Seller will defend and
hereby indemnify Buyer and its successors, assigns, servants and agents
(hereinafter "Indemnitees") against and agree to protect, save and keep
harmless and make whole each thereof, from any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits, costs
(including any net increase in the tax liability of an Indemnitee resulting
from its receipt of indemnity payments made under this Section 10.02),
expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, of
whatsoever kind and nature imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or any
of the documents entered into in connection herewith; (ii) the Buyer's
interest in the Loans or related Property purchased or accepted hereunder or
the enforcement of any claims thereunder; (iii) any claim made by any Obligor,
or any other party, related to the Loans or related Property purchased or
accepted hereunder, or the administration of the transactions evidenced by
such Loans and related Property or related to any other transactions between
the Obligors or their affiliates and the Seller or its affiliates; or (iv) any
environmental claim or liability relating to any real property securing any
Loans.

            (b)   The foregoing indemnities with regard to any particular
Indemnitee shall not extend to any liability, obligation, loss, damage,
penalty, claim, action, suit, cost, expense or disbursement (i) that results
from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee or from any
breach of any representation or warranty made by such Indemnitee herein; (ii)
that constitutes any tax based on any Indemnitee's net income, items of tax
preference or gross receipts (except with respect to indemnity payments
hereunder); or (iii) that consists of the failure of any Obligor to pay its
obligations under the Notes as they become due unless such failure results
from a claim of such Obligor against Seller, Guarantor, Servicer or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of any of them, or Buyer otherwise indemnified against
hereunder.  Any indemnity payments required under this Section 10.02 shall be
paid within thirty (30) days following notice thereof from the Indemnitee to
Seller (which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the matter with
respect to which indemnification is required and shall set forth the
computation used in determining the amount of the indemnity payment).  All of
the rights and privileges of each Indemnitee under this Section 10.02, and the
rights, privileges and obligations of Seller hereunder, shall survive the
expiration or other termination of this Agreement.

            SECTION 10.03     No Waiver:  Remedies Cumulative.  No failure by
the Seller or Buyer to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power
or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power, or remedy.  The rights and remedies provided herein
are cumulative and not exclusive of any right or remedy provided by law.

            SECTION 10.04     Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

            SECTION 10.05     Consent to Jurisdiction:  Waiver of Immunities. 
The Buyer and Seller hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the District of Columbia or the State of
Oregon in any action or proceeding brought to enforce or otherwise arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and irrevocably waive to the fullest extent
permitted by law any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue in any such action or proceeding in any such forum, and hereby
further irrevocably waive any claim that any such forum is an inconvenient
forum.  The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

            SECTION 10.06     Notices.  All notices and other communications
provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing or (unless otherwise
specified) by telex, telegram or cable and shall be sent for next Business Day
delivery to each party at the address set forth under its name on the
signature page hereof, or at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to each other party.  Except as otherwise specified,
all such notices and communications if duly given or made shall be effective
upon receipt.

            SECTION 10.07     Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective Successors
and assigns.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party may assign or otherwise
transfer all or any part of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment or
transfer purported to be made without such consent shall be ineffective.  In
addition, Buyer may not sell the Loans and related Property or participations
therein without the consent of the Seller, except that by executing this Loan
Purchase and Servicing Agreement, Seller shall be deemed to have consented to
the sale and assignment of the Loans and related Property to NCB Retail
Finance Corporation, a special purpose corporation established by Buyer.

            SECTION 10.08     Capital Markets Funding.  Seller hereby agrees
to cooperate with Buyer in making such modifications to this Agreement and the
Related Documents, in executing such other documents and certificates, in
causing to be prepared and delivered such opinions, certificates, financial
reports and letters, and in taking such other actions, including changing
accounting firms, as are reasonably necessary to achieve capital markets
funding of the Loans and the related Property or to improve the execution of
such funding.

            SECTION 10.09     Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall as to such
jurisdiction be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties waive
any provision of law which renders any provision hereof prohibited or
unenforceable in any respect.

            SECTION 10.10     Attorney's Fees.  In the event it is necessary
for any party hereto or its Successors or assigns to institute suit in
connection with this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing party in
such suit shall be entitled to reimbursement for its reasonable costs,
expenses and attorney's fees incurred including fees incurred on any appeal.

            SECTION 10.11     Setoff.  In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Termination
Event or Servicer Default, Buyer is hereby authorized by Seller at any time,
without notice to Seller, to set off and to appropriate and to apply to the
amounts then owed by Seller or Servicer hereunder or by Guarantor under the
Guaranty Agreement, as the case may be, to Buyer any and all deposits (general
or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by
certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust
accounts) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by Buyer to
Seller.

            SECTION 10.12     Limitation on Third Party Beneficiaries.  No
provision, warranty, representation, or agreement herein, whether express or
implied, is intended to or shall be construed as conferring upon any Person
not a party hereto (including, without limitation, any Obligor) any rights or
remedies whatsoever.

            SECTION 10.13     Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the reduction of the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Loans (including Liquidated Loans as to which there
remain unpaid Liquidation Losses) to zero or (ii) the date on which this
Agreement is automatically terminated following the occurrence of any of the
specified Termination Events pursuant to Section 9.02; provided, however, that
(a) the rights accrued to the Buyer prior to such termination, (b) the
obligations of the Guarantor under the Guaranty Agreement and (c) the
indemnification provisions set forth in Section 10.02 shall be continuing and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

            SECTION 10.14     Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement
comprises the entire agreement of the parties and may not be amended or
modified except by written agreement of the parties hereto.  No provision of
this Agreement may be waived except in writing and then only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

            SECTION 10.15     Headings.  The headings of the various
provisions of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not
constitute a part hereof, and shall not affect the meaning or construction of
any provision hereof.

            SECTION 10.16     Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
any number of identical counterparts, any set of which signed by all parties
hereto shall be deemed to constitute a complete, executed original for all
purposes.

In order to induce Buyer to purchase the Loans, Guarantor hereby agrees to
provide the following guaranties:

            (a)   Guarantor hereby agrees to provide to the Buyer a Guaranty

Following (i) the earlier of (A) the collection of all Liquidation Proceeds,
Insurance Proceeds and other amounts with respect to a Defaulted Loan and (B)
a Defaulted Loan being deemed a Liquidated Loan, and (ii) determination of
Liquidation Loss thereon (which in the case of a Defaulted Loan deemed a
Liquidated Loan may be the full Principal Balance of such Loan), the Buyer
shall notify Guarantor of the amount of Liquidation Loss and, within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of such notice, Guarantor shall make a Guaranty
Payment to the Buyer in the amount of such Liquidation Loss; provided,

Payment and the Servicing Fee.  Upon the occurrence and continuation of a
Servicer Default under the Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement (other than a
Servicer Default under Section 8.01(b) thereof) or a Guarantor Default, the
Guarantor shall no longer be entitled to receive the Guaranty Fee.


                                  ARTICLE III

                   GUARANTOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            Section 3.01      Guarantor Representations and Warranties.  The
Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees as follows as of each
Closing Date and as of the date of execution of this Agreement:

            (a)   The Guarantor is duly organized and is validly existing and
in good standing as an Oregon corporation, with corporate power and authority
to own its properties and to transact the business in which it is now engaged;
the Guarantor is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
State of the United States where the nature of its business requires it to be
so qualified; and the Guarantor is doing business only under the corporate and
"doing business as" names listed on Exhibit F to the Holdback Loan Purchase
Agreement.

            (b)   The performance of Guarantor's obligations under this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will
not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of,
or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of Guarantor or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement (other than this Agreement)
or instrument to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it
or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of its property or assets
is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of
its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any statute or any order, rule
or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction
over it or any of its properties; and no consent, approval, authorization,
order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any such
regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body is required for the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (c)   This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Guarantor and this Agreement is the valid and legally binding
obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its
terms, subject as to enforcement to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general principles of equity.

            (d)    The Guarantor is "eligible" in Section 3015 to borrow from

            (e)   Except as described in Exhibit A hereto, there are no
actions, proceedings, investigations, or claims against or affecting Guarantor
now pending before any court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority (nor
to the knowledge of Guarantor has any thereof been threatened nor does any
basis exist therefor) which if determined adversely to the Guarantor would be
likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
operations of Guarantor or on Guarantor's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.  With respect to the litigation described in Exhibit A
hereto, a determination in such litigation that is materially adverse to the
Guarantor would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition
or operations of Guarantor or on Guarantor's ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

            (h)   Member Notes Receivable Ratio.  To maintain on a

leased or subleased property to any of Guarantor's Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
members for a payment obligation at least equal to Guarantor's on the first
lease or sublease and the Subsidiary, Affiliate or member is current on its

compensation, unemployment insurance, social security or similar laws or made
to secure the performance of bids, tenders, contracts (except for the
repayment of borrowed money) or leases, or to secure statutory obligations or

bonds given in the ordinary course of business.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the total amount secured by all such liens, security interests or
other encumbrances shall not at any time exceed 15% of Guarantor's
Consolidated Net Tangible Assets as of such time.  "Consolidated Net Tangible
Assets" shall be, on a consolidated basis, the difference between total assets
and current liabilities, excluding, however, from the determination of total
assets (i) all assets which should be classified as intangible assets (such as
good will, patents, trademarks, copyrights and franchises) and (ii) to the
extent not already deducted from total assets, all reserves including those
for deferred income taxes, depreciation, obsolescence or amortization of
properties and (iii) all capital stock or other investments by the Guarantor

dissolve or enter into any merger, consolidation, joint venture, partnership
or other combination nor sell, lease, dispose of such portion of its business
or assets (excepting sales of goods in the ordinary course of business and
sales of Loans under this Agreement) as constitutes a substantial portion
thereof provided, however, so long as no Termination Event or event which with
the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a
Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing or will occur as a
result of such merger or consolidation, Guarantor may merge or consolidate
with any Person or sell all or substantially all of its business or assets to
any other Person so long as (A)(1) the Guarantor shall be the surviving or
continuing corporation, or (2) if the Guarantor shall not be the surviving or
continuing corporation or shall sell substantially all of its assets to a
Person, such surviving, continuing or purchasing Person shall be incorporated
under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction thereof and shall
assume in writing all obligations of the Guarantor under this Agreement, shall
be eligible to borrow form NCB under the provisions of the Bank Act and shall
satisfy the financial covenants set forth in clauses (g), (h), (i) and (k) of
this Article IV, and (B) at the time of such consolidation, merger or sale and
after giving effect thereto, no Termination Event shall have occurred and be
continuing.  Without limitation on the foregoing, the Guarantor, and its
consolidated subsidiaries, will not during any four consecutive calendar
quarters sell in excess of 10% of their Consolidated Net Tangible Assets
unless the proceeds of such sale or sales are reinvested within 12 months in
assets to be owned and utilized by the Guarantor in the ordinary course of its
business; provided, however, in determining compliance with the foregoing
requirement, sales of the following assets will be disregarded:  (a)

Affiliates, on terms that are less favorable to Guarantor than those which
might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates.

            (n)   ERISA Compliance.  To not and not allow any member of its
Controlled Groups or any Plan of any of them to: (i) engage in any "prohibited
transaction" as such term is defined in Section 4.06 or Section 2003(a) of
ERISA; (ii) incur any "accumulated funding deficiencies" (as such term is
defined in Section 3.02 of ERISA) whether or not waived; (iii) terminate any
Pension Plan in a manner which could result in the imposition of a lien on any
property of the Guarantor, or any member of its Controlled Group pursuant to

            (o)   Subordinate Position.  To (i) make or own (including a

Buyer under the Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement and (ii) own no corporation
or other business entity that makes loans to any Obligor or member of its
Obligor Group if such Obligor's or members repayment obligation on such loan

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 6.01      Further Assurances.  Each party hereto agrees to
execute and deliver to the other party and to perform all such other acts as
the other party may reasonably request to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

            Section 6.02      Indemnities.  (a) Guarantor will defend and
hereby indemnify Buyer and its successors, assigns, servants and agents
(hereinafter "Indemnities") against and agree to protect, save and keep
harmless and make whole each thereof, from any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits, costs
(including any net increase in the tax liability of an Indemnitee resulting
from its receipt of indemnity payments made under this Section 5.02), expenses
and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, of whatsoever kind
and nature imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee in any
way relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement, the Holdback Loan
Purchase Agreement, or any of the documents entered into in connection with
any of them; (ii) the Buyer's interest in the Loans or related Property
purchased or accepted under the Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement or the
enforcement of any claims thereunder; (iii) any claim made by any Obligor, or
any other party, related to the Loans or related Property purchased or
accepted hereunder, or the administration of the transactions evidenced by
such Loans and related Property or related to any other transactions between
the Obligors or their affiliates and the Seller or its affiliates; or (iv) any
environmental claim or liability relating to any real property securing any
Loans.

            (b)   For any claims arising against United Resources, Inc. in its
capacity as the Servicer, the Guarantor will defend and hereby indemnify the
Buyer, its directors, officers, employees and agents, against any and all
costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities in respect of any
grossly negligent action taken by, or grossly negligent omission of, the
Servicer with respect to its servicing obligations under the Loan Purchase
Agreement.

            (c)   The foregoing indemnities with regard to any particular
Indemnitee shall not extend to any liability, obligation, loss, damage,
penalty, claim, action, suit, cost, expense or disbursement (i) that results
from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee or from any
breach of any representation or warranty made by such Indemnitee herein; (ii)
that constitutes any tax based on any Indemnitee's net income, items of tax
preference or gross receipts (except with respect to indemnity payments
hereunder); or (iii) that consists of the failure of any Obligor to pay its
obligations under the Notes as they become due unless such failure results
from a claim of such Obligor against Seller, Guarantor, Servicer or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of any of them, or Buyer otherwise indemnified against
hereunder.  Any indemnity payments required under this Section 6.02 shall be
paid within thirty (30) days following notice thereof from the Indemnitee to
Guarantor (which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the matter with
respect to which indemnification is required and shall set forth the
computation used in determining the amount of the indemnity payment).  All of
the rights and privileges of each Indemnitee under this Section 6.02, and the
rights, privileges and obligations of Guarantor hereunder, shall survive the
expiration or other termination of this Agreement.

            Section 6.03      No Waiver:  Remedies Cumulative.  No failure by
the Guarantor or Buyer to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power, or remedy.  The rights and remedies provided herein
are cumulative and not exclusive of any right or remedy provided by law.

            Section 6.04      Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

            Section 6.05      Consent to Jurisdiction:  Waiver of Immunities. 
Guarantor and Buyer hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any state
or federal court sitting in the District of Columbia or the State of Oregon in
any action or proceeding brought to enforce or otherwise arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and irrevocably waive to the fullest extent
permitted by law any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue in any such action or proceeding in any such forum, and hereby
further irrevocably waive any claim that any such forum is an inconvenient
forum.  The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

            Section 6.06      Notices.  All notices and other communications
provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing or (unless otherwise
specified) by telex, telegram or cable and shall be sent for next Business Day
delivery to each party at the address set forth under its name on the
signature page hereof, or at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to the other party.  Except as otherwise specified,
all such notices and communications if duly given or made shall be effective
upon receipt.

            Section 6.07      Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective Successors
and assigns.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantor may not assign or
otherwise transfer all or any part of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment or transfer purported to be made without such consent shall be
ineffective.  In addition, Buyer may, however, sell, assign or transfer the
Loans and related Property which are the subject of the guaranties provided
herein without the consent of the Guarantor.  Further, the Guarantor agrees to
recognize any such buyers or assignees as successors and assigns of the Buyer
hereunder, with all rights of the Buyer hereunder.

            Section 6.08      Capital Markets Funding.  Guarantor hereby
agrees to cooperate with Buyer in making such modifications to this Agreement,
in executing such other documents and certificates, in causing to be prepared
and delivered such opinions, certificates, financial reports and letters, and
in taking such other actions, including changing accounting firms, as are
reasonably necessary to achieve capital markets funding of the Loans and the
related Property or to improve the execution of such funding.

            Section 6.09      Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall as to such
jurisdiction be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties waive
any provision of law which renders any provision hereof prohibited or
unenforceable in any respect.

            Section 6.10      Attorney's Fees.  In the event it is necessary
for any party hereto or its Successors or assigns to institute suit in
connection with this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing party in
such suit shall be entitled to reimbursement for its reasonable costs,
expenses and attorney's fees incurred including fees incurred on any appeal.

            Section 6.11      Setoff.  In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Termination
Event or Servicer Default, Buyer is hereby authorized by Guarantor at any
time, with notice to Guarantor, to set off and to appropriate and to apply to
the amounts then owed by Guarantor hereunder or the Seller or Servicer under
the Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, to Buyer any and all
deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness
evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not
including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing
by Buyer to Guarantor.

            Section 6.12      Limitation on Third Party Beneficiaries.  No
provision, warranty, representation, or agreement herein, whether express or
implied, is intended to or shall be construed as conferring upon any Person
not a party hereto (including, without limitation, any Obligor) any rights or
remedies whatsoever.

            Section 6.13      Continuing Agreement.  This Guaranty Agreement
is a continuing agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until the
Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement and the Existing Loan Purchase Agreement
shall have terminated and all of United Resources' obligations under the
Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement and the Existing Loan Purchase Agreement have
been satisfied; provided, however, that if the Holdback Loan Purchase
Agreement and the Existing Loan Purchase Agreement are terminated pursuant to
Section 9.02 of the Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement and Section 10.02 of the
Existing Loan Purchase Agreement, respectively, then the Guarantor's
obligations under this Guaranty Agreement shall survive the termination of the
Holdback Loan Purchase Agreement and the Existing Loan Purchase Agreement; and
provided further, that (a) the rights accrued to the Buyer prior to
termination of this Agreement and (b) the indemnification rights set forth in
Section 6.02 hereof shall be continuing and shall survive termination of this
Guaranty Agreement.

            Section 6.14      Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement
comprises the entire agreement of the parties and may not be amended or
modified except by written agreement of the parties hereto.  No provision of
this Agreement may be waived except in writing and then only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

            Section 6.15      Headings.  The headings of the various
provisions of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not
constitute a part hereof, and shall not affect the meaning or construction of
any provision hereof.

            Section 6.16      Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
any number of identical counterparts, any set of which signed by the parties
hereto shall be deemed to constitute a complete, executed original for all
purposes.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amended
and Restated Guaranty Agreement to be executed by their respective officers or
agents thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.
