Item 1. Business

     The registrant, United Grocers, Inc.  ("United" or "the Company"), a
wholesale grocery distributor, is an Oregon business corporation organized in
1915 which operates and is taxed as a cooperative.

     The Company supplies groceries and related products to independent
retail grocers located in Oregon, western Washington and northern California. 
United's goal is both to supply grocery products to retailers at prices which
enable them to compete effectively in the retail market, and to furnish them
other services, such as marketing assistance, engineering, accounting,
financing and insurance, which are important to the successful operation of a
retail grocery business.

     United also sells groceries and related products at wholesale through 30
Cash and Carry depots, principally to nonmember grocers, restaurants and
institutional buyers.  

     Consolidated revenues by principal product lines and services appear in
the following table:

     United and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Grocers Insurance Group, Inc.,
Grocers Insurance Agency, Inc., Grocers Insurance Company, UGIC, Ltd.,
United Workplace Consultants, Inc., Western Passage Express, Inc., United
Store Development, Ltd., Northwest Process, Inc., Western Security Services,
Ltd., Premier Consulting, Inc., United Resources, Inc., U.G. Resources, Inc.,
and B.A.T. Enterprises, Inc. provide a variety of services to members.

Marketing and Distribution

  Independent retail grocers within United's market area are eligible to
apply for membership.  All applicants for membership are subject to approval
by United's Board of Directors on the basis of financial responsibility and
operational ability.  On approval, applicants are required to purchase shares
of United's common stock.  United has approximately 250 members operating a
total of approximately 360 retail grocery stores.  

  Members receive periodic order guides indicating the price and availability
of various merchandise.  Members select the desired merchandise and place
their orders using United's computerized order system.  The merchandise is
picked up by the member or delivered by truck to the member's retail
facility.  

  No member or other customer of United accounts for as much as 10 percent of
its sales.  Management believes that the loss of any one or a few of its
members or other customers would not have a material effect on its business
or financial condition.

  Members are eligible to join United's group advertising programs.  Members
of advertising groups all do business under the group name, advertise items
jointly, are assessed fees for group marketing services, and take part in
group promotional programs.  Each advertising group has its own coordinator
and acts independently in passing upon applications of membership within the
group and deciding on promotional and advertising programs.
 
  United's Cash & Carry wholesale outlets provide a convenient, low cost
method of purchasing groceries and institutional products for non-member
grocers, restaurants, and institutional buyers.  Cash & Carry customers
select their merchandise at the outlet much in the same manner that a
customer at a retail grocery store would.  Cash & Carry customers provide
their own transportation.

Supplies

  United purchases goods from a wide variety of sources ranging from local
farmers to large multinational corporations.  United attempts to obtain the
lowest possible price by pooling the buying power of its members.  United is
not dependent on any single supplier and the loss of any single supplier
would not have a material effect on its business.

  United is one of the five stockholders of Western Family Holding Company, a
corporation which pools the buying power of its stockholders in order to
obtain lower cost merchandise.  Purchases from Western Family Holding
Company, which account for about 11% of United's total purchases, are
distributed under labels such as "Western Family", and "Cottage."

<PAGE>
Retail Services

  United provides a number of retail services to its members.  Services which
do not carry a specific fee or charge include marketing information,
merchandising assistance, competitive retail price reporting and
developmental services such as store site selection, design and engineering.

  United also offers its members, at a fee, complete bookkeeping, accounting
and tax services for their retail operations.  A computerized payroll service
is also available. Other miscellaneous retail services which generally carry
a scheduled fee assessment include customized retail pricing, retail shelf
"unit pricing", and retail information service products.

  United, where appropriate, leases retail space and subleases the space to
qualified members to enable them to obtain prime commercial space.  At
September 30, 1994, United was obligated on 45 such leases.  Each such
sublease requires that the sublessee pay all charges which may be incurred by
United.  Lease insurance guaranteeing payment of rent in the event of default
covers a substantial amount of the lease payments. United's subsidiary UGIC,
Ltd. provides lease insurance for twenty-one such subleases.  See "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information on these
subleases.

Finance Services

  United's subsidiary, United Resources, Inc., makes loans and provides other
financial services to members.  Loans to members are generally made at one
and three quarters to two and one quarter percentage points over the prime
interest rate.  Such loans generally are for terms of one to ten years.  Loan
funds are obtained under a loan agreement with two commercial banks and a
note purchase agreement with National Consumer Cooperative Bank  at rates
varying with market interest rates. At September 30, 1994, the aggregate
principal amount of member loans outstanding due the subsidiary was
$37,512,122.  The subsidiary's interest income for the year then ended was
approximately $ 3,090,000.  In the normal course of its activities, United
Resources, Inc. acquires retail stores through foreclosure or purchase and
operates them on a temporary basis.  United Resources owned four such stores
at September 30, 1994. During 1994, United Resources acquired five stores
through foreclosure and disposed of eight stores through sale or closure.

Insurance Services
Overview

  Grocers Insurance Group, Inc. was formed on October 25, 1990, and is a
holding company for United's insurance related subsidiaries.  Grocers
Insurance Group, Inc. assists in marketing insurance related services offered
by those subsidiaries.

     Grocers Insurance Agency, Inc., is an insurance agency offering
property, crime, workers' compensation, group life, group health and other
types of insurance.  Sales of insurance, although primarily made to members,
are also made to nonmembers.  Commissions earned totaled approximately
$804,000 for the year ended September 30, 1994.

  Grocers Insurance Company (GIC), formerly United Employers Insurance Co.,
writes insurance policies for property and casualty, workers' compensation
and other types of insurance and provides some reinsurance services. 
Premiums earned during 1994 decreased slightly to $24.6 million, from $24.9
million in 1993.  GIC operates as a specialty insurer, concentrating on
grocery stores and related businesses for a customer base.  Currently
licensed in 19 states located primarily in the western region of the United
States, GIC has applications pending in several additional states,
concentrated in the Midwest.

       UGIC, Ltd. provides some reinsurance services for property and
casualty insurance and workers' compensation and provides underwriting for
lease insurance. Total written premiums for 1994 was $363,000.

       United Workplace Consultants, Inc. offers rehabilitation
services to insurance companies, principally those owned by United. Total
revenue for the year ended September 30, 1994 was $451,000.

     Affiliated General Agency, Inc., purchased by Grocers Insurance Agency,
Inc., in 1993 was closed during 1994.

Insurance Operations

     The following analysis of insurance operations is limited to Grocers
Insurance Company, the significant underwriting subsidiary of the Company.

Premiums Written

     An analysis of the GIC's premiums written during the last three years is
shown in the following table.
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                         $000
          Direct    ReinsuranceReinsuranceNet
Year Written   Assumed   Ceded     Written
<C>   <C>      <C>       <C>       <C>
1992 $23,862   $1,183    $5,067    $19,978
1993  24,431      716     6,597     18,550
1994  23,992      861     6,652     18,201

</TABLE>

     The three states accounting for the largest amounts of direct premiums
written for the year ending September 30, 1994 were Oregon with 41%,
California with 22%, and Washington with 15%. No other state accounted for
more than 5% of such premiums. In 1994, there were no significant changes in
business, geographic mix or types of risks assumed.

Underwriting Results

     A commonly used industry measurement of property and casualty insurance
underwriting results is the combined loss and expense ratio. This ratio is
the sum of the ratio of net incurred losses and related loss adjustment
expenses to net premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of underwriting
expenses to premiums written (expense ratio). Underwriting results are
generally considered profitable when the combined ratio is under 100%. The
industry computes this ratio on a calendar year statutory accounting basis
for comparison purposes. The loss ratio, expense ratio, and combined ratio
for GIC for the last three calendar years are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>      

          Loss           Expense        Combined
Year      Ratio          Ratio          Ratio
<C>       <C>            <C>            <C>       
1991      84.1%          22.0%          106.1%
1992      79.1%          21.6%          100.7%
1993      89.6%          13.0%          102.6%

</TABLE>

These ratios compare to industry composite combined ratios of 107.6% for
1991, 114.6% for 1992, and 105.5% for 1993.

     There have been no unusually large gains or losses from underwriting or
investment operations during the year ending September 30, 1994. There are no
effects from currency fluctuations, since all of GIC's business is transacted
within the United States.

Claims Operations

     GIC establishes estimates for reported claims on an individual case
basis. Fast track types of reserving methods are not used. The estimates are
based on GIC's experience within the grocery industry and specific knowledge
of facts regarding each individual claim. These estimates are reviewed on a
regular basis or as additional information becomes available.

     Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) reserves are established for claims
which have occurred but are not yet reported to GIC as well as future
development on reported claims. IBNR estimates are principally derived from
analysis of historical patterns of development of both paid and incurred
losses by line of business and accident years. Independent professional
actuaries are engaged on an annual basis to analyze the overall reserving
accuracy of GIC. IBNR's account for approximately 42% of GIC's total unpaid
claims and claim adjustment expenses.

     Net Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses (LAE) for the last three
fiscal years are:

1994       22,968         4,671     27,639   (2.7)

</TABLE>

For additional historical information on loss reserve development and
reconciliation of claims reserves, please refer to Appendix 1 and Appendix 2
to this report.

     During the year ending September 30, 1994, GIC adjusted reserves
recorded in prior years downward by approximately 3%, due to generally
favorable settlements on established case estimates for prior years claims
and an actuarially determined decrease in development factors previously used
in setting IBNR estimates.

     There have been no other significant changes in reserving assumptions.
GIC does not typically use structured settlements of any materiality.

Reinsurance

     In order to write policies above statutory limits, GIC reinsures limits
above $100,000 for all risks. Multiple layers of reinsurance treaties are
placed with upper limits of $20 million for workers' compensation and
liability exposures, and limits of up to $3 million for property risks.
Facultative reinsurance is purchased for property risks written with limits
above $3 million.

     GIC utilizes a reinsurance intermediary for assistance in the design and
placement of reinsurance coverage. The structure of the reinsurance program
may vary slightly from year to year, but has remained essentially the same
since 1989. Treaties are primarily placed on an excess basis, with an
additional share treaty used for property risks. Current reinsurers on these
main working layers are all rated A- or better by A.M. Best.

     GIC has not entered into any portfolio loss transfers or other types of
financial transactions involving loss reserves.

Risk Based Capital

     The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted,
effective December 31, 1994, a risk based capital formula for property and
casualty companies which will be used by insurance regulators in assessing
the capital adequacy of insurance companies. The formula computes a required
level of capital based on the risks assumed by the insurer. Various
regulatory actions are then prescribed if a company's ratio falls below its
minimum level. The actions range from requiring the insurer to submit a
comprehensive action plan to the state of domicile to placing the insurer
under regulatory control.

     The ratio for GIC as determined at December 31, 1993 was significantly
above the levels which would require regulatory action.

IRIS Ratios

     The NAIC produces an annual evaluation, the Insurance Regulatory
Information System (IRIS), utilizing data from the statutory annual
statements filed as of each December 31 with the state insurance departments.
The report is intended to assist regulators in analysis of the financial
conditions of insurers and to aid in targeting troubled companies. IRIS
identifies eleven industry values and specifies "unusual values" for each
ratio that falls outside a pre-determined range. Regulators use the "unusual
value" designation as an indication of potential problems.

     GIC had no ratios designated as an "Unusual value" in its IRIS Report
for the year ended December 31, 1993.

A.M. Best Ratings

     A.M. Best Company,Inc. ratings are indications of the solvency of an
insurer and are derived from analysis of the financial conditions and
operations of a company relative to the insurance industry in general. The
1993 A.M. Best letter ratings range from A++ ("Superior") to F ("In
Liquidation"). GIC applied for an initial rating in 1991 and was rated a B+.
In 1993, GIC was upgraded to a B++ rating, with a financial size category of
V. 

     GIC believes that the attainment of an "A" rating would have a favorable
impact on the marketing of its policies and accordingly makes a significant
number of underwriting and operational decisions with this goal in mind.


Other Services

  Western Passage Express, Inc. provides freight services to United and
others.  Northwest Process, Inc. provides store displays, advertising
materials, and printing services.  U. G. Resources, Inc. leases retail space
which is subleased to member store operators. Two new subsidiaries, Western
Security Services, Ltd. and Premier Consulting, Inc.,provide various security
and employment management services.

Competition

     The grocery industry is characterized by intense competition.  In order
to compete effectively, a wholesale grocer must have the ability to meet
competitive market prices which fluctuate rapidly, provide a wide range of
perishable and nonperishable products, make prompt and efficient delivery and
provide the peripheral services which are required by modern supermarket
operations.

     United believes that it accounts for a larger volume of sales of
groceries than any other wholesaler in its grocery marketing area, which is
comprised of Oregon, the northernmost part of California and western
Washington.  United's principal competitors are two national grocery
wholesalers (which because of their operations in other areas are larger than
United) and three regional grocery wholesalers.

     Other competitors include a number of local grocery wholesalers, many of
whom are limited to special product lines, such as candy or produce, or sell
only to limited market segments, such as restaurants or institutions.  United
also competes with a significant number of producers which market their
products directly to retailers and with several chain store organizations
which control both their wholesale and retail operations.  United's
competitors range from small local businesses to businesses significantly
larger than United. Based on information available to it, United estimates
that its members, many of whom are in competition with one another, account
for approximately 20% of the retail grocery market within United's marketing
area.  Although members are free to purchase from sources other than United, 
members generally purchase goods (except goods which United does not supply, 
such as beer and wine) principally from United.  United does not account for
a significant percentage of the national wholesale grocery market.

     Recently, competition in the markets served by the Company's customers
has increased significantly.  Warehouse and club format stores have gained
overall strength and are involved in major expansion activities.  Direct
distributors of certain product lines (produce, general merchandise, etc.)
are becoming more aggressive in attempting to direct business away from the
Company.  The Company has responded with new programs to be more price
competitive and has increased item selection and variety in several product
areas.  The Company's recent warehouse expansion project at its Portland
facility was designed to increase its capabilities in frozen food, deli
items, general merchandise/housewares and specialty items to support its new
program strategies. Further, the Company's new member volume allowance
program has been designed to share the savings associated with larger order
efficiencies from its member stores, thereby reducing the participating
member's cost of product.

     Recent trends in the results of the Company's member stores have
continued. In general, members outside major metropolitan areas, and those
operating newer stores, price oriented or super store formats registered
various gains in volume.  Members operating average sized conventional stores
generally registered small volume losses overall.       Like the grocery
industry, the insurance industry is highly competitive. Grocers Insurance
Group is well positioned to serve the retail food industry. Due to its
specialization in the retail food business, Grocers Insurance Group generally
operates on lower expense ratios than most of its competitors, allowing it to
offer competitive prices for its policies.

Employees

     United employs approximately 1,700 persons.  Approximately 880 of its
employees are members of Teamster or other unions.  Collective bargaining
contracts with the unions are negotiated through an employer association to
which United and other major food distributors in its marketing area belong. 


     United considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.

Environment and Energy

     United's operations are not of a type which ordinarily result in the
discharge of significant quantities of pollutants.  United believes that its
operations substantially meet or exceed all applicable environmental
regulations.

     United has, for a number of years, maintained a program of collecting
waste paper products from its members and from its own operations.  This
waste paper is then sold to a paper company for recycling.  Members
participating in this program receive weekly credits reflecting their
participation in the program.

     United primarily uses electricity in the operation of its warehouses and
diesel fuel in the operation of its truck fleet.  United believes that it has
adequate sources of supply to meet its anticipated energy needs.  United's
energy suppliers have indicated that, because of the nature of United's
business, it would be entitled to priority in the event of any future energy
shortages.

Cost Savings

     By pooling the buying power of its members, United is able to purchase
goods in large quantities at prices lower than the prices generally available
to independent retail grocers.  The savings from the bulk purchases are
passed along to members in the form of rebates, allowances and patronage
dividends.

     Sales to members are invoiced to their accounts at prices contained in
United's order guide.  A partnership incentive program results in the
addition or subtraction of a percentage of the member's weekly invoice cost
based on the member's average weekly purchases by department for the
preceding four weeks, excluding purchases of drop shipments.  The partnership
incentive percentages are designed to reflect the economies of scale realized
by United in servicing various sized accounts.

     Rebates and allowances are paid to members periodically based upon their
purchases of particular items or their promotional and advertising
performance.  Generally, such rebates and allowances stem from United's
margins and the merchandising or promotional programs of United's suppliers. 


     United also pays its members annual patronage dividends based on the
overage, or excess of revenues over expenses, on sales to members for the
year.  Each year United's board of directors determines the portion of the
overage which is to be distributed as patronage dividends.  Decisions
concerning the portion of the overage to be retained are based upon various
factors including United's future capital needs and the amount of earnings
available from operations not qualifying for distribution as patronage 
dividends.  The patronage dividends are allocated among the members in
proportion to the contribution to United's gross profit (before rebates and
allowances) attributable to their purchases from United.  The patronage
dividends are paid partly in cash and partly in Membership Stock.

Government Contract Business

     The Company does not generate significant business based upon contracts
with local, state or federal government entities.

<PAGE>
Income Taxes

     United operates and is taxed as a cooperative.  Accordingly, patronage
dividends are not included in United's taxable income but are instead taxed
to the individual members receiving the patronage dividends.  The Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code") requires that not less than 20
percent of each member's patronage dividend be paid in cash.  United's
patronage dividend policy meets that requirement, providing for cash payments
of up to 100% of dividends based on ratios of the value of stock holdings by
member stores to their average weekly purchases, and total number of shares
of stock owned.  Patronage dividends not paid in cash are paid in additional
Membership Stock.  Members are required to agree to abide by all United's
bylaw provisions, including those applicable to federal income taxation of
patronage dividends.  Accordingly, members must report as taxable income the
total amount of patronage dividends, whether paid in cash or Membership
Stock, in the year such patronage dividends are received, and such amounts
are not taxable to United.  

     United is taxed on income which does not qualify for distribution as
patronage dividends and on the portion of overage which is not distributed to
members.  United's subsidiaries retain all profits (or losses) from their
operations and are part of the consolidated federal income tax return.

Item 2.  Properties

     United owns and operates two distribution centers.  Its main
distribution center, located in Milwaukie, Oregon, contains over 815,000
square feet of warehouse space situated on a 62-acre site, owned by United. 
Also at this location are 84,900 square feet of office space, a 20,000 square
foot truck repair shop and a 114,000 square foot frozen food distribution
center.

     United's southern Oregon Division distribution center, located in
Medford, Oregon, contains approximately 200,000 square feet of warehouse
space, plus related office and maintenance areas.

     United's distribution center warehouses are of modern, one-floor,
sprinklered, concrete construction.  The warehouses are subject to various
mortgages, the terms of which are summarized in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.  

     United and its subsidiaries operate a truck fleet consisting of 141
tractor cabs and 300 dry freight and refrigerated semitrailers, including
both owned and leased units.

     United leases a mainframe computer, together with related peripheral
equipment, under various leases expiring in April, 1997.  The leases calls
for annual rental of approximately $836,500.

     United leases the facilities described in the following table for Cash
and Carry outlets at an aggregate annual rent of approximately $2,000,000. 
Most of the leases contain renewal options.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

      During fiscal year 1994, net sales and operations increased 8.8% to
$954.2 million. This compares to a 2.2% decrease in fiscal year 1993 to
$877.0 million. Income before members' allowances, patronage dividends, and
taxes increased $2.1 million to $22.7 million (2.38% of sales). This compares
to $20.6 million (2.35% of sales) and $20.7 million (2.31% of sales) in 1993
and 1992, respectively.

      During 1994, the increase in net sales and operations was primarily
attributable to the distribution segment which enjoyed increased warehouse
unit volume, increased Cash & Carry unit volume, and increased equipment unit
sales. These gains in sales were offset by lower premium income of the
insurance segment.

      In 1994, the Company generated increased profits within its
distribution segment from the Cash & Carry and service income areas. Within
the insurance segment, Grocers Insurance Company increased its profitability
despite lower premium income,  mainly through the benefit of reduced loss and
loss adjustment expenses, which was partially offset by higher operating
expenses. The profit improvements in 1994 were offset by higher distribution
segment operating expenses, and increased member allowances paid ($2.0
million increase to $11.5 million) and operating losses in retail store
operations ($4.5 million in 1994 compared to $2.2 million in 1993).

      During 1993, the decrease in net sales and operations was primarily
attributed to a 52 week accounting period, lower warehouse unit sales, and
lower levels of store financing interest income, which were partially offset
by increased service income, insurance segment written premiums, and sales
from retail store operations. The Company enjoyed increased profits in 1993
within the distribution segment's Cash & Carry and service income areas.
Within the insurance segment, Grocers Insurance Company increased its
profitability due to premium volume, increased investment income, and reduced
operating expenses. These profit improvements were more than offset by
increased member allowance payments and operating losses in retail store
operations.

NET SALES AND OPERATIONS

      During 1994, sales of the Company's distribution segment increased
8.14% to $888.9 million compared to $822 million in 1993. The sales gain was
primarily attributable to an increase in unit volume. Inflation during 1994
impacted net sales by 1.0% of warehouse sales.

      Member distribution sales increased due to additional new stores for
existing members, and acquisition of new member business. Management expects
the recent trend in increased retail store development to continue in 1995,
as several members are planning additional new stores.

      Cash & Carry sales increased 15.3% to $179.4 million compared to $155.6
million in 1993. Sales at new units contributed 6.4% to the sales increase.
The balance of the increase was due primarily to higher unit sales volume at
existing stores.

      Sales at company-owned retail stores, which are acquired as a result of
store finance activities, increased $4.9 million to $46.2 million. During
1994, the company disposed of eight retail stores, and acquired five stores,
decreasing the number of retail stores to four.

      In 1994, the insurance segment's net insurance premiums, commissions,
and fees decreased by $1.7 million to $18.8 million. The decrease was
primarily attributed to lower commissions earned by the insurance segment's
Grocers Insurance Agency.

      During 1993, the Company's distribution segment sales declined 3.6 %
compared to 1992.  When compared to a 52 week period in 1992, the 1993 sales
decline was 1.9%.  Inflation during 1993 added approximately 0.8 % to sales.

      During 1993, a consumer trend towards lower cost items had a negative
impact on distribution segment sales.  Cash & Carry sales increased slightly,
reflecting new store sales, while interest income declined, reflecting lower
interest rates during the 1993 year when compared to 1992.

      Retail store sales increased $16.1 million in 1993, reflecting a net
increase of two stores during the year. 

      In 1993 the insurance segments's net insurance premiums, commissions,
and fees increased by $0.9 million over the 1992 total.  The increase was
attributable to increased policy volume and rehabilitation fees, partially
offset by lower commission levels and increased reinsurance premiums paid.

GROSS OPERATING INCOME

      Gross operating income increased to $137.5 million (14.4% of sales) in
1994 from $127.5 million (14.5% of sales) in 1993 and $123.7 million (13.8%
of sales) in 1992. The increase in gross operating income occurred due to
increased unit volume, and the continued shift in distribution segment's
sales mix towards Cash & Carry operations. 

      Improving trends in loss development experience in the insurance
segment also increased gross operating income. In 1994, loss and loss
adjustment expenses were 64.7% of total premium income, compared to 83.3% and
75.5% in 1993 and 1992 respectively.   

OPERATING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      In 1994, operating, selling, and administrative expenses increased $6.0
million to $103.5 million (10.9% of sales).  These expenses amounted to $97.5
million (11.1% of sales) and $93.5 million (10.4% of sales) in 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The components of these expenses are summarized below:

</TABLE>

      In 1994, operating, selling, and administrative expenses as a percent
of sales decreased primarily due to increased unit volume in the distribution
segment. Increased labor productivity resulting from these unit volume
increases was partially offset by increases in other operating expense areas,
notably supplies and transportation operating expenses and other taxes.

      Insurance segment operating expenses increased to 36.3% of segment
income. The increase was primarily attributed to increased personnel costs,
other taxes,  and building expenses associated with the new insurance
building. In 1993 and 1992, insurance segment operating expenses were 26.4%
and 28.1% of segment sales, respectively.

      Provision for doubtful accounts was $2.0 million (0.2% of sales) in
1994. This compares to $2.2 million (0.3% of sales) and $2.1 million (0.2% of
sales) in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

      Interest expense increased  $0.9 million to $9.2 million (1.0% of
sales) in 1994. This increase was due to higher levels of average debt during
the year, as well as a higher average interest rate.

MEMBER ALLOWANCES AND DIVIDENDS

      In 1994, total member allowances and dividends increased 9.9% to $20.2
million (2.1% of sales). In 1993, total allowances and dividends increased
4.0% to $18.4 million.

      Total member allowances and dividends as a percent of member sales
increased to 2.84% in 1994, compared to 2.75% and 2.53% in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

      The Company's updated member allowance program was in place during all
of 1994, and management expects that the level of member allowances as a
percent of member sales should remain at approximately 1994 levels in future
years.

NET INCOME AND INCOME TAXES

      In 1994, income before income taxes was $2.6 million (0.3% of sales)
compared to $2.3 million (0.3% of sales) and $3.1 million (0.3% of sales) in
1993 and 1992, respectively.

      The Company's effective tax rate increased to 39.0% from 25.2% in 1993
and 29.2% in 1992. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily caused by
decreased tax refunds as a result of carrybacks that were utilized in 1993. 
In 1994, net income after income taxes decreased to $1.6 million (0.2% of
sales) from $1.7 million (0.2% of sales) and $2.7 million (0.3% of sales) in
1993 and 1992, respectively. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS

      In 1994, the Company used $2.8 million in cash in its operating
activities. Increases in accounts receivable as a result of additional member
stores and member volume, and investments by the Company in its new
information services platform were the major factors contributing to the use
of cash in operations.  The Company offset these uses of cash by increasing
patronage dividends payable with stock and increases in accounts payable.

CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

      In 1994, the Company used $16.3 million in its investing activities, a
decrease of $8.6 million from the $24.9 million used in 1993. Cash
requirements of the Company's retail member finance activities were reduced
in 1994 due to the substitution of a new Note Purchase Agreement during the
year. Purchases of property and equipment were reduced to $5.3 million from
$12.0 million in 1993. These favorable cash flow results were offset by
reduced proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, and equity
investments in certain affiliated companies.

      In fiscal year 1995, anticipated capital expenditures will approximate
$8.0 million, representing $3.0 million in replacement assets, $2.0 million
for new Cash & Carry units, and $3.0 million in continuing investments in
upgraded operations software. In addition, the Company could undertake
certain acquisitions to enhance its distribution segment businesses.

CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

      In 1994, the Company provided $13.3 million from its financing
activities by increasing its levels of senior debt to fund its operations,
and the purchase of its new insurance building.

      In 1994, the Company's capital structure shifted towards greater use of
senior debt capital, due to lower interest costs and increased funding needs.
The present components of the capital structure are within the Company's
long-term targets for funding sources.

      Subsequent to September 30, 1994, the Company executed a Note Agreement
with an insurance company lender.  Proceeds of the senior, unsecured debt
were $20 million.  The proceeds were used to retire bank debt.  The term of
the note is eleven (11) years.  The note carries a fixed rate of 8.42 %.

      In 1994, the Company's working capital increased $3.5 million to $45.3
million. The Company's main sources of funds include earnings, member capital
stock, capital investment notes, bank debt, private placement debt,and note
purchase programs. As of September 30, 1994, the Company had $19.0 million in
unused credit lines available. In addition, the Company had $12.6 million
available under its Note Purchase Agreement.

      Grocers Insurance Company investments are held to support the payment
of claims. These investments are not available to the Company to meet its
capital needs due to restrictions imposed by insurance regulators regarding
intercompany loans and advances. 

      In addition, state regulators require that Grocers Insurance Company
maintain minimum amounts of capital  and surplus.  As a result of these
regulatory requirements, $3.4 million of Grocers Insurance Company's equity
may not be paid as dividends to the Company.

                        INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
Grocers, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and October 1, 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1994. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Grocers,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and October 1, 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for reinsurance in 1993-94.  Also, as
discussed in Notes 4 and 7, the Company changed its method of accounting for
inventories in 1992-93 and for income taxes in 1991-92.

                    UNITED GROCERS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1994


1.   Summary of significant accounting policies

     a.   Reporting year

          United Grocers, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) reports on a
          fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks which is the fiscal year of the
          distribution segment.  The Company's fiscal closing date is the
          Friday nearest September 30.  The fiscal year of the subsidiaries
          included in the insurance segment is September 30.

     b.   Organization

          As a cooperative, the Company's stock is owned by its member
          customers.  Sales to these members account for approximately 80% of
          wholesale grocery sales.

     c.   Principles of consolidation

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
          United Grocers, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as follows: 
          Grocers Insurance Group, Inc., Grocers Insurance Agency, Inc.,
          UGIC, Ltd., Grocers Insurance Company (formerly United Employers
          Insurance Co.), United Workplace Consultants, Inc., Western Passage
          Express, Inc., United Store Development, Ltd., Northwest Process,
          Inc., UG Resources, Inc., United Resources, Inc., Affiliated
          General Agency, Inc., Premier Consulting, Inc. (formerly Employee
          Management Services, Inc.), Western Security Services, Ltd. and BAT
          Enterprises, Inc.  All intercompany balances and transactions have
          been eliminated upon consolidation.  Investment in affiliated
          companies is stated at cost plus the Company's share of
          undistributed earnings since acquisition (see Note 17).

     d.   Inventories and cost of sales

          Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of
          all inventories is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
          method.  See Note 4 for change in accounting for inventories.

          Cost of sales includes the cost of distribution and insurance
          operations.  The distribution operation costs include the purchases
          of product, the net of allowances paid and received on purchases,
          less the net advertising department margins, plus the handling
          allowances made to members based upon the cost of servicing their
          accounts.  The insurance operation costs include losses reported, a
          provision for losses incurred but not reported and premium refunds.

     e.   Treasury stock

          The Company uses the par value method of accounting for treasury
          stock.  Under Oregon corporation law, treasury stock must be
          canceled upon redemption.

     f.   Investments

          Investments are primarily in non-equity securities and as such are
          carried at cost.  The Company's intent is to hold these securities
          until maturity.  Sales and redemptions of investments are primarily
          the result of maturities.  Any realized gains or losses are usually
          the result of immaterial differences between the called amount and
          amortized cost.  The market value of these investments at September
          30, 1994 and October 1, 1993 is $36,487,841 and $36,464,552,
          respectively.  

     g.   Property, plant and equipment

          Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost and includes
          expenditures for new facilities and those which substantially
          increase the useful lives of the existing plant and equipment.  The
          Company capitalizes interest as a component of the cost of
          significant construction projects.    During the year ended October
          1, 1993 and October 2, 1992, interest was capitalized in the amount
          of $64,929 and $578,611, respectively, out of a total interest of
          $8,281,946 and $9,303,377, respectively, which resulted in an
          increase in the net income of approximately $49,000 and $410,000.  

          Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
          estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Estimated useful
          lives are generally as follows:

               Buildings                40 - 75 years
               Building improvements    Balance of building life
               Warehouse equipment      5 - 20 years
               Truck equipment          3 -  8 years
               Office equipment         5 - 10 years

     h.   Amortization

          Long-term liability loan costs, software costs, and non-competition
          agreements are being amortized and charged to operating expenses on
          a straight-line basis over five to twenty years.

     i.   Reinsurance

          In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the
          loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause
          unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of
          risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises
          or reinsurers.  Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated
          in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the
          reinsured policy.  Amounts paid for prospective reinsurance are
          reported as prepaid reinsurance premiums and amortized over the
          remaining contract period in proportion to the amount of insurance
          protection provided.

     j.   Income taxes

          The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income
          tax return.  The Company operates and is taxed as a cooperative. 
          Accordingly, amounts distributed as patronage dividends are not
          included in its taxable income but are instead taxed to the
          individual members receiving the patronage dividends.  Deferred
          income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future
          years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
          liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end. 
          No valuation allowances were considered necessary to reduce
          deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  See
          Note 8 for details of timing differences and Note 7 for change in
          accounting method.
<PAGE>
     k.   Earnings per common share

          The Company's policy is to distribute earnings only in the form of
          patronage dividends.  No dividends have ever been declared on the
          common stock of the Company, and all earnings not distributed as
          patronage dividends have been retained.  Earnings per common share
          are not shown because no earnings are available for the purpose of
          paying dividends on the common stock.

     l.   Statement of cash flows

          For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers
          all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
          three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     m.   Restricted assets and net assets

          Restricted assets and net assets that may not be transferred to the
          parent company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends by
          the insurance company subsidiary without the consent of various
          state insurance agencies as of September 30, 1994 are as follows:

               Cash and cash equivalents          $   725,000
               Investments                         15,370,300
                                                  -----------
                    Total                         $16,095,300

   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
   Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  The Company plans to
   adopt this Statement in 1995 and does not anticipate any significant
   change as a result of this Statement on the present accounting for
   investments.

   The notes receivable from members are generally for periods of two years
   to ten years at interest rates of 4.25% to 10.00%.  The annual
   maturities for each of the next five fiscal years following September
   30, 1994 are as follows:

          Year                            Amount  
          ----                         -----------

   The provision for doubtful accounts and notes charged to operating
   expenses for the three years ended September 30, 1994 amounted to

4. Change in accounting for inventories

   Effective October 3, 1992, the Company changed its method of accounting
   for the cost of the general wholesale grocery category of inventories
   from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out
   (FIFO) method.  The Company believes that the use of the FIFO method
   better matches current costs with current revenues and more
   appropriately reflects its financial condition.  This change has also
   been made for income tax purposes.

   The change has been applied retroactively and comparative amounts for
   prior periods have been restated.  The effect of this change on retained
   earnings and net income for restated 1991-92 is as follows:

7. Change in accounting for income taxes

   The Company adopted, effective September 28, 1991, the Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income
   Taxes, issued in February, 1992.  Under the method specified by SFAS No.
   109, the deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the
   difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
   liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect
   when these differences reverse.  Deferred tax expense is the result of
   changes in the liability for deferred taxes.  The principal types of
   differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and
   tax return purposes are accumulated depreciation, insurance loss
   reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, and capitalized costs in
   inventory.

   The deferred method, used in the years prior to 1992, required the
   Company to provide for deferred tax expense based on certain items of
   income and expense which were reported in different years in the
   financial statements and the tax returns as measured by the tax rate in
   effect for the year the difference occurred.

   As allowed by SFAS No. 109, the Company did not restate the years prior
   to the year ended October 2, 1992 and, accordingly, the cumulative
   effect of the accounting change on the prior years of $526,314 is
   included in the earnings for the year ended October 2, 1992.

8. Income taxes

   The provision for income taxes for the three years consists of the

    The Company has net operating loss carryovers of approximately
    $3,500,000 to apply against future years' State income taxes,
    expiring in years 2007 through 2009.  These operating loss carryovers
    are the result of the insurance company subsidiary being required to
    file a separate calendar year State tax return and not giving the
    parent the benefit of this offset on its State tax return.  The
    Company also has unused State energy tax credits of approximately
    $45,000, expiring in 1998. 

9.  Members' patronage dividends

    The Company's income from sales to members, before income taxes and
    patronage dividends, is available at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, to be returned to the members in the form of patronage
    dividends.  As of year end, the Board of Directors voted to
    distribute the following in patronage dividends:

10. Notes payable - bank

    Notes payable - bank consists of borrowings on bank lines of credit
    at an average interest rate of 5.72% at September 30, 1994 and 3.95%
    at October 1, 1993.

    At September 30, 1994 and October 1, 1993, the Company had unused
    lines of credit totaling $19,000,000 and $10,300,000, respectively;
    and unused letters of credit totaling $350,000 and $450,000,
    respectively.

    In April of 1993, the Company entered into a three year reverse
    interest swap agreement with a bank.  Under the agreement, the
    Company receives a fixed rate of 4.40% on $20 million (notional
    amount) and pays a floating rate based on LIBOR, as determined in six
    month intervals.  The transaction effectively changes a portion of
    the Company's interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a floating
    rate basis, accordingly, all gains or losses have been recognized as
    adjustments to interest expense.  This swap agreement has been
    entered into with a major financial institution which is expected to
    fully perform under the terms of the agreement thereby further
    mitigating the risk from the transaction.

11. Long-term liabilities

    Long-term liabilities at the balance sheet date consist of the
    following:
                                                  1994         1993

        to 5.89% in 1994 and from 3.94%  
        to 4.78% in 1993.                     $ 35,000,000 $ 25,000,000

    The Company's bank loan agreements require the maintenance of certain
    financial ratios and a minimum amount of capital and subordinated
    debt.  The Company was in compliance with these requirements as of
    September 30, 1994 and October 1, 1993.

12. Reinsurance

    The Company in 1994 adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
    Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts, issued in December, 1992. 
    The Statement requires that transactions relating to reinsurance
    transactions be reported at gross amounts rather than net amounts.

    The effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company is
    to gross up the insurance liabilities by reclassifying the ceded
    reinsurance amounts for reinsurance recoverables and prepaid
    reinsurance premiums as assets.  The change had the effect of
    increasing 1993 total assets and total liabilities by $4,741,852 as
    follows:

<PAGE>
    Increase in current assets:
     Reinsurance recoverables for ceded
      loss reserves - now classified as
      accounts and notes receivable                   $3,494,121
     Prepaid reinsurance premiums - now

    Increase in current liabilities:
     Insurance reserves                               $3,494,121
     Unearned premiums - classified

                                                      ==========

    There is no effect or change to the consolidated income statement as
    the income statement classifications did not change.  Net premiums
    earned continue to be reported as net sales and operations while net
    losses and loss adjustment expenses continue to be reported as cost
    of sales.

    Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligation
    to policyholders.  Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations
    could result in losses to the Company.  The Company evaluates the
    financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of
    credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, activities, or
    economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimize its exposure
    to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.  The Company holds
    collateral under related reinsurance agreements in the form of
    letters of credit totaling $338,000 that can be drawn on for amounts
    that remain unpaid for more than 60 days.

    Reinsurance amounts reflected in the financial statements are as

13. Segment reporting

    The Company has two operating segments which are located primarily in
    the Pacific Northwest.  The distribution segment includes all
    operations relating to wholesale grocery and related product sales,
    retail grocery sales, service department revenues, and financing
    income and fees.  The insurance segment includes all operations
    relating to insurance underwriting, commissions, and reinsurance
    primarily to provide workers' compensation and property-casualty
    coverage.

    A summary of information about the Company's operations by segment
    before intersegment eliminations for the three years is as follows:

    For net sales and operations, wholesale grocery sales (primarily to
    members) during the three years ended September 30, 1994 accounted
    for approximately 95%, 93% and 95%, respectively, of the distribution
    total.  Premium revenue (primarily from members) accounted for
    approximately 95%, 90% and 86%, respectively, of the insurance total.

    The change in the method of accounting for inventories (Note 4)
    related to and affected only the distribution segment.

14. Pension plans

    The Company has a Company-sponsored pension plan that covers
    substantially all of its salaried employees.  The Company also has
    separate Company-sponsored 401(k) plans for salaried and union
    employees.  The Company has made annual contributions to the plans
    equal to the amount annually accrued for pension expense.  The
    Company's funding policy is to satisfy the funding requirements of
    the Employees' Retirement Income Security Act.

    The Company also participates in several multi-employer pension plans
    for the benefit of its employees who are union members.  The data
    available from administrators of the multi-employer plans is not
    sufficient to determine the accumulated benefit obligation, nor the
    net assets attributable to the multi-employer plans in which the
    Company union employees participate.

    The financial statements include pension expense for the Company-
    sponsored pension plan as determined using Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 87 (SFAS 87).  The effect of SFAS 87 was a
    decrease of pension expense in the amount of $546,894 for 1994,
    $484,020 for 1993, and $317,193 for 1992.  The Company's unrecognized
    net asset resulting from the initial application of SFAS 87 is being
    amortized over eighteen years.
                                                              
    In determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
    obligation, a discount rate of 8% and a future maximum compensation
    increase rate of 4% were used.  The expected long-term rate of return
    on assets was 8%.

    Pension costs for all plans for the three years consist of the
    following: 
                                        1994         1993         1992

    In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides health benefits
    for certain retired salaried employees.  The Financial Accounting
    Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits Other Than
    Pensions."  This statement will require accrual of such benefits during
    the years an employee provides services.  The costs of these benefits
    are currently expensed on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The cost of this
    retiree health care is funded out of current operations and was
    approximately $356,000 in 1994, $282,000 in 1993 and $257,000 in 1992. 
    The impact of this new standard has not been fully determined, but the
    change likely will result in a greater liability and expense being
    recognized for these benefits.  The Company has until 1995-96 to adopt
    this Statement because fewer than 500 employees will be affected.  

15. Leases

    The Company is obligated under one hundred and five significant leases
    in 1994.  Forty-five of these leases are for twenty to twenty-five
    years with renewal options and involve supermarket properties which are
    subleased to members.  Twelve of these leases are subleased to
    affiliated companies.  The remaining leases represent property and
    equipment used by the Company.  The leases expire at various dates, the
    last expiring in 2013.  Rental expense for the three years consists of
    the following:

                                        1994         1993         1992

    (A) Minimum payments are those required by the Company over the terms
        of the significant leases.

    (B) Minimum receipts are those to be received by the Company from
        sublease agreements.

            Twenty-one of the subleases as of September 30, 1994, are
            insured by the Company's foreign subsidiary, UGIC, Ltd.  The
            annual rental for these leases is approximately $2,440,000. 
            The total minimum payments over the lease term for these same
            leases is approximately $54,100,000.

    In 1992 and 1991, the Company entered into sale-leaseback
    transactions for three cash and carry outlets.  The sales resulted in
    deferred gains of approximately $800,000 which are being amortized
    over the leaseback period of fifteen years.  The total lease
    commitments are approximately $2,500,000 over fifteen years with an
    annual rental of approximately $155,000 for each of the first five
    years.

                                 -----------  -----------  ----------- 
       Purchases                 $89,179,000  $70,334,000  $71,994,000
       Volume incentive rebate     1,561,000    1,231,000    1,260,000  
       Open accounts payable       6,006,000    5,150,000    4,000,000

    The Company in 1994 made an approximately 22% minority equity
    investment of $6,094,315 in the retail store operations of two
    members.  The Company's share of losses in these operations in 1994
    was $217,000.  Transactions with these two members for the short
    periods in 1994 were sales of approximately $22,945,000 and open
    accounts receivable as of September 30, 1994 were approximately
    $1,860,000.

    UGIC, Ltd. paid cash dividends to the Parent in 1992 in the amount of
    $500,000.

18. Concentrations of credit risk

    The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents in several banks
    located in the Pacific Northwest and a zero balance bank account
    located in the Midwest.  Each bank is covered by FDIC insurance;
    balances in excess of coverage are not insured.

    As a cooperative, the majority of the Company's accounts receivable
    represent sales to its members who are located throughout the Pacific
    Northwest.  These accounts are not generally secured by collateral
    but each member has stock holdings in the Company as well as
    patronage rebates which the Company could apply against account
    balances.

    The Company makes store financing loans to members from time to time
    mainly to finance the acquisition of grocery store properties and
    equipment.  These loans are represented by notes receivable which are
    secured by collateral consisting of personal property, securities and
    guarantees.

    The insurance subsidiaries have investments primarily in federal
    securities and state municipal bonds which are backed by the full
    faith and credit of the respective governmental agency.

19. Commitments and contingencies
                             
    a.  During 1994, 1991 and 1990, the Company entered into agreements
        under which it sold and continues to sell certain of its notes
        receivable from members subject to limited recourse provisions. 
        These are secured by collateral which usually consists of
        personal property, securities and guarantees.  The Company is
        responsible for collection of the notes, for which it receives a
        collection fee, and remits the net proceeds to the purchaser on a
        monthly basis.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company sold notes
        totaling approximately $8,625,000, $900,000 and $5,800,000,
        respectively.  The balances of transferred notes that were
        outstanding and subject to recourse provisions were $13,652,000,
        $13,441,000 and $20,934,000 at September 30, 1994, October 1,
        1993 and October 2, 1992, respectively.
    
    b.  In connection with its loan activities to members, the Company
        has approved loan applications totaling approximately $8,000,000
        for which funds have been committed, but not disbursed, as of
        September 30, 1994.

    c.  The Company is guarantor of a covenant by a member as of
        September 30, 1994 totaling $350,000 with annual principal
        payments of approximately $50,000.

    d.  The Company is a party to various litigation and claims arising
        in the ordinary course of business.  While the ultimate effect of
        such actions cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company
        expects that the outcome of these matters will not result in a
        material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
        position or results of operations.

          For good consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by
each of the undersigned parties, the parties agree as follows:

          1.   Amendments to Agreement.

           c.   Section 4.01 is amended to read as follows:

           4.01  The Revolving Line Commitments.  The Revolving Line Banks
      each severally agree on the terms and conditions of this Agreement to
      make Advances (the "Revolving Advances") in the principal amount equal
      to 50% of the Total Revolving Line Commitment (such Bank's "Revolving
      Line Commitment") available to Borrower from time to time on any

      ending on the earlier of the Maturity Date, or the termination of the
      Commitment pursuant to Section 9.01 (the "Revolving Line Commitment

           As this Commitment is for a revolving line of credit, Borrower may
      receive Advances, repay them, and receive additional Advances at all

      the Revolving Advances outstanding at any one time from the Revolving
      Line Banks does not exceed the Total Revolving Line Commitment, and no
      Default or Incipient Default shall have occurred.  All Revolving
      Advances shall be made by the Revolving Line Banks through Seafirst, as

      respective Revolving Line Commitments bear to the Total Revolving Line
      Commitment, and all repayments shall be made through Seafirst, as
      agent, in accordance with Section 6.11.  In no event shall any Bank be

      Advances (the "Operating Advances") in the principal amount equal to
      50% of the Total Operating Line Commitment (such Bank's "Operating Line
      Commitment") available to Borrower from time to time on any Banking Day
      during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the
      earlier of the Maturity Date, or the termination of the Commitment
      pursuant to Section 9.01 (the "Operating Line Commitment Period").

           As this Commitment is for a revolving line of credit, Borrower may
      receive Advances, repay them, and receive additional Advances at all
      times until the applicable Maturity Date as long as the aggregate of
      the Operating Advances outstanding at any one time from the Operating
      line Banks does not exceed the Total Operating Line Commitment, and no
      Default or Incipient Default shall have occurred.  All Operating
      Advances shall be made by the Operating line Banks through Seafirst, as
      agent, pro rata in the same proportion that the Operating line Banks'
      respective Operating Line Commitments bear to the Total Operating Line
      Commitment, and all repayments shall be made through Seafirst, as
      agent, in accordance with Section 6.11.  In no event shall any Bank be
      required to have aggregate Operating Advances outstanding at any one
      time in excess of its Operating Line Commitment. 

           e.   Fixed Charge Coverage.  Section 7.10 of the Agreement is

director or officer of such Person.  The term "control" means the possession,
directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise.

     "Applicable Rate" shall mean during each Interest Accrual Period, a per

date and for the period reflected in the related Obligor Group Financial
Statements, the consolidated ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (a) EBITDA
to (b) Cash Interest Expense plus CPLTD; provided that if the Obligor Group
has taken on new debt which is not reflected on the Obligor Group Financial

debt or loan and related interest expense.

     "Cash Interest Expense" shall mean, for any period, gross interest
expense for such period determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (other than

Loans as debtors) to be filed or recorded in all such appropriate places as
are required to protect the Buyer's interest in such Loans and such other
Property, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing statements or
other evidence of such filings to the Buyer.  Seller and Buyer agree that
with respect to each Loan, Related Document and item of Primary Collateral,
Seller will make all filings and take all such other actions necessary to
perfect Buyer's first priority security interest therein, and, with respect
to each item of Collateral which is not Primary Collateral, Seller will make
all filings and take all such other actions necessary to perfect Buyer's
security interest therein to the same level of priority enjoyed by the Seller
at the time of the Incremental Purchase of the related Loan.

          (d)  It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that each
conveyance of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Property
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a purchase and sale and not a
loan.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the conveyance of the Property to
the Buyer hereunder is characterized by any third party as a pledge, the
parties intend that Seller shall be deemed hereunder to have granted to the
Buyer a first priority perfected security interest in all of Seller's right,
title and interest in, to and under the Loans, the Notes, the related
Collateral and Related Documents, and all monies due or to become due with
respect thereto after the applicable Cut-Off Date, and that this Agreement
shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.

          (e)  If the Buyer determines that any documents or documents
constituting a part of a Loan File are missing or defective (that is,
mutilated, damaged, defaced, incomplete, improperly dated, clearly forged or
otherwise physically altered) with respect to any Loan in any respect which
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Buyer, then the Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller, whereupon Seller shall have a period of 30
days, within which to correct or cure any such defect.  If any such material
defect has not been corrected or cured in all material respects as described
below, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller will, as
of the end of such 30th day (or earlier if Seller elects), repurchase the
related Loan from the Buyer at a price equal to the sum (without duplication)
of (i) the Principal Balance of such Loan as of the first day of the Due
Period following the Due Period during which such repurchase occurs, (ii) the
aggregate amount of all Monthly Payments on such Loan due on or prior to the
last day of the Due Period during which such repurchase occurs not previously
made by the Obligor or advanced by or on behalf of the Servicer (including by
the Guarantor pursuant to the Advance Guaranty) and (iii) the amount of any
outstanding Advances and Guaranty Payments pursuant to the Advance Guaranty
made in respect of such Loan (the "Purchase Amount").  The Purchase Amount
shall be paid by Seller to the Servicer in immediately available funds by the
last day of the Due Period during which such repurchase obligation arises
and, upon receipt by the Servicer of such deposit, the Servicer shall release
or cause to be released to Seller the related Loan Files and shall execute
and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such instruments of
transfer or assignment of such Loan, the security interest in the related
Property, in each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as
Seller shall reasonably request (as shall be prepared by and at the expense
of Seller).  It is understood and agreed that the obligation of Seller to
repurchase any Loan as to which a material defect in a constituent document
exists and to make the related payments as described in this Section 2.01(e)
shall, together with the indemnification rights contained in Article 11.02
and the right of Buyer to be reimbursed for reasonable fees and expenses
incurred in effecting this repurchase, constitute the sole remedies against
Seller with respect to such defective Loan available to the Buyer.

     SECTION 2.01A  Incremental Purchase.  (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Seller may at any time prior to June 30, 1994 (or such
later date as is approved by Buyer) sell to the Buyer and the Buyer shall
purchase from the Seller certain identified Loans and Property related
thereto (each, an "Incremental Purchase"); provided, however, that no
Incremental Purchase shall be for a principal amount of less than $3,000,000
(other than the final Incremental Purchase which may be in such lesser amount
as agreed to by Buyer) and provided further, that the Buyer shall not be
obligated to make an Incremental Purchase (or any portion thereof) to the
extent such Purchase (or any portion thereof), together with all previous
Incremental Purchases, would exceed the Maximum Purchase Amount.

          (b)  The Seller shall provide the Buyer with written notice of its
intention to request an Incremental Purchase in the form of Exhibit L hereto
no later than ten (10) Business Days before each Incremental Purchase and
shall provide the Buyer with at least five (5) Business Days to review the
Loan Files relating to each Incremental Purchase.  Upon satisfaction of all
terms and conditions contained herein, Buyer shall pay to the Seller the
Purchase Price of each Incremental Purchase on the applicable Closing Date.

     SECTION 2.02   Agreement to Accept Renewal Notes.  (a)  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including delivery of the Renewal
Notes and satisfaction of the other delivery and filing requirements set
forth in Section 2.01 hereof no later than five (5) Business Days before the
applicable Renewal Date, and upon at least 30 days' written notice from
Seller, the Buyer agrees to accept on any Renewal Date such Renewal Loans as
Seller shall have caused Obligors of the related Prior Notes to execute and
deliver.

          (b) The parties to this Agreement intend that the conveyance of
each Renewal Loan and related Property by Seller and acceptance thereof by
Buyer shall constitute a purchase and sale and not a loan.

          (c) If any document or documents constituting part of a Loan File
relating to a Renewal Loan are missing or defective as described in section
2.01(e) hereof, the Buyer shall have the same rights against Seller as
provided in such Section 2.01(e).

                                 ARTICLE IV

                       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     SECTION 4.01   Seller's Corporate Representations and Warranties. 
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of each Closing Date and as of any
Renewal Date as follows:

          (a)  Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oregon, is doing business
only under the corporate and "doing business as" names listed in Exhibit A
hereto, and is qualified to do business in each other jurisdiction where the
conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties requires such
qualification, and has full corporate power, authority and legal right to
carry on its business as presently conducted, to own and operate its
properties and assets, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to
sell the Loans and related Property.

          (b)  The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of this
Agreement and any assignment, the endorsement the Notes and the sale of any
Loans, related Notes and Related Documents and the security interest in the
related Collateral hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action of Seller, do not require any shareholder approval or the
approval or consent of any trustee or the holders of any Debt of Seller,
except such as have been obtained (certified copies thereof having been
delivered to Buyer), do not contravene any law, regulation, rule or order
binding on it or its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws and do not
contravene the provisions of or constitute a default under any indenture,
mortgage, contract or other agreement or instrument to which Seller is a
party or by which Seller or any of the Loans, related Notes or Related
Documents may be bound or affected.

          (c)  No Government Approval or filing or registration with any
Governmental Authority is required for the making and performance by Seller
of this Agreement or any assignment or the endorsement of the Notes or in
connection with the sale of the Loans and related Property contemplated
hereby, except such as have been heretofore obtained and are in full force
and effect (certified copies thereof having been delivered to Buyer).

          (d)  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller
and constitutes, and any assignment and any endorsement of a Note when duly
executed and delivered will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with its
terms.

          (e)  Except as described in Exhibit I hereto, there are no actions,
proceedings, investigations, or claims against or affecting Seller now
pending before any court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority (nor to
the knowledge of Seller has any thereof been threatened nor does any basis
exist therefor) which if determined adversely to the Seller would be likely
to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of
Seller or on Seller's ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, or under any Assignment or under an endorsement of any Note.  With
respect to the litigation described in Exhibit I hereto, a determination in
such litigation that is materially adverse to the Seller or Guarantor would
not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations
of Seller or on Seller's ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, or under any assignment or endorsement of any Note.

          (f)  The consolidated balance sheet of the Seller and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries at October 1, 1993, and the related statements of
income and retained earnings of Seller and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries
for the fiscal year then ended, copies of which have been furnished to Buyer,
fairly present the financial condition of Seller and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries as at such date and the results of operations of Seller and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries for the period then ended, all in accordance with
U.S. GAAP consistently applied.  Since that date, there has been no material
adverse change in the financial condition or operations of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

          (g)  Seller has good and marketable title to each of the properties
and assets reflected in its balance sheet referred to in Section 4.01(f)
except such as have been since sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business.

          (h)  Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates is in
material breach of or default under any agreement or agreements to which it
is a party or which are binding on it or any of its assets and which provide
for the payment of monies, the delivery of goods or the provision of services
in amounts or with values in the aggregate in excess of Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($250,000).

          (i)  The present value of all benefits vested under all Pension
Plans did not, as of the most recent valuation date of such Pension Plans,
exceed the value of the assets of the Pension Plans allocable to such vested
benefits by an amount which would represent a potential material liability of
Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries or affect materially the ability of
the Seller to perform this Agreement; no Plan or trust created thereunder, or
any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 or Section 2003(a) of
ERISA) which could subject such Plan or any other Plan, any trust created
thereunder, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing
with any Plan or any such trust to the tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 502 or Section 2003(a) of ERISA; no Pension
Plan or trust created thereunder has been terminated, and there have been no
"reportable events" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) since
the effective date of ERISA; no Pension Plan or trust created thereunder has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in
Section 302 of ERISA) whether or not waived, since the effective date of
ERISA; and the required allocations and contributions to Pension Plans will
not violate Section 415 of the Code.

          (j)  Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been duly
filed in all places where filing is necessary and all other or additional
acts have been taken as are necessary to perfect the Buyer's interests
arising hereunder and under the assignments in and to the Loans and related
Property and the lien created hereby constitutes a valid and perfected lien
of first priority in and to all of the Loans and related Property (other than
in Collateral which is not Primary Collateral, in which case the Buyer has
only such interest as the Seller had and disclosed to the Buyer on the
applicable Closing Date and other than Seller's security interest in its
capital stock and patronage dividends) and is enforceable against all third
parties (other than third parties whose interests in Collateral which is not
Primary Collateral are prior to Seller's interests therein on the applicable
Closing Date) in all jurisdictions as security for all obligations of the
Seller to the Buyer under this Agreement.

          (k)  Seller has good and marketable title to the Loans and related
Notes designated for sale to the Buyer hereunder, the Related Documents and
the proceeds thereof, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and Seller
has not transferred in any manner whatever to any Person (other than Buyer)
and has not created or permitted any lien, pledge, charge, security interest,
ownership interest, participation interest or any other interest of any
nature whatever (other than in favor of the Buyer) in respect of the Loans,
the related Notes, the Related Documents or the proceeds thereof.

          (l)  Seller's chief executive offices and the offices where such
Seller keeps records concerning the Loans and related Property are located at
6433 S.E. Lake Road, Portland, Oregon or such other location to which such
offices are moved pursuant to Section 6.01(m) hereof.

          (m)  This Agreement, the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01(f) and all other instruments, documents, certificates and
statements furnished to the Buyer by the Seller, taken as a whole, do not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein
not misleading.

          (n)  Seller is "eligible" to borrow from NCB under the provisions
of the Bank Act.

     SECTION 4.02   Seller's Closing Date Representations and Warranties with
respect to Loans.  Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of each Closing
Date with respect to Loans transferred and sold on such Closing Date as
follows:

          (a)  The information with respect to each Loan set forth in the
Loan Schedule, together with any documentation supporting such information,
is true and correct;

          (b)  With respect to each Loan, there exists only one original
Note.  Such original Note and all of the other original or certified
documentation set forth in Sections 2.01 and 3.03 (including all material
documents related thereto) has been or will be delivered to the Buyer on the
applicable Closing Date;

          (c)  Each Loan was originated in the United States and Monthly
Payments on such Loan are payable in U.S. Dollars by an Obligor domiciled in
the United States;

          (d)  Each Note will have a Loan Interest Rate that is either (i) a
fixed rate of at least 7.5% per annum (except for those Loans listed on
Schedule II hereto (as the same may be supplemented upon subsequent
Incremental Purchases) which shall have fixed Loan Interest Rates of at least
5.99%) or (ii) a variable rate based on the Prime Rate, adjusted either
monthly or semi-annually, plus at least 100 basis points;

          (e)  Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment herein
contemplated, the applicable Seller held good and indefeasible title to, and
was the sole owner of, each Loan conveyed by Seller, subject to no liens,
charges, mortgages, encumbrances or rights of others or other liens which
will be released simultaneously with such transfer and assignment; and
immediately upon the transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the Buyer
will hold good and indefeasible title, to, and be the sole owner of, each
Loan subject to no liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances or rights of
others;

          (f)  Seller shall have received at least three (3) (or in the case
of a Full Recourse Loan, twelve (12)) scheduled principal payments before the
applicable Cut-Off Date;

          (g)  As of the applicable Cut-Off Date, no Loan is delinquent
(after giving effect to any applicable grace period) in payment and, as of
the applicable Closing Date, no Loan shall have had an individual payment
delinquent (after giving effect to any applicable grace period) for periods
in excess of 31 days on 2 or more separate occasions;

          (h)  The Loan is not subject to any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, nor will the
operation of any of the terms of the related Note, Related Document or any
related Collateral, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either
the related Note, Related Document or any related Collateral unenforceable in
whole or in part, or subject to any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and so such right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect
thereto;

          (i)  Each Loan at the time it was made complied and, as of the
applicable Closing Date, complied in all material respects with applicable

Policy;

          (k)  Except as noted on Schedule II, the Notes executed by any one
Obligor (or other Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or

of the Seller, shall have an aggregate outstanding balance of less than
$1,500,000;

          (l)  At least one of the Obligors with respect to each Loan (i) is
a member in good standing of United Grocers, Inc. and (ii) to the best of

          (m)  Except for any Loan identified on Schedule II (as the same may
be supplemented upon subsequent Incremental Purchases) hereof, each Loan has
a remaining amortization period of no less than 24 months and no greater than
84 months;

          (n)  The Note related to each Loan provides that the principal be
amortized monthly over the term of such Note, with either (i) level monthly
payments of principal or (ii) level monthly payments of principal and
interest, provided that, in the case of a Loan with renewal provisions, a
balloon payment on such Renewal Date is permissible;

          (o)  Each Loan, related Note, related Collateral and Related
Documents pursuant to which Collateral is pledged to a Seller is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Obligor thereof and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except only as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding or action in equity
or at law), none of which will prevent the ultimate realization of the
security provided by the Collateral or Related Document, and all parties to
each Loan had full legal capacity to execute all Related Documents and convey
the property therein purported to be conveyed;

          (p)  The terms of the Loan, related Note and each Related Document
pursuant to which Collateral was pledged have not been impaired, altered or
modified in any respect, except by written instrument which has been
recorded, if necessary, to protect the interest of the Buyer and which has
been delivered to the Buyer;

          (q)  The proceeds of the Loan have been fully disbursed, and there
is no obligation on the part of the Seller to make future advances
thereunder.  Any and all requirements as to disbursements of any escrow funds
therefor have been complied with.  All costs, fees and expenses incurred in
making or closing or recording the Loans were paid;

          (r)  Except for any Obligor identified on Schedule II (as the same
may be supplemented upon subsequent Incremental Purchases), the Obligor with
respect to each Loan and each other member of its Obligor Group has a
positive net worth as accounted for under U.S. GAAP, consistently applied,
and has no present intention to seek relief under the federal bankruptcy
laws;

          (s)  There is no default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration existing under the Loan, related Note or Related Document and no
event which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of
any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach, violation or
event of acceleration, and the Seller has not waived any such default,
breach, violation or event of acceleration;

          (t)  The Loan was not selected for inclusion under this Agreement
from the Seller's portfolio of comparable loans on any basis which would have
a material adverse effect on the Buyer;

          (u)  The Obligor and/or the Loan Guarantor with respect to each
Loan and related Property is personally liable for the payment and
performance of its obligations under such Loan.  Pursuant to the terms of
each Loan, each of the Obligor and the Loan Guarantor thereunder is
absolutely required to make all payments and perform all obligations due
pursuant to such Loan without abatement, deferment or defense of any kind or
for any reason (except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general application relating to
or affecting creditors rights and by general principles of equity);

          (v)  As of the applicable Closing Date, insofar as facts are within
the Seller's actual knowledge, the Collateral covered by or securing the
obligations under each Loan is insured against loss by fire and such other
hazards as are customary for personal property of the same or similar type,
such insurance being in an amount not less than the full replacement value of
such personal property subject to customary deductibles and Buyer is
designated as loss payee under such policies;

          (w)  Each Loan requires each of the Obligor and Loan Guarantor
thereunder at its own costs and expense to maintain the Collateral pledged to
secure the related Loan in good repair, condition and working order, and to
the best knowledge of the Seller, each Obligor and Loan Guarantor under a
Loan is currently in compliance with this requirement;

          (x)  As of the applicable Closing Date, at least 90% of the value
of the Collateral securing each Loan consists of Primary Collateral, and at
least a portion of the Primary Collateral consists of the inventory,
furniture, fixtures and equipment in the stores owned or leased by the
related Obligor.  All Collateral securing any Loan is located in the United
States;

          (y)  Seller has, or on the applicable Closing Date will have, (1) a
first priority perfected security interest in each item of Primary
Collateral, free from any lien, security interest, encumbrance or other
right, title or interest of any Person, and (2) a perfected security interest
in each other item of Collateral, subject to the prior liens, security
interests and encumbrances existing on, and identified to and approved by the
Buyer on the applicable Closing Date.  Seller shall, on the applicable
Closing Date, transfer its security interest in the Collateral subject
however to the rights of the holder of title in and to the Collateral and of
the Obligors in the Collateral pledged under the Related Documents (and, in
the case of Collateral which is not Primary Collateral, holders of prior
liens), and Seller, as agent for the Buyer, shall defend the Buyer's security
interest in and to Collateral against all claims and demands of all Persons
at any time claiming the same or any interest therein adverse to that of the
Obligors or the Buyer.

          (z)  Either (i) the Obligor and Loan Guarantor has, under the terms
of each Loan, consented to a sale and assignment of the Loan, the related
Note and Related Documents and the sale or grant of a security interest in
and to the Loan and the Collateral relating thereto, or (ii) none of the
Loan, the related Note or any Related Documents requires the consent of
approval of notice to the Obligor or Loan Guarantor with respect to the
assignment and transfer by Seller of Seller's right, title and interest in
and to the Loan, the related Note, any Related Document and Collateral;

          (aa) The Notes and Related Documents delivered to Buyer on the
applicable Closing Date are true, correct, and complete original counterparts
of all instruments and documents evidencing or in any way relating to the
Loan and related indebtedness referred to therein; except as approved by the
Buyer, such Notes and Related Documents are in substantially the form of the
documents attached hereto as Exhibit P; except as included with the
instruments and documents so delivered, such Notes and such Related Documents
have not been amended; and each such Note and Related Document to which
Obligor or Loan Guarantor is a party bears the original signature of such
Obligor and Loan Guarantor;

          (bb) Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been duly
filed in all places where filing is necessary, and all other or additional
acts have been taken as are necessary to perfect Seller's security interests
arising pursuant to the Related Documents in the Collateral and such security
interests constitute a valid and perfected lien in and to all of the
Collateral of first priority (subject to no prior or equal liens or
interests) in the case of all Primary Collateral and of the same level of
priority as that enjoyed by the Seller on the applicable Closing Date in the
case of all other Collateral, and will be enforceable against all third
parties in all jurisdictions as security for the respective obligations of
Obligors to Seller under their respective Notes and Related Documents;

          (cc) Seller has heretofore caused all copies of the Loans, related
Notes and Related Documents in its possession to be separately identified and
distinguished from Seller's other loans, and on the applicable Closing Date,
the Seller will cause each copy of each Note, related Collateral and Related
Document in its possession to be identified with an appropriate legend
clearly disclosing the fact that such Loan, the related Notes, Related
Documents and the Seller's security interest in the related Collateral have
been sold and assigned to the Buyer and the Buyer is the owner thereof, and
any original copies of any Note, related Collateral or Related Document
coming into the possession of the Seller will be delivered to the Buyer;

          (dd)  All Loans specified on Schedule III (as the same may be
supplemented upon subsequent Incremental Purchases) are secured by mortgages
on each property;

          (ee) With respect to any Loan secured by a mortgage on real
property, each mortgage is a valid and subsisting lien of record on the
mortgaged property subject only to a first mortgage lien on such mortgaged
property previously disclosed to Buyer and subject in all cases to such
exceptions that are generally acceptable to prudent and experienced lenders
in connection with their regular commercial lending activities, and such
other exceptions to which similar properties are commonly subject and which
do not individually, or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the
benefits of the security intended to be provided by such mortgage;

          (ff) With respect to each Loan secured by a mortgage on real
property, each original mortgage was recorded, and all subsequent assignments
of the original mortgage have been recorded in the appropriate jurisdictions
wherein such recordation is necessary to perfect the lien thereof as against
creditors of Seller;

          (gg) With respect to each Loan secured by a mortgage on real
property, any related mortgage contains customary and enforceable provisions
which render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the
realization against the mortgaged property of the benefits of the security,
including (i) in the case of a mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by
trustee's sale, and (ii) otherwise by judicial foreclosure;

          (hh) With respect to each Loan secured by a mortgage on real
property, (i) there are no material defaults in complying with the terms of
any applicable mortgage, and all taxes, governmental assessments, insurance
premiums, water, sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments or ground
rents which previously became due and owing have been paid, or an escrow of
funds has been established in an amount sufficient to pay for every such item
which remains unpaid and which has been assessed but is not yet due and
payable; (ii) there is no proceeding pending or threatened for the total or
partial condemnation of any related mortgaged property, nor is such a
proceeding currently occurring, and such property is undamaged by waste,
fire, earthquake or earth movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other
casualty, so as to affect adversely the value of such mortgaged property as
security for the Loan or the use for which the premises were intended; and
(iii) at the time of origination of Loan, and to the best of the Seller's
knowledge, and based primarily on the related Phase I environmental survey or
environmental questionnaire, as the case may be, is, as of the applicable
Cut-Off Date, free of contamination from toxic substances or hazardous
wastes;

          (ii) Except for any Loan identified on Schedule II (as the same may
be supplemented upon subsequent Incremental Purchases) hereof, (i) neither
the Obligor nor any member of its Obligor Group shall have defaulted on any
obligation (including an open account) to Seller or any Affiliate or
Subsidiary of Seller and (ii) the place of business of Obligor or any member
of its Obligor Group cannot have been the location of a failed grocery store
(whether or not owned or managed by Obligor or any member of its Obligor
Group);

          (jj) The classification of Loans as either Preferred Loans or
Standard Loans or Full Recourse Loans (as specified in the Loan Schedule) is
true and correct and complies with the criteria stated in the definitions of
such terms herein;

          (kk) As of the applicable Closing Date, the aggregate Principal
Balance of all Loans (including Loans purchased on previous Closing Dates, if
any) classified as Preferred Loans is at least equal to 51 % of the Principal
Balance of all Loans as of the related Closing Date and the aggregate
Principal Balance of all Loans classified as Full Recourse Loans is less than
or equal to 25% of the Principal Balance of all Loans as of the related
Closing Date.

          (ll) The Aggregate Exposure listed with respect to each Loan in the
Loan Schedule is true and correct;

          (mm) Except for those Loans specified on Schedule II (as the same
may be supplemented upon subsequent Incremental Purchases) hereto, the
purpose for which the Loans were made was not to provide term financing for
open account balances that were (or would otherwise have been) delinquent,
and no Obligor or other member of its Obligor Group has ever been provided
term financing for open account balances that were (or would otherwise have
been) delinquent; 

          (nn) Except for those Loans specified on Schedule II (as the same
may be supplemented upon subsequent Incremental Purchases) hereto, the Loans
are cross-collateralized with other Loans and Collateral made, pledged or
guaranteed by any member of the related Obligor Group; and

          (oo)  With respect to each Loan secured by real estate Collateral
having a value of 10%, or more than 10%, of the Principal Balance of such
Loan on the applicable Closing Date, either (1) the Collateral Coverage Ratio
for the related Obligor Group, calculated for the purpose of making the
representation in this Section 4.02(oo) by excluding the value of the real
estate Collateral having Minimum Documentation, is at least equal to 100% or
(2) the Loan remains classified as a Preferred Loan even if the Collateral
Coverage Ratio for the related Obligor Group is calculated by excluding the
value of real estate Collateral having Minimum Documentation.

     SECTION 4.03   Seller's Renewal Date Representations and Warranties. 
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of each Renewal Date on which the
Seller has designated any Renewal Note for acceptance as follows:

          (a)  As of the applicable Renewal Date, all applicable
representations and warranties in Section 4.02 hereof are confirmed as to
such Renewal Loan.

          (b)  As of the applicable Renewal Date, each Obligor of the
applicable Renewal Loan is not in default of its payment obligations under
the Prior Note or under the Related Documents, and is not in default of its
nonmonetary obligations under such Note or Related Documents.

          (c)  As of the applicable Renewal Date, no event has occurred and
is continuing which would permit the Seller to accelerate the maturity of any
Obligor's obligations under the applicable Renewal Loan or under the Prior
Note or the Related Documents.

          (d)  The Notes and Related Documents delivered to Buyer on or prior
to the applicable Renewal Date are true, correct, and complete original
counterparts of all instruments and documents evidencing or in any way
relating to the Loan and the related Indebtedness referred to therein; except
as included with the instruments and documents so delivered, such Notes and
Related Documents have not been amended; and each such Note and each such
Related Document to which an Obligor or Loan Guarantor is a party bears the
original signature of the Obligor or Loan Guarantor.

          (e)  The Loans and Notes designated by Seller as Renewal Loans and
Notes together with the Related Documents to which Obligors or Loan
Guarantors are parties have been duly executed by their respective Obligors
or Loan Guarantors and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of
their respective Obligors and Loan Guarantors enforceable against such
Obligors and Loan Guarantors in accordance with their respective terms.

          (f)  Each amount identified in a notice provided pursuant to the
terms of Section 3.02 as the "anticipated Renewal Balance" correctly
identifies the amount of the outstanding Principal Balance evidenced by the
Note to be accepted as of such Renewal Date and there are no offsets or
defenses to the payment of such amount that may be asserted against the
Seller either by way of defense or counterclaim.

          (g)  Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been duly
filed in all places where filing is necessary, and all other or additional
acts have been taken as are necessary to perfect the Seller's security
interests arising pursuant to the Related Documents in the Collateral and
such security interests constitute a valid and perfected lien in and to all
of the Collateral of first priority (subject to no prior or equal liens or
interests) in the case of all Primary Collateral and of the same level of
priority as that enjoyed by the Seller on the Closing Date on which the Loan
was first sold and assigned hereunder in the case of all other Collateral,
and will be enforceable against all third parties in all jurisdictions as
security for the respective obligations of Obligors to the Seller under their
respective Notes and Related Documents.

          (h)  No Renewal Loan, related Renewal Note or any Related Document,
alone or in connection with Seller's prior course of conduct, expressly or
impliedly requires Seller or any other Person to make additional advances
thereunder.

          (i) The Note related to the Renewal Note provides for full
amortization over its remaining term to maturity.

     SECTION 4.04   Buyer's Representations and Warranties.  Buyer represents
and warrants to Seller as follows:

          (a)  Buyer is a financial institution duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America,
and has full corporate power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and to purchase the Loans and related Property.

order binding on it or its Articles of Association or Bylaws and do not
contravene the provisions of or constitute a default under any indenture,
mortgage, contract or other agreement or instrument to which Buyer is a party
or by which Buyer or any of its properties may be bound or affected.

          (c)  No Government Approval or filing or registration with any
Governmental Authority is required for the making and performance by Buyer of
this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

          (d)  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with its terms.

     SECTION 4.05   Repurchase Upon Breach of Certain Representations and
Warranties.  (a)  The representations and warranties and agreements of the
Seller set forth in Sections 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 with respect to the Seller
and each Loan and related Property shall continue so long as such Loan
remains outstanding.  Upon discovery by either Seller or Buyer that any of
such representations or warranties was incorrect as of the time made, the
party making such discovery shall give prompt notice to the other party.  In
the event any defect, misrepresentation or omission materially and adversely
affects the interest of the Buyer, the Seller shall eliminate or cure the
circumstance or condition causing the defect within 10 days of the discovery
thereof or, repurchase such Loan and the related Property.  

          (b)  Any such repurchase of a Loan and the related Property by
Seller shall be accomplished in the manner set forth in Section 2.01(e) and
at a price equal to the Purchase Amount.  It is understood and agreed that
the obligation of Seller to repurchase any Loan as to which a breach by

payments which may be required by this Section 4.05(b) shall, together with
the indemnification rights contained in Section 11.02 and the right of Buyer

repurchase, constitute the sole remedies against Seller respecting such
breach available to the Buyer.

                                  ARTICLE V

                          SERVICING AND COLLECTION

     At all times prior to the later of (a) the Termination Date or (b) the
date on which all obligations of the Seller under this Agreement have been
performed in full, the following terms and provisions of this Article V shall
apply.

     SECTION 5.01   Servicing and Collection Agent.  (a)  Except as provided
in Section 8.03, the Buyer appoints the Servicer to act as the Buyer's
exclusive agent for servicing and collecting the Loans, the related Notes,
the Related Documents, the related Collateral and the Indebtedness of the
Obligors evidenced thereby.  The Servicer accepts such appointment.  The
Servicer shall use the same diligence and practices in servicing and
collecting the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, the related Collateral
and the Related Documents as it uses in servicing and collecting indebtedness
evidenced by notes and related documents held for its own account and, in any
event, shall endeavor to collect or cause to be collected from each Obligor
the amounts as and when due and owing under such Obligor's Note and Related
Documents.  In performing its duties hereunder, and subject to the specific
limitations set forth herein, Servicer shall act in accordance with its
Credit and Collection Policy and shall take such actions with respect to the
Loans, Notes and Related Documents as, in its reasonable business judgment,
it may deem advisable to maintain or enhance receipt of timely Collections
thereunder.  Promptly upon the request of Servicer, Buyer agrees to execute
and deliver such documents and take such further acts (at Servicer's expense)
as Servicer may reasonably request to confirm and evidence the agency granted
to Servicer pursuant to this Section 5.01.

          (b)  Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Servicer shall deliver to the Buyer a list certified by its secretary or
one of its assistant secretaries of the Servicing Officers and employees of
the Servicer involved in or responsible for, the administration and servicing
of the Loans, which list shall from time to time be updated by the Servicer
and which may be relied upon until so updated.

          (c)  The Servicer shall maintain in effect a fidelity bond (or a
direct surety bond) and an errors and omissions policy with respect to
Servicing Officers and employees of the Subservicer designated from time to
time pursuant to Sections 5.01(b) and 5.13(f) hereof, each issued by a surety
company acceptable to Buyer.  Such bond and policy shall name the Buyer as
loss payee or additional insured, as appropriate, shall provide for 30 days
prior notice of cancellation to the Buyer and shall otherwise be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.  The Servicer shall deliver
to the Buyer evidence of the coverage provided to the Buyer under such bond
promptly upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement and evidence of
the coverage provided to the Buyer under such policy within 30 days of the
execution of this Agreement, and shall deliver to the Buyer, within 30 days
prior to the expiration of any such bond or policy, a renewal or replacement
thereof, or a certificate evidencing such renewal or replacement, as
appropriate.

     SECTION 5.02   Maintenance of System; Collection and Maintenance of
Information.  (a) Servicer shall arrange and maintain with respect to the
Loans, related Notes and Related Documents, data processing, accounting and
related services adequate for the effective and timely servicing and
collecting of the Indebtedness evidenced thereby in accordance with good
business practices and in compliance with all applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations.

          (b) With respect to each Loan and related Obligor, Obligor Group
and Loan Guarantor, Servicer shall collect the following information: 
(i) within 100 days of the end of each fiscal year of such Obligor, Obligor
Group or Loan Guarantor, as applicable, annual financial statements, together
with a certificate of an authorized officer of such Obligor, Obligor Group or
Loan Guarantor, as applicable, to the effect that the accompanying financial
statements are true and correct in all material respects and demonstrating
compliance with the financial covenants required by the Agreement, including
the Cash Flow Ratio, Collateral Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Tangible Net
Worth; (ii) within 50 days of the end of the fiscal year of such Obligor,
Obligor Group or Loan Guarantor, as applicable, interim financial statements,
together with a certificate of an authorized officer of such Obligor, Obligor
Group or Loan Guarantor, as applicable, to the effect that the accompanying
interim financial statements are true and correct in all material respects
and demonstrating compliance with the financial covenants required by this
Agreement, including Cash Flow Ratio, Collateral Coverage Ratio and
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth; (iii) evidence of adequate insurance with
respect to related Collateral; (iv) annual evaluation of related Collateral;
(v) evidence of continued perfection of Buyer's security interest in the
related Collateral.  Servicer shall maintain the foregoing information and
shall make the same available to the Buyer or its nominees or agents upon
reasonable request.

     SECTION 5.03   Maintenance of Lien Priority.  So long as Servicer is
required to act as Buyer's exclusive agent for servicing and collecting the
Loans, related Notes, the Related Documents and the Indebtedness of the
Obligors evidenced thereby, Servicer agrees to take all actions, including
lien searches and continuation statement filings, necessary or desirable to
ensure that the liens arising pursuant to the Related Documents and securing
repayment of any Obligor's Indebtedness evidenced by a Note will be
maintained as continuously perfected first priority (except in the case of
Collateral which is not Primary Collateral, in which event the Servicer shall
take all actions to maintain the priority sold and assigned hereunder)
security interests (except as otherwise approved by Buyer) in all applicable
jurisdictions.

     SECTION 5.04   Collection Policies.  Servicer agrees to follow, maintain
and apply the credit extension and collection policies identified in the
Credit and Collection Policy in all material respects unless any order of any
court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority or any determination of or
change in any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation should
require otherwise or unless Buyer shall otherwise consent in writing, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Servicer is not authorized to and agrees that it will not
without the Buyer's prior written consent, (a) amend, extend, release,
modify, or waive the terms or conditions of any Loan, related Note or of any
Related Document; (b) release any Collateral pledged in support of any
Obligor's obligations under a Note or Related Document (other than Seller's
capital stock and patronage dividends); (c) grant or permit to be granted any
rebate, refund, credit or other adjustment in respect of a Obligor's
obligation under any Note or any Related Document; or (d) accept as payment
in full any amount less than the total amount required to be paid pursuant to
the terms of such Note and Related Documents.

     SECTION 5.05   Obligor Defaults.  Servicer agrees to promptly give any
notice to Obligor required to commence the running of any applicable cure
period following a default in the performance by Obligor of its obligations
under the Loan, the related Note and Related Documents.  If an Obligor
Default shall occur and be continuing or if a Loan shall otherwise become a
Defaulted Loan, Servicer shall promptly undertake the collection of such
Obligor's Indebtedness in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy. 
Without limiting the foregoing the Servicer shall commence liquidation of the
Collateral pledged to secure such Obligor's obligations under its Loan within
thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such Obligor's Default or upon a
Loan becoming a Defaulted Loan, unless Servicer receives notice from the
Seller of its election to repurchase such Loan pursuant to Section 8.02
hereof.  Servicer shall promptly notify Buyer and Seller of the occurrence of
an Obligor Default or of a Loan becoming a Defaulted Loan.  In its efforts to
collect the Indebtedness evidenced by any Note, Servicer shall in all events
proceed in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and when
seeking to realize on Collateral pledged by any Obligor, shall proceed in
such a fashion as to preserve to Buyer its rights to seek collection of a
deficiency against such Obligor if the sale of the Collateral is insufficient
to pay such Obligor's obligations in full.  

     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to assume the servicing
obligations (other than Advances) of the Servicer hereunder in connection
with the liquidation of a Defaulted Loan and related Property and Servicer
shall cooperate with Buyer in effecting such transfer of obligations and
liquidation of Collateral.  If Buyer assumes the servicing obligations with
respect to the liquidation of a Defaulted Loan, Buyer shall proceed as a
prudent and experienced servicer would under the circumstances and shall be
entitled to reimbursement for its reasonable fees and expenses in performing
such obligations in accordance with Section 5.08 hereof.

     SECTION 5.06   Servicer Reports; Annual Compliance Report.  (a)  On each
Servicer Payment Date, Servicer shall deliver to Buyer and Seller a report
relating to the Loans covering the matters referred to in the attached
Exhibit G.  The report shall also identify any event occurring during the
preceding Due Period of which Servicer has actual knowledge which materially
impairs or might reasonably be expected materially to impair any Obligor's
ability to repay the Debt relating to any Loan and evidenced by a Note or to
perform its obligations under any Related Document or which has or might
reasonably be expected to substantially reduce the value of the Collateral or
to impair the Buyer's lien thereon.  In addition to the foregoing, from time
to time upon request of Buyer, the Servicer will deliver to Buyer such other
statements, lists, reports and other information as the Buyer may reasonably
request, and, to the extent any such information must be obtained by Seller
from a third party, as the Seller may reasonably be expected to obtain.

          (b)  The Servicer shall also deliver to the Buyer a certificate of
a Responsible Officer on each Servicer Payment Date to the effect that a
review of the activities of the Servicer and of any Subservicer during the
preceding monthly period, and of its performance under this Agreement during
such period has been made under the supervision of the officers executing
such certificate with a view to determining whether during such period the
Servicer and any Subservicer had performed and observed all of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and any Subservicing Agreement,
and either (i) stating that based on such review no Servicer Default under
this Agreement has occurred, or (ii) if a Servicer Default has occurred,
specifying such Servicer Default and the nature and status thereof.

          (c)  Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of Servicer,
Servicer shall deliver to Buyer a report of a firm of independent public
accountants selected by the Servicer, which firm is either of nationally
recognized standing or acceptable to Buyer, to the effect that such firm has
examined certain documents and records relating to the servicing of the Loans
and related Property under this Agreement and that, on the basis of such
examination conducted substantially in compliance with generally accepted
audit standards, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe
that the Servicer or such Subservicer, as the case may be, has not serviced
the Loans and related Property in accordance with its Credit and Collection
Policy or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, or has not accounted
for matters regarding the Loans and related Property, including Collections
with respect to the Loans and remittances to Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement, except for such insignificant exceptions or errors on records
that, in the opinion of such firm, it is not required to report.  The
Servicer shall provide a copy of such accountant's reports to Buyer.

     SECTION 5.07   Loan Payments.  (a)  Unless otherwise notified by Buyer,
Servicer shall receive directly all payments with respect to the Loans.  Such
payments, which shall be held by Servicer, as agent for the Buyer, will
include:

              (i)  all Monthly Payments and Payaheads received from the
     Obligors in the Lockbox Account or otherwise;

              (ii)  all Principal Prepayments;

              (iii)  all Insurance Proceeds and all Liquidation Proceeds; and

              (iv)  all payments made by the Seller or the Servicer or the
     Guarantor under this Agreement to be paid to Servicer, including
     Guaranty Payments and Repurchase Proceeds.

          (b)  On a daily basis, the Servicer will, unless otherwise
instructed by Seller, remit or cause to be remitted to Seller from payments
with respect to the Loans, all amounts so received attributable to (i) any
payments received from any source other than payments made in respect of the
Loans, the related Notes, Related Documents and related Collateral,
(ii) payments with respect to the Loans, related Notes, Related Documents and
related Collateral due before the applicable Cut-Off Date, and (iii) payments
received in respect of the Loans following the repurchase thereof by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement.

          (c)  No later than 12:00 noon, Washington, D.C., time, on each
Servicer Payment Date and subject to Section 5.08, Servicer will remit to the
Buyer an amount equal to the total amount of Collections received during the
related Due Period, together with any other Available Funds; provided,
however, that on each Servicer Payment Date, Servicer shall be permitted to
reimburse itself for expenses, fees and other amounts advanced by the
Servicer as provided in Section 5.08 and to reimburse itself or the
Guarantor, as applicable, for all amounts Advanced pursuant to Section 5.07A
or Section 7.01(c), as applicable, and not previously reimbursed.  Payment
shall be made to Buyer at the payment address set out beneath its signature
hereto in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon Washington,
D.C. time on the date such amounts are due.

          (d)  Buyer may require, at any time and in its sole discretion,
that Servicer establish a Lockbox Account and direct all Obligors to send
Loan payments to such Lockbox Account.  In addition, Buyer may also require
that Servicer establish and maintain a Servicing Account, as a separate and
segregated account in the name of the Buyer, into which Account all moneys
from the Lockbox Account will be transferred and from which Account moneys
shall be remitted to Buyer on each Servicer Payment Date.  If so required by
Buyer, Servicer and Seller agree to cooperate with Buyer in establishing a
Lockbox Account and Servicing Account and in amending this Agreement to
contain provisions relating to the establishment, maintenance and application
of such Accounts.

     SECTION 5.07A  Advances by Servicer.  On each Servicer Payment Date, the
Servicer is obligated to advance the total of all Monthly Payments with
respect to Loans, which were due during the preceding Due Period and were
delinquent as of the close of business on the related Servicer Payment Date;
provided, that the Servicer shall have no obligation to make any Advance that
it determines would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance if made.  Any such
Advance is required to be remitted to the Buyer on such Servicer Payment
Date.  The determination by the Servicer that it has made a Nonrecoverable
Advance or that any Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable
Advance, shall be evidenced by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the
Servicer delivered to the Buyer on the Servicer Payment Date and detailing
the reasons for such determination.

     SECTION 5.08   Computation and Payment of Servicing Fees; Servicer's
Expenses.  (a)  On the third Business Day after each Payment Date, the Buyer
shall remit to Servicer as a servicing fee, the amount, if any, by which the
amount remitted to the Buyer on the Servicer Payment Date (consisting of
(i) total Collections received by Servicer during the related Due Period
(minus any Advances or other amounts paid to Servicer or Guarantor pursuant
to Section 5.07 before remittance to Buyer) and (ii) other Available Funds)
exceeds the Anticipated Payment.  As used herein "Anticipated Payment" means
for any Payment Date the sum of (a) the principal portion of the Monthly
Payment for the related Due Period, other than the portion of the Principal
Balance of a Prior Note which, at the time it became due, constituted the
Renewal Balance under a Renewal Note; (b) any Principal Prepayments,
Payaheads, Insurance Proceeds and Net Liquidation Proceeds actually received
during the related Due Period to the extent such payments exceed the amount
of the principal portion of Monthly Payments coming due during such Due
Period (calculated as if such obligation had not been accelerated); (c) the
principal portion of any Guaranty Payment or Repurchase Proceeds with respect
to the related Due Period; (d) the Carry-Forward Amount; and (e) the Monthly
Interest Amount for the related Interest Accrual Period.  As used herein
"Monthly Interest Amount" on any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the sum of (A) the product of (i) the Principal Balance of all Loans on the
immediately preceding Payment Date (and in the case of the initial Payment
Date, on the Initial Closing Date), times (ii) the Applicable Rate times
(iii) a fraction, the denominator of which is three hundred sixty (360), and
the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the related Interest
Accrual Period and (B) if an Incremental Purchase has occurred since the
preceding Payment Date, the product of (i) the Principal Balance as of the
applicable Closing Date of the Loans relating to such Incremental Purchase,
times (ii) the Applicable Rate, times (iii) a fraction, the denominator of
which is three hundred sixty (360), and the numerator of which is the actual
number of days during the period from and including the date of such
Incremental Purchase to the day preceding such Payment Date.  The periodic
payments from the Buyer required by this Section 5.08 are herein referred to
as the "Servicing Fees." Servicing Fees shall be paid to Servicer in
immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon, Portland, Oregon time
on the third Business Day after each Payment Date.

          (b)  In addition, as additional compensation for performing its
obligations hereunder, the Servicer will be entitled to be paid all late
payment charges, to the extent collected from Obligors, together with any
investment income earned on amounts in the Servicing Account.  The Servicer
shall pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing
activities as herein provided, including expenses of any repossession or
remarketing of Collateral, payment of the premiums for any insurance policy,
real property, personal property and sales taxes on the Collateral, payment
of fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants and
payment of expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports to
Buyer and shall be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses out of
available Collections.

     SECTION 5.09   Applicable Rate.  As used in this Agreement, "Applicable
Rate" shall be determined as follows.  The Applicable Rate shall be
established as of each LIBOR Determination Date and shall be applicable for
the next succeeding Interest Accrual Period without regard to changes
thereafter occurring during such Interest Accrual Period in the principal
amounts outstanding under the Notes, in the Principal Balance of Loans
purchased, or in LIBOR.  Buyer shall, after the determination of the
Applicable Rate on each LIBOR Determination Date, notify Seller, Servicer and
Guarantor of such Applicable Rate; provided, however, that any failure of
Buyer to give such notice shall not affect Seller's, Servicer's or
Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

     The Applicable Rate shall be computed and applied on the basis of a year
of three hundred sixty (360) days for the actual number of days occurring in
the applicable Interest Accrual Period.  For each Interest Accrual Period,
the Applicable Rate shall mean an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of
(a) one percent (1%) and (b) LIBOR in effect on the applicable LIBOR
Determination Date.  For purposes hereof, the Buyer will determine LIBOR by
12:00 noon, Eastern Standard Time, on each LIBOR Determination Date on the
basis of quotations provided by four Reference Banks as of 11:00 A.M. (London
time) on such LIBOR Determination Date as such quotations appear on the
display designated as page "LIBO" on the appropriate display on the Bloomberg
Financial Markets System (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page on
that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of
major banks).  LIBOR as determined by Buyer is the arithmetic mean of such
quotations (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole multiple of 0.0625%
per annum).  If on any LIBOR Determination Date at least two but fewer than
all of the Reference Banks provide quotations, LIBOR will be determined in
accordance with the provisions set forth above on the basis of the offered
quotations of those Reference Banks providing such quotations.  If on the
LIBOR Determination Date only one or none of the Reference Banks provides
such offered quotations, LIBOR will be:  (i) the rate per annum (rounded, as
aforesaid) that the Buyer determines to be either (x) the arithmetic mean of
the offered quotations that leading banks in the City of New York selected by
Buyer are quoting at or about 11:00 A.M. London time on the relevant LIBOR
Determination Date for one month Dollar deposits to the principal London
office of each of the Reference Banks or those of them (being at least two in
number) to which such offered quotations are, in the opinion of Buyer, being
so quoted or (y) in the event that Buyer can determine no such arithmetic
mean, the arithmetic mean of the offered quotations that leading banks in the
City of New York selected by Buyer are quoting at or about 11:00 A.M. London
time on such LIBOR Determination Date to leading European banks for one month
Dollar deposits; or (ii) if the banks selected as aforesaid by Buyer are not
quoting as described in clause (i) above, LIBOR for such Interest Accrual
Period will be LIBOR as determined on the previous LIBOR Determination Date. 
"Reference Banks" shall mean four major banks in the London interbank market
selected by Buyer.

     SECTION 5.10   Concerning Renewal Notes.  Servicer may, on behalf of
Buyer, and except as otherwise restricted by this Section 5.10, permit
Obligors to execute and deliver Renewal Notes in renewal of all or a portion
of the Principal Balance under a Prior Note.  Servicer may not permit any
Renewal Note to be executed and delivered more than ten (10) days prior to
the Renewal Date and, further, shall not permit any Renewal Note to be
executed and delivered at any time when Servicer knows that the conditions
set out in Sections 2.02, 3.02 and 3.04 to Buyer's acceptance of such Renewal
Note on the Renewal Date will not be satisfied.

     SECTION 5.11   Concerning Insurance on Collateral.  (a)  The Servicer
shall cause to be maintained, with respect to the Collateral, one or more
insurance policies (which may be, collectively, the individual policies of
insurance required to be maintained by each Obligor, together with one or
more blanket fire and extended coverage insurance policies covering the
Collateral and other equipment of the Servicer or any Subservicer similar to
the Collateral) which provide at least the same coverage as a fire and
extended coverage insurance policy and naming Seller or its affiliates or
assigns as the loss payee.  The Servicer shall take whatever actions are
necessary to cause each insurer to recognize the Buyer as assignee under the
related insurance policy.  Such insurance policies shall be maintained in an
amount which is not less than the full replacement value of such personal
property subject to customary deductions.  Any amounts received under any
such insurance policies with respect to the Collateral shall be held by the
Servicer, as agent for the Buyer.

          (b)  If an insurer under an insurance policy shall deny coverage
(in any such case prior to termination thereof as a result of the payment by
such insurer of an aggregate amount equal to its maximum liability under such
insurance policy), or shall refuse to honor a claim under any such insurance
policy with respect to a Loan or the Collateral related thereto for which the
Servicer does not receive Monthly Payments because such Loan becomes a
Defaulted Loan for reasons relating to such claim, and if such denial or
refusal resulted from the Servicer's failure to comply with the requirements
of such insurance policy or the requirements of such insurer, then the
Servicer shall deem the amount of any resulting unpaid claim to be collected,
as a recovery on the Loan with respect to which such denial or refusal arose,
on or before the last day of the Due Period during which such denial or
refusal occurs, and Servicer shall be obligated to pay such "deemed
Collection" to Buyer as a portion of the Anticipated Payment made to Buyer on
the next succeeding Servicer Payment Date.

          (c)  If the Buyer or the Servicer shall determine that the
financial condition of any insurer might jeopardize recoveries under such an
insurance policy; or if any such insurance policy is cancelled or terminated
for any reason other than the exhaustion of total coverage; then, in each
such case, the Servicer shall use its best efforts to obtain from another
insurer a replacement policy for each such insurance policy, which
replacement policy shall be substantially similar to the insurance policy
being replaced with coverage equal to the then existing coverage of such
insurance policy.

          (d)  The Servicer shall promptly notify the Buyer of the occurrence
of any event described in subsection 5.11(b) or (c).

          (e)  In the monthly report delivered pursuant to Section 5.06,
Servicer shall certify that except as to Loans identified therein (together
with a status report on effort to obtain insurance thereon), the Collateral
related to each Loan is covered under an insurance policy or policies
satisfying the requirements set forth in subsection 5.11(a).

     SECTION 5.12   Servicer Representations and Warranties.  The Servicer
hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees as follows:

          (a)  The Servicer is duly organized and is validly existing and in
good standing as an Oregon corporation, with corporate power and authority to
own its properties and to transact the business in which it is now engaged,
and the Servicer is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each State of the United States where the nature of its business requires it
to be so qualified.

          (b)  The performance of the Servicer's obligations under this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will
not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of,
or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the
Servicer or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement (other than this
Agreement) or instrument to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which it or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of its
property or assets is subject, nor will such action result in any violation
of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any
statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency
or body having jurisdiction over it or any of its properties; and no consent,
approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any
court or any such regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body
is required for the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

          (c)  This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Servicer and this Agreement is the valid and legally binding
obligation of the Servicer, enforceable against the Servicer in accordance
with its terms, subject as to enforcement to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general principles of equity.

          (d)  No event with respect to the Servicer has occurred and is
continuing which would constitute a Servicer Default under Section 9.01 or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a Servicer
Default under this Agreement.

          (e)  The Servicer is "eligible" to borrow from NCB pursuant to the
provisions of the Bank Act.

     SECTION 5.13   Subservicing Agreements Between Servicer and
Subservicers; Enforcement of Subservicer's Obligations.  (a)  The Servicer
may enter into Subservicing Agreements with Subservicers for the servicing
and administration of all or part of the Loans, with the prior written
consent of the Buyer and Guarantor.  References in this Agreement to actions
taken or to be taken by the Servicer in servicing the Loans include actions
taken or to be taken by a Subservicer on behalf of the Servicer.  References
in this Agreement to the servicing standards of the Servicer in servicing the
Loans shall be deemed to refer to the servicing standards of such Servicer as
set forth in this Agreement.  Each Subservicing Agreement will be upon such
terms and conditions as are not inconsistent with this Agreement and as the
Servicer and the Subservicer have agreed.  The Servicer shall notify Buyer in
writing promptly upon the appointment of any Subservicer.  For purposes of
this Agreement, the receipt by the Subservicer of any amount with respect to
a Loan (other than amounts representing servicing compensation or
reimbursement for an advance) shall be treated as the receipt by the Servicer
of such amount.

     The Servicer may, pursuant to any Subservicing Agreement, delegate to
the Subservicer thereunder any and all of its rights, duties, powers and
obligations existing under this Agreement, including the servicing and
administration of the Loans and related Property, acting as agent and bailee
of the Buyer in holding moneys, documents or other items, the obligation to
deliver reports, certificates and documents, to engage independent public
accountants to provide reports under this Agreement, and to make payments and
advances thereunder or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, to make and
receive distributions in respect of Advances, to receive the Servicer
compensation pursuant to Section 5.08 and with respect to such delegated
rights, duties, powers and obligations, the Subservicer may take or do such
acts in its own name, as Subservicer; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the Servicer's delegation to the Subservicer provided in this Section
5.13(a), the Servicer shall not be excused from performance of its
obligations under this Agreement as provided in Section 5.13(d).

          (b)  As part of its servicing activities hereunder, the Servicer,
for the benefit of the Buyer, shall enforce the obligations of each
Subservicer under the related Subservicing Agreement, including the
obligation to make advances in respect of delinquent payments as required by
a Subservicing Agreement.  Such enforcement, including, without limitation,
the legal prosecution of claims, termination of Subservicing Agreements, and
the pursuit of other remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such
an extent and at such time as the Servicer, in its good faith business
judgment, would require were it the owner of the related Loan.  The Servicer
shall pay the costs of such enforcement at its own expense, but shall be
reimbursed therefor only (i) from a general recovery resulting from such
enforcement only to the extent, if any, that such recovery exceeds all
amounts due in respect of the related Loan or (ii) from a specific recovery
of costs, expenses or attorneys fees against the party whom such enforcement
is directed.

          (c)  The Servicer shall be entitled to terminate any Subservicing
Agreement that may exist in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
Subservicing Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of this
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of termination of any
Subservicing Agreement by the Servicer or the Subservicer, the Servicer shall
either act as servicer of the related Loans or enter into a Subservicing
Agreement with a successor Subservicer which will be bound by the terms of
the related Subservicing Agreement.

          (d)  Notwithstanding any Subservicing Agreement, any of the
provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between
the Servicer or a Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a
Subservicer or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to
the Buyer for the servicing and administering of the Loans in accordance with
the provisions of this Article V without diminution of such obligation or
liability by virtue of such Subservicing Agreements or arrangements or by
virtue of indemnification from the Subservicer or the Sellers and to the same
extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were
servicing and administering the Loans.  The Servicer shall be entitled to
enter into any agreement with a Subservicer for indemnification of the
Servicer and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or
modify such indemnification.

          (e)  Any Subservicing Agreement that may be entered into and any
other transactions or services relating to the Loans involving a Subservicer
in its capacity as such and not as an originator shall be deemed to be
between the Subservicer and the Servicer alone and the Buyer shall not be
deemed a party thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties
or liabilities with respect to the Subservicer except as set forth in Section
5.14.

          (f)  Upon Buyer's request, at the time of or at any time after the
execution of a Subservicing Agreement, the Servicer shall cause the
Subservicer to furnish to the Buyer a list certified by the Subservicer's
secretary or other authorized officer of the Servicing Officers and employees
of the Subservicer involved in or responsible for, subservicing the Loans,
which list the Servicer shall cause to be updated from time to time by the
Subservicer.

     SECTION 5.14   Assumption or Termination of Sub-Servicing Agreement by
Buyer.  If the Servicer shall be replaced for any reason (including by reason
of any Servicer Default), the Buyer or any other successor succeeding to the
duties of the Servicer in accordance with Sections 8.01 or 8.02 shall
thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under each
Subservicing Agreement that may then be in effect.  The Buyer, its designee
or the Successor Servicer for the Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed all
of the Servicer's interest therein and to have replaced the Servicer's
interest therein and to have replaced the Servicer as a party to the
Subservicing Agreement to the same extent as if the Subservicing Agreement
had been assigned to the assuming party except that the Servicer shall not
thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations under the Subservicing
Agreement unless otherwise so provided in such Subservicing Agreement.  If
the Buyer shall have assumed the rights and obligations of the Servicer under
the Subservicing Agreement as described in this Section 5.14, the Buyer may
terminate the Subservicer's rights and obligations under the Subservicing
Agreement only in accordance with the terms of the Subservicing Agreement.

     The Servicer shall, upon request of the Buyer but at the expense of the
Servicer, deliver to the assuming party all documents and records relating to
the Subservicing Agreement and an accounting of amounts collected and held by
it and otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient
transfer of the Subservicing Agreement to the assuming party.

     SECTION 5.15   Access to Certain Documentation and Certain Information
Regarding the Loans.  The Servicer will provide to the Buyer access to the
documentation in its possession regarding the Loans, such access being
afforded without charge but only during normal business hours at the offices
of the Servicer or its designee or agent, including at the offices of any
Subservicer, as designated by the Servicer.  

     SECTION 5.16   Servicer Not to Resign.  (a)  The Servicer shall not
resign from the duties and obligations hereby imposed on it except upon a
determination by its Board of Directors that by reason of change in
applicable legal requirements the continued performance by the Servicer of
its duties under this Agreement would cause it to be in violation of such
legal requirements, said determination to be evidenced by a resolution of its
Board of Directors to such effect accompanied by an opinion of counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, to such effect.

          (b)  The Servicer may not assign this Agreement or any of its
rights, powers, duties or obligations hereunder, provided that the Servicer
may assign this Agreement in connection with a consolidation, merger,
conveyance, transfer or lease made in compliance with Section 6.01(i).

          (c)  Except as provided in Sections 5.16(a), 9.01 and 11.02(b), the
duties and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement shall continue
until the Termination Date, and shall survive the exercise of any right or
remedy under this Agreement by the Sellers or Buyer of any provision of this
Agreement, and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.16(a), 9.01 and
11.02(b), prior to the Termination Date, the Servicer shall continue to serve
as Servicer hereunder until such Successor Servicer shall be appointed and
assume the duties of Servicer hereunder.

                                 ARTICLE VI

                      SELLER'S AND SERVICER'S COVENANTS

Seller or Servicer, as the case may be, in appropriate proceedings, and
except other Debt, taxes and other obligations which, in the aggregate do not

     SECTION 7.02   Guarantor Representations and Warranties.  The Guarantor
hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees as follows as of each Closing

good standing as an Oregon corporation, with corporate power and authority to
own its properties and to transact the business in which it is now engaged;
the Guarantor is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each State of the United States where the nature of its business requires it
to be so qualified; and the Guarantor is doing business only under the
corporate and "doing business as" names listed on Exhibit A hereto.

          (b)  The performance of Guarantor's obligations under this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will
not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of,
or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of Guarantor
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement (other than this Agreement)
or instrument to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
it or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of its property or
assets is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the
provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any statute or
any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body
having jurisdiction over it or any of its properties; and no consent,
approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any
court or any such regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body
is required for the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

          (c)  This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Guarantor and this Agreement is the valid and legally binding
obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its

proceedings, investigations, or claims against or affecting Guarantor now
pending before any court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority (nor to
the knowledge of Guarantor has any thereof been threatened nor does any basis
exist therefor) which if determined adversely to the Guarantor would be
likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
operations of Guarantor or on Guarantor's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, or under any Assignment or under an endorsement of any
Note.  With respect to the litigation described in Exhibit I hereto, a
determination in such litigation that is materially adverse to the Seller or

obligations under this Agreement.

for each such month is equal to or less than the sum of the LIBOR on such
Date and 150 basis points.  An Interest Rate Agreement, if any, must satisfy
the following requirements:  (i) have a term of 36 months (or such fewer
number of months as remain in the term of this Agreement); (ii) be provided
by a party or parties who is or are either rated "A" or higher by a Rating
Agency or acceptable to Buyer; (iii) be accompanied by an opinion of counsel

has then been continuing for at least thirty (30) days or (iii) Buyer has
received notice of any adverse event as described in Section 5.06 or Section
6.01(f) hereof.  Such Loan shall be repurchased by Seller from Buyer by the
last day of the Due Period during which Seller receives notice of any such
Defaulted Loan or the occurrence and continuation of an Obligor Default or
notice of adverse event, as the case may be.  Such repurchase shall be
accomplished on the same terms as set forth in Section 2.01(e) and at the

to have warranted that such Loans and related Property are free and clear of
all liens or claims resulting from or arising out of its acts or omissions
(other than acts of Buyer resulting from Seller's or Servicer's failure to
perform as required by this Agreement) or claims of Buyer's creditors.

Servicer under this Agreement shall vest in the Buyer, and the Buyer is
hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of the
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other
instruments (including any notices to obligors deemed necessary or advisable
by the Buyer), and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or

renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

     SECTION 11.10  Attorney's Fees.  In the event it is necessary for any
party hereto or its Successors or assigns to institute suit in connection
with this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing party in such suit
shall be entitled to reimbursement for its reasonable costs, expenses and
attorney's fees incurred including fees incurred on any appeal.

     SECTION 11.11  Setoff.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Termination Event or
Servicer Default, Buyer is hereby authorized by Seller, Servicer and
Guarantor at any time, without notice to Seller, Servicer and Guarantor, as
the case may be, to set off and to appropriate and to apply to the amounts
then owed by Seller, Servicer or Guarantor, as the case may be, hereunder to

      United Grocers, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), hereby
confirms its agreement with you as set forth below.  You are hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Purchaser".  This Agreement is herein referred
to as this or the "Agreement".  Reference is made to Section 8 hereof for
definitions of capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined.

      1.   Description of Notes and Commitment.

      1.1  Description of Notes.  The Company has authorized the issue and
sale of its Senior Notes (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Notes"
and individually as a "Note") in the aggregate principal amount of
$20,000,000.  The Notes shall be dated the Closing Date, mature November 1,
2005, and bear interest at the rate of 8.42% per annum, payable semiannually
in arrears on the first day of each May and November in each year (commencing
May 1, 1995), and at maturity, provided that overdue principal (including any
overdue required or optional prepayment of principal) and premium, if any,
and (to the extent legally enforceable) any overdue installment of interest
shall bear interest from and after the due date thereof at the rate of 10.42%
per annum.  Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year of twelve 30-day months.  The Notes shall be substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A.  The Notes are not subject to prepayment or
redemption at the option of the Company prior to their expressed maturity
date except on the terms and conditions and in the amounts and with the
premium, if any, set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement.  The term "Notes"
as used herein shall include each Note delivered pursuant to this Agreement
and all promissory notes delivered in substitution or exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof, and where applicable, shall include the singular number as well
as the plural.

      1.2  Commitment, Closing Date.  Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and on the basis of the representations and warranties hereinafter set
forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to you, and you agree to purchase
from the Company, on the Closing Date, at the purchase price of 100% of the
principal amount thereof, the entire $20,000,000 principal amount of Notes. 

      Delivery of the Notes will be made at the offices of Chapman and
Cutler, 111 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, against payment
therefor in Federal Reserve or other funds current and immediately available
at the principal office of United States National Bank of Oregon, Main
Branch, Portland, Oregon, A.B.A. Number 123-000-220 for the General Account
of the Company, Account No. 010-0661-545 (marked to request telephone
notification of John W. White, Vice President of the Company at 503-833-1100)
in the amount of the purchase price at 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on
November 15, 1994 or such other date as shall mutually be agreed upon by the
Company and the Purchaser (the "Closing Date").  The Notes delivered to you
on the Closing Date will be delivered to you in the form of a single
registered Note in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A for the full amount
of your purchase (unless different denominations are specified by you),
registered in your name or in the name of such nominee, as may be specified
in Schedule I attached hereto.

      2.   Prepayment of Notes.

      2.1  Required Prepayments.  The Company agrees that on November 1 in
each year, commencing November 1, 2001, and continuing to and including
November 1, 2004, it will prepay the principal indebtedness evidenced by the
Notes in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (a) $4,000,000, or (b)
the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.  The entire remaining
principal amount of the Notes shall become due and payable on November 1,
2005.  No premium shall be payable in connection with any required prepayment
made pursuant to this Section 2.1.

      In the event that the Company shall prepay less than all of the Notes
pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, the amounts of the prepayments required by
this Section 2.1 shall be reduced by an amount which is the same percentage
of such required prepayment as the percentage that the principal amount of
Notes prepaid pursuant to Section 2.2 is of the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Notes immediately prior to such prepayment.

      2.2  Optional Prepayment with Premium.  In addition to the prepayments
required by Section 2.1, upon compliance with Section 2.3, the Company shall
have the right, at any time and from time to time, to prepay the principal
indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, either in whole or in part (but if in
part then in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000) by payment
of the principal amount of the Notes, or portion thereof to be prepaid, and
accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment together with a
premium equal to the Make-Whole Amount, determined as of the date of such
prepayment but using the Reinvestment Rate determined as of five Business
Days prior to the date of such prepayment.

      2.3  Notice of Optional Prepayments.  The Company will give notice of
any prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 2.2 to each Holder thereof
not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such
optional prepayment specifying (a) such date, (b) the principal amount of the
Notes of such Holder to be prepaid on such date, (c) that a premium may be
payable, (d) the date when such premium will be calculated, (e) the estimated
premium, and (f) the accrued interest applicable to the prepayment.  Notice
of prepayment having been so given, the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes specified in such notice, together with accrued interest thereon and
the premium, if any, payable with respect thereto shall become due and
payable on the prepayment date specified in such notice.  At least two
Business Days prior to the prepayment date specified in such notice, the
Company shall provide each Holder written notice stating whether any premium
is payable in connection with such prepayment, and containing a reasonably
detailed computation of any such premium or the basis for determining that no
such premium is payable.

      3.   Representations.

      3.1  Representations of the Company.  The Company represents and
warrants that:

           (a)  Subsidiaries.  Exhibit B attached hereto states the name of
each Subsidiary, its jurisdiction of incorporation, the percentage of its
Voting Stock owned by the Company and/or other Subsidiaries, and whether such
Subsidiary is a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary.  Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all of the
shares of stock of each Subsidiary it purports to own, free and clear in each
case of any Lien.  All such shares have been duly issued and are fully paid
and non-assessable.

           (b)  Corporate Organization and Authority.  The Company and each
Subsidiary:

                (i)  is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
 in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation;

                (ii) has all requisite power and authority and all necessary
 licenses and permits to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
 business as now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted; and

                (iii)     is duly licensed or qualified and is in good
 standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction wherein the nature
 of the business transacted by it or the nature of the property owned or
 leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary.

           (c)  Business and Property.  You have heretofore been furnished
with a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum dated August, 1994 (the
"Memorandum"), from BA Securities, Inc. which generally sets forth the
business conducted and proposed to be conducted by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the principal properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

           (d)  Financial Statements.  

                (i)  The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
 Subsidiaries as of the last day of its fiscal year ended in each of the
 years 1989 through 1993 and the consolidated statements of income,
 consolidated statements of Members' equity and consolidated statements of
 cash flows for the fiscal years ended on said dates, each accompanied by a
 report thereon containing an opinion unqualified as to scope limitations
 imposed by the Company and otherwise without qualification except as
 therein noted, by Delap, White & Raish, have been prepared in accordance
 with GAAP consistently applied except as therein noted, are correct and
 complete and present fairly the financial position of the Company and its
 Subsidiaries as of such dates and the results of their operations and
 changes in their cash flows for such periods.  The unaudited consolidated
 balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of July 1, 1994, and
 the unaudited statements of income, Members' equity and cash flows for the
 nine-month period ended on such date prepared by the Company have been
 prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, are correct and
 complete and present fairly the financial position of the Company and its
 Subsidiaries as of such date and the results of their operations and
 changes in their cash flows for such period.

           (ii) Since October 1, 1993, there has been no change in the
 condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
 shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of such date except changes in
 the ordinary course of business, none of which individually or in the
 aggregate involve the possibility of materially adversely affecting the
 properties, business, prospects, profits or condition (financial or
 otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

           (e)  Debt and Liens.  Exhibit C attached hereto correctly
describes all Debt and Liens, if any, relating thereto, of the Company and
its Subsidiaries outstanding as of September 30, 1994.

           (f)  Full Disclosure.  Neither the financial statements referred
to in Section 3.1(d) hereof, this Agreement, the Memorandum or any other
written statement furnished by the Company to you in connection with the
negotiation of the sale of the Notes, contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein or herein not misleading.  There is no fact peculiar to the
Company or its Subsidiaries which the Company has not disclosed to you in
writing which materially adversely affects nor, so far as the Company can now
foresee, will materially adversely affect the properties, business,
prospects, profits or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

           (g)  Pending Litigation.  There are no proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or
any Subsidiary in any court or before any governmental or regulatory
authority or arbitration board or tribunal which involve the possibility of
materially adversely affecting the properties, business, prospects, profits
or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

           (h)  Title to Properties.  The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title in fee simple (or its equivalent
under applicable law) to all parcels of real property material to its
business, prospects, profits or condition (financial or otherwise) and has
good title to all the other material items of personal property it purports
to own, including that reflected in the most recent balance sheet referred to
in Section 3.1(d) hereof, except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business and except for Liens permitted by this Agreement.

           (i)  Patents and Trademarks.  The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries owns or possesses all the patents, trademarks, trade names,
service marks, copyrights, licenses, permits and rights with respect to the
foregoing necessary for the conduct of its business, without any known
conflict with the rights of others.  To the best of the Company's knowledge
after due inquiry, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under any such license or permit and no event has occurred and is
continuing under the provisions of any such license or permit which with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an event of
default thereunder.

           (j)  Sale Is Legal and Authorized.  The sale of the Notes and
compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement and
the Notes:

                (i)  are within the corporate powers of the Company;

                (ii) will not violate any provisions of any law or any order
 of any court or governmental authority and will not conflict with or result
 in any breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or
 constitute a default under the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
 Company or any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the
 Company is a party or by which it may be bound or result in the imposition
 of any Liens on any property of the Company; and

                (iii)     have been duly authorized by proper corporate
 action on the part of the Company (no action by the Members of the Company
 being required by law, by the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the
 Company or otherwise), executed and delivered by the Company and this
 Agreement and the Notes, when executed and delivered by the Company, will
 constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations, contracts and
 agreements of the Company enforceable in accordance with their respective
 terms.

           (k)  No Defaults.  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.  The Company is not in default in the payment of principal or
interest on any Debt and is not in default under any instrument or
instruments or agreements under and subject to which any Debt has been issued
and no event has occurred and is continuing under the provisions of any such
instrument or agreement which with the lapse of time or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute an event of default thereunder.

           (l)  Governmental Consent.  No approval, consent or withholding of
objection on the part of any regulatory body, state, federal or local, is
necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement or the Notes or compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions of this Agreement or the Notes.

           (m)  Taxes.  The Company is taxed as a cooperative under
Subchapter T of the Code.  All tax returns required to be filed by the
Company or any Subsidiary in any jurisdiction have, in fact, been filed, and
all taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges upon the Company
or any Subsidiary or upon any of their respective properties, income or
franchises, which are shown to be due and payable in such returns have been
paid.  For all taxable years ending on or before September 30, 1986, the
federal income tax liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been
satisfied and either the period of limitations on assessment of additional
federal income tax has expired or the Company and its Subsidiaries have
entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service closing
conclusively the total tax liability for the taxable year.  The Company does
not know of any material proposed additional tax assessment against it for
which adequate provision has not been made on its accounts, and no material
controversy in respect of additional federal or state income taxes due since
said date is pending or to the knowledge of the Company threatened.  The
provisions for taxes on the books of the Company and each Subsidiary are
adequate for all open years, and for its current fiscal period.

           (n)  Use of Proceeds.  The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes
will be used to refinance existing Debt of the Company and for general
corporate purposes.  None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the use of proceeds from the issuance of the
Notes) will violate or result in a violation of Section 7 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any regulation issued pursuant thereto,
including, without limitation, Regulations G, T and X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R., Chapter II.  Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary owns or intends to carry or purchase any "margin
stock" within the meaning of said Regulation G.  None of the proceeds from
the sale of the Notes will be used to purchase, or refinance any borrowing
the proceeds of which were used to purchase, any "security" within the
meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

           (o)  Private Offering.  Neither the Company, directly or
indirectly, nor any agent on its behalf has offered or will offer the Notes
or any similar Security or has solicited or will solicit an offer to acquire
the Notes or any similar Security from or has otherwise approached or
negotiated or will approach or negotiate in respect of the Notes or any
similar Security with any person other than the Purchaser and not more than
75 other institutional investors, each of whom was offered a portion of the
Notes at private sale for investment.  Neither the Company, directly or
indirectly, nor any agent on its behalf has offered or will offer the Notes
or any similar Security or has solicited or will solicit an offer to acquire
the Notes or any similar Security from any person so as to bring the issuance
and sale of the Notes within the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended.

           (p)  ERISA.  The consummation of the transactions provided for in
this Agreement and compliance by the Company with the provisions thereof and
the Notes issued thereunder will not involve any prohibited transaction
within the meaning of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.  Each Plan complies
in all material respects with all applicable statutes and governmental rules
and regulations, and (a) no Reportable Event has occurred and is continuing
with respect to any Plan, (b) neither the Company nor any member of the ERISA
Group has withdrawn from any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or instituted steps
to do so, and (c) no steps have been instituted to terminate any Plan.  No
condition exists or event or transaction has occurred in connection with any
Plan which could result in the incurrence by the Company or any member of the
ERISA Group of any material liability, fine or penalty.  No Plan maintained
by the Company or any member of the ERISA Group, nor any trust created
thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as defined in
Section 302 of ERISA nor does the present value of all benefits vested under
all Plans exceed, as of the last annual valuation date, the value of the
assets of the Plans allocable to such vested benefits.  Neither the Company
nor any member of the ERISA Group is a member of or contributes to any
multiple employer plan as described in ERISA.  Neither the Company nor any
member of the ERISA Group has any contingent liability with respect to any
post-retirement "welfare benefit plan" (as such term is defined in ERISA)
except for the obligation of the Company to provide post-retirement medical
insurance to certain existing employees and existing retirees, the aggregate
number of which employees and retirees is less than 150.

           (q)  Compliance with Law.  

                (i)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) is
 in violation of any law, ordinance, franchise, governmental rule or
 regulation to which it is subject; or (B) has failed to obtain any license,
 permit, franchise or other governmental authorization necessary to the
 ownership of its property or to the conduct of its business, which
 violation or failure to obtain would materially adversely affect the
 business, prospects, profits, properties or condition (financial or
 otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or impair the ability
 of the Company to perform its obligations contained in this Agreement or
 the Notes.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
 with respect to any order of any court or governmental authority or
 arbitration board or tribunal.

                (ii) Without limiting the provisions of clause (i) of this
 paragraph (q), the Company is in compliance with all applicable
 Environmental Laws, the failure to comply with which would materially
 affect adversely the properties, business, prospects, profits or condition
 (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
 ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Agreement or
 the Notes.

           (r)  Investment Company Act.  The Company is not, and is not
directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person which
is, required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

           (s)  Foreign Assets Control Regulations, etc.  Neither the Company
nor any Affiliate of the Company is, by reason of being a "national" of a
"designated foreign country" or a "specially designated national" within the
meaning of the Regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United
States Treasury Department (31 C.F.R., Subtitle B, Chapter V), or for any
other reason, subject to any restriction or prohibition under, or is in
violation of, any Federal statue or Presidential Executive Order, or any
rules or regulations of any department, agency or administrative body
promulgated under any such statute or order, concerning trade or other
relations with any foreign country or any citizen or national thereof or the
ownership or operation of any property. 

           (t)  Solvency.  Both immediately prior and immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of the Notes, the Company will not be
"insolvent" (as such term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code).

      3.2  Representations of the Purchaser.  

           (a)  You represent and in entering into this Agreement the Company
understands, that:  

                (i)  you are acquiring the Notes for the purpose of
 investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that you
 have no present intention of selling, negotiating or otherwise disposing of
 the Notes; it being understood, however, that the disposition of your
 property shall at all times be and remain within your control; and 

                (ii) you have been advised that the Notes have not been
 registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and, therefore,
 cannot be resold unless they are registered under said Act or an exemption
 from registration is available.

           (b)  You further represent that at least one of the following
statements is an accurate representation as to the source of funds to be used
by you to make your investment hereunder:

                (i)  No part of such funds constitutes assets allocated to
 any separate account maintained by you in which any "employee benefit plan"
 (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) or any trust created to
 fund the benefits thereunder has any interest; or 

                (ii) Such funds constitute assets of a specific employee
 benefit plan, complete and correct information as to the identity of which
 you have disclosed in writing to the Company; or

                (iii)     The source of funds is an "investment fund"
 managed by a "qualified professional asset manager" or "QPAM" (as defined
 in Part V of PTE 84-14, issued March 13, 1984), provided that no other
 party to the transactions described in this Agreement and no "affiliate" of
 such other party (as defined in Section V(c) of PTE 84-14) has at this
 time, and during the immediately preceding one year has exercised, the
 authority to appoint or terminate said QPAM as manager of the assets of any
 plan identified in writing pursuant to this clause 3.2(b)(iii) or to
 negotiate the terms of said QPAM's management agreement on behalf of any
 such identified plans.

      If any plan is identified pursuant to subclause 3.2(b)(ii), then the
Company shall deliver a certificate on the Closing Date, which certificate
shall state that such party is neither a "party in interest" (as defined in
Title I, Section 3(14) of ERISA) nor a "disqualified person" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), with
respect to any plan identified pursuant to subclause 3.2(b)(ii) above.  If
any plan is identified pursuant to clause 3.2(b)(iii) above, then the Company
shall deliver a certificate on the Closing Date, which certificate shall
state that neither it nor any "affiliate" (as defined in Section V(c) of PTE
84-14) is described in the proviso to said subclause 3.2(b)(iii).

      4.   Closing Conditions.  The obligation of the Purchaser to purchase a
Note on the Closing Date shall be subject to the performance by the Company
of its agreements hereunder which by the terms hereof are to be performed at
or prior to the time of delivery of the Notes and to the following further
conditions precedent:

      4.1  Legal Opinions.  Concurrently with the delivery of the Notes to
you on the Closing Date, you shall have received from Brownstein, Rask,
Arenz, Sweeney, Kerr & Grim, counsel for the Company and from Chapman and
Cutler, who are acting as your special counsel in this transaction, their
respective opinions dated the Closing Date, in form and substance
satisfactory to you and your special counsel, and covering the matters set
forth in Exhibits D and E, respectively, hereto.

      4.2  Legality.  The Notes being purchased by you on the Closing Date
shall qualify on the Closing Date as a legal investment for you under the
laws of each jurisdiction to which you may be subject (without resort to any
so-called "basket provisions" to such laws), and such purchase shall not
subject you to any penalty or other onerous condition under or pursuant to
any applicable law or governmental regulation and you shall have received
such certificates or other evidence as you may reasonably request to
establish compliance with this condition.

      4.3  Closing Certificate.  Concurrently with the delivery of Notes to
you on the Closing Date, you shall have received a certificate dated the
Closing Date, signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the President or any
Vice President or the Treasurer of the Company the truth and accuracy of
which shall be a condition to your obligation to purchase the Notes proposed
to be sold to you and to the effect that 

           (a)  the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in Section 3 hereto are true and correct on and with respect to the Closing
Date, 

           (b)  the Company has performed all of its obligations hereunder
which are to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, and 

           (c)  no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

      4.4  Satisfactory Proceedings.  All proceedings taken in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all documents
incident thereto, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to you and your
special counsel, and you shall have received a copy (executed or certified as
may be appropriate) of all documents and other evidence which you may
reasonably request in connection with such transactions and of all
proceedings taken in connection therewith in form and substance satisfactory
to you and your special counsel.

      4.5  Special Counsel Fees.  Concurrently with the delivery of the Notes
to you on the Closing Date, the Company shall have paid the fees and
disbursements of your special counsel which are referred to Section 9.6 and
reflected in the statement of your special counsel delivered on such date. 
Promptly upon receipt of supplemental statements, the Company will pay
additional fees and disbursements of your special counsel which were not paid
at the time of closing.

      4.6  Waiver of Conditions.  If on the Closing Date the Company fails to
tender to you the Notes to be issued to you on such date, or if the
conditions specified in this Section 4 have not been fulfilled, you may
thereupon elect to be relieved of all further obligations under this
Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, if the conditions specified in
this Section 4 have not been fulfilled, you may waive compliance by the
Company with any such condition to such extent you may in your sole
discretion determine.  Nothing in this Section 4.6 shall operate to relieve
the Company of any of its obligations hereunder or to waive any of your
rights against the Company.

      4.7  Reliance on Audited Financial Statements.  You shall have received
an original counterpart of a letter, substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit F attached hereto, from the Company to its independent certified
accountants confirming that you are relying upon the financial statements of
the Company audited by such accountants, together with an acknowledgment and
consent from such accountants in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Purchasers.

      5.   Company Covenants.  From and after the Closing Date and continuing
so long as any amount remains unpaid on any Note:
      5.1  Corporate Existence, Etc.  The Company will preserve and keep in
full force and effect, and will cause each Subsidiary to preserve and keep in
full force and effect, its corporate existence and all licenses and permits
necessary to the proper conduct of its business, provided that the foregoing
shall not prevent any transaction permitted by Section 5.13.

      5.2  Insurance.  The Company will maintain, and will cause each
Subsidiary to maintain, insurance coverage by financially sound and reputable
insurers and in such forms and amounts and against such risks as are
customary for corporations engaged in the same or a similar business and
owning and operating similar properties.

      5.3  Taxes, Claims for Labor and Materials, Compliance with Laws.  The
Company will promptly pay and discharge, and will cause each Subsidiary
promptly to pay and discharge, all lawful taxes, assessments and governmental
charges or levies imposed upon the Company or such Subsidiary, respectively,
or upon or in respect of all or any part of the property or business of the
Company or such Subsidiary, all trade accounts payable in accordance with
usual and customary business terms, and all claims for work, labor or
materials, which if unpaid might become a Lien upon any property of the
Company or such Subsidiary; provided the Company or such Subsidiary shall not
be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy, account payable or
claim if 

           (a)  the validity, applicability or amount thereof is being
contested in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings which will
prevent the forfeiture or sale of any property of the Company or such
Subsidiary or any material interference with the use thereof by the Company
or such Subsidiary, and 

           (b)  the Company or such Subsidiary shall set aside on its books,
reserves deemed by it to be adequate with respect thereto.  

The Company will promptly comply and will cause each Subsidiary to comply
with all laws, ordinances or governmental rules and regulations to which it
is subject including, without limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970, as amended, ERISA and all Environmental Laws, the violation of

immediately after it became or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary.  In the event
any Restricted Subsidiary ceased or ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary
subsequent to October 1, 1990, all investments of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in such Person shall be deemed to have been made at
the time such Person ceased or ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary.

           (b)  The Company will not, and will not permit its Restricted
Subsidiaries to make any payment of principal or interest on Subordinated
Debt, or pay or declare any patronage dividends, if a Default or Event of

 other corporation, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to any
 other corporation, if (A) the Company shall be the surviving or continuing
 corporation or, if the Company shall not be the surviving or continuing
 corporation or shall sell all or substantially all of its assets to a
 corporation, such surviving, continuing or purchasing corporation shall be
 incorporated under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction
 thereof and shall assume in writing all obligations of the Company under
 this Agreement and under the Notes, (B) at the time of such consolidation,

 with or into the Company or any other Person so long as (A) in any merger
 or consolidation involving the Company, the requirements of
 Section 5.13(a)(i) shall be satisfied; or (B) in any other merger or
 consolidation, at the time of such consolidation or merger and after giving
 effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
 continuing and after giving effect to such merger or consolidation, the
 Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Senior

 provided, that such transfer is permitted by Section 5.13(b)(vii).

           (b)  The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of (each referred to
as a "Transfer") any assets, except:

 the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted by Section 5.13(a);

                (ii)  Transfers in the ordinary course of business;

                (iii)  Transfers of individual assets having a book value
 less than $250,000 (for which purpose the book value of assets sold in a

                (vii)  Any other Transfers, including without limitation
 Transfers to Restricted Subsidiaries which are not Wholly-owned, provided
 that (A) after giving effect to such Transfer, the aggregate net book value
 of assets transferred subject to this provision during the then current
 Fiscal Quarter and the immediately preceding three Fiscal Quarters would
 not exceed 10% of Consolidated Total Assets computed as of the end of the
 most recent Fiscal Quarter preceding such Transfer, unless the net proceeds
 from such Transfers in excess of 10% (1) are reinvested in assets in
 related businesses, as determined by the Board of Directors, within twelve
 months from the date of such Transfers or (2) are applied to repay an
 equivalent amount of Consolidated Senior Funded Debt including premium, if
 any; (B) in the opinion of the Company, the sale is for fair value and is
 in the best interests of the Company; and (C) immediately after the
 consummation of the transaction, and after giving effect thereto, no
 Default or Event of Default would exist.

           (c)  The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to
issue or sell any shares of stock of any class (including as "stock" for the
purposes of this Section 5.13(c), any warrants, rights or options to purchase
or otherwise acquire stock or other Securities exchangeable for or
convertible into stock) of such Restricted Subsidiary to any Person other
than the Company or a Wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary, except for the
purpose of qualifying directors, or except in satisfaction of the validly
pre-existing preemptive rights of minority shareholders in connection with
the simultaneous issuance of stock to the Company and/or a Restricted
Subsidiary whereby the Company and/or such Restricted Subsidiary maintain
their same proportionate interest in such Restricted Subsidiary.

           (d)  The Company will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of

any Debt of any other Restricted Subsidiary, unless:

                (i)  simultaneously with such sale, transfer or disposition,
 all shares of stock and all Debt of such Restricted Subsidiary at the time
 owned by the Company and by every other Restricted Subsidiary shall be
 sold, transferred or disposed of as an entirety;

                (ii)  the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
 determined, as evidenced by a resolution thereof, that the retention of
 such stock and Debt is no longer in the best interests of the Company;

                (iii)  such stock and Debt is sold, transferred or otherwise
 disposed of to a Person, for a cash consideration and on terms reasonably
 deemed by the Board of Directors to be adequate and satisfactory;

                (iv)  the Restricted Subsidiary being disposed of shall not
 have any continuing investment in the Company or any other Restricted

 Section 5.13(b)(vii) hereof.

      5.14 Guaranties.  The Company will not and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to become or be liable in respect of any Guaranty
except (a) Guaranties of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in

Guaranties of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary which constitute Debt,
are limited in amount to a stated maximum dollar exposure and are permitted
by the applicable provisions of Section 5.8.

      5.15 Repurchase of Notes.  Neither the Company nor any Restricted

Notes, pro rata, from all Holders at the same time and upon the same terms. 
In case the Company repurchases or otherwise acquires any Notes, such Notes
shall immediately thereafter be cancelled and no Notes shall be issued in
substitution therefor.  Without limiting the foregoing, upon the purchase or
other acquisition of any Notes by the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or

any service by or for, any Affiliate), except in the ordinary course of and

Plans.  The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, withdraw
from any Multiemployer Plan or permit any employee benefit plan maintained by

ERISA) or the imposition of a Lien on any property of the Company or any
Subsidiary pursuant to Section 4068 of ERISA.

      5.18 Reports and Rights of Inspection.  The Company will keep, and will
cause each Restricted Subsidiary to keep, proper books of record and account

respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or the Notes unless each Holder (irrespective of the amount of
Notes then owned by it) shall be informed thereof by the Company and shall be
afforded the opportunity of considering the same and shall be supplied by the
Company with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision

      9.1  Registration and Transfer of Notes.  The Company shall cause to be

the Notes (hereinafter called the "Note Register") and the Company will
register or transfer or cause to be registered or transferred, as hereinafter
provided and under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, any Note
issued pursuant to this Note Agreement.

      A Holder may transfer a Note, upon surrender thereof at the principal
office of the Company duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer duly executed by the Holder or its attorney duly authorized in
writing.

      The Note Register shall reflect for each Purchaser the address of such
Purchaser appearing on Schedule I hereto.  Each Purchaser and each subsequent
Holder may cause its address to be changed on the Note Register by a written
instruction to the Company.

      9.2  Exchange of Notes.  At any time and from time to time, upon not
less than ten days' notice by a Holder pursuant to this Section 9.2, and upon
surrender of the Note at its office, the Company will deliver in exchange
therefor, without expense to the Holder, except as set forth below, Notes
duly registered as provided in Section 9.1 hereof, for the same aggregate
principal amount as the then unpaid principal amount of the Note so
surrendered, in the denomination of $100,000 or any amount in excess thereof
as such Holder shall specify, dated as of the date to which interest has been
paid on the Note so surrendered or, if such surrender is prior to the payment
of any interest thereon, then dated as of the date of issue, payable to such
person or persons, or registered assigns, as may be designated by such
Holder, and otherwise of the same form and tenor as the Notes so surrendered
for exchange.  The Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed upon such exchange or
transfer.

      9.3  Loss, Theft, etc. of Notes.  Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory
to the Company of the loss, theft or destruction of any Note, and upon
delivery of a bond of indemnity in such form and amount as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or upon surrender and cancellation of
any mutilated Note, the Company will make and deliver without expense to the
Holder thereof, a new Note, of like tenor, in lieu of such lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Note.  If the Purchaser or any subsequent
Institutional Holder is the owner of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Note,
then the affidavit of an authorized officer of such owner, setting forth the
fact of loss, theft or destruction and of its ownership of the Note at the
time of such loss, theft or destruction shall be accepted as satisfactory
evidence thereof and no further indemnity shall be required as a condition to
the execution and delivery of a new Note other than the written agreement of
such owner to indemnify the Company.

      9.4  Direct Payment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Notes, in the case of any Note owned by the Purchaser or its
nominee or owned by any other Institutional Holder who has given written
notice to the Company requesting that the provisions of this Section 9.4
shall apply, the Company will promptly and punctually pay when due (whether
as the result of required or optional prepayment, upon acceleration, at
maturity or otherwise) the principal thereof, interest thereon, and premium,
if any, without any presentment thereof, directly to the Purchaser or
Institutional Holder at the address of the Purchaser set forth in Schedule I
hereto or at such other address as the Purchaser or such Institutional Holder
may from time to time designate in writing to the Company or, if a bank
account is designated for the Purchaser on Schedule I hereto or in any
written notice to the Company from the Purchaser or Institutional Holder, the
Company will make such payments by bank wire transfer in immediately
available funds to such bank account before 10:00 a.m., Portland, Oregon
time, marked for attention as indicated, or in such other manner or to such
other account of the Purchaser or Institutional Holder in any bank in the
United States as the Purchaser or Institutional Holder may from time to time
direct in writing.  Any Holder to which this Section 9.4 applies agrees that
in the event it shall sell or transfer any Note it will, prior to the
delivery of the Note, make (unless it has already done so) a notation thereon
of the date to which interest has been paid on such Note.  The Company may
from time to time close its Note Register for a period not to exceed five
days prior to the date of any payment on the Notes and the Company may
postpone any transfer of Notes until opening of said Note Register.

      9.5  Pro Rata Payments.  All payments of interest or premium, if any,
and payments or prepayments of principal shall be made and applied pro rata
on all Notes outstanding in accordance with the respective unpaid principal
amounts thereof.

      9.6  Expenses, Stamp Tax Indemnity.  Whether or not the transactions
herein contemplated shall be consummated, the Company agrees to pay directly,
all of the out-of-pocket expenses of the Purchaser in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Note Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to the charges
and disbursements of Chapman and Cutler, special counsel to the Purchaser,
the cost of obtaining private placement numbers for the Notes, duplicating
and printing costs and charges for shipping the Notes, adequately insured to
the Purchaser at its home or office or at such other place as it may
designate.  The Company also agrees that it will pay and save the Purchaser
harmless against any and all liability with respect to stamp and other taxes,
if any, which may be payable or which may be determined to be payable in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Note Agreement or the
Notes, whether or not any Notes are then outstanding.  The Company agrees to
protect and indemnify the Purchaser against any liability for any and all
brokerage fees and commissions payable or claimed to be payable to any Person
retained by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Note Agreement.  In addition, the Company
agrees to pay all out-of-pocket expenses of the Holders in connection with
any amendments, waivers or consents pursuant to the provisions hereof,
including, without limitation, all legal fees and disbursements of any
counsel to the Holders.  The obligations of the Company under this
Section 9.6 shall survive payment of the Notes and the termination of this
Note Agreement.

      9.7  Powers and Rights Not Waived; Remedies Cumulative.  No delay or
failure on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power or right shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of the
same preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any
other power or right.  No waiver or consent, given or extended pursuant to
Section 7 hereof, shall extend to or affect any other obligation or right. 
The rights and remedies of a Holder are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies any Holder would otherwise have.

      9.8  Notices.  All communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing and, if to you, delivered or mailed prepaid by registered or

the benefit of your successors and assigns, including each successive Holder
or Holders.

      The closing opinion of Chapman and Cutler, special counsel to the

delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding

of 1939, as amended.

      The opinion of Chapman and Cutler shall also state that the opinion of
Brownstein, Rask, Arenz, Sweeney, Kerr & Grim is satisfactory in scope and
form to Chapman and Cutler and that, in their opinion, the Purchaser is
justified in relying thereon.  In rendering the opinion set forth in

paragraph 1, solely upon an examination of the Certificate of Incorporation
certified by, and a certificate of good standing of the Company from, the
Secretary of State of the State of Oregon, the By-laws of the Company and the
general business corporation law of the State of Oregon.  The opinion of
Chapman and Cutler is limited to the laws of the State of Illinois, the
general business corporation law of the State of Oregon and the Federal laws

                          Subordination Provisions

      1.1  Agreement of Subordination.  The Company agrees, and each holder
of a Note, by his purchase or acceptance thereof, likewise agrees, that the
payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes is hereby expressly
subordinated, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, in right
of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness (which
shall include, without limitation, the 8.42% Senior Notes issued or to be
issued under and pursuant to the Note Agreement dated as of October 10, 1994
between the Company and Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company and all
Senior Funded Indebtedness of the Company as defined in said Note Agreement,
together with all other obligations and fees due in connection therewith).

      1.2  Distribution on Dissolution and Reorganization; Subrogation of
Notes.  Upon any distribution of assets of the Company upon any liquidation,
dissolution, winding up or reorganization of the Company (whether in
bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for
the benefit of creditors or any other liquidation, dissolution, winding up or
reorganization of the Company):

      (1)  The holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to
receive payment in full, or have provision made for payment in full, of the
principal thereof, and the premium, if any, and interest thereon, and all
other obligations and fees due in connection therewith before the holders of
the Notes are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of
or interest on the Notes;

      (2)  Any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind
or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the holders
of the Notes or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of
this Article shall be paid by the liquidating trustee or agent or other
person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy,
a receiver or liquidating trustee or other trustee or agent, directly to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or
to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments
evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably
(subject to any subordination of any class of Senior Indebtedness, by the
provisions thereof, to any other class or classes of Senior Indebtedness)
according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the
principal of, and the premium, if any, and interest on, and all other
obligations and fees due in connection therewith, the Senior Indebtedness
held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full
of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution, or provision therefor, to the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness; and

      (3)  In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such payment
or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in
cash, property or securities, shall be received by the Trustee or the holders
of the Notes before all Senior Indebtedness including all other obligations
and fees due in connection therewith is paid in full, or provision made for
its payment, such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders
of Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid or unprovided for or their
representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any
indenture under which any instrument evidencing any of such Senior
Indebtedness may have been issued, as provided in the foregoing subparagraph
(2), for application to the payment of such Senior Indebtedness until all
such Senior Indebtedness, including all such other obligations and fees due
in connection therewith, shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to
any concurrent payment or distribution, or provision therefor, to the holders
of such Senior Indebtedness.
Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, including all
other obligations and fees due in connection therewith, the holders of the
Notes shall be subrogated pro rata (based on the respective amounts paid over
for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness) with the holders of
any other subordinated indebtedness of the Company that by its terms ranks
pari passu with the Notes (such subordinated indebtedness being hereafter in
this Section referred to as "pari passu indebtedness") to the rights of the
holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash,
property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness
until the principal of and interest on the Notes shall be paid in full; and,
for purposes of such subrogation, no such payments or distributions to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness, which, but for the provisions of this
Article, would have been payable or distributable to holders of the Notes or
the pari passu indebtedness, shall, as between the Company, its creditors
other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of the Notes
and the pari passu indebtedness be deemed to be a payment by the Company to
or on account of the Senior Indebtedness.  It is understood that the
provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of
defining the relative rights of the holders of the Notes and the holders of
the pari passu indebtedness and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. 
Nothing contained in this Article, in the Indenture or in the Notes is
intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its creditors other than
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the holders of the Notes, the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the
holders of the Notes the principal of and interest on the Notes as and when
the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is
intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Notes
and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness.  Upon any distribution of assets of the Company referred to in
this Article, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be entitled to
rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in
which such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or reorganization proceedings
are pending or a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other
person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the holders of the Notes
for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such
distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness
of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts
paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this
Article.

      In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that further
evidence is required with respect to the right of any person as a holder of
Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to
this Section, the Trustee may request such person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior
Indebtedness held by such person, as to the extent to which such person is
entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, and as to other
facts pertinent to the rights of such person under this Section, and, if such
evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such person
pending judicial determination as to the right of such person to receive such
payment.

      The Trustee, however, shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to
the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such
holders unless it shall negligently pay over or distribute to the holders of
the Notes or the Company or any other person, moneys or assets to which any
holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or
otherwise.

      The terms "paid in full" and "payment in full" as used in this
Section with respect to Senior Indebtedness mean the receipt, in cash, of the
principal amount of the Senior Indebtedness (and any premium due thereon) and
full interest thereon and all other obligations, fees and expenses due in
connection therewith to the date of such payment of principal.

      1.3  Payments on Notes.  In the event and during the continuation of
any default under any instrument constituting Senior Indebtedness or pursuant
to which any Senior Indebtedness is issued continuing beyond the period of
grace, if any, specified in such instrument, the Company shall not make any
payment of principal of or interest on the Notes or purchase or redeem or set
aside funds for the redemption of the Notes or otherwise acquire any Notes,
and neither the Trustee nor any holder of the Notes shall be entitled to
receive any such payment.

      Nothing contained in this Article, in the Indenture or in any of the
Notes shall, however, (a) affect the obligation of the Company to make or
prevent the Company from making, at any time, except during the pendency of
any such liquidation, dissolution, winding up, or reorganization proceedings
or during the continuation of any such default, payments of principal of or
interest on the Notes or (b) prevent the application by the Trustee or any
Paying Agent of any moneys deposited with it hereunder by the Company to the
payment of or on account of the principal of or interest on the Notes if, not
less than two business days prior to such application, the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, as the case may be, did not have written notice from the
Company or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any event prohibiting the
making of such deposit by the Company or such application by the Trustee. 
Prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee shall be
entitled to assume that no such event exists and shall not be charged with
knowledge of the existence of any such event.

      1.4  Acceleration of Notes.  If and so long as any Senior Indebtedness
is outstanding, neither the Trustee nor any holder of a Note shall have any
right to accelerate the maturity of any Note.

      1.5  Actions against the Company.  If and so long as any Senior
Indebtedness is outstanding and payment on account of principal of or
interest on the Notes is barred by this Article, neither the Trustee nor any
holder of a Note shall commence or prosecute any legal action against the
Company to obtain a judgment for principal of or interest on the Notes, or
attach, execute, levy, garnish or otherwise realize upon any assets of the
Company, or join with any creditor (unless the holder or holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of Senior Indebtedness so
join) in filing an involuntary petition against the Company under the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, as the same has been or may hereafter be amended, modified
or replaced.

      1.6  Trustee Authorized to Effectuate Subordination.  Such holder of a
Note, by his purchase or acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the
Trustee in his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the subordination provided for in this Article and appoints the
Trustee his attorney in fact for such purpose.

      1.7  Rights of Trustee as a Holder of Senior Indebtedness.  The Trustee
shall be entitled to all rights set forth in this Article with respect to any
Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent
as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Section ____ of
the Indentures or elsewhere in the Indenture, shall deprive the Trustee of
any of its rights as such holder.

      1.8  Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness.  Each holder of any
Note, by his purchase or acceptance hereof, agrees that the subordination
provisions of this Article are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a
consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness, whether such Senior
Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the
Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior
Indebtedness, and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed
conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and
continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

      1.9  Subordination Note to Be Prejudiced by Certain Acts.  No right of
any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce
subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced
or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any
act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder or by any
noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this
Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be
otherwise charged with.

      1.10 Senior Indebtedness.  Senior Indebtedness means all indebtedness
of the Company of every kind and character, whether outstanding on the date
of this Indenture or thereafter created (other than indebtedness evidenced by
____________________________), (i) for money borrowed by the Company, (ii)
for money borrowed by others and guaranteed by the Company, and (iii)
constituting purchase money indebtedness incurred for the purchase of
tangible property and for the payment of which the Company is directly or
contingently liable; unless in each case by the terms of the instrument
creating or evidencing the indebtedness or obligation it is provided that
such indebtedness or obligation is not superior in right of payment to the
Notes.

                          STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT


     THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated June 20, 1994, is
by and among UNITED GROCERS, INC., an Oregon corporation ("Buyer"), and C & K
MARKET, INC., an Oregon corporation ("Seller").

shares of common stock of the Company (the "Shares").  Buyer desires to
purchase from Seller and Seller desires to sell to Buyer 145,256 Shares,
which sum will represent 22 percent of all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Seller, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.  The transactions contemplated in this Agreement are herein referred
to as the "Purchase."

SECTION 1.     PURCHASE OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS

$5,750,000 (the "Purchase Price").

          1.3  Payment of Purchase Price.  The Purchase Price will be paid to
Seller as follows:

               (a)  A cash amount of $5,750,000 shall be paid by Buyer to
Seller on or before June 30, 1994.  

SECTION 2.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY AND SELLER

     As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
purchase the Shares, Seller represents and warrants that:

          2.1  Organization and Corporate Power.  Seller is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of
the state of Oregon and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in
which its ownership of property or conduct of business requires it to
qualify.  Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
material licenses, permits, and authorizations necessary to own and operate
its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted.  The copies of
Seller's charter documents and Bylaws that have been furnished to Buyer's
counsel reflect all amendments made thereto at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement and are correct and complete.

          2.2  Capital Stock and Related Matters.  The authorized capital
stock of the Seller consists of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, 515,000 of
which are issued and outstanding and 485,000 of which are owned, beneficially
and of record as treasury stock, by Seller and no other capital stock of the
Seller is issued and outstanding.  Seller does not have outstanding and has
not agreed, orally or in writing, to issue any stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock, nor does it
have outstanding nor has it agreed, orally or in writing, to issue any
options or rights to purchase or otherwise acquire its capital stock.  Seller
is not subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or
otherwise acquire or retire any shares of its capital stock, except as
required by the employee stock purchase plan dated September 30, 1989.  All
of the outstanding shares of the Seller's capital stock are validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable, except as required by the employee stock
purchase plan.  Seller has, and upon purchase thereof by Buyer pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement Buyer will have, good and marketable title to the
Shares, free and clear of all security interests, liens, encumbrances, or
other restrictions or claims, subject only to restrictions as to
marketability.  Assuming that the representations in Section 3.6 are true and
correct, Seller has not violated or will not violate any applicable
securities laws in connection with the offer or sale of the Shares to Buyer
hereunder.

          2.3  Purchase Agreement.  As further and as a material
consideration for Buyer's purchase of Shares heretofore identified, Seller
covenants and agrees with Buyer:  

               (a)  To cause each of its present and hereinafter acquired
retail grocery stores to become members in good standing of United Grocers,
Inc., in accordance with the Bylaws of United Grocers, Inc., for a period not
less than seven (7) years from date of Closing.  

               (b)  To use Buyer as its principal supplier and to purchase
from Buyer during the term of this Agreement, grocery, produce, meat, HABA,
and general merchandise in the aggregate weekly purchase price of not less
than 50 percent of Seller's weekly gross sales, exclusive of video, gasoline,
service center, lottery, hardware store sales, and liquor sales, to the
extent that Buyer shall now or hereinafter be able to supply such goods and
merchandise to Seller.  Said calculation of weekly purchases to be computed
on a calendar quarterly basis.  Buyer will supply Seller's requirements at
such prices and on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered
by Buyer to other purchasers from Buyer carrying on a business similar to
that of Seller in the geographical areas in which Seller operates its stores. 
If, with respect to said 50 percent purchase requirement, at any time Seller
contends that Buyer is not able to supply particular goods or merchandise
customarily stocked by retail supermarkets, or that the terms offered by
Buyer are not reasonably comparable to those offered by Buyer to other pur-
chasers described above, then Seller shall so advise Buyer in writing
specifying such contention with particularity if, within 30 days after
receipt of such notice, Buyer does not offer to supply goods or merchandise
so specified or does not advise Seller that the terms and conditions offered
are reasonably comparable to those offered to such other purchasers, Seller
shall be free to secure such specified goods and merchandise from any source
it desires.  If Buyer demonstrates that it is offering reasonably comparable
terms and Seller, nonetheless, purchases from another source, and if such
purchase violates the said 50 percent purchase requirement, then such
purchase or purchases shall constitute a default under this Agreement.  In
the event of a breach of this covenant, Seller agrees to pay Buyer as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty or forfeiture a sum computed as
follows:  

                    (i)  the average weekly purchases from date of the
agreement to the date of the breach shall be determined;

                   (ii)  the average weekly purchases so determined shall
then be multiplied by the number of weeks from the date of the breach to the
end of the term of the purchase agreement; and

                  (iii)  the computed sum shall be multiplied by two and one-
quarter percent (2 1/4%) to determine the liquidated damages due and owing
Buyer by reason of Seller's default.  Such sum shall become immediately due
and owing within 15 days from date of written notice of the liquidated
damages.  

               In addition to the foregoing liquidate damages, Buyer may, at
its option, require Seller to repurchase the stock acquired by Buyer
hereunder.  The Purchase Price to be $5,750,000, plus 22 percent of the
accumulated net earnings after date of this Agreement or the original
Purchase Price plus 12 percent per annum compounded annually, whichever sum
is higher.  Said sum shall be paid in cash 30 days following written notifi-
cation of default.  If the breach occurs other than at a year-end, an interim
closing of the books will occur as of the date of the breach to establish the
accumulated net earnings as of said date.  

               Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the expiration of
said seven (7) year period, Seller should elect not to continue to purchase
from Buyer goods and merchandise in weekly amounts as provided above, then,
in that event, Seller shall be required and hereby agrees to purchase from
Buyer the stock which is the subject of this Agreement.  The Purchase Price,
computed pursuant to the foregoing formula, will be due and owing within 30
days from date of written notice from Buyer to Seller.  All unpaid balances
shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum.  

          2.4  Authorization; No Breach.  The execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby to
which Seller is a party have been duly authorized by Seller.  This Agreement
and each other agreement contemplated hereby, when executed and delivered by
the parties thereto, will constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligation
of the Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms.  The
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and all other agreements
contemplated hereby to which Seller is a party, the offering and sale of the
Shares hereunder and the fulfillment of and compliance with the respective
terms hereof and thereof by the Seller, do not and will not (i) conflict with
or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of; (ii)
constitute a default under; (iii) result in the creation of any lien,
security interest, charge, or encumbrance upon the capital stock or assets of
Seller, (iv) give any third party the right to accelerate any obligation
under; (v) result in a violation of; or (vi) require any authorization,
consent, approval, exemption, or other action by or notice to any court or
administrative or governmental body pursuant to the charter or Bylaws of
Seller or any law, statute, rule, or regulation to which Seller is subject,
or any agreement, instrument, order, judgment, or decree to which Seller is
subject.

          2.5  Conduct of Business; Liabilities.  Seller is not in default
under, and no condition exists that, with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default of the Seller under (i) any mortgage, loan
agreement, indenture, evidence of indebtedness, or other instrument
evidencing borrowed money to which the Seller is a party or by which the
Seller or the properties of the Seller are bound; or (ii) any judgment,
order, or injunction of any court, arbitrator, or governmental agency that
would reasonably be expected to affect materially and adversely the business,
financial condition, or results of operations of the Seller taken as a whole.

          2.6  Financial Statements.  The audited balance sheet of the Seller
as of December 31, 1992, in the form attached to this Agreement as Schedule
"2.6(a)" (the "December 31, 1992 Balance Sheet"), fairly presents the

1992, in the form attached to this Agreement as Schedule "2.6(a)" (the
"December 31, 1992 Income Statement"), fairly presents the results of

in this Agreement as the "December 31, 1992 Statements."  The unaudited
balance sheet and income statement of the Seller as of December 31, 1993, and
for the 12 months then ended, in the form attached hereto as Schedule
"2.6(b)" (the "Unaudited Financial Statements"), fairly present the financial
position of the Seller as of December 31, 1993, and the results of operations
for the 12 months then ended and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and in a manner
substantially consistent with the December 31, 1992 Statements, except for
differences resulting from normally occurring audit adjustments, including,
but not limited to, income tax and tax accrual adjustments, or as noted in
the Unaudited Statements or the notes thereto.  There are no adjustments that
would be required on audit of the Unaudited Statements that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material negative effect upon the
Seller's reported financial condition.

          2.7  No Undisclosed Liabilities.  Except for liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31,
1992 (the "Statement Date"), the Seller is not subject to any material
liability or obligation that was required to be included or adequately
reserved against in the Unaudited Statements or described in the notes
thereto and was not so included, reserved against, or described.

          2.8  Absence of Certain Changes.  Except as contemplated or

any such asset, or any lease of property, including equipment, other than in
the ordinary course of business;

the ordinary course of business and in accordance with past practice;

               (h)  The discharge or satisfaction of any material lien or
encumbrance or the payment of any material liability other than current

          2.9  Title and Related Matters.  Seller has good and marketable

for property taxes not yet delinquent or payable subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and statutory or common-law liens securing the payment or per-

is not delinquent, or that is payable without interest or penalty subsequent
to the date on which this representation is given, or the validity of which

or by any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency, or
instrumentality; Seller is not subject to any arbitration proceedings under
collective bargaining agreements, or otherwise or, to the best of the

best knowledge of the directors and responsible officers of Seller, there is

          2.11  Tax Matters.  Seller has filed all United States, state,
local, and foreign tax returns and reports heretofore required to be filed by
it and has paid all taxes shown as due thereon; and no taxing authority has

investigation of the Seller for the purpose of determining whether such a
deficiency should be asserted against the Seller.

          2.12  Compliance with Laws.  Seller is, in the conduct of its
business, in compliance with all laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations,
orders, judgments, or decrees applicable to it, the enforcement of which, if

comply with such laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, orders, judgments,
or decrees.

          2.13  Insurance.  Seller is not in material default with respect to

               (g)  To the best knowledge of the directors and responsible
officers of the Seller, no employee of the Seller is subject to any
noncompetition, nondisclosure, confidentiality, employment, consulting, or
similar agreements with persons other than the Seller relating to the present
business activities of the Seller.

          2.15  Disclosure.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the schedules,
attachments, written statements, documents, certificates, or other items
prepared or supplied to Buyer by or on behalf of the Seller with respect to
the Purchase contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit a
material fact necessary to make each statement contained herein or therein
not misleading.  No responsible officer or director of the Seller has
intentionally concealed any fact known by such person to have a material
adverse effect upon the existing or expected financial condition, operating
results, assets, customer relations, employee relations, or business
prospects of the Seller, taken as a whole.

SECTION 3.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

     As a material inducement to Seller to enter into this Agreement and sell
the Shares, Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

          3.1  Organization; Power.  Buyer is a corporation duly incorporated
and validly existing under the laws of the state of Oregon, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
perform its obligations hereunder.

          3.2  Authorization.  The execution, delivery, and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby to which
Buyer is a party have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action of Buyer, and this Agreement and each such other agreement,
when executed and delivered by the parties thereto, will constitute the
legal, valid, and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, and similar statutes affecting creditors'
rights generally and judicial limits on equitable remedies.

          3.3  No Conflict with Other Instruments or Agreements.  The
execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and all other
agreements contemplated hereby to which Buyer is a party will not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, its Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws or any material agreement to which Buyer is a party
or by which Buyer is bound.

          3.4  Governmental Authorities.  Except as set forth in Schedule
"3.4," (i) Buyer is not required to submit any notice, report, or other
filing with any governmental or regulatory authority in connection with the
execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the
purchase; and (ii) no consent, approval, or authorization of any governmental
or regulatory authority is required to be obtained by Buyer or any affiliate
in connection with Buyer's execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Purchase.

          3.5  Litigation.  There are no actions, suits, proceedings, or
governmental investigations or inquiries pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, threatened against Buyer or its properties, assets, operations, or
businesses that might delay, prevent, or hinder the consummation of the
Purchase.

          3.6  Investment Representations.  

               (a)  Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its own account with
the intention of holding such securities for purposes of investment, and
Buyer has no intention of selling such securities in a public distribution in
violation of the United States securities laws or any applicable state
securities laws.  During the course of the negotiation of this Agreement,
Buyer has reviewed all information provided to it by the Seller and has had
the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from representatives
of the Seller concerning the Seller, the securities offered and sold hereby,
and the Purchase, and to obtain certain additional information requested by
Buyer.

               (b)  Buyer understands that the Shares to be purchased have
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the
"Securities Act"), by reason of a specific exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the
bona fide nature of the investment intent as expressed herein.

               (c)  Buyer understands that the Shares cannot be resold in a
transaction to which the Securities Act applies unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available.  Buyer is aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act which permit limited resale of shares purchased in a
private placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

               (d)  Buyer understands that no public market now exists for
any of the securities issued by the Seller and that it is uncertain that a
public market will ever exist for the Shares.

               (e)  Buyer understands that the certificates for the Shares
will bear the following legend:

     THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE  HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
     INVESTMENT AND NOT  WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE 
     SALE OR DISPOSITION THEREOF.  NO SUCH SALE  OR DISPOSITION MAY BE
     EFFECTED WITHOUT AN  EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED 
     THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL  REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE
     COMPANY  THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED  UNDER THE
     SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.

               (f)  Buyer acknowledges that the Shares acquired herein will
be further subject to a Buy Sell Agreement between Seller and Seller's
shareholders, a copy of which is attached hereto, marked as Schedule
"3.6(f)," and by this reference incorporated herein.   

          3.7  Brokerage.  There are no claims for brokerage commissions,
finders' fees, or similar compensation in connection with the Purchase based
on any arrangement or agreement entered into by Buyer and binding upon
Seller.  

          3.8  Option to Seller to Repurchase Shares.  In the event Seller
has performed all of its obligations under this Agreement and is not in
breach thereof and no condition exists that, with the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default under this
Agreement or any other agreement between the parties hereto, including, but
not limited to, those arising from Seller's purchase of goods from Buyer and
provided Seller has performed all of its obligations to United Resources,
Inc., then Seller is granted an option to repurchase the 145,256 Shares of
stock.  This option granted to Seller to repurchase may not be exercised
prior to June 30, 2001.  Notification of Seller's exercise of said option
shall be in writing, addressed to Buyer in care of its President.  The
purchase price will be Buyer's original cost, plus 22 percent of the accumu-
lated net earnings after date of this Agreement or Seller's original cost,
plus 12 percent per annum, compounded annually, whichever amount is greater. 
Payment shall be in cash payable to Buyer within 30 days of exercise of the
option.  If, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall become a
party to an initial public offering ("IPO") within 12 months following its
repurchase of the Shares in accordance with its option, and the consideration
received by Seller for its Shares pursuant to said IPO is greater than the
consideration paid Buyer for its Shares under the option, then, in that
event, Buyer shall be paid the higher price for the Shares repurchased by
Seller.  Payment of such greater price shall be paid to Buyer within 60 days
following receipt by Seller of such greater sum.  

          3.9  Option to Buyer to Purchase Additional Shares.  So long as
Buyer shall be a shareholder of Seller, in the event Seller desires to issue
any additional shares of stock, or in the event any of Seller's shareholders
desire to sell, assign or transfer any of their stock in Seller, then, in
that event, Seller or Seller's shareholders shall first offer unto Buyer the
right of first refusal to purchase said shares upon such terms and conditions
as the selling or transferring party is prepared to sell to a third party or
parties, net of any fees or commissions which would otherwise be charged. 
Seller or its shareholders shall provide Buyer with written notice of the
intended transfer.  Said notice shall specify the number of shares offered,
the Purchase Price and terms for payment.  Seller or its shareholders shall
also provide to Buyer all documents, instruments, agreements, offers,
appraisals, inventories, equipment lists, financial statements, and such
other material and information as Buyer may reasonably request to aid in its
decision to exercise or decline to purchase as herein provided.  Buyer shall
have a period of 45 days from date of receipt of such written notice to
accept or reject such offer.  Acceptance or rejection of the offer by Buyer
shall be evidenced by written notice from Buyer to the intended transferor
within the above specified 45 day period.  If Buyer elects to purchase such
shares, Buyer shall be irrevocably obligated to purchase upon the specified
terms contained in Seller's or Seller's shareholder's notice.  Closing of the
transaction shall be within 60 days from date of Buyer's acceptance.  Seller
or its shareholders shall provide documentation for the transfer in form
acceptable to Buyer representing and warranting that title to the transferred
stock is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and that the selling
party has requisite authority to make the transfer.  If Buyer elects not to
purchase, then Seller or its shareholders will be free to transfer the
offered shares to a third party on the identical terms offered to Buyer.  

               (a)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is acknowledged by and
between the parties hereto that a transfer, by gift or as a result of death,
of ownership of the stock owned by Raymond Nidiffer and/or June Nidiffer to
his or her lawful issue is permitted; provided such issue transferee holds
such stock subject to the terms of this Agreement and the heretofore
referenced Buy Sell Agreement marked as Schedule "3.6(f)."  

SECTION 4.     CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER

     Each and every obligation of Buyer under this Agreement is subject to

offer shall be in writing and shall remain open for acceptance by Buyer for a
period of not less than 45 days from date of the written notice of the offer.

to the performance of such obligation, covenant, or agreement or who has the
benefit of such condition, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition will not

BOWMAN and certain others by Lease Agreement dated December 1, 1983.  The
tenant's interest in the lease was assigned to Sublessor by document dated
December 17, 1987.  SANDY DEVELOPMENT CO., an Oregon corporation ("Prime
Lessor") is now the holder of the lessor's interest in the lease.  The lease
together with the Lease Amendment are hereinafter designated as "the Prime
Lease" or "Exhibit A" and by this reference are incorporated herein as if
their terms and conditions were set forth herein.  

     WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublet said premises for a period of
approximately eleven (11) years with certain renewal rights as provided in
the Prime Lease and Sublessor is willing to so sublet in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth; now, therefore,

     IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:  

     1.   Term.  

          1.1  Sublessor hereby sublets unto Sublessee those premises
described in said Exhibit A, for the remainder of the term of the Prime
Lease, which is approximately eleven (11) years, commencing on May 4, 1994.  

          1.2  The Sublessee, so long as it is not in default hereunder,
shall be granted the right to exercise any and all renewal options contained
in Exhibit A, upon the condition that Sublessee is not in default of this
Sublease, and upon the further condition that Sublessee exercise its
option(s) no later than 30 days prior to the deadline for exercise under the
Prime Lease.

     2.   Rent.  

          2.1  Sublessee covenants and agrees to pay for the whole of said
term:  (1) the rents set forth on the attached Exhibit B including basic rent
and percentage rent, which rents shall be paid to Sublessor, plus (2) all
affirmative covenants of the tenant contained in the Prime Lease including,
without limitation, those pertaining to taxes, assessments, insurance and all
of the covenants and obligations to be performed by the tenant, as set forth
in said Exhibit A, which shall be paid and performed directly to the Prime
Lessor, EXCEPT those covenants in the Prime Lease pertaining to basic rent
and additional rent based on percentage of gross sales ("Percentage Rent"),
which Sublessee shall have no obligation to pay.  

          2.2  Sublessor shall pay to the Prime Lessor promptly when due, all
payments of basic rent and of Percentage Rent which become due under the
Prime Lease during the lease term and any renewal terms.  Sublessee shall
deliver to Sublessor a written statement of its gross receipts in the
premises (as defined on the attached Exhibit B) annually or more often if
required by the terms of the Prime Lease.  

     3.   Deposits and Prorates.  

          3.1  Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all rental
or security deposits, as required pursuant to the terms and conditions of
said Exhibit A.  

          3.2  Real property taxes and assessments, common areaa maintenance
charges and any other nonrent payments required to be made under the Prime
Lease shall be prorated between the parties on a daily basis as of May 4,
1994.  

     4.   Prime Lease.  Sublessee shall be bound by and have the benefit of
the same responsibilities, rights, privileges and duties of Sublessor, as
enumerated in Exhibit A, except for the duty to pay basic rent and Percentage
Rent pursuant to Exhibit A, and covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and
hold Sublessor harmless from any and all responsibility and/or liability
which Sublessor may incur by virtue of said Exhibit A, and/or Sublessee's
occupancy of the premises during the term and any renewals of this Sublease
except with respect to payment of basic rent and Percentage Rent due pursuant
to Exhibit A.  Furthermore, Sublessee shall be bound by any subsequent
amendment, revision, supplement or addition to the Prime Lease but Sublessor
shall not enter into any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement or
addition to the Prime Lease without the prior written consent of Sublessee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld so long as the proposed
amendment does not adversely impact Sublessee.  

     5.   Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:  

          5.1  Any failure by Sublessee to pay rent pursuant to Exhibit B
when due; or any failure of Sublessee to pay any amount due under the Prime
Lease (other than basic rent and Percentage Rent), or to perform when due any
other nonrent obligation of Sublessor under the Prime Lease, or any other
nonrent default under the Prime Lease, any of which continues for up to 70
percent of the cure period provided with respect thereto in the Prime Lease;
Sublessor covenants and agrees that upon receipt from the Prime Lessor of any
notice of default or alleged default to promptly supply Sublessee with a copy
of said notice;  

          5.2  Any failure by Sublessee to perform when due any other
obligations of Sublessee hereunder within thirty (30) days after written
notice of said default except that if the failure cannot reasonably be
corrected within 30 days the Sublessee shall not be in default if Sublessee
promptly begins to correct the failure and continues to pursue such
correction to completion;  

          5.3  If any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished
to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee in connection with this
Sublease is false in any material respect when made or furnished;  

          5.4  Sublessee vacates, abandons or fails continuously to occupy
and to conduct its business on the leased premises, except as caused by a
strike, remodeling first approved by Sublessor, Act of God, or other cause
beyond the reasonable control of Sublessee or termination of this Sublease by
mutual agreement or pursuant to other agreements between the parties;
Sublessor shall respond within fifteen (15) working days to any notice from
Sublessee requesting consent to remodeling, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, or Sublessor shall be deemed to have consented;  

          5.5  Sublessee makes a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors; admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become
due; files a petition in bankruptcy; is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent;
files a petition seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition,
readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief under any present
or future statute, law or regulation; fails timely to contest the material
allegations of a petition filed against it in any bankruptcy proceeding, or
seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of any trustee, receiver
or liquidator of Sublessee or any material part of its properties.  

          5.6  Any failure by Sublessee to pay and/or satisfy within 20 days
after written notice to Sublessee specifying the failure with reasonable
particularity, any present or hereafter incurred indebtedness or obligation
of Sublessee to Sublessor with respect to the retail operation upon the
premises which exceeds $75,000 and arises from Sublessor's or United
Resources Inc.'s extensions of credit to Sublessee.  

     6.   Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:  

          6.1  Sublessor shall have the right, at its election, upon notice
to Sublessee, to terminate this Sublease or to terminate Sublessee's right of
possession in the premises without terminating this Sublease;  

          6.2  Sublessor shall have the immediate right, whether or not the
Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to Paragraph 6.1, to re-enter
and repossess the premises or any part thereof by force, summary proceedings,
ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, all without any liability
on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;  

          6.3  Sublessor may, whether or not this Sublease shall have been
terminated pursuant to Paragraph 6.1, resublet the premises, or any part
thereof, in the name of Sublessee, Sublessor or otherwise, without notice to
Sublessee, for such term or terms and for such uses as Sublessor, in its
reasonable discretion, may determine and may collect and receive rents
payable by reason of such resubletting (without any liability for any failure
to collect such rents).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sublessor shall
be subject to such common law duties of mitigation of damages, if any, as are
imposed upon the Prime Lessor;

          6.4  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any
sums required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be
required of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest
at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until
repaid; 

          6.5  Sublessor may exercise any and all other rights and remedies
afforded to the Prime Lessor upon default under the Prime Lease and any and
all other rights and remedies Sublessor may have pursuant to the laws of the
State of Oregon.  In addition to the other remedies provided above, Sublessor
shall be entitled to current damages and final damages as provided in
Paragraph 7 below, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to
injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened
violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a decree
compelling performance of this Sublease.  Notwithstanding the above,
Sublessor shall not be entitled to double damages; and           6.6  No
expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession of the premises or
any part thereof, or resubletting to the above paragraph or by operation of
law or otherwise, shall relieve Sublessee of its liabilities and obligations
under this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or resubletting.  

     7.   Damages.  

          7.1  Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of any event of default, Sublessee will
pay to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessee for
the period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether
or not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessee
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessee in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any of any
resubletting effected for the account of the Sublessee, after deducting from
such proceeds all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with such resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession
costs, brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, alteration
costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting).  Sublessee will pay
such current damages on the days on which rent would have been payable under
this Sublease in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession,
and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the same from Sublessee on each
such day.  

          7.2  Final Damages.  At any time after any such expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of any event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to Paragraph 7.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessee, and Sublessee will pay
to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessee's default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of
such demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely
difficult to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any
of (a) the rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease
from the date of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which
Sublessee shall have satisfied in full its obligations under Paragraph 7.1 to
pay current damages) for what would be the then unexpired term in the absence
of such expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value
at an assumed interest rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, over (b) the then
net rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an assumed
interest rate of ten percent (10%) per annum for the same period.  Rental
value shall be established by reference to the terms and conditions upon
which Sublessor resublets the premises if such resubletting is accomplished
within a reasonable period of time after such expiration, termination or
repossession, and otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's estimates
and assumptions of fact regarding market and other relevant circumstances,
which shall govern unless shown to be erroneous.  If any statute or rule of
law shall validly limit the amount of such liquidated final damages to less
than the amount above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be entitled to the maximum
amount allowable under such statute or rule of law.    8.   Rights
Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved
to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and
each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any
other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or
in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to insist at any time upon
the strict performance of any covenant or agreement or to exercise any
option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease shall not be
construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future.  No waiver by
Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to have been made
whether due to receipt of rent or otherwise, unless expressed in writing and
signed by Sublessor.  

     9.   Assignment and Subletting.   Sublessee acknowledges that provisions
for assignment and subletting in the Prime Lease are applicable to the Prime
Lessor and Sublessor only.  Except as provided below Sublessee will not
assign this Sublease or sublet in excess of 6,000 square feet of the premises
without the prior written consent of Sublessor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  A transfer of ownership of a majority of the issued
and outstanding stock in Sublessee, by whatever procedure, shall be deemed an
assignment of this Sublease for the purposes of this paragraph except that
transfers by sale, gift, exchange or as a result of the death of a
shareholder to the spouses and/or children of a shareholder or transfers to a
corporation, partnership, estate, trust or other entity which is controlled
by one or more shareholders of Sublessee and/or their spouses or children or
transfers between existing shareholders shall not be deemed to be an
assignment of this Sublease.  For purposes of this paragraph existing
shareholders of Sublessee are G. T. Danielson, Craig T Danielson and Carol D.
Suzuki.  

     10.  Covenants, Representations and Warranties.  

          10.1  Membership in Sublessor.  Sublessee agrees to maintain or
cause to be maintained the membership of the store in good standing with
Sublessor during the Sublease term and any renewal terms.  

          10.2  Payment of Rent by Sublessor; Indemnity.  Sublessor shall pay
all basic rent and Percentage Rent payments to the Prime Lessor promptly when
due under the Prime Lease.  Sublessor shall indemnify and defend Sublessee
and hold it harmless from any claim, loss, liability or expense arising out
of or caused by Sublessor's failure to make all such payments promptly when
due, including without limitation all costs, attorney's fees, lost profits,
expenses and damages incurred by Sublessee.  

          10.3  Payment by Sublessee.  If Sublessor fails to make any payment
of basic rent or Percentage Rent to the Prime Lessor promptly when due,
Sublessee may elect but shall not be obligated to make the payment.  All
amounts so paid by Sublessee shall be credited against any sums then or later
owed by Sublessee to Sublessor including without limitation rents owed
pursuant to this Sublease and payments for merchandise purchased from
Sublessor for this or other stores.  

          10.4  No Commissions.  Each of the parties hereto represent and
warrant that there are no brokers, finders or other persons entitled to any
fee, commission or other compensation in connection with this Sublease, and
agree to hold the other party harmless from any claims for such fees,
commissions and/or compensation.  

          10.5  Accuracy.  Sublessor hereby represents and warrants to
Sublessee that any financial statements, appraisals and other documents
submitted to Sublessee in connection with Sublessee's investigation of the
business on the premises and decision to enter into this Sublease are true,
correct, complete and accurate in every respect and that said financial
statements fairly and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial
condition and results of operations reflected therein.  

          10.6  Quiet Enjoyment.  Sublessor represents and warrants to
Sublessee that Sublessor has the right to sublease the premises to Sublessee
and that so long as Sublessee is not in default of this Sublease it shall
have quiet possession of the premises free of any claim or interference by
others.  

     11.  Security Agreement.  

          11.1  Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessee and Sublessor

"Collateral"), and that a security interest in and to the Collateral is
hereby granted to the Sublessor, and all of the Sublessee's right, title and
interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all to secure all

of all patronage rebates and rebate notes shall be paid to Sublessee.  

          11.2  Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and without

the extent they would be due under the document or instrument evidencing each
obligation and shall have the remedies of a secured party under the Code,
including without limitation the right to take immediate and exclusive

as may be necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain a perfected
security interest in the Collateral.

               (c)  If, at any time, Sublessee contends that Sublessor is not

writing, specifying such contention with particularity.  If, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such notice, Sublessor does not offer by written
notice to supply goods or merchandise so specified or does not demonstrate to
Sublessee that the terms and conditions offered are at least equal to those
offered to such other purchasers, Sublessee shall be free to secure such
specified goods and merchandise from any source which it desires.  If
Sublessor demonstrates that it is offering equal terms and in fact is
offering equal terms, and Sublessee nonetheless purchases from another
source, such purchase shall be a breach of this paragraph.

said Exhibit "A," for the term of  15 years, to and including August 18,
2009.

          1.1  Sublessee, so long as it is not in default hereunder and
further provided that no event or condition exists that, with the passage of
time or giving of notice would constitute default, shall be granted the right
to exercise the renewal options contained in Exhibit "A," as set forth in
Section 4.3 of said Exhibit.

     (2)  Sublessee covenant and agree to pay for the whole of said term the
rental hereinafter provided, together with all affirmative covenants includ-
ing, without limitation, those pertaining to minimum rent, Common Area
Charges (CAM), percentage of gross sales, taxes, assessments, insurance and
all of the covenants and obligations to be performed by Lessee, as set forth
in said Exhibit "A," and to make such payments and provide such performance
when due by the terms of the lease and amendments thereto.

     (3)  Sublessee shall, upon execution hereof, pay any and all rental or
security deposits and all other sums, except minimum rent, as required
pursuant to the terms and conditions of said Exhibit "A", and shall pay rent
to Sublessor, in accordance with the "Sublease Rent Schedule" attached
hereto.  All such rental payments to Sublessor shall be made without offset,
adjustment or deduction of any kind. 

     (4)  Sublessee shall be bound by the same responsibilities, rights,
privileges and duties as Sublessor, as enumerated in Exhibit "A" and cove-
nants and agrees to fully indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any and
all responsibility and/or liability which Sublessor may incur by virtue of
said Exhibit "A," and/or Sublessee's occupancy of the premises.  Furthermore,
Sublessee shall be bound by any subsequent amendment, revision, supplement or
addition to the prime lease between Sublessor and the prime Lessor, and to
keep the Sublessor indemnified against all actions, claims and demands
whatsoever in respect to said exhibit "A," and Sublessee's use of the demised
premises.

     4.1  Assignment and Subletting.  Sublessee acknowledges that provisions
for extension options and assignment and subletting in the Lease are applica-
ble to the prime Lessor and Sublessor only.  Sublessee will not assign this
Sublease or sublet the premises without the prior written consent of Subles-
sor which may be granted or withheld in its absolute discretion.  A direct or
indirect transfer of ownership and control of a majority of the voting stock
of a corporate Sublessee, by whatever demands, shall be deemed an assignment
of this Sublease for the purposes of this paragraph.

     4.2  Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

          (a) Membership in United Grocers, Inc.  Upon execution and during
the term hereof, Sublessee agrees to maintain or cause to be maintained the
membership of the store in good standing in United Grocers, in accordance
with the Bylaws of United Grocers, as long as this Sublease remains in
effect.

          (b)  Purchases from Sublessor.  Sublessee agrees that throughout
the term of the Sublease and any extensions or renewals thereof, except as
hereinafter provided, Sublessee will purchase from Sublessor not less than
fifty-eight percent (58%) of its retail sales of all goods and merchandise
required by it for resale on the premises to the extent that Sublessor shall
now or hereafter be able to supply such goods and merchandise to Sublessee,
and Sublessor will supply all of Sublessee's requirements at such prices and
on such terms as are reasonably comparable to those offered by Sublessor to
other purchasers from Sublessor carrying on businesses similar to that of the
Sublessee in the Sonoma County area of the State of California.  If, at any
time, the Sublessee contends that Sublessor is not able to supply particular
goods or merchandise customarily stocked by retail supermarkets in the Sonoma
County area, or that terms offered by Sublessor are not reasonably comparable
to those offered by Sublessor to other purchasers described above, the
Sublessee shall so advise Sublessor in writing, specifying such contention
with particularity.  If, within 30 days after receipt of such notice,
Sublessor does not offer to supply goods or merchandise so specified or does
not advise Sublessee that the terms and conditions offered are reasonably
comparable to those offered to such other purchasers, Sublessee shall be free
to secure such specified goods and merchandise from any source which it
desires.  If Sublessor demonstrates that it is offering reasonably comparable
terms, and Sublessee nonetheless purchases from another source, such purchase
or purchases shall not be an exception from the 58% requirement specified
above.  If the above percentage requirements are not complied with, it shall
constitute a default hereunder.  In the event of a breach of this purchase
covenant, Sublessor may terminate this sublease and, in addition to the
remedies hereinafter offered Sublessor, Sublessee agrees to pay Sublessor, as
liquidated damages, and not as a penalty or forfeiture, a sum computed as
follows:

               1.  The average weekly purchases from the date of the agree-
     ment to the date of the breach shall be determined;

               2.  the average weekly purchases so determined shall then be
     multiplied by the number of weeks from the date of the breach to the end
     of the term of the purchase agreement; and

               3.  The computed sum shall be multiplied by two and one-
     quarter percent (2-1/4 %) to determine the liquidated damages due and
     owing Sublessor by reason of Sublessee's default.  Said sum shall become
     immediately due and owing within 15 days from date of written notice of
     the liquidated damages.

          (c)  Sublessee covenants that as long as this Sublease remains in
effect, and for an additional period of six (6) months thereafter, Sublessee
shall not directly or indirectly sell or permit the sale of the store and the
owners of Sublessee shall not directly or indirectly sell controlling
interests in Sublessee (whether in one or a series of related transactions)
without first offering to sell said store or controlling interest, as the
case may be, to Sublessor upon the same terms and conditions as the Sublessee
or its owners, as the case may be, are prepared to accept from a third party. 
Prior to such sale by the Sublessee or its owners, the Sublessee shall first
notify Sublessor of the desire to sell the store or controlling interest in
the Sublessee and of all the terms and conditions of such sale and shall
provide to Sublessor all documents, instruments, agreements, offers, accep-
tances, appraisals, inventories, equipment lists, leases, financial state-
ments and such other material and information as Sublessor may reasonably
request to aid in its decision to exercise or decline its right to purchase
as hereinafter provided.  Within 30 days following receipt of such notice of
desire to sell and all materials and information reasonably requested by
Sublessor, Sublessor shall advise Sublessee whether Sublessor elects to
purchase or declines to purchase the store or such controlling interest upon
the offered terms and conditions.  If Sublessor shall elect to purchase,
Sublessor shall purchase and the Sublessee or its owners shall sell, such
retail grocery business or such controlling interest, as the case may be, all
on the terms set forth in the offer.  If Sublessor declines the purchase, the
Sublessee or its owners shall be free to sell the store or controlling
interest, as the case may be, upon (and only upon) the terms and conditions
offered as aforesaid to Sublessor; provided that such sale is consummated
within 120 days following the date Sublessor declined the purchase, and if
such sale is not consummated in accordance  with the offered terms and
conditions within said 120-day period, the provisions of this paragraph shall
apply again and no subsequent sale of any portion of the offered store or
controlling interest may be effected without again offering the same to
Sublessor as provided herein.  Sublessor may waive its rights under this
section provided such waiver is in writing.  The foregoing provisions shall
not apply to transfers of assets or interests by sale, gift or as a result of
death to the lawful issue of Sublessee, or transfers of assets to a corpora-
tion or partnership or transfers of a controlling interest to a trust as long
as such corporation, partnership or trust is controlled by the transferor;
provided such transferee agrees that it holds such assets or controlling
interest subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph.

          (d)  Sublessee represents and warrants that there are no brokers,
finders or other persons entitled to any fee, commission or other compensa-
tion  in connection with this Sublease, and agree to hold Sublessor harmless
from any claims for such fees, commissions and/or compensation.

          (e)  Sublessee hereby represents and warrants to Sublessor that the
financial statements, appraisals and other documents submitted to Sublessor
in connection herewith or pursuant hereto are and shall be true, correct,
complete and accurate in every respect and said financial statements fairly
and accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations reflected herein.

     (5)  Security Agreement.

          5.1  Grant, Collateral and Obligations.  Sublessee and Sublessor
agree that this Sublease shall constitute a security agreement within the
meaning of the Oregon Uniform Commercial Code (hereinafter referred to as the
"Code") with respect to:

               (a)  required cash deposits (as defined in the Bylaws of
Sublessor) presently or hereafter held by or deposited with Sublessor by
Sublessee;

               (b)  any and all patronage rebates and rebate notes represent-
ing patronage rebates (as defined in the Bylaws of Sublessor) earned or
hereafter earned by reason of patronage of Sublessor by Sublessee;

               (c)  subject to liens securing purchase money financing
therefor as described in Exhibit "X," all trade, store and other fixtures and
all leasehold  improvements and all equipment and other personal property of
Sublessee used or useful in the operation of the store in or on the premises,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired including, without limitation, the
property described in Exhibit "Y", attached hereto, if any; and

               (d)  all replacements of substitutions for, and additions to
the foregoing, and the proceeds thereof (all of said personal property and
the replacements, substitutions and additions thereto and the proceeds
thereof being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Collat-
eral"), and that a security interest in and to the Collateral is hereby
granted to the Sublessor, and the Collateral and all of the Sublessee's
right, title and interest therein are hereby assigned to the Sublessor, all
to secure all presently existing or hereafter incurred direct, indirect,
absolute or contingent indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of
Sublessee to Sublessor (referred to as "the Obligations" herein) including,
but not limited to, the payment of all rent and other sums and the
performance of all other obligations of Sublessee under this Sublease, all
renewals and extensions thereof, the price of goods, services and merchandise
purchased by Sublessee from Sublessor from time to time, and all costs of
collection, legal expenses and attorneys' fees paid or incurred by Sublessor
in enforcing any rights in respect to the Obligations or in connection with
assembling, collecting, selling or otherwise dealing with or realizing upon
the Collateral.

          5.2  Security Agreement Warranties.  In addition to and without
limiting the force or effect of any other covenants, representations and
warranties of Sublessee contained in this Sublease, Sublessee hereby cove-
nants, represents and warrants to and with Sublessor as follows:

               (a)  Sublessee is  the owner of the Collateral free and clear
of liens, security interests and encumbrances of every kind and description,
except liens, security interests and encumbrances securing indebtedness to
Sublessor and liens described on Exhibit "X," hereto to which Secured Party
has consented ("Permitted Liens").

               (b)  Sublessee will not sell, dispose of, encumber or permit
any other security interest, lien or encumbrance to attach to the Collateral
except the security interest of Sublessor and the Permitted Liens.

               (c)  All tangible Collateral shall be kept at Sublessee's
place(s) of business located on the premises, and Sublessee shall not permit
the same to be removed therefrom without the prior written consent of
Sublessor.

               (d)  Sublessee shall keep the tangible Collateral at all times
insured against risks of loss or damage by fire (including so-called extended
coverage), theft and such other casualties as Sublessor may reasonably
require, all in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms,
for such periods and written by such companies or underwriters as Sublessor
may approve.  All such policies of insurance shall name Sublessor as loss
payee thereon as its interest may appear and shall provide for at least 30
days' prior written notice of modification or cancellation to Sublessor. 
Sublessee shall furnish Sublessor with certificates of such insurance or
other evidence satisfactory to Sublessor as to compliance with the provisions
of this paragraph.  Sublessor may act as attorney-in-fact for Sublessee in
making, adjusting and settling claims under and canceling such insurance and
endorsing Sublessee' name on any drafts drawn by insurers of the Collateral.

               (e)  Sublessee will keep the Collateral in good order and
repair, shall not waste or destroy the Collateral or any part thereof, and
shall not use the Collateral in violation of any statute, ordinance or policy
of insurance thereon.  Sublessor may examine and inspect the Collateral at
any reasonable time or times, wherever located.

               (f)  Sublessee will pay promptly when due all taxes and
assessments upon the Collateral or for its use or operation or upon this
Sublease or upon any instruments evidencing the Obligations.

               (g)  Sublessee will pay promptly when due all indebtedness
secured by any lien or other security interest in the Collateral, whether
superior or junior to the security interest established hereby.

          5.3  Additional Remedies.  Upon any default hereunder and at any
time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), Sublessor at
its option may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable and shall
have the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of
California (the "Code"), including without limitation the right to take
immediate and exclusive possession of the Collateral.

          5.4  Financing Statements.  Sublessee will at their own cost and
expense, upon demand, furnish to Sublessor such financing statements and
other documents in form satisfactory to Sublessor and will do all such acts
and things as Sublessor may at any time or from time to time request or as
may be necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain a perfected
security interest in the Collateral.

          5.5  Attorneys' Fees.  In the event of the institution of any suit
or action to terminate this Sublease, or to enforce the terms or provisions
hereto, Sublessee shall and does hereby agree to pay, in addition to the
costs and disbursements provided by statute, reasonable attorneys' fees in
such proceedings or on any appeal from any judgment or decree entered
therein.

     (6)  Default.  The following shall constitute a default under this
Sublease:

          6.1  Any failure by Sublessee to pay, when due, rent or any other
amount due under the Lease or to perform any other obligation of Sublessor
under the Lease or any other default under the Lease which continues for up
to one-half of the cure period as defined in the lease, provided with respect
thereto in the Lease;

          6.2  Any failure by Sublessee to pay when due rent or any other
amount due under this Sublease or to perform when due any other obligation of
Sublessee hereunder;

          6.3  If any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished
to Sublessor by or on behalf of the Sublessee is false in any material
respect when made or furnished;

          6.4  Any failure by Sublessee to pay when due and/or satisfy any
other present or hereinafter incurred indebtedness or obligation of Sublessee
to Sublessor, including but not limited to those arising from Sublessee's
purchases of goods and services from Sublessor any other loans or leases
Sublessee may have or enter into with Sublessor, and Sublessee's obligations
under the Bylaws of Sublessor and its application for membership in Subles-
sor;

          6.5  If Sublessee vacates or abandon the premises or allows the
premises to remain vacant or unoccupied;

          6.6  If Sublessee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
or if, with or without Sublessee's acquiescence, a petition in bankruptcy is
filed against Sublessee, or Sublessee is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent,
or a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for all or part of Subless-
ee's assets, or a petition or answer is filed by or against Sublessee seeking
or acquiescing in any reorganization, liquidation or similar relief under any
federal, state or local law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other
relief for debtors; and

          6.7  If Sublessee sells or otherwise disposes of all or any
substantial portion of the assets of Sublessee located at or associated with
the store, other than inventory sold at retail in the ordinary course of
business.

     (7)  Remedies.  In the event of any default under this Sublease:

          7.1  Sublessor shall have the right, at its election then or at any
time thereafter, upon notice to Sublessee, to terminate this Sublease or to
terminate Sublessee's rights of possession in the premises without terminat-
ing this Sublease;

          7.2  Sublessor shall have the immediate right, whether or not the
Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1, to re-enter
and repossess the premises or any part thereof by force, summary proceedings,
ejectment or any other legal or equitable process, all without any liability
on Sublessor's part for such entry, repossession or removal;

          7.3  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to), whether
or not this Sublease shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 7.1,
resublet the premises, or any part thereof, in the name of Sublessee,
Sublessor or otherwise, without notice to Sublessee, for such term or terms
and for such uses as Sublessor, in its absolute discretion, may determine and
may collect and receive rents payable by reason of such resubletting (without
any liability for any failure to collect such rents);

          7.4  Sublessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) procure
any insurance, pay any rentals, taxes or liens, make any repairs, pay any
sums required to be paid, and to do and perform such other acts as may be
required of Sublessee hereunder, and any payments so made shall bear interest
at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the time of such payment until
repaid; and

          7.5  Sublessor may exercise any and all other rights and remedies
afforded to the prime Lessor upon default under the Lease and any and all
other rights and remedies Sublessor may have as provided herein, pursuant to
the laws of the State of California.  In addition to the other remedies
provided above, Sublessor shall be entitled to current damages and final
damages as provided in paragraph (8) below, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted
or threatened violation, of any of the provisions of this Sublease, or to a
decree compelling performance of this Sublease.

          7.6  No expiration or termination of this Sublease, repossession of
the premises or any part thereof, or resubletting of the premises or any part
thereof, whether pursuant to the above paragraph or by operation of law or
otherwise, shall relieve Sublessee of its liabilities and obligations under
this Sublease, all of which shall survive such expiration, termination,
repossession or resubletting.

     (8)  Damages.

          8.1  Current Damages.  In the event of any expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, Sublessee will
pay to Sublessor the rent and other sums required to be paid by Sublessee for
the period to and including the date of such expiration, termination or
repossession; and, thereafter, until the end of what would have been the term
in the absence of such expiration, termination or repossession, and whether
or not the premises or any part thereof shall have been resublet, Sublessee
shall be liable to Sublessor for, and shall pay to Sublessor, as liquidated
and agreed current damages the rent and other sums which would be payable
under this Sublease by Sublessee in the absence of such expiration,
termination or repossession, less the net proceeds, if any, of any resublett-
ing effected for the account of Sublessee, after deducting from such proceeds
all of Sublessor's expenses reasonably incurred in connection with such
resubletting (including, without limitation, all repossession costs, broker-
age commissions, legal expenses, attorney's fees, employee expenses, alter-
ation costs and expenses of preparation for such resubletting).  Sublessee
will pay such current damages on the days on which rent would have been
payable under this Sublease in the absence of such expiration, termination or
repossession, and Sublessor shall be entitled to recover the same from
Sublessee on each such day.

          8.2  Final Damages.  At any time after any such expiration or
termination of this Sublease or repossession of the premises or any part
thereof by reason of the occurrence of an event of default, whether or not
Sublessor shall have collected any current damages pursuant to paragraph 8.1,
Sublessor shall be entitled to recover from Sublessee, and Sublessee will pay
to Sublessor on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages for
Sublessee's default and in lieu of all current damages beyond the date of
such demand (it being agreed that it would be impracticable or extremely
difficult to fix the actual damages), an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (a) the rent and other sums which would be payable under this Sublease
from the date of such demand (or, if it be earlier, the date to which
Sublessee shall have satisfied in full its obligations under paragraph 8.1 to
pay current damages) for what would be the then unexpired term in the absence
of such expiration, termination or repossession, discounted to present value
at an assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, over (b) the
then net rental value of the premises discounted to present value at an
assumed interest rate of seven percent (7%) per annum for the same period. 
Rental value shall be established by reference to the terms and conditions
upon which Sublessor resublets the premises if such resubletting is accom-
plished within a reasonable period of time after such expiration, termination
or repossession, and otherwise established on the basis of Sublessor's
estimates and assumptions of fact regarding market and other relevant
circumstances, which shall govern unless shown to be erroneous.  If any
statute or rule of law shall validly limit the amount of such liquidated
final damages to less than the amount above agreed upon, Sublessor shall be
entitled to the maximum amount allowable under such statute or rule of law.

     (9)  Rights Cumulative, Nonwaiver.  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to Sublessor is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute.  The failure of Sublessor to
insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement
or to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Sublease
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. 
No waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease shall be deemed to
have been made whether due in the receipt of rent or otherwise, unless
expressed in writing and signed by Sublessor.

     (10) Notices.  Any notice or demand required or permitted to be given
under this Sublease shall be deemed to have been properly given when, and
only when, the same is in writing and has been deposited in the United States
Mail, with postage prepaid, to be forwarded by registered or certified mail
and addressed to the party to be notified at the address appearing below its
signature.  Such addresses may be changed from time to time by serving of
notice as above provided.

     (11) Right of Refusal:  If, during the term of this sublease, or any
extension hereof, Sublessee or any successor to Sublessee shall receive a
bona fide offer to purchase the business being operated under this sublease,
i. e., goodwill, fixtures and/or equipment and inventory or the property of
which the premises are a part, which offer is acceptable to Sublessee,
Sublessor shall have the right to purchase the business (or the property)
upon the same terms and conditions.  Sublessee agrees to immediately, upon
receipt of such offer, to give Sublessor written notice of the terms and
conditions thereof, and the Sublessor shall have the right, for thirty (30)
days after receipt of such notice, to exercise its option to purchase under
the identical terms and conditions of such offer.  Sublessor's exercise of
its option shall be given in writing, within said thirty-day period.

     (12) Additional Provisions.
