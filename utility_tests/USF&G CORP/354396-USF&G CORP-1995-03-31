*USF&G adopted SFAS No. 133 in 1993 which requires the effects of reinsurance
activity to be reported on a gross basis.  Prior to 1993 information presented
for property/casualty insurance segment is net of applicable reinsurance
amounts.


USF&G Company reinsures portions of its policy risks with other insurance
companies or underwriters and remains contingently liable under these contracts
(ceded reinsurance). In addition, it assumes policy risks from other insurance
companies and through participation in pools and associations (assumed
reinsurance). (Refer to the Assumed Reinsurance Category discussion on page 3 of
this Form 10-K.)

Ceded reinsurance allows USF&G Company to obtain indemnification against losses
associated with insurance contracts it has written by entering into a
reinsurance contract with another insurance enterprise (the reinsurer). USF&G
Company pays (cedes) an amount to the reinsurer who agrees to reimburse USF&G
Company for a specified portion of any claims paid on business under the
reinsured contracts. Reinsurance gives USF&G Company the ability to write
certain individually large risks or groups of risks, and control its exposure to
losses by ceding a portion of such large risks. USF&G Company's ceding
reinsurance agreements are generally structured on a treaty basis whereby all
risks meeting a certain criteria are automatically reinsured.

USF&G Company may also use supplemental facultative reinsurance based on an
underwriter's evaluation of characteristics of a specific insured risk. The
following table summarizes the approximate extent of the Company's reinsurance
coverages.

                            Coverage
Risk Type                 Percentage      Retention      Coverage
Property Cat Program (a)         95%    $75 million  $140 million

Commercial Umbrella             100      15 million     5 million


(a) Second Event Coverage purchased lowers retention to $50 million for second
    catastrophe.
(b) Retention of individual property losses are $1 million, but can be increased
    to $4 million subject to underwriting criteria.
(c) Represents limits at December 31, 1994. Fourth layer canceled for 1995,
    reducing limit to $25 million.
(d) Represents limits at December 31, 1994.  Accident and Health Workers'
    Compensation Catastrophe Coverage canceled for 1995, reducing limit to $425
    million.

Commercial Category: Commercial coverages provide protection related to property
loss, liability claims and workers' compensation benefits to businesses and
other institutions. This type of insurance protects against loss from damage to
the insured's covered properties and protects against legal liability for
injuries to other persons or damage to their property arising from the insured's
business operations. Workers' compensation provides benefits to employees, as
mandated by state laws, for employment-related accidents, injuries or illnesses.

Personal Category: Personal coverages for automobile and homeowners insurance
include aspects of property loss and liability risks. Automobile policies cover
liability to third-parties for bodily injury and property damage, and cover
physical damage to the insured's own vehicle resulting from collision and
various other perils. Homeowners policies protect against loss of dwellings and

Assumed Reinsurance Category: USF&G Company operates a separate reinsurance
division which underwrites treaty reinsurance and is composed of various wholly-
owned subsidiaries. The lead company in this group, F&G Re, Inc., acts as the
reinsurance underwriting manager and solicits and services assumed reinsurance
for USF&G Company. F&G Re, Inc., writes reinsurance in North America and in
specific foreign countries (mainly in Western Europe and Japan). Reinsurance
prices and conditions are not normally subject to the same state regulation
applicable to the primary insurance market because reinsurers contract solely
with other insurance companies. Selected data for the reinsurance category are
as follows:

Fidelity/Surety Category: Fidelity bonds indemnify employers against the
dishonesty or default of employees in their employment. These types of bonds are
written for mercantile businesses, financial institutions, and public officials.
Surety bonds guarantee the performance of a principal who undertakes contractual
or statutory obligations, and indemnify third-party obligees for damages caused
by the principal's failure to perform. Selected data for the fidelity/surety

Single premium deferred annuities ("SPDAs") offer the owner the option of
receiving a lump sum distribution at a future date or a series of fixed payments
over a specified period.  Tax-sheltered annuity ("TSA") products, which provide
retirement income, are a type of deferred annuity.  Other annuities consist of
single premium immediate annuities ("SPIAs"), which provide for payments that
begin within one year after the sale and continue over a fixed period or an
individual's lifetime.  Structured settlements are immediate annuities
principally sold through the property/casualty company in settlement of
insurance claims.

Other insurance products include recurring and single premium universal life and
term insurance that generally provide a fixed benefit upon the death of the
insured.  These products were sold on an individual and group basis.  However,
F&G Life sold its group life business in 1991.  Universal life insurance
provides a death benefit for the life of the insured and accumulates cash values
to which interest is credited.  Term life insurance provides a fixed death
benefit if the insured dies during the contractual period.

Universal life products, which represent all the permanent life insurance sales
in 1992 through 1994, and have been the majority of permanent life insurance
sales since 1988, also include a cash value component that is credited with
interest at competitive rates.  The interest rates are applied to premiums for
one year from receipt; new rates are declared quarterly on recurring premium
policies and semi-monthly on single premium policies.  Universal life cash
values are charged for the cost of life insurance coverage and for
administrative expenses.  Additional information on the F&G Life's products is
discussed on page 21 of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

The parent company performs corporate functions including managing the capital
requirements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The noninsurance
operations include management consulting services, asset management services,
and discontinued operations. As a result of restructuring, there were no oil and
gas operating losses in 1994 and 1993.  During 1992, the investment in oil and
gas properties was merged with another oil and gas exploration and production
company. Discontinued operations included certain investment management,
leasing, marketing, and travel services, and other noninsurance operations.
During 1994, the Corporation committed to a plan to consolidate its home office
operations in Baltimore, Maryland at its Mount Washington facility.  The parent
company recognized facilities exit costs of $211 million representing the
present value of the rent and other operating expenses to be incurred under the
lease on the Corporation's principal office building from the time USF&G
vacates the building through the expiration of the lease in 2009.  (Refer to
Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Corporation's
1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.)

1.3.  DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS

The Corporation's subsidiaries market a full range of property/casualty
insurance and life insurance products.

Property/Casualty Insurance:  USF&G Company's products have been sold
exclusively by independent agents since its founding in 1896.  Independent
agents generally represent multiple insurance companies. USF&G Company's
products are sold through approximately 3,800 independent agencies in the United
States on a commission basis.


As of December 31, 1994, USF&G Company maintained 5 regional offices and 30
branch offices to service its independent agents and policyholders. The regional
offices are located in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and Western areas, and
in Mississippi. The branch offices are located throughout the United States.
These offices support the administration of underwriting standards, the delivery
of policies, and the supervision of the Company's claim offices.  In the first
quarter of 1995, the Company eliminated the Midwest regional office and
consolidated its business into the other regional offices.  This measure was
taken to save expenses as well as increase efficiency of operations.

Life Insurance:  F&G Life's sales by distribution system are as follows:

(in millions)                   1994          1993          1992
Direct-structured settlements    $88           $66           $37

National brokerage                46            14             -
National wholesaler               71            39             -
Other                             33            37            51
     Total                      $286          $205          $155

Structured settlements are annuities sold predominantly through the
property/casualty company in settlement of certain of its insurance claims.
Tax-sheltered annuities are sold through a national wholesale distribution
network primarily to teachers.  SPDAs are sold primarily through independent
agents and insurance brokers.  Prior to 1992, most SPDAs were sold through
securities brokerage firms (New York Stock Exchange member firms and other
financial institutions).

1.4.  COMPETITION
Property/Casualty Insurance: The property/casualty insurance industry is highly
competitive with about 2,400 companies nationwide. These insurers are not only
stock companies, but also mutual companies and other underwriting organizations.
USF&G Company ranked 24th in the industry, based on 1993 statutory net premiums
written and 23rd based on 1993 statutory policyholders' surplus. USF&G Company
competes with other property/casualty insurance companies whose products are
distributed through national, regional and local independent agencies, direct
sales and brokers. Consumers may also use self-insurance, which includes captive
insurance subsidiaries.

Pricing is a primary means of competition in the property/casualty industry. The
industry is currently in a period of significant price competition, which
adversely affects USF&G Company's profitability. Availability and quality of
products, quality and speed of service (including claims service), financial
strength, distribution systems and technical expertise are also important
elements of competition. In personal and other lines offered by USF&G Company,
significant price competition is experienced from direct-writing companies that
do not use independent agents and generally have lower policy acquisition costs.

Life Insurance:  The Corporation's life insurance subsidiaries operate in a
competitive environment, with approximately 1,300 companies in the industry
including stock and mutual companies.  F&G Life ranked 86th in the United States
based on 1993 statutory assets and 97th based on 1993 statutory capital and
surplus.

In the life insurance industry, interest crediting rates, policy features,
financial stability and service quality are important competitive factors.  F&G
Life's products compete not only with those offered by other life insurance
companies, but also with other income accumulation-oriented products offered by
other financial institutions.  F&G Life has experienced considerable competitive
pressure in recent periods as a result of its relatively lower credit ratings.
Competitive pressures for agency business also have intensified in recent years
because of an increase in the variety of products available in the market and
efforts of competitors to expand their market shares.

Premium Rates:  Most states have laws requiring that rate schedules and other
information be filed with a regulatory authority for substantially all property,
casualty, and surety lines. Some states permit insurers to use rates without
prior regulatory approval whereas other states prohibit implementation of new
rates without such approval. The authority may disapprove a filing if it finds
that the rates are inadequate, excessive, or unfairly discriminatory. Rates are
not necessarily uniform for all insurers. In states that require prior approval
of rates, regulators usually require the submission of historical data to
justify rate increases and, accordingly, there is often a time lag between
identifying the need for rate increases and securing such increases. The effect
of this lag is particularly severe in times of rising claims and inflation.
Rates for life insurance are generally not regulated.

1.5. INVESTMENTS
Investing the net cash flows from operations is a major aspect of the
property/casualty and life insurance businesses. The components of the
Corporation's investment portfolio and investment performance are discussed on
pages 23 through 27, 43 through 45, 48 and 49 of the 1994 Annual Report to
Shareholders, which pages are incorporated herein by reference.

1.6. PROPERTY/CASUALTY LOSS RESERVES
1.6a.  General
The reserve liabilities for property/casualty losses and loss expenses represent
estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses incurred through December 31 of each year. The reserves are determined
using adjusters' individual case estimates and actuarially based statistical
projections.

USF&G Company's estimates of losses for reported claims are established
judgmentally on an individual case basis. Such estimates are based on a claim
adjuster's particular expertise with the type of risk involved and knowledge of
circumstances surrounding the individual claims. These estimates are reviewed on
a regular basis and updated as additional facts become known.

The reserves derived from statistical projections are subject to the effects of
trends in claim severity and frequency. Statistical projections are employed in
three specific areas: 1) to calculate bulk reserves for incurred but not
reported ("IBNR") losses and provide for development of case basis loss
reserves; 2) to calculate allocated loss expense reserves; and 3) to calculate
unallocated loss expense reserves.

IBNR and Case Development Reserves: USF&G Company's estimates of IBNR and case
development reserves are derived from analyses of historical patterns of
development of paid and reported losses by accident year for each line of
business. The loss projection procedures used in this analysis contain explicit
provisions for quantifying the effect of inflation on loss payments expected to
be made in the future. This process relies on the basic assumption that past
experience adjusted for the effect of current developments and likely trends is
an appropriate basis for predicting future events.

Loss Expense: USF&G Company's estimates of unpaid loss expenses are based on
analyses of the long-term relationship of projected ultimate loss expense to
projected ultimate losses for each line of business. By using incurred losses as
a base, inflation assumptions applicable to loss reserves apply equally to
allocated expense reserves.

Unallocated Loss Expense: Unallocated loss expense reserves are based on
historical relationships of paid unallocated expenses to paid losses. As with
allocated loss expenses, the inflation assumptions applicable to loss reserves
are presumed to apply equally to unallocated expense reserves.

The process of estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses is
inherently judgmental. The process is influenced by factors which are subject to
significant variation. Possible sources of variation include changing rates of
inflation (particularly medical cost inflation) as well as changes in other
economic conditions, the legal system and internal claims settlement practices,
among other variables. In many cases significant periods of time may lapse
between the occurrence of an insured event, the reporting of a claim to USF&G
Company and USF&G Company's final settlement of the claim. More than 46 percent
of USF&G Company's loss and loss expense reserves are provided for claims which
have been incurred but not reported and for future development on reported
claims. While USF&G Company reports a single amount as the estimate for unpaid
loss and loss expenses as of each valuation date, the reported reserves should
be considered the best estimate from a range of possible outcomes. It is
unlikely that future losses and loss expenses will develop exactly as projected
and may in fact vary significantly from projections. These estimates are
continually reviewed and updated as experience develops and new information
becomes known. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operating
results.

1.6b. Discounted Loss Reserves
The reserves for permanent-total disability benefits and long-term medical care
benefits under workers' compensation insurance are discounted at rates of
interest generally ranging from 3 percent to 5 percent. The carrying amount of
such workers' compensation reserves, net of reinsurance and net of discount, was
$1.60 billion, $1.75 billion, and $1.80 billion at December 31, 1994, 1993, and
1992, respectively. The discount is amortized over the expected lifetimes of the
claimants. Discounted reserves come from three sources: reserves assumed from
the Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Bureau (WCRB), reserves assumed from
residual market pools, and reserves for USF&G Company's net retained business.

(in millions)                                      1994     1993     1992
Estimated discount, January 1                      $508     $680     $683

Estimated discount amortized                        (35)     (34)     (32)
Estimated discount, December 31                    $441     $508     $680

The source of the negative discount accrual of $32 million in 1994 results from
an acceleration in the underlying payment pattern of workers' compensation
claims.  An increase in the use of structured settlements to resolve claims is
the primary factor affecting the change in the payment stream.  The source of
the negative discount accrual of $34 million in 1993 results from the WCRB
commutation and the concurrent reduction in discount rates.  Additionally, the
discount was reduced by a redistribution of reserves to states and
re-apportionment on reserves assumed from residual market pools.

The following table reconciles the changes in loss and loss expense reserves for
the years presented.

1.6d. Analysis of Loss and Loss Expense Reserve Development
The following table shows property/casualty loss reserves net of ceded
reinsurance as recorded in the indicated years, subsequent payments made with
respect to such reserves and re-estimates of such reserves.  The top line shows
the estimated liability that was recorded at the end of each of the indicated
years for all current and prior year unpaid losses and loss expenses.  The upper
portion of the table shows the cumulative amount subsequently paid in succeeding
years.  The lower portion of the table shows re-estimates of the original
recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year. Such re-estimations
result from development of additional facts and circumstances pertaining to
unsettled claims.  The bottom line shows the dollar amount of the cumulative
change through 1994 that is attributable to the original recorded reserve for
each prior year.  Such change has been reflected in income of subsequent years.

A new table, added in 1994, provides data gross of ceded reinsurance for the
carried reserve at year ends 1993 and 1994 and the development of the year end
1993 reserve.  This information immediately follows the Analysis of Net Loss and
Net Loss Expense Reserve Development Table.  Additional years of development
will be added to the gross of ceded reinsurance table until it reaches the
dimensions of the original table.

Conditions and trends that have affected reserve development in the past have
changed and may not necessarily occur in the future.  Therefore, care should be
exercised in extrapolating future reserve redundancies or deficiencies from such
development.

</TABLE>
*Certain reserves are recorded on a discounted basis to reflect the value of
timing differences between the recording of reserves and subsequent payment.
The amortization of that discount is included in the reserve deficiencies shown
above.

The net development table shows a $5 million decrease in the current year on
prior year incurred loss and loss expenses net of ceded reinsurance.  Although
the overall development is flat, there are a number of offsetting occurrences.
Adverse development resulted from discount amortization in workers' compensation
and reserve strengthening in general liability for environmental and asbestos
liabilities.  The adverse development was offset by favorable development in
both personal and commercial auto liability.

A decrease of $15 million in the current year on prior year incurred loss and
loss expenses gross of ceded reinsurance is shown on the gross development
table.  The gross development table shows more favorable development than the
net development table due to favorable development on losses ceded to
reinsurers.

In the table above all entries are shown net of ceded reinsurance.  Each column
total shows reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year for each
accident year.  Adverse development on accident years prior to 1986 is primarily
attributable to workers' compensation discount amortization and environmental
and asbestos reserve strengthening is concentrated in the older accident years.
Ongoing review of automobile liability reserves indicates more favorable
projections of ultimate incurred loss than previously recognized on accident
years 1991 and subsequent.

1.6e. Loss Portfolio Transfers
Also included in the table "Analysis of Net Loss and Net Loss Expense
Reserve Development" are various loss portfolio transfer transactions. These
transactions are reinsurance contracts that do not involve the same type of risk
as traditional reinsurance.  In a loss portfolio reinsurance contract, USF&G
Company assumes another insurer's outstanding loss reserves for a price equal to
their discounted value plus a fee. These contracts generally provide for fixed
loss payments at specified future dates.  The financial risk involved is whether
the investment income earned on the cash received will cover the discount
associated with the losses assumed. This financial risk is controlled by the
Corporation's asset/liability management techniques, which involve matching the
maturities of the investment portfolio to expected patterns of future claim and
benefit payments.

Loss portfolio transfers have had no impact on reported reserve deficiencies and
no future loss development, either adverse or favorable, is anticipated. Loss
portfolio transfers included in outstanding reserves were as follows:

(in millions)
1994          $86
1993          110
1992          123
1991          279
1990          324
1989          397
1988          394
1987          355

1.6f. Structured Settlements
Structured settlements represent the settlement of claims through the purchase
of annuities. While they result in accelerated claim payments, structured
settlements generally reduce the ultimate amount of losses paid. Structured
settlements are used primarily in the third-party liability and workers'
compensation lines of business. These types of settlements were not used
extensively on liability lines until 1985. Their use was extended to workers'
compensation claims in 1987. The number of such settlements has grown steadily
and they appear to be having an impact on claim payment patterns. USF&G Company
has developed procedures to ensure that the impact of structured settlements is
given appropriate recognition in estimating ultimate reserve liabilities.

1.6g. Reconciliation of Liability for Loss and Loss Expenses from SAP to GAAP
The following table presents the differences between property/casualty insurance
claim reserves reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and the consolidated
annual statement filed with state insurance departments in accordance with
statutory accounting practices ("SAP"):

1.7. LIFE BENEFIT RESERVES
Ordinary life insurance future policy benefit reserves are computed under the
net level premium method using assumptions for future investment yields,
mortality, and withdrawal rates.  These assumptions reflect F&G Life's
experience, modified to reflect anticipated trends, and provide for possible
adverse deviation.  Reserve interest rate assumptions are graded and range from
4.25 percent to 8.25 percent.

Universal life and annuity reserves are computed on the retrospective deposit
method, which produces reserves equal to the cash value of the contracts.  Such
reserves are not reduced for charges that would be deducted from the cash value
of policies surrendered.  Reserves on single premium annuities with guaranteed
payments are computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces reserves
equal to the present value of future benefit payments.

The table below shows F&G Life's benefit reserves by policy type.

1.8. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
The risks insured by the Corporation's insurance subsidiaries are geographically
diversified primarily throughout the United States.  The Corporation has
established a subsidiary to market fidelity/surety insurance in Canada.
Reinsurance risks are incurred throughout North America and specific foreign
countries (mainly in Western Europe and Japan). The products marketed by the
Corporation's management consulting subsidiary, a part of noninsurance
operations, are distributed throughout the world. Total assets and revenues of
foreign operations are not material.  The tables below show the composition of
statutory voluntary direct premiums written for the Corporation's
property/casualty operations and statutory premium income of its life insurance
operations by region for the year ended 1994.

Item 2.  Business Properties

Real estate owned and used in the regular conduct of business consists of 12
business properties located in various cities throughout the United States. The
Corporation's Mount Washington Center, located in Baltimore, Maryland, is the
principal owned property. This is the headquarters for the life insurance
operations, and the location of the information systems, and training and
development complexes.

In addition, the Corporation leases approximately 120 offices in various cities
in the regular course of business. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The principal leased property is a 40-story home office
building in Baltimore, Maryland, sold in 1984 and leased back by the
Corporation.  During 1994, the Corporation committed to a plan to consolidate
its home office operations in Baltimore, Maryland at its Mount Washington
facility.  The facilities exit costs of $183 million represent the present value
of the rent and other operating expenses to be incurred under the lease on the
Corporation's principal office building from the time USF&G vacates the building
through the expiration of the lease in 2009.  (Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Corporation's 1994 Annual Report to
Shareholders.)

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

The Corporation's insurance subsidiaries are routinely engaged in litigation in
the normal course of their business, including defending claims for punitive
damages.  As a liability insurer, they defend third-party claims brought against
their insureds. As an insurer, they defend themselves against coverage claims.

In the opinion of management, such litigation and the litigation described in
Section 8.1 and 8.2 of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section
and note are herein incorporated by reference, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on USF&G Corporation's consolidated financial position,
although it is possible that the results of operations in a particular quarter
or annual period would be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of 1994.

N/A - Not applicable to life insurance pursuant to Rule 12-16 of Regulation S-X.
(a) Other policyholders' funds, net investment income, and other operating
expenses are not allocated to property/casualty categories.
(b) Unpaid losses and loss expenses reflect the implementation of SFAS No. 113,
"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts," which increased liabilities by $1.2 billion with a corresponding
increase in assets at December 31, 1993. This standard requires reinsurance
receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums to be reported separately as assets
instead of the previous practice of netting such receivables against the related
loss and unearned premium liabilities.

(a) Reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustments reflect the implementation
of SFAS No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts," which increased liabilities by $1.2 billion with a
corresponding increase in assets at December 31, 1993. This standard requires
reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums to be reported
separately as assets instead of the previous practice of netting such
receivables against the related loss and unearned premium liabilities.
(b) Certain long-term disability payments for workers' compensation are
discounted at rates ranging from 3% to 5%.

                               USF&G CORPORATION

                                   BY-LAWS

ARTICLE I.

STOCKHOLDERS


SECTION 1.01.   Annual Meeting.

        The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to
elect directors and transact any other business within its powers at such time
and on such day within the month of May as shall be fixed by the Board of
Directors.  Except as the Articles of Incorporation or statute provides
otherwise, any business may be considered at an annual meeting without the
purpose of the meeting having been specified in the notice.  Failure to hold an
annual meeting does not invalidate the Corporation's existence or affect any
otherwise valid corporate acts.


SECTION 1.02.   Special Meeting.

        At any time in the interval between annual meetings, a special meeting
of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President
or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting or in writing
(addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation) with or without a meeting.


SECTION 1.03.   Place of Meetings.

        Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place in the United
States as is set from time to time by the Board of Directors.


SECTION 1.04.   Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice.

        Not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90) days before each
stockholders' meeting, the Secretary shall give written notice of the meeting to
each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting.  The notice shall state the
time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special meeting or notice
of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the meeting.  Notice is
given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to him, left at his
residence or usual place of business, or mailed to him at his address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, each person who is entitled to notice waives notice if he before or
after the meeting signs a waiver of the notice which is filed with the records
of stockholders' meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by proxy.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to
reconvene at the same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any
such adjourned meeting other than by announcement.


SECTION 1.05.   Quorum; Voting.

        Unless statute or the Articles of Incorporation provides otherwise, at a
meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders
entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting
constitutes a quorum and a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at
which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly
comes before the meeting.  In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders present
in person or by proxy, by majority vote and without notice other than by
announcement, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall
attend.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any
business may be transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  In the event
that at any meeting a quorum exists for the transaction of some business but
does not exist for the transaction of other business, the business as to which
a quorum is present may be transacted by the holders of stock present in person
or by proxy who are entitled to vote thereon.


SECTION 1.06.   General Right to Vote; Proxies.

        Unless the Articles of Incorporation provides for a greater or lesser
number of votes per share or limits or denies voting rights, each outstanding
share of stock, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.  In all elections for
directors, each share of stock may be voted for as many individuals as there are
directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be
voted.  A stockholder may vote the stock he owns of record either in person or
by written proxy signed by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney in
fact.  Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than eleven
(11) months after its date.


SECTION 1.07.   List of Stockholders.

        At each meeting of stockholders, a full, true and complete list
of all stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, showing the number and
class of shares held by each and certified by the transfer agent for such class
or by the Secretary, shall be furnished by the Secretary.


SECTION 1.08.   Conduct of Voting.

        At all meetings of stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by
judges, the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching
the qualification of votes and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or
rejection of votes shall be decided, by the chairman of the meeting.  If
demanded by stockholders, present in person or by proxy, entitled to cast
ten percent (10%) in number of votes entitled to be cast, or if ordered by the
chairman, the vote upon any election or question shall be taken by ballot and,
upon like demand or order, the voting shall be conducted by two inspectors, in
which event the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions
touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the
acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided, by such inspectors.  Unless
so demanded or ordered, no vote need be by ballot and voting need not be
conducted by inspectors.  The stockholders at any meeting may choose an
inspector or inspectors to act at such meeting, and in default of such
election the chairman of the meeting may appoint an inspector or inspectors.  No
candidate for election as a director at a meeting shall serve as an inspector
thereat.


ARTICLE II.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS


SECTION 2.01.   Function of Directors.

        The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the
direction of its Board of Directors.  All powers of the Corporation may be
exercised by or under authority of the Board of Directors, except as conferred
on or reserved to the stockholders by statute or by the Articles of
Incorporation or By-Laws.


SECTION 2.02.   Number of Directors.

        The Corporation shall have at least three (3) directors at all times;
provided that, if there is no stock outstanding, the number of directors may be
less than three (3) but not less than one (1), and, if there is stock
outstanding and so long as there are less than three (3) stockholders, the
number of directors may be less than three (3) but not less than the number of
stockholders.  The Corporation shall have the number of directors provided in
the Articles of Incorporation until changed as herein provided.  A majority of
the entire Board of Directors may alter the number of directors set by the
Articles of Incorporation to not exceeding twenty-five (25) nor less than
the minimum number then permitted herein, but the action may not affect the
tenure of office of any director.


SECTION 2.03.   Election and Tenure of Directors.

        At each annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect directors to hold
office until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and
qualify.


SECTION 2.04.   Removal of Director.

        The stockholders may remove any director, with or without cause, by the
affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast for the
election of directors.


SECTION 2.05.   Vacancy on Board.

        The stockholders may elect a successor to fill a vacancy on the Board of
Directors which results from the removal of a director.  A majority of the
remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum, may fill
a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from any cause except an
increase in the number of directors and a majority of the entire Board of
Directors may fill a vacancy which results from an increase in the number of
directors.  A director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy
serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is
elected and qualifies.   A director elected by the stockholders to fill a
vacancy which results from the removal of a director serves for the balance of
the term of the removed director.


SECTION 2.06.   Regular Meetings.

        After each meeting of stockholders at which a Board of Directors shall
have been elected, the Board of Directors so elected shall meet as soon as
practicable for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other
business; and in the event that no other time is designated by the stockholders,
the Board of Directors shall meet one hour after the time for such stockholders'
meeting or immediately following the close of such meeting, whichever is later,
on the day of such meeting.  Such first regular meeting shall be held at any
place in or out of the State of Maryland as may be designated by the
stockholders, or in default of such designation at the place designated by the
Board of Directors for such first regular meeting, or in default of such
designation at the place of the holding of the immediately preceding meeting of
stockholders.  No notice of such first meeting shall be necessary if held as
hereinabove provided.  Any other regular meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held on such date and at any place in or out of the State of Maryland
as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.


SECTION 2.07.   Special Meeting.

        Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by
the Chairman of the Board or the President or by a majority of the Board of
Directors by vote at a meeting, or in writing with or without a meeting.  A
special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any
place in or out of the State of Maryland as may be designated from time to time
by the Board of Directors.  In the absence of such designation such meeting
shall be held at such place as may be designated in the call.


SECTION 2.08.   Notice of Meeting.

        Except as provided in Section 2.06, the Secretary shall give notice to
each director of each regular and special meeting of the Board of Directors.
The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting.  Notice is given to a
director when it is delivered personally to him, left at his residence or usual
place of business, or sent by telegraph or telephone, at least twenty-four (24)
hours before the time of the meeting or, in the alternative by mail to his
address as it shall appear on the records of the Corporation, at least seventy-
two (72) hours before the time of the meeting.  Unless the By-Laws or a
resolution of the Board of Directors provide otherwise, the notice need not
state the business to be transacted at or the purposes of any regular or special
meeting of the Board of Directors.  No notice of any meeting of the Board of
Directors need be given to any director who attends, or to any director who, in
writing executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or
after the holding thereof, waives such notice.  Any meeting of the Board of
Directors, regular or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the
same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any such adjourned
meeting other than by announcement.


SECTION 2.09.   Action by Directors.

        Unless statute or the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws require a
greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present is action of the Board of Directors.  A
majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum, the directors present
by majority vote and without notice other than by announcement may adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend.  At any such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which
might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be
taken without a meeting, if a unanimous written consent which sets forth the
action is signed by each member of the Board and filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board.


SECTION 2.10.   Meeting by Conference Telephone.

        Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting by means
of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.
Participation in a meeting by these means constitutes presence in person at a
meeting.


SECTION 2.11.   Compensation.

        By resolution of the Board of Directors a fixed sum and expenses, if
any, for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors
or of committees thereof, and other compensation for their services as such or
on committees of the Board of Directors, may be paid to directors (excluding
directors who are officers of the Corporation).  A director who serves the
Corporation in any other capacity also may receive compensation for such other
services, pursuant to a resolution of the directors.


SECTION 2.12.   Advisory Directors.

        The Board of Directors may appoint, from time to time, Advisory
Directors to provide advice to, and to serve as a resource for, the Board of
Directors and management.  Such Advisory Directors shall serve solely at the
pleasure of the Board of Directors and may attend meetings of the Board of
Directors, or selected portions thereof; in an observer capacity on a regular or
selected basis as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors
or the Chairman of the Board.  Advisory Directors shall not constitute members
of the Board of Directors for any purpose and accordingly shall not count
towards a quorum of the Board of Directors or have any vote with respect to any
action taken or required to be taken by the Board of Directors, or otherwise
have any responsibilities or rights of members of the Board.  Advisory Directors
may be paid such fees and may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection
with attendance of regular or special meetings as the Board of Directors shall
authorize by resolution.


ARTICLE III.

COMMITTEES


SECTION 3.01.   Committees.

        The Board of Directors may appoint from among its members an Executive
Committee and other committees composed of two (2) or more directors and
delegate to these committees any of the powers of the Board of Directors, except
the power to declare dividends or other distributions on stock, elect directors,
issue stock other than as provided in the next sentence, recommend to the
stockholders any action which requires stockholder approval, amend the By-Laws,
or approve any merger or share exchange which does not require stockholder
approval.  If the Board of Directors has given general authorization for
the issuance of stock, a committee of the Board, in accordance with a general
formula or method specified by the Board by resolution or by adoption of a stock
option or other plan, may fix the terms of stock subject to classification or
reclassification and the terms on which any stock may be issued, including all
terms and conditions required or permitted to be established or authorized by
the Board of Directors.


SECTION 3.02.   Procedure.

        Each committee may fix rules of procedure for its business.  A majority
of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business and the act of a majority of those present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the committee.  The members of a committee
present at any meeting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may appoint a
director to act in the place of an absent member.  Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of a committee may be taken without a
meeting, if a unanimous written consent which sets forth the action is signed by
each member of the committee and filed with the minutes of the committee.  The
members of a committee may conduct any meeting thereof by conference telephone
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10.


SECTION 3.03.   Emergency.

        In the event of a state of disaster of sufficient severity to
prevent the conduct and management of the affairs and business of the
Corporation by its directors and officers as contemplated by the Articles of
Incorporation and the By-Laws, any two (2) or more available members of the then
incumbent Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum of that Committee for
the full conduct and management of the affairs and business of the Corporation
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01.  In the event of the
unavailability, at such time, of a minimum of two (2) members of the then
incumbent Executive Committee, the available directors shall elect an Executive
Committee consisting of any two (2) members of the Board of Directors, whether
or not they be officers of the Corporation, which two (2) members shall
constitute the Executive Committee for the full conduct and management of the
affairs of the Corporation in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section.  This Section shall be subject to implementation by resolution of the
Board of Directors passed from time to time for that purpose, and any provisions
of the By-Laws (other than this Section) and any resolutions which are contrary
to the provisions of this Section or to the provisions of any such implementary
resolutions shall be suspended until it shall be determined by any interim
Executive Committee acting under this Section that it shall be to the advantage
of the Corporation to resume the conduct and management of its affairs and
business under all the other provisions of the By-Laws.

SECTION 4.04.   Vice Presidents.

        The Vice President or Vice Presidents, at the request of the President,
or in his absence, or during his inability to act, shall perform the duties and
exercise the functions of the President, and when so acting shall have the
powers of the President.  If there be more than one Vice President, the Board
of Directors may determine which one or more of the Vice Presidents shall
perform any of such duties or exercise any of such functions, or if such
determination is not made by the Board of Directors, the President may make such
determination; otherwise any of the Vice Presidents may perform any of such
duties or exercise any of such functions.  The Vice President or Vice Presidents

incident to the office of a secretary of a corporation, and such other duties as
are from time to time assigned to him by the Board of Directors or the

may from time to time authorize any committee or officer to appoint other

qualifies.  If the Board of Directors in its judgment finds that the best
interests of the Corporation will be served, it may remove any officer or
agent of the Corporation.  The removal of an officer or agent does not prejudice
any of his contract rights.  The Board of Directors (or any committee or officer

     fide  purchaser  in  whose hands such Securities  are  valid obligations of
     the Company;

provided, however, that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite
principal  amount of the Outstanding  Securities  have given  any  request,
demand, authorization,  direction,  notice, consent  or  waiver  hereunder, (A)
the principal  amount  of  an Original  Issue  Discount Security that shall  be
deemed  to  be Outstanding  shall  be the amount of the principal  thereof  that

except  that,  in  determining  whether  the  Trustee  shall   be
protected   in   relying   upon   any   such   request,   demand,
authorization,  direction,  notice,  consent  or   waiver,   only Securities
which the Trustee knows to be so owned  shall  be  so disregarded.  Securities
so owned which have been pledged in good faith  may  be regarded as Outstanding
if the pledgee establishes to  the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's

the Company  or  any  other  obligor  upon  the  Securities  or   any Subsidiary

or representations by, counsel, unless such  officer knows, or in the exercise

certificate, opinion or representation by  an  accountant or firm of accountants
in the  employ  of  the Company,  unless  such officer or counsel, as the  case

certificate, opinion or representation with respect to  such accounting  matters
upon  which its  certificate,  statement  or opinion may be based is erroneous.

Section 104.  Acts of Holders; Record Dates.

      (a)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver  or other action provided or permitted  by  this Indenture to be given or
taken by Holders may be embodied in  and evidenced  by  one  or more instruments
of substantially  similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent
duly appointed in  writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly  provided,
such  action  shall  become effective  when  such  instrument  or instruments
are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is  hereby
expressly   required,  to  the  Company.   Such   instrument   or instruments
(and  the  action  embodied  therein  and  evidenced thereby)  are  herein
sometimes referred to as the "Act"  of  the
Holders  signing  such  instrument  or  instruments.   Proof   of execution  of
any such instrument or of a writing appointing  any such  agent shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and  (subject to Section 601)
conclusive in favor of the  Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner
provided in this Section.

     (b)  The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit  of  a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary  public or  other  officer  authorized
by law to take acknowledgments  of deeds, certifying that the individual signing
such instrument  or writing  acknowledged to him or her the execution thereof.
Where such  execution  is by a signer acting in a capacity  other  than such
signer's individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit
shall   also   constitute  sufficient  proof  of  such   signer's
authority.   The  fact  and date of the  execution  of  any  such instrument  or
writing, or the authority of the Person  executing the  same,  may  also  be
proved in any other  manner  which  the Trustee deems sufficient.

      (c)  The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust
Indenture  Act, fix any day as the  record  date  for  the purpose  of
determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities  of any  series  entitled  to
give  or  take  any  request,  demand,
authorization,  direction,  notice,  consent,  waiver  or   other action, or to
vote on any action, authorized or permitted  to  be given  or  taken  by
Holders of Outstanding Securities  of  such
series.    If  not  set  by  the  Company  prior  to  the   first solicitation
of a Holder of Securities of such series made by any Person in respect of any
such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record
date for any such action  or vote  shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date
of  the  most recent  list  of  Holders  required to be  provided  pursuant  to
Section  701)  prior to such first solicitation or vote,  as  the case  may  be.
With regard to any record date for action  to  be taken  by  the Holders of one
or more series of Securities,  only the  Holders of Securities of such series on
such date (or  their duly  designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or
take,  or vote on, the relevant action.

      (d)   The  ownership of Securities shall be proved  by  the Security
Register or by a certificate of the Security Registrar.

      (e)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security  shall bind  every future
Holder of the same Security and the Holder  of every  Security issued upon the
registration of transfer  thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in
respect of anything done,  omitted  or  suffered to be done by  the  Trustee  or
the Company  in  reliance thereon, whether or not  notation  of  such action is
made upon such Security.

      (f)   Without  limiting the foregoing,  a  Holder  entitled hereunder to
give or take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do
so with regard to all or any  part  of the  principal  amount of such Security
or by one  or  more  duly appointed  agents  each  of which may  do  so
pursuant  to  such appointment  with  regard to all or any different  part  of
such principal amount.

Section 105.  Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.

      Any  request,  demand,  authorization,  direction,  notice, consent,
waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided  or permitted  by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or  furnished to, or filed with,

     (1)   the  Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall  be sufficient
     for  every  purpose hereunder  if  made,  given, furnished or filed in
     writing to or with the Trustee at  its
     Corporate   Trust   Office,   Attention:   Corporate   Trust Department, or

           (2)  the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be  sufficient
     for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein  expressly provided)
     if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company
     addressed to it at the address  of  its  principal office specified  in
     the  first paragraph  of this instrument, Attention: Treasurer,  (until
     another  address is furnished in writing to the  Trustee  by the Company).

Section 106.  Notice to Holders; Waiver.

      Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of  any event,  such
notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein  expressly provided)
if in writing and mailed, first-class postage  prepaid, to each Holder affected
by such event,  at  its address  as  it appears in the Security Register, not
later  than the  latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date
(if  any),  prescribed for the giving of such  notice;  provided, however,  that
the  Company or the Trustee, upon  a  good  faith determination  that mailing is
in the circumstances  impractical, may give such notice by any other method
which, in the reasonable belief  of  the  Company or, in the case of the
Trustee,  of  the Company and the Trustee, is likely to be received by the
Holders.  In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the
failure  to  mail such notice, nor any defect in  any  notice  so mailed, to any
particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency  of such  notice with respect to
other Holders.  Where this Indenture provides  for notice in any manner, such
notice may be waived  in writing  by  the  Person entitled to receive such
notice,  either before  or  after  the  event,  and  such  waiver  shall  be
the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed
with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent  to  the
validity of any action taken in reliance  upon such waiver.

      In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason
of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then
such notification as shall be made with the  approval  of  the  Trustee  shall
constitute  a  sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Section 107.  Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

      If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a  provision
of  the Trust Indenture Act that is required  under such  Act  to be a part of
and govern this Indenture, the  latter provision  shall  control.  If any
provision  of  this  Indenture modifies  or  excludes any provision of the Trust
Indenture  Act that  may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision  shall
be  deemed  to apply to this Indenture as so modified  or  to  be excluded, as
the case may be.

Section 108.  Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

      The  Article and Section headings herein and the  Table  of Contents  are
for  convenience only and  shall  not  affect  the construction hereof.

Section 109.  Successors and Assigns.

      All  covenants  and  agreements in this  Indenture  by  the Company  shall
bind  its  successors  and  assigns,  whether  so expressed or not.

Section 110.  Separability Clause.

     In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities
shall   be  invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable,  the  validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

Section 111.  Benefits of Indenture.

      Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express  or implied, shall
give to any Person, other than the parties  hereto and  their  successors
hereunder and the Holders, any benefit  or any  legal  or  equitable  right,
remedy  or  claim  under  this Indenture.

Section 112.  Governing Law.

      This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by  and construed  in
accordance with the laws of the State of New  York, but without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws.

Section 113.  Legal Holidays.

     In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or  Stated
Maturity of any Security or the last day on  which  a Holder  has  the  right
to convert a Security  at  a  particular conversion  price shall not be a
Business Day  at  any  Place  of Payment,  then  (notwithstanding  any  other
provision  of  this Indenture  or  of the Securities (other than a provision  of
the Securities  of  any series which specifically  states  that  such provision
shall  apply  in  lieu of this  Section))  payment  of interest  or  principal
(and premium, if any) or conversion  need not  be  made at such Place of Payment
on such date, but  may  be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such
Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest
Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no
interest  shall accrue with respect to such payment  for  the period from and
after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the
case may be.

Section 114.   Personal     Immunity    from    Liability     for Incorporators,
               Stockholders, Etc.

     No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or  premium,
if any, or interest, if any, on any Security, or for any claim based thereon, or
otherwise in respect of any Security, or  based  on  or in respect of this
Indenture or  any  indenture supplemental  hereto, against any incorporator,  or
against  any past,  present  or future stockholder, director  or  officer,  as
such, of the Company or of any successor corporation, whether  by virtue  of
any constitution, statute or rule of law, or  by  the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise,  all  such liability being expressly waived
and released as a condition  of, and as consideration for, the execution of this
Indenture and the issue of the Securities.

entire indebtedness of this Security or (2)  certain restrictive covenants and
Events of Default with respect to  this Security,  in  each case upon compliance

      [If  the Security is convertible into Common Stock  of  the Company,
insert -- Subject to the provisions of  the  Indenture, the  Holder of this
Security is entitled, at its option,  at  any
time  on or before                     (except that, in case this Security  or
any portion hereof shall be called for  redemption, such  right  shall
terminate with respect to  this  Security  or portion  hereof, as the case may
be, so called for redemption  at the  close  of  business  on the date  fixed
for  redemption  as provided  in the Indenture unless the Company defaults in
making the payment due upon redemption), to convert the principal amount of
this  Security (or any portion hereof which is $1,000  or  an integral  multiple
thereof), into fully paid and  non-assessable shares  (calculated as to each
conversion to the nearest  1/100th of  a  share) of the Common Stock of the
Company, as said  shares shall be constituted at the date of conversion, at the
conversion price of $_____ principal amount of Securities for each share  of
Common  Stock, or at the adjusted conversion price in  effect  at the  date  of
conversion determined as provided in the Indenture, upon  surrender  of this
Security, together with  the  conversion notice  hereon  duly executed, to the
Company at  the  designated
office   or   agency   of   the  Company  in  __________________, accompanied
(if  so required by the Company) by  instruments  of transfer, in form

business on the Interest Payment  Date next following such Regular Record Date
(unless this Security  or the portion being converted shall have been called for
redemption on  a Redemption Date during such period), also be accompanied by
payment in funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal  to the  interest
payable  on  such Interest  Payment  Date  on  the
principal amount of this Security then being converted.   Subject to  the
aforesaid requirement for payment and, in the case  of  a conversion  after  the
Regular Record Date  next  preceding  any Interest  Payment  Date  and on or
before such  Interest  Payment Date,  to  the  right  of  the Holder of this
Security  (or  any Predecessor  Security) of record at such Regular Record  Date
to receive  an  installment  of interest  (with  certain  exceptions provided
in  the  Indenture), no adjustment is  to  be  made  on conversion for interest
accrued hereon or for dividends on shares
of  Common  Stock  issued  on conversion.   The  Company  is  not required to
issue fractional shares upon any such conversion, but shall  make  adjustment
therefor in cash  on  the  basis  of  the current  market value of such
fractional interest as provided  in the Indenture.  The conversion price is
subject to adjustment  as provided  in the Indenture.  In addition, the
Indenture  provides
that   in  case  of  certain  consolidations,  mergers  or  share exchanges  to
which  the  Company is a  party  or  the  sale  of substantially  all  of the
assets of the Company,  the  Indenture
shall  be  amended,  without  the  consent  of  any  Holders   of securities, so
that this Security, if then outstanding,  will  be convertible thereafter,
during the period this Security shall  be convertible as specified above, only
into the kind and amount  of
securities,   cash  and  other  property  receivable   upon   the consolidation,
merger, share exchange or sale by a holder of  the number  of shares of Common
Stock into which this Security  might have  been  converted  immediately prior
to  such  consolidation, merger,  share exchange or sale (assuming such holder
of  Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election and received  per
share  the  kind and amount received per share by a plurality  of non-electing
shares) [, assuming if such consolidation,  merger,
share  exchange or sale is prior to          , 19   ,  that  this Security  were
convertible at the time  of  such  consolidation, merger,  share  exchange or
sale at the initial conversion  price
specified above as adjusted from                 , 19    to  such time  pursuant
to the Indenture.  In the event of conversion  of this Security in part only, a
new Security or Securities for  the unconverted  portion hereof shall be issued
in the  name  of  the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

     [If the Security is convertible into other securities of the Company,
specify the conversion features.]

     [If the Security is not an Original Issue Discount Security, insert  --  If
an Event of Default with respect to Securities  of this  series shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of  the Securities of this series may be declared
due and payable in  the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.]

      [If  the  Security is an Original Issue Discount  Security, insert  --  If
an Event of Default with respect to Securities  of this series shall occur and
be continuing, an amount of principal of  the Securities of this series may be
declared due and payable in  the  manner  and with the effect provided in  the
Indenture.  Such  amount  shall be equal to -- insert formula for determining
the  amount.   Upon  payment (i) of the amount  of  principal  so declared  due
and payable and (ii) of interest  on  any  overdue principal  and overdue
interest (in each case to the extent  that the  payment of such interest shall
be legally enforceable),  all of  the  Company's obligations in respect of the
payment  of  the principal  of  and  interest, if any, on the Securities  of
this series shall terminate.]

      The  Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as  therein provided,  the
amendment  thereof and the  modification  of  the rights  and  obligations of
the Company and  the  rights  of  the Holders of the Securities of each series
to be affected under the Indenture  at  any time by the Company and the Trustee
with  the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount  of  the
Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture
also contains provisions permitting the Holders  of specified  percentages in
principal amount of the  Securities  of each series at the time Outstanding, on
behalf of the Holders  of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by
the Company with  certain  provisions  of  the  Indenture  and  certain  past
defaults  under the Indenture and their consequences.   Any  such consent  or
waiver  by  the Holder of  this  Security  shall  be conclusive  and  binding
upon such Holder  and  upon  all  future Holders  of  this  Security and of any
Security issued  upon  the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof
or in  lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made
upon this Security.

      No  reference herein to the Indenture and no  provision  of this  Security
or  of the Indenture shall alter  or  impair  the obligation  of  the Company,
which is absolute and unconditional, to  pay  the  principal of and any premium
and interest  on  this Security  at  the  times, place and rates, and  in  the
coin  or currency, herein prescribed.

therein set forth, the transfer of this Security  is registerable  in  the
Security Register, upon surrender  of  this Security for registration of
transfer at the office or agency  of the  Company in any place where the
principal of and any  premium and  interest on this Security are payable, duly
endorsed by,  or
accompanied  by  a  written  instrument  of  transfer   in   form satisfactory
to  the  Company and the  Security  Registrar  duly executed by, the Holder
hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Securities of this  series and  of like tenor, of authorized denominations and
for the  same aggregate  principal  amount, will be issued  to  the  designated
transferee or transferees.

       The  Securities  of  this  series  are  issuable  only  in
registered form without coupons in denominations of $         and any  integral
multiple thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject  to certain
limitations therein set forth, Securities  of this  series  are  exchangeable
for a  like  aggregate  principal amount  of  Securities of this series and  of
like  tenor  of  a different  authorized denomination, as requested  by  the
Holder surrendering the same.

     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may  require payment  of  a sum  sufficient  to  cover
any tax or other  governmental  charge payable in connection therewith.

      Prior  to due presentment of this Security for registration of  transfer,
the  Company, the Trustee and  any  agent  of  the Company  or the Trustee may
treat the Person in whose  name  this Security  is  registered as the owner
hereof  for  all  purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither
the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

     No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of (and  premium,
if any) or interest on this Security, or  for  any claim  based hereon, or
otherwise in respect hereof, or based  on or  in  respect  of  the Indenture or
any indenture  supplemental
thereto,  against  any  incorporator,  stockholder,  officer   or director, as
such, past, present or future, of the Company or  of any successor corporation,
whether by virtue of any constitution, statute  or  rule of law, or by the
enforcement of any assessment or  penalty  or  otherwise,  all such  liability
being,  by  the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the
issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

      All  terms used in this Security which are defined  in  the Indenture
shall  have  the meanings  assigned  to  them  in  the Indenture.

     (19)         any   restriction   or   condition    on    the
     transferability of the Securities of the series;

     (20)       any  authenticating or paying agents, registrars, conversion
     agents or any other agents with respect  to  the Securities of the series;
     and

     (21)       any other terms of the series (which terms  shall not  be
     inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, except as permitted by
     Section 901(5)).

      All  Securities  of any one series shall  be  substantially identical
except as to denomination and except as may  otherwise be  provided  in or
pursuant to the Board Resolution referred  to above or in any such indenture
supplemental hereto.

      If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant
to a Board Resolution, a copy of such action shall be delivered to the Trustee.

Section 302.  Denominations.

       The  Securities  of  each  series  shall  be  issuable  in registered
form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated
by Section 301.  In the absence of  any such provisions with respect to the
Securities of any series, the Securities  of such series shall be issuable in
denominations  of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

Section 303.  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

     The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its  Chairman,
its President, any Executive Vice President,  any Vice  President, its Treasurer
or Assistant Treasurer, under  its corporate  seal  reproduced  thereon attested
by  its  Corporate
Secretary  or  one  of its Assistant Corporate Secretaries.   The signature  of
any  of these officers on the  Securities  may  be manual or facsimile.

      The  seal  of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile thereof  and
may be impressed, affixed, imprinted  or  otherwise reproduced on the
Securities.  Securities bearing the  manual  or facsimile  signatures of
individuals who were  at  any  time  the
proper   officers  of  the  Company  shall  bind   the   Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have  ceased to  hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such  Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such
Securities.   Minor typographical and other minor errors  in  the text  of  any
Security or minor defects in the seal or  facsimile signature  on  any  Security
shall not  affect  the  validity  or enforceability of such Security if it has
been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.

      At  any time and from time to time after the execution  and delivery of
this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of
any   series   executed  by  the  Company  to  the  Trustee   for
authentication,   together  with  a   Company   Order   for   the authentication
and delivery of such Securities, and  the  Trustee in  accordance  with  the
Company Order shall  authenticate  and deliver  such Securities.  If the form or
terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to
one or more Board  Resolutions  as  permitted by Sections  201  and  301,  in
authenticating  such  Securities, and  accepting  the  additional
responsibilities  under  this  Indenture  in  relation  to   such Securities,
the  Trustee  shall  be  entitled  to  receive,  and (subject  to  Section  601)
shall be fully protected  in  relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,

         (a)       if  the  form  of  such  Securities  has  been
     established  by  or  pursuant  to  a  Board  Resolution   as
     permitted   by  Section  201,  that  such  form   has   been established
     in  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  this Indenture;

        (b)      if  the  terms  of  such  Securities  have  been
     established  by  or  pursuant  to  a  Board  Resolution   as
     permitted  by  Section  301,  that  such  terms  have   been established
     in  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  this Indenture; and

       (c)       that  such  Securities, when  authenticated  and delivered  by
     the Trustee and issued by the Company  in  the manner  and  subject  to any
     conditions  specified  in  such Opinion  of  Counsel,  will  constitute
     valid  and  legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in
     accordance
     with   their   terms,  subject  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
     fraudulent     transfer,     reorganization,     moratorium, rehabilitation
     and  similar laws of  general  applicability relating to or affecting
     creditors' rights generally or  the rights  of  creditors  of insurance
     companies  or  insurance
     holding   companies   generally  and   to   general   equity principles.

      The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and  deliver
any Securities under this Section if  the  Trustee, being  advised  by counsel,
determines that such action  may  not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in
good faith by its board of directors, executive committee, or a trust committee
of directors or  responsible officers of the Trustee shall determine that such
action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders of
Securities.

      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301  and  of  the preceding
paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to  be originally  issued  at
one time, it shall  not  be  necessary  to deliver  the  Board  Resolution
otherwise  required  pursuant  to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion
of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior
to  the time  of  authentication of each Security of such series if  such
documents  are  delivered at or prior to the authentication  upon original
issuance  of the first Security of such  series  to  be issued.

     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

      No  Security  shall be entitled to any benefit  under  this Indenture or
be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless  there
appears   on   such  Security  a  certificate  of  authentication substantially
in the form provided for herein  executed  by  the Trustee  by  manual
signature, and  such  certificate  upon  any Security shall be conclusive
evidence, and the only evidence, that  such  Security  has been duly
authenticated  and  delivered hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Security  shall have  been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never
issued and  sold  by  the  Company, and the Company shall  deliver  such
Security  to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in  Section 309,  for  all
purposes of this Indenture such Security shall  be deemed  never to have been
authenticated and delivered  hereunder and shall never be entitled to the
benefits of this Indenture.

Section 304.  Temporary Securities.

      Pending  the  preparation of definitive Securities  of  any series,  the
Company  may execute, and upon  Company  Order  the Trustee  shall  authenticate
and deliver,  temporary  Securities which  are  printed, lithographed,
typewritten,  mimeographed  or otherwise produced, in any authorized
denomination, substantially of  the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu
of which  they are  issued  and  with  such appropriate  insertions,  omissions,
substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may
determine, as evidenced by their execution of such
Securities.   Every temporary Security shall be executed  by  the Company and
authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and  in  substantially the
same manner, and with like effect,  as the definitive Securities.

      If  temporary  Securities of any  series  are  issued,  the Company  will
cause definitive Securities of that series  to  be prepared  without
unreasonable delay.  After the  preparation  of definitive Securities of such
series, the temporary Securities of such  series  shall be exchangeable for
definitive Securities  of such  series upon surrender of the temporary
Securities  of  such series  at  the  office or agency of the Company in  a
Place  of
Payment  for  that  series, without charge to the  Holder.   Upon
surrender   for  cancellation  of  any  one  or  more   temporary Securities  of
any  series, the Company shall  execute  and  the Trustee  shall authenticate
and deliver in exchange therefor  one or  more  definitive  Securities  of  the
same  series,  of  any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount and  tenor.  Until so exchanged the temporary Securities  of
any series  shall  in all respects be entitled to the  same  benefits under this
Indenture as definitive Securities of such series  and tenor.

Section 305.   Registration,   Registration   of   Transfer   and Exchange.

      The  Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate  Trust Office of the
Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office  and  in any other
office or agency of the  Company  in  a Place of Payment being herein sometimes
collectively referred  to as  the "Security Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it or the Trustee may prescribe, the Company shall
provide  for  the registration of Securities and of transfers  of Securities.
The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for  the  purpose  of
registering Securities  and  transfers  of Securities as herein provided.

      Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of  any series
at the office or agency in a Place of Payment  for that  series,  the Company
shall execute, and the  Trustee  shall
authenticate   and  deliver,  in  the  name  of  the   designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series,  of any authorized
denominations and of a like  aggregate principal amount and tenor.

     At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged  for
other  Securities of  the  same  series,  of  any authorized denominations and
of a like aggregate principal amount and  tenor,  upon surrender of the
Securities to be exchanged  at
such   office  or  agency.   Whenever  any  Securities   are   so surrendered
for  exchange, the Company shall  execute,  and  the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, the Securities which  the Holder  making  the exchange is entitled
to receive  and  bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.

      All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer  or exchange  of
Securities shall be the valid  obligations  of  the Company,  evidencing  the
same debt, and  entitled  to  the  same benefits under this Indenture, as the
Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

      Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer,
exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so  required
by   the  Company  or  the  Trustee)  be  duly  endorsed,  or  be
accompanied  by  a  written  instrument  of  transfer   in   form satisfactory
to  the  Company and the  Security  Registrar  duly executed,  by the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly  authorized in writing.

      No  service  charge shall be made for any  registration  of transfer or
exchange of Securities, but the Company
or  the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to  cover any  tax  or
other governmental charge that may  be  imposed  in connection  with  any
registration of transfer  or  exchange  of Securities, other than exchanges
pursuant to Section 304, 906  or 1107 not involving any transfer.

     Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required (i) to issue,
register  the transfer of or exchange Securities  of  any series  during a
period beginning at the opening of  business  15 days  before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption  of Securities  of that series selected for
redemption under  Section 1103  and  ending  at the close of business on the
day  of  such mailing,  or  (ii) to register the transfer of  or  exchange  any
Security  so selected for redemption in whole or in part,  except the unredeemed
portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

      Notwithstanding any other provision in this  Indenture,  no Global
Security may be transferred to, or registered or exchanged for  Securities
registered in the name of, any Person other  than the  Depositary for such
Global Security or any nominee  thereof,
and   no  such  transfer  may  be  registered,  unless  (1)  such Depositary
(A) notifies the Company and the Trustee that  it  is unwilling  or  unable to
continue as Depositary for  such  Global Security  or (B) ceases to be a
clearing agency registered  under the  Exchange Act, (2) the Company executes
and delivers  to  the Trustee  a  Company Order that such Global Security shall
be  so transferable,  registrable and exchangeable, and  such  transfers shall
be  registrable,  (3) there shall  have  occurred  and  be continuing  an  Event
of Default with respect to  the  Securities evidenced  by such Global Security
or (4) there shall exist  such other  circumstances,  if any, as have been
specified  for  this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. Notwithstanding any
other provision  in  this  Indenture, a Global Security  to  which  the
restriction set forth in the preceding sentence shall have ceased to  apply  may
be transferred only to, and may be registered  and exchanged for Securities
registered only in the name or names of, such Person or Persons as the
Depositary for such Global Security shall  have  directed and no transfer
thereof other than  such  a transfer may be registered.

     Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of  transfer
of,  or in exchange for or in  lieu  of,  a  Global Security to which the
restriction set forth in the first sentence of  the preceding paragraph shall
apply, whether pursuant to this Section,  Section  304, 306, 906 or 1107 or
otherwise,  shall  be authenticated  and  delivered in the form of,  and  shall
be,  a Global Security.

Section 306.   Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

      If  there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i)  a
mutilated Security, or (ii) evidence to their satisfaction of  the  destruction,
loss or theft of any Security and in either case  such security or indemnity as
may be required by either  of them  to  save  each  of them and any agent  of
either  of  them harmless,  then, in the absence of notice to the Company  or
the Trustee  that  such Security has been acquired  by  a  bona  fide purchaser,
the  Company  shall execute  and  the  Trustee  shall
authenticate  and  deliver,  in  lieu  of  any  such   mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Security, a new Security of  the  same series  and  of  like
tenor and principal amount  and  bearing  a number not contemporaneously
outstanding.

      In  case  any  such mutilated, destroyed,  lost  or  stolen Security  has
become or is about to become due and payable,  the Company in its discretion
may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

      Upon  the issuance of any new Security under this  Section, the  Company
or  the Trustee may require the payment  of  a  sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge that may be  imposed in relation thereto and any
other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
therewith.

      Every  new Security of any series issued pursuant  to  this Section  in
lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security  shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation  of  the Company,  whether or not the
destroyed, lost or  stolen  Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone,
and shall be entitled to  all  the  benefits  of  (but shall  be  subject  to
all  the limitations  of rights set forth in) this Indenture  equally  and
proportionately with any and all other Securities of that  series duly issued
hereunder.

      The  provisions  of  this Section are exclusive  and  shall preclude  (to
the extent lawful) all other rights  and  remedies
with   respect  to  the  replacement  or  payment  of  mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Securities.

Section 307.   Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

      Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with  respect
to  any  series  of Securities,  interest  on  any Security  which  is  payable,
and is  punctually  paid  or  duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
shall be paid  to  the Person  in  whose name that Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest.

     Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but  is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease  to be payable to the Holder
on the relevant Regular Record Date  by  virtue  of having been such Holder, and
such  Defaulted Interest  may  be  paid by the Company, at its election  in
each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

       (1)       The  Company may elect to make  payment  of  any Defaulted
     Interest  to  the  Persons  in  whose  names  the Securities  of such
     series (or their respective  Predecessor Securities)  are registered at the
     close of  business  on  a Special  Record  Date  for  the payment  of  such
     Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The
     Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted
     Interest proposed to be paid on each Security  of such series and the date
     of the proposed payment, and at the same  time  the  Company shall deposit
     with the  Trustee  an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount
     proposed to be paid  in  respect of such Defaulted Interest or  shall  make
     arrangements  satisfactory to the Trustee for  such  deposit prior  to the
     date of the proposed payment, such money  when deposited to be held in
     trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled  to  such  Defaulted Interest
     as  in  this  Clause provided.  Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special
     Record Date  for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be  not
     more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the  date of the
     proposed payment and not less than 15  days after  the  receipt  by the
     Trustee of  the  notice  of  the
     proposed  payment.   The Trustee shall promptly  notify  the Company of
     such Special Record Date and, in the name and  at the  expense  of  the
     Company, shall cause  notice  of  the proposed payment of such Defaulted
     Interest and the  Special Record  Date  therefor  to  be mailed,  first-
     class  postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at  its
     address  as  it appears in the Security Register,  not  less than  10 days
     prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice  of the  proposed  payment of
     such Defaulted  Interest  and  the Special  Record  Date therefor having
     been so  mailed,  such Defaulted  Interest shall be paid to the  Persons
     in  whose names  the  Securities of such series (or  their  respective
     Predecessor  Securities)  are registered  at  the  close  of business on
     such Special Record Date and shall no longer  be payable pursuant to the
     following Clause (2).

           (2)   The  Company may make payment of  any  Defaulted Interest on
     the Securities of any series in any other lawful
     manner  not  inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of   any securities
     exchange on which such Securities may be  listed, and  upon  such notice as
     may be required by such  exchange, if,  after notice given by the Company
     to the Trustee of the proposed  payment pursuant to this Clause,  such
     manner  of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

      Subject  to the foregoing provisions of this Section,  each Security
delivered  under this Indenture  upon  registration  of transfer  of or in
exchange for or in lieu of any other  Security shall  carry  the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid,  and  to accrue, which were carried by such other
Security.

      Subject to the provisions of Section 1202, in the  case  of any Security
which is converted after any Regular Record Date and on  or  prior to the next
succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Security the principal of (or
premium, if any, on) which shall become due and payable, whether at a Stated
Maturity or  by declaration  of acceleration, call for redemption, or
otherwise, prior  to  such  Interest Payment Date),  interest  whose  Stated
Maturity  is  on such Interest Payment Date shall be  payable  on such  Interest
Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion  and such  interest  (whether or
not punctually paid or duly  provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose
name that Security  (or any  one  or  more Predecessor Securities) is registered
at  the
close  of  business  on  such Regular  Record  Date.   Except  as
otherwise   expressly  provided  in  the  immediately   preceding sentence,  in
the  case  of  any Security  which  is  converted, interest whose Stated
Maturity is after the date of conversion of such Security shall not be payable.

Section 308.   Persons Deemed Owners.

      Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration  of transfer,  the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the  Company or  the  Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name such Security is  registered as the owner of such
Security for the  purpose  of receiving payment of principal of and any premium
and (subject to Section  307)  any interest on such Security and  for  all
other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither
the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company  or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 309.   Cancellation.

       All   Securities  surrendered  for  payment,   redemption, registration
of transfer or exchange or for credit  against  any sinking  fund  or analogous
payment or for conversion  shall,  if surrendered to any Person other than the
Trustee, be delivered to the  Trustee  and shall be promptly cancelled by it.
The  Company may  at  any  time  deliver to the Trustee for  cancellation  any
Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the  Company
may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and  may deliver  to  the Trustee
(or to any other Person for delivery  to
the   Trustee)   for   cancellation  any  Securities   previously authenticated
hereunder which the Company  has  not  issued  and sold, and all Securities so
delivered shall be promptly cancelled by  the Trustee.  No Securities shall be
authenticated in lieu of or  in exchange for any Securities cancelled as
provided in  this
Section,  except as expressly permitted by this  Indenture.   All cancelled
Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of  as directed by a Company
Order.  Acquisition by the Company  of  any Security shall not operate as a
redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness  represented by such Security
unless and  until  the same is delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

Section 310.   Computation of Interest.

     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.


                          ARTICLE FOUR

                   SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

Section 401.   Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.

      This  Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to  be  of further
effect (except as to any surviving rights of conversion, registration of
transfer or exchange of Securities  of  a  series herein expressly provided for)
with respect to Securities of  any series,  and  the Trustee, at the expense of
the  Company,  shall
execute   proper   instruments  acknowledging  satisfaction   and discharge of
this Indenture with respect to a series, when

     (1)  either

     (A)  all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and  delivered
     (other than (i) Securities which  have  been destroyed,  lost or stolen and
     which have been  replaced  or paid  as provided in Section 306 and (ii)
     Securities of such
     series   for  whose  payment  money  has  theretofore   been deposited  in
     trust or segregated and held in trust  by  the Company  and thereafter
     repaid to the Company or  discharged from  such  trust, as provided in
     Section  1003)  have  been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

     (B)  all  such  Securities of such  series  not  theretofore delivered to
     the Trustee for cancellation

      (i)      have become due and payable, or

     (ii)       will  become  due  and payable  at  their  Stated Maturity
     within one year, or

     (iii)      are to be called for redemption within  one  year under
     arrangements reasonably satisfactory to  the  Trustee for the giving of
     notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
     Company,

     and  the  Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii)  above, has
     irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee in trust
     for the purpose (A) money (either in United States  dollars or such other
     currency or currency  unit  in which  the  Securities of any series may be
     payable)  in  an amount,  or  (B)  U.S.  Government Obligations  (or
     Foreign Government Obligations if the Securities are denominated  in a
     foreign currency or currencies) that through the scheduled payment  of
     principal and interest in  respect  thereof  in accordance with their terms
     will provide, not later than one day  before the due date of any payment,
     money in an amount,
     or   (C)  a  combination  thereof,  sufficient  to  pay  and discharge the
     entire indebtedness on such Securities of such
     series   not  theretofore  delivered  to  the  Trustee   for cancellation,
     for principal of (and premium,  if  any)  and interest  to  the  date  of
     such deposit  (in  the  case  of Securities of such series which have
     become due and payable) or  to  the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as
     the  case may be;

     (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
     hereunder by the Company; and

     (3)   the  Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
     and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions  precedent
     herein provided for  relating  to  the satisfaction and discharge of this
     Indenture with respect to such series have been complied with.

      In  the  event there are Securities of two or  more  series outstanding
hereunder, the Trustee shall be required  to  execute an  instrument
acknowledging satisfaction and discharge  of  this Indenture  only if requested
to do so with respect to  Securities of a particular series as to which it is
Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met.  In the event that there
are  two  or more  Trustees  hereunder,  then the effectiveness  of  any  such
instrument  shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from all
Trustees hereunder.

      Notwithstanding  the  satisfaction and  discharge  of  this Indenture with
respect to a particular series, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee
under Section 607, the obligations  of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent
under Section 614 and, if money  shall  have  been deposited with the Trustee
pursuant  to subclause  (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations  of
the  Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of  Section 1003 shall
survive until there are no Securities Outstanding with respect to a particular
series and the obligations of the Company and  the  Trustee with respect to all
other series of  Securities shall survive.

Section 402.   Application of Trust Fund.

     Subject to provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all  amounts
deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section  401 shall be held in trust and
applied by it, in accordance with  the provisions of the Securities and this
Indenture, to the  payment, either  directly  or  through  any Paying  Agent
(including  the Company  acting  as  its own Paying Agent)  as  the  Trustee
may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal  and any
premium and interest for whose payment such funds have  been deposited with the
Trustee.


                          ARTICLE FIVE

                            REMEDIES

Section 501.   Events of Default.

      "Event of Default" whenever used with respect to Securities of  a series
means any one of the following events and such other events  as  may be
established with respect to the Securities  of such series as contemplated by
Section 301 hereof:

     (1)   Default  in the payment of any instalment of  interest upon  any  of
     the Securities of such series as and when  the same  shall become due and
     payable, and continuance of  such default for a period of 30 days; or

     (2)   Default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if  any, on
     any of the Securities of such series as and when the  same  shall become
     due and payable either at  maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or
     otherwise; or

     (3)   Default  in  the making of any sinking  fund  payment, whether
     mandatory or optional, as and when the  same  shall become  due  and
     payable by the terms of the  Securities  of such series; or

     (4)   Failure on the part of the Company duly to observe  or perform  in
     any material respect any other of the  covenants or  agreements on the part
     of the Company contained in  this Indenture  or in the Securities (other
     than those set  forth exclusively in the terms of any other particular
     series  of Securities established as contemplated by this Indenture for the
     benefit of such other series) and written notice of such failure,  stating
     that such notice is a "Notice of  Default" hereunder,  and  requiring the
     Company to remedy  the  same, shall  have  been  given by registered  or
     certified  mail, return receipt requested, to the Company by the Trustee,
     or to  the  Company and the Trustee by the holders of at  least
     25%   in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Outstanding Securities  of
     that  series, and such  failure  shall  have continued unremedied for a
     period of 90 days after the  date of the Company's receipt of such Notice
     of Default; or

     (5)   An  event  of default, as defined in any indenture  or instrument
     evidencing or under which  the  Company  or  any
     Principal   Insurance  Subsidiary  shall  have   outstanding indebtedness
     for  borrowed money in a principal  amount  in excess  of  $50,000,000,
     shall happen and be continuing  and such  indebtedness shall have been
     accelerated so  that  the same shall be or become due and payable prior to
     the date on which  the same would otherwise have become due and  payable or
     the Company or any Principal Insurance Subsidiary  shall default  in  the
     payment at final maturity  of  outstanding indebtedness  for  borrowed
     money in a principal  amount  in excess  of $50,000,000, and such
     acceleration or default  at maturity  shall not be waived, rescinded or
     annulled  within 30  days  after  written notice thereof, stating  that
     such notice  is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, shall have  been given  to
     the Company by the Trustee (if such event be known to  it), or to the
     Company and the Trustee by the holders of
     at   least  25%  in  aggregate  principal  amount   of   the Outstanding
     Securities of that series;  provided,  however, that if such acceleration
     under such indenture or instrument or  default  at maturity shall be
     remedied or cured  by  the
     Company   or  Principal  Insurance  Subsidiary,  or  waived, rescinded  or
     annulled  by the requisite  holders  of  such indebtedness, then the Event
     of Default hereunder by  reason thereof  shall  be  deemed likewise to have
     been  thereupon remedied,  cured or waived without further action  upon
     the part  of  either  the  Trustee or any of  the  Holders;  and
     provided  further,  that,  subject  to  the  provisions   of Sections 601
     and 602, the Trustee shall not be charged  with knowledge of any such
     default unless written notice  thereof shall have been given to the Trustee
     by the Company, by  the holder of any such indebtedness or an agent of the
     holder of any  such indebtedness, by the trustee then acting under any such
     indenture or other instrument under which such default shall  have
     occurred, or by the holders of at least  25%  in aggregate principal amount
     of the Outstanding Securities  of that series; or

     (6)  A decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises
     shall have been entered adjudging the  Company  or any  Principal Insurance
     Subsidiary a bankrupt or insolvent,
     or   approving   as   properly  filed  a  petition   seeking
     reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment or  composition  of the  Company
     or any Principal Insurance Subsidiary under any applicable Federal or State
     bankruptcy or similar  law,  and such  decree or order shall have continued
     undischarged  and unstayed for a period of 90 days; or a decree or order of
     a
     court   having   jurisdiction  in  the  premises   for   the appointment
     of  a receiver, liquidator, trustee,  assignee, sequestrator or similar
     official in bankruptcy or insolvency of  the Company or any Principal
     Insurance Subsidiary or  of all or substantially all of its property, or
     for the winding up  or  liquidation of its affairs, shall have been
     entered, and  such  decree or order shall have continued undischarged and
     unstayed for a period of 90 days; or

     (7)  The Company or any Principal Insurance Subsidiary shall
     institute   proceedings  to  be  adjudicated   a   voluntary bankrupt,  or
     shall consent to the filing of  a  bankruptcy proceeding against it, or
     shall file a petition or answer or consent  seeking reorganization,
     arrangement, adjustment  or composition under any applicable Federal or
     State bankruptcy or  similar law, or shall consent to the filing of any
     such petition, or shall consent to the appointment of a receiver,
     liquidator,  trustee,  assignee,  sequestrator  or   similar official in
     bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company  or  any Principal  Insurance
     Subsidiary or of all  or  substantially all  of  its property, or shall
     make an assignment  for  the
     benefit  of  creditors,  or  shall  admit  in  writing   its inability to
     pay its debts generally as they become due  and its  willingness  to  be
     adjudged a bankrupt,  or  corporate action  shall  be  taken  by the
     Company  or  any  Principal Insurance  Subsidiary in furtherance of any of
     the aforesaid purposes.

Section 502.   Acceleration    of   Maturity;   Rescission    and Annulment.

      If  an  Event of Default with respect to Securities of  any series at the
time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then  in every  such case the Trustee
or the Holders of not less than  25% in  principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the
Securities of that  series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion
of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms
thereof) of all of the Securities of that series to  be due  and  payable
immediately, by a notice  in  writing  to  the Company  (and to the Trustee if
given by Holders), and  upon  any such  declaration  such  principal amount (or
specified  amount) shall become immediately due and payable; provided, however,
that if  an Event of Default specified in Section 501(6) or (7) occurs and  is
continuing, such principal amount of all such Securities shall  ipso  facto
become  and be immediately  due  and  payable without  any declaration or other
act on the part of the  Trustee or  any Holders; provided, further, that except
in the case of  a default  in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any) or interest on any Security or in the payment of any sinking fund payment,
the  Trustee  shall be protected  in  withholding  such notice  if  and so long
as the board of directors, the  executive committee  or  a trust committee of
directors and/or  Responsible Officers  of  the  Trustee  in  good  faith
determine  that  the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the
Holders  of such Securities.

      At  any time after such a declaration of acceleration  with respect  to
Securities of any series has been made and  before  a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by  the  Trustee  as  hereinafter in
this Article  provided,  the Holders  of  a  majority in principal amount of
the  Outstanding Securities  of that series, by written notice to the Company
and the  Trustee,  may waive all defaults and may rescind  and  annul such
declaration and its consequences if

     (1)   the  Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee  a sum sufficient
     to pay

                (A)   all  overdue interest on all Securities  of that series,

                (B)   the principal of (and premium, if any,  on) any
          Securities  of that series which have  become  due otherwise than by
          such declaration of acceleration  and any  interest  thereon at the
          rate or rates  prescribed therefor in such Securities,

                (C)   to the extent that payment of such interest is  lawful,
          interest upon overdue interest at the  rate or rates prescribed
          therefor in such Securities, and

                (D)   all  sums paid or advanced by  the  Trustee hereunder  and
          the reasonable compensation,  expenses, disbursements and advances of
          the Trustee,  its  agents and counsel due the Trustee under Section
          607;

and

     (2)   all  Events of Default with respect to  Securities  of that series,
     other than the non-payment of the principal  of and interest, if any, on
     the Securities of that series which have  become due solely by such
     declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in
     Section 513.

No  such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 503.   Collection   of   Indebtedness   and   Suits   for Enforcement by
               Trustee.

     The Company covenants that if

     (1)   default is made in the payment of any interest on  any Security when
     such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a
     period of 30 days, or

     (2)  default is made in the payment of  the principal of (or premium, if
     any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,

the  Company will, upon written demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for  the
benefit  of the Holders of such Securities,  the  whole amount then due and
payable on such Securities for principal  and any  premium and interest and, to
the extent that payment of such interest  shall be legally enforceable, interest
on  any  overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate
or rates  prescribed therefor in such Securities, and,  in  addition thereto,
such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover  the costs  and  expenses
of  collection,  including  the  reasonable
compensation,  expenses,  disbursements  and  advances   of   the Trustee,  its
agents and counsel, except such costs and  expenses as  are  a result of
negligence or bad faith on the part  of  the
Trustee.   Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the  Company may  pay  the
principal of and premium, if any, and interest,  if any,  on  the Securities of
any series to the registered holders, whether or not the Securities of such
series are overdue.

      If  an  Event of Default with respect to Securities of  any
series  occurs  and  is  continuing,  the  Trustee  may  in   its discretion
proceed  to protect and enforce its  rights  and  the rights  of  the  Holders
of Securities of  such  series  by  such appropriate judicial proceedings as the
Trustee shall  deem  most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific  enforcement  of  any  covenant  or  agreement  in
this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted  herein, or to
enforce any other proper remedy.

Section 504.   Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

      In  case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or  any other
obligor upon the Securities), its property or  its creditors,  the  Trustee
shall be  entitled  and  empowered,  by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act
in order to have claims  of  the  Holders  and the Trustee  allowed  in  any
such
proceeding.   In particular, the Trustee shall be  authorized  to collect  and
receive  any moneys or other  property  payable  or deliverable  on any such
claims and to distribute the  same;  and
any   custodian,   receiver,   assignee,   trustee,   liquidator, sequestrator
or  other similar official  in  any  such  judicial proceeding  is  hereby
authorized by each  Holder  to  make  such payments to the Trustee and, in the
event that the Trustee  shall consent  to the making of such payments directly
to the  Holders, to  pay  to  the  Trustee any amount due it  for  the
reasonable
compensation,  expenses,  disbursements  and  advances   of   the Trustee,  its
agents and counsel due the Trustee  under  Section 607.

      No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the  Trustee
to authorize or consent to or accept  or  adopt  on behalf  of  any  Holder any
plan of reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Securities or the  rights of  any  Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee
to  vote  in respect  of  the  claim  of any Holder in  any  such  proceeding;
provided,  however,  that  the Trustee  may,  on  behalf  of  the Holders,  vote
for the election of a trustee  in  bankruptcy  or similar official and be a
member of a creditors' or other similar committee.

Section 505.   Trustee  May Enforce Claims Without Possession  of Securities.

      All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee  without the possession of any of the
Securities or the production thereof in  any  proceeding  relating thereto, and
any  such  proceeding instituted  by the Trustee shall be brought in its  own
name  as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment  shall, after
provision for the payment of the reasonable  compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its  agents and counsel due the
Trustee under Section 607, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the
Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

Section 506.   Application of Money Collected.

      Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall  be
applied in the following order, at the date  or  dates fixed  by  the Trustee
and, in case of the distribution  of  such money  on  account of principal or
any premium or interest,  upon presentation  of the Securities and the notation
thereon  of  the payment  if  only  partially paid and upon surrender  thereof
if fully paid:

          FIRST:    To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
     607;

           SECOND:   To the payment of the amounts then  due  and unpaid for
     principal of and any premium and interest on  the Securities in respect of
     which or for the benefit  of  which such  money  has been collected,
     ratably, without preference or  priority of any kind, according to the
     amounts  due  and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium
     and interest, respectively; and

           THIRD:    To the payment of the remainder, if any,  to the Company or
     any other Person lawfully entitled thereto.

Section 507.   Limitation on Suits.

     No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to  institute
any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to  this  Indenture,  or for
the appointment  of  a  receiver  or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder,
unless

          (1)  such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
     a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that
     series;

           (2)   the  Holders of not less than 25%  in  principal amount  of
     the Outstanding Securities of that series  shall have  made  written
     request to  the  Trustee  to  institute proceedings in respect of such
     Event of Default in  its  own name as Trustee hereunder;

          (3)  such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
     reasonably satisfactory in form and substance  to the  Trustee against the
     costs, expenses and liabilities  to be incurred in compliance with such
     request;

           (4)  the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
     request  and  offer  of  indemnity  has  failed  to institute any such
     proceeding; and

           (5)   no  direction  inconsistent  with  such  written request  has
     been given to the Trustee during  such  60-day period  by the Holders of a
     majority in principal amount  of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it  being  understood and intended that no one or  more  of  such Holders shall
have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or  by  availing of, any
provision of this Indenture  to  affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any
other of such Holders,  or to  obtain or to seek to obtain priority or
preference  over  any other  of  such  Holders  or  to enforce  any  right
under  this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal
and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.

Section 508.   Unconditional   Right  of   Holders   to   Receive Principal,
               Premium and Interest and to Convert.

      Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,  the Holder  of
any Security shall have the right, which is  absolute and unconditional, to
receive payment of the principal of and any premium  and  (subject  to  Section
307)  any  interest  on  such Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities
expressed  in  such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption
Date) and  to convert such Securities in accordance with Article Twelve and to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment  or such  right of
conversion, and such rights shall not be  impaired without the consent of such
Holder.

Section 509.   Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

      If  the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to  enforce
any  right or remedy under this Indenture  and  such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason,  or has  been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such  Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any
determination in such proceeding,  the  Company, the Trustee and the Holders
shall  be restored  severally  and respectively to their  former  positions
hereunder  and thereafter all rights and remedies of the  Trustee and  the
Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding  had been instituted.

Section 510.   Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or  payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the  last  paragraph of
Section 306, no right  or  remedy  herein conferred  upon or reserved to the
Trustee or to the  Holders  is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and  every right  and  remedy  shall, to the extent  permitted  by  law,
be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy  given hereunder
or  now or hereafter existing at law or in  equity  or
otherwise.   The assertion or employment of any right  or  remedy
hereunder,   or  otherwise,  shall  not  prevent  the  concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 511.   Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

      No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities  to
exercise any right or remedy  accruing  upon  any Event  of  Default  shall
impair any such  right  or  remedy  or
constitute  a  waiver  of  any  such  Event  of  Default  or   an acquiescence
therein.  Subject to Section 507, every  right  and remedy  given by this
Article or by law to the Trustee or to  the Holders may be exercised from time
to time, and as often  as  may be  deemed  expedient, by the Trustee or by the
Holders,  as  the case may be.

Section 512.   Control by Holders.

     The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of any series shall  have  the  right  to direct  the  time, method
and place of conducting any  proceeding for  any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect
to the Securities of such series, provided that

           (1)  such direction shall not be in conflict with  any rule of law or
     with this Indenture,

           (2)   the  Trustee  may take any other  action  deemed proper  by
     the Trustee which is not inconsistent with  such direction, and

           (3)   the Trustee need not take any action which might involve it in
     personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the Holders of such series
     not joining therein.

      Upon  receipt  by  the Trustee of any such  direction  with respect to
Securities of any series, a record date shall  be  set for  determining  the
Holders of Outstanding Securities  of  such series  entitled  to join in such
direction,  which  record  date shall  be  the close of business on the day the
Trustee  receives such  direction.  The Holders of Outstanding Securities  of
such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents),  and only
such  Persons, shall be entitled to join in such direction, whether  or  not
such Holders remain Holders after  such  record date;  provided  that, unless
such direction  shall  have  become effective  by  virtue  of  Holders of  at
least  a  majority  in principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series
on such record  date  (or  their  duly appointed  agents)  having  joined
therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date,  such direction
shall  automatically and without  any  action  by  any Person  be  cancelled and
of no further effect. Nothing  in  this paragraph  shall  prevent a Holder (or
a  duly  appointed  agent thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration
of such  90-day  period, a direction contrary to or different from, or, after
the expiration of such period, identical to, a direction that has been cancelled
pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in  which event a new record
date in respect thereof shall be set pursuant to this paragraph.

Section 513.   Waiver of Past Defaults.

      The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of  the
Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders  of  all  the
Securities of such series  waive  any  past
default   hereunder  with  respect  to  such   series   and   its consequences,
except a default

           (1)  in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on
     any Security of such series, or

          (2)  in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
     Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent  of the Holder of
     each Outstanding Security of  such series affected.

     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any  Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed  to  have been  cured,  for every
purpose of this Indenture;  but  no  such waiver  shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 514.   Undertaking for Costs.

     In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken,  suffered or
omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to
file an undertaking to pay the costs  of such suit, and may assess costs against
any such  party litigant,  in the manner and to the extent provided in the
Trust Indenture  Act; provided that neither this Section nor the  Trust
Indenture  Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to  require such  an
undertaking or to make such an assessment in  any  suit instituted by the
Company.


                           ARTICLE SIX

                           THE TRUSTEE

Section 601.   Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

      The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be  as
provided  by  the  Trust  Indenture  Act.   Notwithstanding   the foregoing,  no
provision  of this Indenture  shall  require  the Trustee  to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise  incur  any financial  liability  in the performance of
any  of  its  duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or
powers,  if it  shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of
such  funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or  liability
is  not  reasonably  assured  to  it.   Whether  or  not  therein expressly so
provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to  the  conduct  or
affecting the  liability  of  or  affording protection  to the Trustee shall be
subject to the provisions  of this Section.

Section 602.   Notice of Defaults.

      If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any  series,
the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities  of such  series notice of such
default as and to the extent provided by  the Trust Indenture Act; provided,
however, that in the  case of  any default of the character specified in Section
501(4) with respect  to Securities of such series, no such notice to  Holders
shall  be  given  until  at least 30 days  after  the  occurrence
thereof.   For  the purpose of this Section, the  term  "default" means  any
event which is, or after notice or lapse of  time  or both would become, an
Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.

Section 603.   Certain Rights of Trustee.

     Subject to the provisions of Section 601:

           (a)   the  Trustee may rely and shall be protected  in acting  or
     refraining  from  acting  upon  any  resolution, certificate, statement,
     instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,  direction, consent, order,
     bond, debenture,  note, other  evidence of indebtedness or other paper  or
     document believed  by  it  to be genuine and to have been  signed  or
     presented by the proper party or parties;

           (b)  any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein  shall
     be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or  Company  Order  and  any
     resolution  of  the  Board  of
     Directors   may  be  sufficiently  evidenced  by   a   Board Resolution;

           (c)   whenever in the administration of this Indenture the  Trustee
     shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or  established prior to
     taking, suffering or  omitting  any action  hereunder,  the Trustee (unless
     other  evidence  be herein  specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of
     bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

           (d)   the  Trustee may consult with  counsel  and  the written
     advice  of such counsel or any Opinion  of  Counsel shall  be full and
     complete authorization and protection  in respect  of  any  action taken,
     suffered or  omitted  by  it hereunder in good faith and in reliance
     thereon;

           (e)   the  Trustee  shall be under  no  obligation  to exercise  any
     of the rights or powers vested in it  by  this Indenture at the request or
     direction of any of the  Holders pursuant  to this Indenture, unless such
     Holders shall  have offered  to  the  Trustee  security or indemnity
     reasonably satisfactory  in  form and substance to the Trustee  against the
     costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance
     with such request or direction;

           (f)   the  Trustee  shall not be  bound  to  make  any investigation
     into  the  facts or  matters  stated  in  any resolution,  certificate,
     statement,  instrument,  opinion, report,  notice, request, direction,
     consent,  order,  bond, debenture,  note,  other evidence of indebtedness
     or  other paper  or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion,  may make
     such further inquiry or investigation into such  facts or  matters  as  it
     may see fit, and, if the  Trustee  shall determine to make such further
     inquiry or investigation,  it shall  upon reasonable notice to the Company
     be entitled  to examine  the  books, records and premises  of  the
     Company, personally  or  by  agent or attorney at a  time  and  place
     reasonably acceptable to the Company; and

           (g)   the  Trustee may execute any of  the  trusts  or powers
     hereunder  or  perform any duties  hereunder  either directly  or  by  or
     through agents or  attorneys  and  the Trustee  shall  not  be responsible
     for  any  misconduct  or negligence  on  the part of any agent or attorney
     appointed with due care by it hereunder.

Except  as  otherwise required by the Trust  Indenture  Act,  the
Trustee   undertakes  to  perform  only  such   duties   as   are
specifically  set  forth  in  this  Indenture,  and  no   implied covenants  or
obligations  shall be  read  into  this  Indenture against the Trustee.

Section 604.   Not  Responsible  for  Recitals  or  Issuance   of Securities.

      The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the  Trustee's
certificates of authentication, shall be taken  as the  statements of the
Company, and neither the Trustee  nor  any
Authenticating  Agent  assumes  any  responsibility   for   their
correctness.   The  Trustee makes no representations  as  to  the validity  or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities.  Neither  the  Trustee  nor
any  Authenticating  Agent  shall  be accountable  for  the  use  or
application  by  the  Company  of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

Section 605.   May Hold Securities.

     The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security
Registrar  or any other agent of the  Company,  in  its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections
608 and 613, may otherwise deal  with the Company with the same rights it would
have  if  it were  not  Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent,  Security
Registrar or such other agent.

Section 606.   Money Held in Trust.

      Money  held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need  not  be segregated
from other funds except to the extent required by law.  The Trustee shall be
under no liability for interest on any money received  by  it  hereunder except
as otherwise agreed  with  the Company.

Section 607.   Compensation and Reimbursement.

     The Company agrees

          (1)  to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation
     for  all  services rendered  by  it  hereunder (which compensation shall
     not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a
     trustee of an express trust);

           (2)  except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse  the
     Trustee  upon its written  request  for  all reasonable expenses,
     disbursements and advances incurred  or made by the Trustee in accordance
     with any provision of this
     Indenture   (including  the  reasonable  compensation,   and reasonable
     expenses and disbursements  of  its  agents  and outside  counsel), except
     any such expense, disbursement  or advance  as  may  be attributable to its
     negligence  or  bad faith; and

           (3)   to  indemnify the Trustee for, and  to  hold  it harmless
     against, any loss, liability or  expense  incurred without negligence or
     bad faith on its part, arising out  of or  in  connection with the
     acceptance or administration  of the  trust  or  trusts hereunder,
     including  the  reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against
     any claim  or liability in connection with the exercise or performance  of
     any of its powers or duties hereunder.

      As  security for the performance of the obligations of  the Company  under
this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien  prior to  the  Securities upon all
property and funds held or collected by  the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee
(but not in any other capacity),  except  funds  held  in  trust  for  the
payment  of principal  of  (or  premium, if any) or  interest  on  particular
Securities or any coupons.  The provisions of this Section  shall survive the
termination of this Identure.

      When  the  Trustee incurs expenses or renders  services  in connection
with an Event of Default specified in Section  501(6) or  (7),  the expenses
(including reasonable charges and expenses of  its  counsel)  and  the
compensation  for  the  services  are intended  to  constitute  expenses of
administration  under  any applicable  federal  or  state bankruptcy,
insolvency  or  other similar law.

Section 608.   Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

      If  the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the
meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee  shall either  eliminate such
interest or resign, to the extent  and  in the  manner  provided by, and subject
to the provisions  of,  the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.

Section 609.   Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

      There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be  a Person
that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or is a subsidiary of a
corporation which shall be  a Person  that  has  a  combined capital and surplus
of  at  least $50,000,000  and which unconditionally guarantees the obligations
of  the  Trustee hereunder.  If such Person publishes reports  of
condition  at  least  annually,  pursuant  to  law  or   to   the requirements
of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this
Section, the combined capital and surplus of such  Person  shall  be  deemed to
be its  combined  capital  and surplus  as  set forth in its most recent report
of condition  so published.  If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in  accordance  with  the provisions of this  Section,  it  shall
resign  immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in
this Article.

Section 610.   Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

      (a)   No  resignation  or removal of  the  Trustee  and  no appointment of
a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become  effective  until the
acceptance  of  appointment  by  the successor  Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.

      (b)  The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of
one or more series by giving written notice thereof to  the  Company.  If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall
not have been delivered  to the  Trustee  within 30 days after the giving of
such  notice  of resignation,  the  resigning Trustee may petition  any  court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of such series.

      (c)  The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to
the Company.

     (d)  If at any time:

           (1)  the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after  written
     request therefor by the Company  or  by  any Holder who has been a bona
     fide Holder of a Security for  at least six months, or

           (2)   the  Trustee  shall cease to be  eligible  under Section  609
     and shall fail to resign after written  request therefor by the Company or
     by any such Holder, or

           (3)   the Trustee shall become incapable of acting  or shall  be
     adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver  of the  Trustee  or of its
     property shall be appointed  or  any public  officer shall take charge or
     control of the  Trustee
     or   of   its  property  or  affairs  for  the  purpose   of
     rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove  the
Trustee  with  respect to all  Securities,  or  (ii) subject  to  Section 514,
any Holder who has  been  a  bona  fide Holder  of  a Security for at least six
months may, on behalf  of itself  and all others similarly situated, petition
any court  of competent  jurisdiction  for  the removal  of  the  Trustee  with
respect  to  all  Securities and the appointment of  a  successor Trustee or
Trustees.

      (e)   If  the  Trustee shall resign, be removed  or  become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with
respect to the Securities of  one  or more  series, the Company, by a Board
Resolution, shall  promptly appoint  a  successor  Trustee or Trustees with
respect  to  the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that
any such  successor  Trustee may be appointed  with  respect  to  the Securities
of one or more or all of such series and that  at  any time  there  shall  be
only  one Trustee  with  respect  to  the Securities  of any particular series)
and shall comply  with  the
applicable  requirements of Section 611.   If,  within  one  year
after   such  resignation,  removal  or  incapability,   or   the occurrence  of
such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect  to the  Securities of any Series
shall be appointed by  Act  of  the Holders  of  a  majority in principal amount
of  the  Outstanding Securities  of  such  series delivered to  the  Company
and  the retiring  Trustee,  the  successor Trustee  so  appointed  shall,
forthwith  upon its acceptance of such appointment in  accordance with  the
applicable  requirements of Section  611,  become  the successor  Trustee with
respect to the Securities of such  series and  to that extent supersede the
successor Trustee appointed  by
the  Company.   If  no  successor Trustee  with  respect  to  the Securities  of
any Series shall have been so  appointed  by  the Company  or  the Holders and
accepted appointment in  the  manner required  by  Section 611, any Holder who
has been  a  bona  fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six
months  may, on  behalf of itself and all others similarly situated,  petition
any  court  of  competent jurisdiction for the appointment  of  a successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

      (f)  The Company shall give notice of each resignation  and each removal
of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series  and each
appointment of a successor Trustee with  respect to  the Securities of any
series to all Holders of Securities  of such  series in the manner provided in
Section 106.  Each  notice shall  include the name of the successor Trustee with
respect  to the  Securities of such series and the address of  its  Corporate
Trust Office.

Section 611.   Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

      (a)   In  case of the appointment hereunder of a  successor Trustee  with
respect  to all Securities, every  such  successor Trustee  so  appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver  to the  Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument  accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring  Trustee  shall  become  effective  and  such  successor
Trustee,  without  any  further act, deed  or  conveyance,  shall become  vested
with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties  of the  retiring Trustee; but,
on the request of the Company or  the successor  Trustee, such retiring Trustee
shall, upon payment  of its  charges,  execute and deliver an instrument
transferring  to such  successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of
the retiring  Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver  to such
successor  Trustee  all property and  money  held  by  such retiring Trustee
hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in Section
607.

      (b)   In  case of the appointment hereunder of a  successor Trustee  with
respect to the Securities of one or more  (but  not all) series, the Company,
the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee  with  respect  to the
Securities of  such  series  shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental
hereto wherein each successor  Trustee shall accept such appointment  and  which
(1) shall  contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to
transfer the rights, powers, trust and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series to which  the appointment of
such successor Trustee relates, (2)  if the  retiring  Trustee  is  not
retiring  with  respect  to  all Securities,  shall  contain such provisions as
shall  be  deemed necessary  or  desirable to confirm that all the rights,
powers, trusts  and  duties of the retiring Trustee with respect  to  the
Securities  of  that  or those series as to  which  the  retiring Trustee  is
not  retiring shall continue to  be  vested  in  the retiring  Trustee,  and (3)
shall add to or  change  any  of  the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or  facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than  one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such  supplemental indenture shall constitute  such  Trustee  co-trustees  of
the same trust and that each such Trustee  shall  be trustee  of  a trust or
trusts hereunder separate and apart  from any  trust  or  trusts hereunder
administered by any  other  such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of
such supplemental indenture  the  resignation or removal of  the  retiring
Trustee shall  become effective to the extent provided therein  and  each
such  successor  Trustee,  without  any  further  act,  deed   or conveyance,
shall  become vested with all  the  rights,  powers, trusts  and  duties of the
retiring Trustee with respect  to  the Securities  of  that or those series to
which the appointment  of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the
Company or any  successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly  assign,
transfer  and deliver to such successor Trustee all property  and money held by
such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities  of  that or
those series to which the appointment  of such  successor  Trustee  relates,
subject  nevertheless  to  its claim, if any, provided for in Section 607.

     (c)  Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall  execute
any  and  all  instruments  for  more  fully  and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

     (d)  No successor shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such
acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this
Article.

Section 612.   Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.

     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
converted  or  with  which  it  may  be  consolidated,   or   any
corporation   resulting   from   any   merger,   conversion    or consolidation
to  which the Trustee shall be  a  party,  or  any corporation succeeding to all
or substantially all the  corporate trust  business  of the Trustee, shall be
the  successor  of  the Trustee  hereunder, provided such corporation shall be
otherwise qualified  and eligible under this Article, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any  of
the  parties  hereto.   In case any Securities  shall  have  been authenticated,
but not delivered, by the Trustee then in  office, any  successor  by  merger,
conversion or consolidation  to  such authenticating Trustee may adopt such
authentication and  deliver the  Securities so authenticated with the same
effect as if  such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 613.   Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company  (or
any other obligor upon the Securities), the  Trustee shall  be  subject to the
provisions of the Trust  Indenture  Act regarding  the collection of claims
against the Company  (or  any such other obligor).

Section 614.   Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

      The Trustee may with the consent of the Company appoint  an Authenticating
Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of  Securities which shall be
authorized to act on behalf of  the Trustee  to  authenticate Securities of such
series  issued  upon original  issue  and  upon  exchange, registration  of
transfer, partial  conversion or partial redemption thereof or pursuant  to
Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the  benefits
of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for  all  purposes as if
authenticated by the Trustee  hereunder.
Wherever   reference   is   made  in  this   Indenture   to   the authentication
and delivery of Securities by the Trustee  or  the Trustee's certificate of
authentication, such reference shall  be deemed  to include authentication and
delivery on behalf  of  the
Trustee   by  an  Authenticating  Agent  and  a  certificate   of
authentication  executed  on  behalf  of  the   Trustee   by   an
Authenticating  Agent.   Each  Authenticating  Agent   shall   be acceptable to
the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business
under the laws of the United  States of  America,  any  State  thereof or the
District  of  Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating
Agent, having a  combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000  and
subject  to  supervision  or  examination  by  Federal  or  State
authority.   If  such Authenticating Agent publishes  reports  of
condition  at  least  annually,  pursuant  to  law  or   to   the requirements
of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this
Section, the combined capital and surplus of such  Authenticating Agent shall be
deemed  to  be  its  combined capital  and  surplus as set forth in its most
recent  report  of condition  so published.  If at any time an Authenticating
Agent shall  cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions  of this
Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and
with the effect specified in this Section.

      Any  corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may  be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or  any
corporation   resulting   from   any   merger,   conversion    or consolidation
to  which such Authenticating  Agent  shall  be  a party,  or any corporation
succeeding to the corporate agency  or corporate  trust  business  of  an
Authenticating  Agent,  shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided
such corporation shall  be  otherwise  eligible under this  Section,  without
the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on  the  part of the
Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

      An  Authenticating Agent may resign at any time  by  giving
written  notice thereof to the Trustee and to the  Company.   The Trustee or the
Company may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating  Agent by
giving written notice  thereof  to  such Authenticating  Agent and to the
Company or the Trustee,  as  the case may be.  Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such  a  termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating
Agent  shall  cease  to  be  eligible  in  accordance  with   the provisions  of
this Section, the Trustee may appoint a  successor Authenticating Agent which
shall be acceptable to the Company and shall  mail  written  notice of such
appointment  by  first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities
of the series with  respect to which such Authenticating Agent will  serve,  as
their  names and addresses appear in the Security Register.   Any successor
Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder  shall  become
vested with all the rights,  powers  and duties  of  its  predecessor hereunder,
with like  effect  as  if
originally  named  as  an  Authenticating  Agent.  No   successor Authenticating
Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

      The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time  to time
reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.

     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to
this Section, the Securities of such series may  have endorsed  thereon,  in
addition to the Trustee's  certificate  of authentication,  an alternative
certificate of authentication  in the following form:

      This  is  one  of  the Securities of the series  designated therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

Section 901.   Supplemental   Indentures   Without   Consent   of Holders.

      Without  the  consent  of any Holders,  the  Company,  when authorized  by

     herein and in the Securities; or

           (2)   to  add to the covenants of the Company for  the benefit  of
     the Holders of all or any series of  Securities (and  if  such covenants
     are to be for the benefit  of  less than  all  series of Securities,
     stating that such covenants are  expressly being included solely for the
     benefit of such series)  or to surrender any right or power herein
     conferred upon the Company; or

          (3)  to add any additional Events of Default; or

     principal, and with  or without  interest  coupons, or to permit or
     facilitate  the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form, or to
     permit or  facilitate  the  issuance  of  Original  Issue  Discount
     Securities; or

           (5)   to  add  to,  change or  eliminate  any  of  the provisions  of
     this Indenture in respect  of  one  or  more series  of  Securities,
     provided that  any  such  addition, change  or  elimination (i) shall
     neither (A) apply  to  any Security  of  any series created prior to the
     execution  of such  supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit  of
     such  provision nor (B) modify the rights of the  Holder  of any  such
     Security with respect to such provision  or  (ii) shall  become effective
     only when there is no such  Security Outstanding; or

            (6)   to  secure  the  Securities  pursuant  to   the requirements
     of  Section 1005, or to otherwise  secure  the Securities of any series; or

           (7)   to establish the form or terms of Securities  of any series as
     permitted by Sections 201 and 301; or

           (8)   to  evidence and provide for the  acceptance  of appointment
     hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or
     more series and to add to or change any  of  the  provisions  of  this
     Indenture  as  shall  be necessary to provide for or facilitate the
     administration of the  trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant
     to the requirements of Section 611(b); or

           (9)   to  cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any  provision
     herein  which may be inconsistent  with  any other provision herein, or to
     make any other provisions with
     respect   to   matters  or  questions  arising  under   this Indenture,
     provided that such action pursuant to this clause (9)  shall not adversely
     affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any
     material respect; or

           (10)  to make provision with respect to the conversion rights  of
     Holders pursuant to the requirements of  Article Twelve,  including
     providing  for  the  conversion  of  the securities into any security
     (other than the Common Stock of the Company) or property of the Company; or

          (11)  to conform to any mandatory provisions of law.

Section 902.   Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders.

      With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of  principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected  by such
supplemental indenture, by Act of said  Holders delivered  to  the  Company and
the Trustee,  the  Company,  when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the
Trustee may enter  into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any
of  the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in  any manner  the  rights
of the Holders of Securities of  such  series
under   this   Indenture;  provided,  however,   that   no   such supplemental
indenture shall, without the consent of  the  Holder of each Outstanding
Security affected thereby,

          (1)  change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment
     of principal of or interest on, any Security, or  reduce  the  principal
     amount thereof  or  the  rate  of interest  thereon (including any change
     in the  Floating  or Adjustable  Rate Provision pursuant to which  such
     rate  is determined  that would reduce such rate for any  period)  or any
     premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or  reduce the  amount  of the
     principal of an Original Issue  Discount Security that would be due and
     payable upon a declaration of acceleration  of  the Maturity thereof
     pursuant  to  Section 502,  or  change any Place of Payment where, or the
     coin  or currency  in which, any Security or any premium or  interest
     thereon  is  payable, or impair the right to institute  suit for  the
     enforcement of any such payment on  or  after  the Stated  Maturity thereof
     (or, in the case of redemption,  on or after the Redemption Date), or

           (2)  reduce the percentage in principal amount of  the Outstanding
     Securities of any series, the consent  of  whose Holders is required for
     any such supplemental indenture,  or the  consent of whose Holders is
     required for any waiver (of compliance  with  certain provisions of  this
     Indenture  or certain  defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided
     for in this Indenture, or

           (3)   if  applicable, make any change  that  adversely affects  the
     right  to convert any security  to  which  the provisions  of Article
     Twelve are applicable or,  except  as provided in this Indenture, decrease
     the conversion rate  or increase the conversion price of any such security,
     or

           (4)   modify  any of the provisions of  this  Section, Section  513
     or  Section 907, except to increase  any  such percentage  or  to provide
     that certain other provisions  of this  Indenture  cannot be modified or
     waived  without  the consent  of the Holder of each Outstanding Security
     affected thereby,  provided, however, that this clause shall  not  be
     deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect  to changes  in
     the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section and
     Section 907, or the deletion  of
     this  proviso,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements   of Sections
     611(b) and 901(8).

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or  other
provision of this Indenture which has  expressly  been included solely for the
benefit of one or more particular  series of  Securities,  or which modifies the
rights of the  Holders  of Securities of such series with respect to such
covenant or  other provision,  shall be deemed not to affect the rights  under
this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.

      It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this
Section   to   approve  the  particular  form  of  any   proposed supplemental
indenture, but it shall be sufficient  if  such  Act shall approve the substance
thereof.

Section 903.  Execution of Supplemental Indentures.

     In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any
supplemental  indenture permitted by  this  Article  or  the modifications
thereby of the trusts created by  this  Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled
to receive, and (subject to Section 601)  shall  be  fully protected in relying
upon, an  Opinion  of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental
indenture is  authorized or permitted by this Indenture.  The Trustee  may, but
shall  not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture  which
affects the Trustee's  own  rights,  duties  or immunities under this Indenture
or otherwise.

Section 904.  Effect of Supplemental Indentures.

      Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this
Article,   this   Indenture  shall  be  modified  in   accordance therewith, and
such supplemental indenture shall form a  part  of this  Indenture for all
purposes; and every Holder of  Securities theretofore  or thereafter
authenticated and delivered  hereunder shall be bound thereby.

Section 905.  Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.

      Every  supplemental  indenture executed  pursuant  to  this Article  shall
conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.

Section 906.   Reference    in    Securities   to    Supplemental Indentures.

      Securities of any series authenticated and delivered  after the  execution
of  any supplemental indenture pursuant  to  this Article  may,  and  shall  if
required by  the  Trustee,  bear  a notation  in  form  approved by the  Trustee
as  to  any  matter
provided  for  in such supplemental indenture.   If  the  Company shall  so
determine, new Securities of any series so modified  as to conform, in the
opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such  supplemental indenture may
be prepared and executed by  the Company  and  authenticated  and  delivered  by
the  Trustee  in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.

Section 907.  Waiver of Compliance by Holders.

      Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any  of  the
acts which the Company is required  to  do,  or  is prohibited from doing, by
any of the provisions of this Indenture may,  to  the  extent that such
provisions might  be  changed  or eliminated  by a supplemental indenture
pursuant to  Section  902 upon  consent of holders of not less than a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Securities of the series
affected, be omitted or done by the Company, if there is obtained the prior
consent or waiver of the holders of at least a majority in  aggregate principal
amount of the then Outstanding Securities of such series.


                           ARTICLE TEN

                            COVENANTS

Section 1001.  Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.

      The  Company covenants and agrees for the benefit  of  each series  of
Securities that it will duly and  punctually  pay  or cause to be paid the
principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in
accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.

Section 1002.  Maintenance of Office or Agency.

      So long as any Securities are Outstanding, the Company will maintain in
each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where
Securities of that series may be presented or  surrendered for payment, where
Securities of that series  may be  surrendered  for registration of transfer or
exchange,  where Securities  of that series may be surrendered for conversion
and where  notices and demands to or upon the Company in  respect  of the
Securities of that series and this Indenture may be  served.  The Company will
give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location,  and  any  change in
the location, of  such  office  or
agency.   If  at any time the Company shall fail to maintain  any such  required
office or agency or shall  fail  to  furnish  the Trustee with the address
thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or
served at the Corporate  Trust Office  of  the  Trustee,  and the Company
hereby  appoints  the
Trustee   as   its  agent  to  receive  all  such  presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands.

     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other  offices
or agencies where the Securities of  one  or  more series  may  be  presented or
surrendered for  any  or  all  such purposes  and  may  from time to time
rescind such  designations; provided,  however, that no such designation or
rescission  shall in  any  manner relieve the Company of its obligation to
maintain an  office  or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities  of any
series  for  such purposes.  The Company  will  give  prompt written  notice  to
the  Trustee  of  any  such  designation  or rescission  and of any change in
the location of any  such  other office or agency.

Section 1003.  Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.

     If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with  respect
to any series of Securities, it will, on or  before each  due date of the
principal of or any premium or interest  on any of the Securities of that
series, segregate and hold in trust for  the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so
becoming due until  such  sums  shall  be paid to such  Persons  or  otherwise
disposed  of  as  herein provided and will  promptly  notify  the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

      Whenever  the Company shall have one or more Paying  Agents for any series
of Securities, it will, prior to each due date  of the principal of or any
premium or interest on any Securities  of that series, deposit with a Paying
Agent a sum sufficient to  pay such  amount,  such  sum  to be held as  provided
by  the  Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee)  the
Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

      The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series  of Securities
other than the Trustee to execute and deliver  to  the Trustee an instrument in
which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions
of this Section, that such Paying  Agent  will (i) comply with the provisions of
the  Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (ii)  during the
continuance  of  any default by the Company  (or  any  other obligor upon the
Securities of that series) in the making of  any payment in respect of the
Securities of that series, and upon the written request of the Trustee,
forthwith pay to the Trustee  all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for
payment in respect of the Securities of that series.

      The  Company may at any time, for the purpose of  obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to  the  Trustee  all sums held
in trust by the Company  or  such Paying  Agent, such sums to be held by the
Trustee upon the  same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the
Company  or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent  to
the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with
respect to such money.

     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then  held  by
the  Company, in trust for  the  payment  of  the principal  of or any premium
or interest on any Security  of  any
series   and  remaining  unclaimed  for  two  years  after   such principal,
premium or interest has become due and payable  shall be  paid  to the Company
on Company Request, or (if then held  by the  Company) shall be discharged from
such trust; and the Holder of  such  Security  shall  thereafter, as  an
unsecured  general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof,  and
all liability  of  the Trustee or such Paying Agent with  respect  to such
trust  money, and all liability of the Company  as  trustee thereof,  shall
thereupon  cease; provided,  however,  that  the Trustee  or such Paying Agent,
before being required to make  any such  repayment, may at the expense of the
Company  cause  to  be published once, in a newspaper published in the English
language, customarily  published  on  each  Business  Day  and  of  general
circulation  in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of  New  York, notice  that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a  date specified therein, which
shall not be less than 30 days from  the date  of  such publication, any
unclaimed balance of  such  money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

Section 1004.  Statement by Officers as to Default.

      The  Company  will deliver to the Trustee within  120  days after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date  hereof,  a
certificate signed by the  Company's  principal executive  officer,  principal
financial  officer  or  principal accounting  officer stating whether or not to
the best  knowledge of  the  signer  thereof the Company is in  compliance  with
all terms, conditions and covenants of this Indenture (without regard to  any
period  of  grace  or  requirement  of  notice  provided hereunder)  and  if
the  signer has obtained  knowledge  of  any continuing default by the Company
in the performance, observation
or   fulfillment  of  any  such  term,  condition  or   covenant, specifying
each such default and the nature thereof.

Section 1005.  Limitations on Liens on Common Stock of  Principal Insurance
               Subsidiaries.

      As  long as any of the Securities remains outstanding,  the Company  will
not,  and will not permit any Principal  Insurance Subsidiary to, issue, assume,
incur or guarantee any indebtedness for  borrowed money secured by a mortgage,
pledge, lien or  other encumbrance,  directly or indirectly, on any of the
Common  Stock of  a Principal Insurance Subsidiary, which Common Stock is owned
by  the  Company or by any Principal Insurance Subsidiary, unless
the   Securities  and,  if  the  Company  so  elects,  any  other indebtedness
of  the  Company  ranking  on  a  parity  with  the Securities, shall be secured
equally and ratably with,  or  prior to, such secured indebtedness for borrowed
money so long as it is outstanding.


                         ARTICLE ELEVEN

                    Redemption of Securities

Section 1101.  Applicability of Article.

      Securities of any series which are redeemable before  their Stated
Maturity  shall  be redeemable in accordance  with  their terms  and  (except
as otherwise specified  as  contemplated  by Section 301 for Securities of any
series) in accordance with this Article.

Section 1102.  Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

      In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all
the Securities of any series, the Company shall, at least  60 days prior to the
Redemption Date fixed by the  Company (unless  a  shorter notice shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee), notify  the  Trustee of such Redemption Date,  of
the  principal amount  of  Securities  of such series to  be  redeemed  and,  if
applicable,  of the tenor of the Securities to be  redeemed.   In the  case of
any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of  any  restriction on
such redemption provided in the terms  of such Securities or elsewhere in this
Indenture, the Company shall furnish  the  Trustee  with an Officers'
Certificate  evidencing compliance with such restriction.

Section 1103.  Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.

      If  less  than all the Securities of any series are  to  be redeemed
(unless all of the Securities of such series and  of  a specified tenor are to
be redeemed), the particular Securities to be  redeemed shall be selected not
more than 45 days prior to the Redemption  Date by the Trustee, from the
Outstanding  Securities of  such  series  not previously called for redemption,
by  such method  as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and  which may
provide for the selection for redemption of portions  (equal to  the  minimum
authorized denomination for Securities  of  that series  or any integral
multiple thereof) of the principal amount of  Securities of such series of a
denomination larger  than  the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of
that series. If less than all of the Securities of such series and of a
specified tenor  are  to  be  redeemed,  the particular  Securities  to  be
redeemed  shall be selected not more than 45 days  prior  to  the Redemption
Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding  Securities of  such  series  and
specified tenor not previously  called  for redemption in accordance with the
preceding sentence.

     If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in  part
before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the
Security so selected, the converted portion of  such  Security shall be deemed
(so far as may be) to  be  the portion  selected  for redemption.  Securities
which  have  been converted  during a selection of Securities to be redeemed
shall be  treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such
selection.

      The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the
Securities selected for redemption and, in the case  of  any Securities selected
for partial redemption, the principal  amount thereof to be redeemed.

      For  all  purposes  of this Indenture, unless  the  context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption  of Securities  shall
relate, in the case of any Securities  redeemed or  to  be redeemed only in
part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been
or is to be redeemed.

Section 1104.  Notice of Redemption.

      Notice  of  redemption shall be given by first-class  mail, postage
prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than  60  days prior to the Redemption
Date, to each Holder of Securities to  be redeemed, at its address appearing in
the Security Register.

     All notices of redemption shall state:

          (1)  the Redemption Date,

          (2)  the Redemption Price,

          (3)  if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series  are to
     be redeemed, the identification (and, in  the case  of partial redemption
     of any Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to
     be redeemed,

           (4)   that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will  become
     due and payable upon each such Security  to  be redeemed  and,  if
     applicable, that interest  thereon  will cease to accrue on and after said
     date,

           (5)  if applicable, the conversion price, and that the date  on
     which  the right to convert the principal  of  the Securities  or  the
     portions thereof to  be  redeemed  will terminate  will  be the Redemption
     Date  and  the  place  or
     places   where  such  Securities  may  be  surrendered   for conversion,

           (6)  the place or places where such Securities are  to be surrendered
     for payment of the Redemption Price, and

          (7)  that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.

      Notice  of redemption of Securities to be redeemed  at  the election of
the Company shall be given by the Company or, at  the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the  expense of the Company.

Section 1105.  Deposit of Redemption Price.

     Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the  Trustee
or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as  its own Paying Agent,
segregate and hold in trust as provided in  Section  1003)  an  amount of money
sufficient  to  pay  the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date
shall  be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities
which  are to be redeemed on that date, other than any Securities called  for
redemption on that date which  have  been  converted prior to the date of such
deposit.

      If any Security or portion thereof called for redemption is converted,
any  money deposited with the  Trustee  or  with  any Paying  Agent  or  so
segregated  and  held  in  trust  for  the redemption of such Security or
portion thereof shall (subject  to any  right  of  the  Holder of such Security
or  any  Predecessor Security to receive interest as provided in the last
paragraph of Section 307) be paid to the Company upon Company Request  or,  if
then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust.

Section 1106.  Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

      Notice  of  redemption having been given as aforesaid,  the Securities  so
to  be  redeemed shall, on the  Redemption  Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the  payment  of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest)  such Securities shall cease to bear interest.  Upon surrender  of
any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security
shall  be paid by the Company at the Redemption  Price, together  with accrued
interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however,  that,  unless otherwise
specified  as  contemplated  by Section 301, installments of interest whose
Stated Maturity is on or  prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the
Holders of  such  Securities,  or  one  or more  Predecessor  Securities,
registered  as  such  at the close of business  on  the  relevant Record  Dates
according to their terms  and  the  provisions  of Section 307.

      If  any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender  thereof for redemption, the  principal  and  any premium shall, until
paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in
the Security.

Section 1107.  Securities Redeemed in Part.

      Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall  be surrendered at
a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the  Company or  the  Trustee so requires,
due endorsement by,  or  a  written instrument  of transfer in form satisfactory
to the  Company  and the  Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his
attorney duly  authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute,  and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without
service charge, a new Security or Securities  of the same series and of like
tenor, of any authorized denomination as  requested by such Holder, in aggregate
principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal of the Security so surrendered.


                         ARTICLE TWELVE

                    CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 1201.  Applicability of Article.

      The  provisions of this Article shall be applicable to  the Securities  of
any series which are convertible into  shares  of Common  Stock of the Company,
and the issuance of such shares  of Common  Stock upon the conversion of such
Securities,  except  as otherwise  specified  as  contemplated by  Section  301
for  the Securities of such series.

Section 1202.  Exercise of Conversion Privilege.

     In order to exercise a conversion privilege, the Holder of a Security  of a
series with such a privilege shall surrender  such Security  to  the Company at
the office or agency maintained  for that  purpose  pursuant to Section 1002,
accompanied  by  written notice  to  the  Company that the Holder elects to
convert  such Security or a specified portion thereof.  Such notice shall  also
state, if different from the name and address of such Holder, the name  or
names  (with  address)  in  which  the  certificate  or certificates for shares
of Common Stock which shall  be  issuable on  such conversion shall be issued.
Securities surrendered  for conversion  shall (if so required by the Company or
the  Trustee) be  duly endorsed by or accompanied by instruments of transfer in
forms  satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly  executed by  the
registered  Holder or its attorney  duly  authorized  in writing; and Securities
so surrendered for conversion during  the period  from the close of business on
any Regular Record Date  to the  opening of business on the next succeeding
Interest  Payment
Date  (excluding  Securities  or  portions  thereof  called   for redemption
during  such  period) shall also  be  accompanied  by payment in funds
acceptable to the Company of an amount equal  to the  interest  payable  on
such Interest  Payment  Date  on  the principal amount of such Security then
being converted, and  such
interest   shall   be   payable   to   such   registered   Holder
notwithstanding the conversion of such Security, subject  to  the provisions  of
Section 307 relating to the payment  of  Defaulted Interest  by the Company.  As
promptly as practicable  after  the receipt of such notice and of any payment
required pursuant to  a Board  Resolution  and, subject to Section  303,  set
forth,  or determined  in the manner provided, in an Officers'  Certificate, or
established  in  one or more indentures  supplemental  hereto setting  forth
the  terms of such series of  Security,  and  the surrender  of  such Security
in accordance with  such  reasonable regulations as the Company may prescribe,
the Company shall issue and shall deliver, at the office or agency at which such
Security is  surrendered,  to  such  Holder or on  its  written  order,  a
certificate  or  certificates for the number of  full  shares  of Common  Stock
issuable upon the conversion of such Security  (or specified portion thereof),
in accordance with the provisions  of such  Board  Resolution,  Officers'
Certificate  or  supplemental indenture,  and  cash  as  provided therein  in
respect  of  any fractional  share  of such Common Stock otherwise  issuable
upon such  conversion.  Such conversion shall be deemed to  have  been effected
immediately prior to the close of business on the  date on  which  such notice
and such payment, if required, shall  have been  received in proper order for
conversion by the Company  and such  Security  shall have been surrendered as
aforesaid  (unless such  Holder  shall have so surrendered such Security  and
shall have  instructed  the  Company to  effect  the  conversion  on  a
particular date following such surrender and such Holder shall be entitled  to
convert such Security on such date, in  which  case such  conversion shall be
deemed to be effected immediately prior to  the  close  of business on such
date) and at  such  time  the rights  of  the  Holder of such Security as such
Security  Holder shall cease and the person or persons in whose name or names
any certificate  or certificates for shares of Common  Stock  of  the Company
shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have  become  the
Holder  or Holders of  record  of  the  shares represented  thereby.  Except as
set forth above and  subject  to the  final  paragraph  of Section 307, no
payment  or  adjustment shall  be  made  upon any conversion on account of  any
interest accrued  on  the  Securities surrendered  for  conversion  or  on
account  of  any  dividends on the Common Stock  of  the  Company issued upon
such conversion.

     In the case of any Security which is converted in part only, upon  such
conversion the Company shall execute and the  Trustee shall  authenticate and
deliver to or on the order of the  Holder thereof,  at  the  expense  of the
Company,  a  new  Security  or Securities  of  the same series, of authorized
denominations,  in aggregate  principal amount equal to the unconverted  portion
of such Security.

Section 1203.  No Fractional Shares.

      No fractional share of Common Stock of the Company shall be
issued  upon  conversions of Securities of any series.   If  more than one
Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by  the  same  Holder,
the number of full shares which  shall  be issuable  upon conversion shall be
computed on the basis  of  the aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Securities
(or  specified portions  thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered.
If, except for the provisions of this Section 1203, any Holder of a  Security or
Securities would be entitled to a fractional share of  Common  Stock  of  the
Company upon the  conversion  of  such Security  or  Securities,  or  specified
portions  thereof,  the Company shall pay to such Holder an amount in cash equal
to  the current  market value of such fractional share computed,  (i)  if such
Common  Stock  is listed or admitted  to  unlisted  trading privileges on a
national securities exchange, on the basis of the last reported sale price
regular way on such exchange on the last trading  day  prior to the date of
conversion upon which  such  a sale  shall have been effected, or (ii) if such
Common  Stock  is not  at  the  time  so  listed or admitted  to  unlisted
trading privileges on a national securities exchange, on the basis of the
average of the bid and asked prices of such Common Stock  in  the over-the-
counter  market, on the last trading day  prior  to  the date  of  conversion,
as reported by the National Association  of Securities  Dealers  Automated
Quotation System,  or  if  not  so available,  the fair market price as
determined by the  Board  of
Directors.   For  purposes of this Section, "trading  day"  shall mean  each
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday  other than  any day on which
the Common Stock is not traded on the  New York Stock Exchange, or if the Common
Stock is not traded on  the New  York Stock Exchange, on the principal exchange
or market  on which the Common Stock is traded or quoted.

Section 1204.  Adjustment of Conversion Price.

      The  conversion price of Securities of any series  that  is convertible
into Common Stock of the Company shall  be  adjusted
for   any   stock   dividends,  stock  splits,  reclassification, combinations
or similar transactions in accordance with the terms of  the supplemental
indenture or Board Resolutions setting forth the terms of the Securities of such
series.

     Whenever the conversion price is adjusted, the Company shall compute the
adjusted conversion price in accordance with terms of the  applicable  Board
Resolution or supplemental  indenture  and shall prepare an Officers'
Certificate setting forth the adjusted conversion price and showing in
reasonable detail the facts  upon which  such  adjustment  is  based, and  such
certificate  shall forthwith  be filed at each office or agency maintained  for
the purpose of conversion of Securities pursuant to Section 1002 and, if
different,  with  the Trustee.  The Company  shall  forthwith cause a notice
setting forth the adjusted conversion price to  be mailed, first class postage
prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of  such series at its address appearing
on the Security Register and to any conversion agent other than the Trustee.

Section 1205.  Notice of Certain Corporate Actions.

In Case:

           (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution)
     on its Common Stock (other than  dividends  or distributions  which will
     not require an adjustment  of  the conversion  price  of Securities of any
     series  pursuant  to Section 1204); or

           (b)  the Company shall authorize the granting  to  the holders  of
     its Common Stock of rights, options or  warrants to  subscribe for or
     purchase any shares of capital stock of any  class or of any other rights
     (other than any such grant for  which  approval of any shareholders of the
     Company  is required  or  which  will not require an adjustment  of  the
     conversion  price  of Securities of any series  pursuant  to Section 1204);
     or

           (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company
     (other  than a subdivision or  combination  of  its outstanding shares of
     Common Stock, or of any consolidation, merger or share exchange to which
     the Company is a party and for  which  approval of any shareholders of the
     Company  is required  or  which  will not require an adjustment  of  the
     conversion  price  of Securities of any series  pursuant  to Section 1204),
     or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

           (d)  of  the  voluntary  or  involuntary  dissolution, liquidation or
     winding up of the Company;

then  the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee,   and shall  cause
to be mailed to all Holders at their last  addresses as they shall appear in the
Securities Register, at least 20 days (or  10  days in any case specified in
clause (a) or  (b)  above) prior  to  the  applicable record date hereinafter
specified,  a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken  for
the  purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights,  options  or warrants,  or,
if a record is not to be taken, the  date  as  of which  the  holders of Common
Stock of record to be  entitled  to such  dividend, distribution, rights,
options or warrants are  to be  determined,  or (ii) the date on which such
reclassification,
consolidation,   merger,  share  exchange,   sale,   dissolution, liquidation
or  winding up is expected to become effective,  and the  date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of  record  shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of  Common Stock  for  securities, cash or other property
deliverable  upon such  reclassification,  consolidation, merger,  share
exchange, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.  If at any time the
Trustee shall not be the conversion agent, a copy of such  notice shall  also
forthwith be filed by the Company with the conversion agent.

Section 1206.  Reservation of Shares of Common Stock.

      The  Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free  from
preemptive rights, out of its authorized but  unissued Common  Stock,  for  the
purpose of effecting the  conversion  of Securities,  the  full number of shares
of Common  Stock  of  the Company  then  issuable upon the conversion  of  all
outstanding Securities of any series that have conversion rights.

Section 1207.  Payment of Certain Taxes Upon Conversion.

      The  Company will pay any and all taxes that may be payable in respect of
the issue or delivery of shares of its Common Stock on  conversion of Securities
pursuant hereto.  The Company  shall not, however, be required to pay any tax
which may be payable  in respect  of  any transfer involved in the issue and
delivery  of shares  of  its  Common Stock in a name other than  that  of  the
Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue  or
delivery  shall be made unless and  until  the  person requesting such issue has
paid to the Company the amount  of  any such tax, or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.

Section 1208.  Nonassessability.

      The  Company covenants that all shares of its Common  Stock which may be
issued upon conversion of Securities will upon issue in  accordance  with the
terms hereof be duly and validly  issued and fully paid and nonassessable.

Section 1209.  Effect  of  Consolidation or Merger on  Conversion Privilege.

      In case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company
into or with any other Person, or in the case of a statutory  share exchange to
which the Company is a party  or  in case of any sale or conveyance of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company (including cash),
the Company or  the  Person formed by such consolidation or the  Person  into
which  the  Company shall have been merged or  the  Person  which shall have
acquired such assets, or the surviving entity in  such share exchange, as the
case may be, shall execute and deliver  to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
providing that the Holder of each  Security then outstanding of any series that
is convertible into  Common  Stock of the Company shall have  the  right,  which
right   shall  be  the  exclusive  conversion  right   thereafter available  to
said Holder (until the expiration of the conversion right  of such Security), to
convert such Security into the  kind and  amount  of shares of stock or other
securities  or  property (including  cash)  receivable  upon such
consolidation,  merger, share  exchange, conveyance or sale by a holder of the
number  of shares  of  Common Stock of the Company into which such  Security
might   have   been   converted   immediately   prior   to   such
consolidation,  merger,  share  exchange,  conveyance  or   sale,
subject   to  compliance  with  the  other  provisions  of   this
Indenture,  such Security and such supplemental indenture.   Such supplemental
indenture shall provide for adjustments which  shall be  as nearly equivalent as
may be practicable to the adjustments provided  for  in  such Security.  The
above provisions  of  this Section  shall  similarly  apply  to  successive
consolidations, mergers,  share exchanges, conveyances or sales. It is
expressly agreed  and  understood that anything in this  Indenture  to  the
contrary   notwithstanding,  if,   pursuant   to   such   merger, consolidation,
share exchange, conveyance or  sale,  holders  of outstanding shares of Common
Stock of the Company do not  receive shares  of common stock of the surviving
corporation but  receive other  securities,  cash  or other property  or  any
combination thereof,  Holders  of  Securities shall not  have  the  right  to
thereafter  convert  their Securities into common  stock  of  the
surviving  corporation  or  the  corporation  which  shall   have acquired such
assets, but rather, shall have the right upon  such conversion  to  receive  the
other  securities,  cash  or  other property receivable by a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock  of  the  Company into which the Securities
held  by  such holder  might  have  been  converted immediately  prior  to  such
consolidation, merger, share exchange, conveyance or sale, all as more  fully
provided in the first sentence of this Section  1209.  Anything  in  this
Section 1209 to the contrary notwithstanding, the  provisions of this Section
1209 shall not apply to a  merger or  consolidation of another corporation with
or into the Company or any share exchange to which the Company is a party
pursuant to which  both of the following conditions are applicable:  (i)  the
Company  is the surviving or successor corporation and  (ii)  the outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Company are not changed or  converted  into  any
other securities or property  (including cash)  or changed in number or
character or reclassified pursuant to the terms of such merger, consolidation or
share exchange.

      As  evidence of the kind and amount of shares of  stock  or
other   securities  or  property  (including  cash)  into   which
Securities   may   properly  be  convertible   after   any   such consolidation,
merger, share exchange, conveyance or sale, or  as
to   the   appropriate  adjustments  of  the  conversion   prices applicable
with respect thereto, the Trustee shall be  furnished with  and may accept the
certificate or opinion of an independent certified  public accountant with
respect thereto;  and,  in  the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee,
the Trustee  may conclusively  rely  thereon,  and shall  not  be  responsible
or accountable  to  any Holder of Securities for  any  provision  in conformity
therewith  or approved by such independent  certified accountant which may be
contained in said supplemental indenture.

Section 1210.  Duties of Trustee Regarding Conversion.

      Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall  at  any time  be
under  any  duty or responsibility  to  any  Holder  of Securities of any series
that is convertible into Common Stock of the  Company  to  determine whether any
facts  exist  which  may require  any adjustment of the conversion price, or
with  respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with
respect  to  the  method  employed,  whether  herein  or  in  any supplemental
indenture, any resolutions of the Board of Directors or  written  instrument
executed by one or more officers  of  the Company provided to be employed in
making the same.  Neither  the Trustee  nor  any  conversion agent  shall  be
accountable  with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount)  of
any shares  of  Common Stock of the Company, or of any securities  or property,
which may at any time be issued or delivered  upon  the conversion  of  any
Securities and neither the  Trustee  nor  any conversion  agent makes any
representation with respect  thereto.  Subject to the provisions of Section 601,
neither the Trustee nor any  conversion agent shall be responsible for any
failure of the Company  to  issue, transfer or deliver any shares of its  Common
Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property  upon the surrender
of any Security for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the
covenants of the Company contained in this Article  Twelve  or  in  the
applicable  supplemental  indenture, resolutions  of  the  Board of Directors
or  written  instrument executed by one or more duly authorized officers of the
Company.

Section 1211.  Repayment of Certain Funds Upon Conversion.

     Any funds which at any time shall have been deposited by the Company  or
on its behalf with the Trustee or any  other  paying agent for the purpose of
paying the principal of, and premium, if any,  and  interest, if any, on any of
the Securities  (including funds deposited for the sinking fund referred to in
Article Three hereof) and which shall not be required for such purposes because
of  the conversion of such Securities as provided in this Article Twelve  shall
after such conversion be repaid to the  Company  by the Trustee upon the
Company's written request.


                        ARTICLE THIRTEEN
               DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE

Section 1301.  Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or  Covenant Defeasance.

      The  Company may elect, at any time, to have either Section 1302 or
Section 1303 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any series,  upon
compliance with the conditions set forth  below  in this Article Thirteen.

Section 1302.  Defeasance and Discharge.

      Upon  the  Company's  exercise of the  option  provided  in Section 1301
to have this Section 1302 applied to the Outstanding Securities  of  any series,
the Company shall be deemed  to  have
been  discharged  from  its  obligations  with  respect  to   the Outstanding
Securities of such series as provided in this Section on  and  after the date
the conditions set forth in Section  1304
are   satisfied  (hereinafter  called  "Defeasance").   For  this purpose,  such
Defeasance means that the Company shall be  deemed to  have  paid and discharged
the entire indebtedness represented by  the  Outstanding  Securities  of  such
series  and  to  have satisfied all its other obligations under the Securities
of  such series  and  this  Indenture insofar as the  Securities  of  such
series  are  concerned (and the Trustee, at the  expense  of  the Company,
shall  execute  proper  instruments  acknowledging  the same),  subject  to  the
following  which  shall  survive  until otherwise terminated or discharged
hereunder:  (1) the rights  of Holders of Securities of such series to receive,
solely from  the trust  fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set
forth in  such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium
and  interest on such Securities  of  such  series  when payments  are due, (2)
the Company's obligations with respect  to the  Securities of such series under
Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and  1003,  (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties
and immunities of  the  Trustee  hereunder, including, without  limitation,  its
rights under Section 607  and (4) this Article Thirteen.  Subject to  compliance
with  this  Article  Thirteen,  the  Company  may exercise its option provided
in Section 1301 to have this Section
1302   applied  to  the  Outstanding  Securities  of  any  series
notwithstanding  the  prior exercise of its  option  provided  in Section  1301
to  have Section 1303 applied to  the  Outstanding Securities of such series.

Section 1303.  Covenant Defeasance.

      Upon  the  Company's  exercise of the  option  provided  in Section 1301
to have this Section 1303 applied to the outstanding Securities of any series,
(1) the Company shall be released  from its  obligations  under  Section 1005
and  Section  801  and  any provision  of  a  supplemental indenture  specified
for  release pursuant to the terms thereof and (2) the occurrence of any event
specified  in  Sections 501(3), 501(4) (with respect  to  Section 1005  and
Section 801) and 501(5) shall be deemed not to  be  or result  in an Event of
Default, in each case with respect to  the Outstanding Securities of such series
as provided in this Section on  and  after the date the conditions set forth in
Section  1304
are  satisfied  (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance").   For this purpose,
such Covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and
shall have no liability in respect of any term,  condition  or limitation set
forth in any  such  specified Section  (to  the  extent so specified in  the
case  of  Section
501(4)),  whether  directly  or  indirectly  by  reason  of   any reference
elsewhere herein to any such Section or by  reason  of any  reference in any
such Section to any other provision  herein or in any other document, but the
remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of such series shall be
unaffected thereby.

Section 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

      The  following  shall be the conditions to  application  of either Section
1302 or Section 1303 to the Outstanding Securities of any series:

           (1)  The  Company shall irrevocably have deposited  or caused  to be
     deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee that satisfies the
     requirements contemplated by Section  609 and  agrees  to comply with the
     provisions of  this  Article Thirteen applicable to it) as trust funds in
     trust  for  the purpose  of  making  the  following  payments,
     specifically pledged  as  security  for,  and dedicated  solely  to,  the
     benefit  of  the Holders of Outstanding Securities  of  such series,  (A)
     in  the  case  of Securities  of  such  series denominated in U.S. dollars,
     (i) money in an amount, or (ii) U.S.  Government  Obligations  that
     through  the  scheduled payment  of  principal and interest in  respect
     thereof  in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one
     day  before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or  (iii) a
     combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the  opinion  of a
     nationally recognized firm of independent public  accountants  expressed in
     a  written  certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and
     discharge,  and which  shall  be applied by the Trustee (or any  such
     other qualifying  trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal  of and  any
     premium  and interest on the  Securities  of  such series  on  the
     respective Stated Maturities, in  accordance with  the terms of this
     Indenture and the Securities of such series.  As used herein, "U.S.
     Government Obligation" means (x)  any  security  that is (i) a direct
     obligation  of  the United States of America for the payment of which full
     faith and  credit  of the United States of America is  pledged  or (ii)  an
     obligation of a Person controlled or supervised  by and  acting  as an
     agency or instrumentality for the  United States  of  America the payment
     of which is  unconditionally guaranteed  as  a  full faith and credit
     obligation  by  the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or
     (ii), is  not  callable or redeemable at the option of the  issuer thereof,
     and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section
     3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended)  as custodian with
     respect to any specific  payment of  principal  of  or interest on any such
     U.S.  Government
     Obligation  specified  in  Clause  (x)  and  held  by   such custodian  for
     the account of the holder of such  depositary
     receipt,  or  with  respect  to  any  specific  payment   of principal  of
     or  interest  on  any  such  U.S.  Government Obligation, provided that
     (except as required by  law)  such custodian is not authorized to make any
     deduction  from  the amount payable to the Holder of such depositary
     receipt from any  amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S.
     Government  Obligation or the specific payment of  principal or  interest
     evidenced by such depositary receipt; or (B) in the  case  of  Securities
     of such series  denominated  in  a currency  other  than the U.S. dollar,
     (i)  money  in  such
     currency   in   an   amount,  or  (ii)  Foreign   Government Obligations
     that through the scheduled payment of  principal and  interest  in respect
     thereof in accordance  with  their terms  will provide, not later than one
     day before  the  due date of any payment, money in such currency in an
     amount, or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the
     opinion  of  a  nationally recognized  firm  of  independent public
     accountants  expressed in  a  written  certification thereof delivered to
     the Trustee, to pay and discharge,  and which  shall  be applied by the
     Trustee (or any  such  other qualifying  trustee) to pay and discharge, the
     principal  of and  any  premium  and interest on the  Securities  of  such
     series  on  the respective Stated Maturities, in  accordance with  the
     terms of this Indenture and the Securities of such
     series.   As  used  herein, "Foreign Government  Obligation" means  (x)
     any security that is (i) a direct obligation  of the government that issued
     such currency for the payment  of which full faith and credit of such
     government is pledged or (ii)  an obligation of a Person controlled or
     supervised  by
     and   acting  as  an  agency  or  instrumentality  for  such
     government   the   payment  of  which   is   unconditionally guaranteed  as
     a full faith and credit obligation  by  such government,  which,  in either
     case  (i)  or  (ii),  is  not callable  or redeemable at the option of the
     issuer thereof, and  (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as
     defined in  Section  3(a)(2)  of  the Securities  Act  of  1933,  as
     amended)  as custodian with respect to any specific  payment of  principal
     of or interest on any such Foreign  Government
     Obligation  specified  in  Clause  (x)  and  held  by   such custodian  for
     the account of the holder of such  depositary
     receipt,  or  with  respect  to  any  specific  payment   of principal  of
     or  interest on any such  Foreign  Government Obligation, provided that
     (except as required by  law)  such custodian is not authorized to make any
     deduction  from  the amount payable to the Holder of such depositary
     receipt from any  amount  received by the custodian  in  respect  of  the
     Foreign  Government  Obligation or the specific  payment  of principal or
     interest evidenced by such depositary receipt.

           (2) In the case of an election under Section 1302, the Company  shall
     have delivered to the Trustee an  Opinion  of
     Counsel   stating  that  the  Holders  of  the   Outstanding Securities  of
     such series will not recognize gain  or  loss for  Federal income tax
     purposes as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be
     effected with respect to  the Securities  of  such series and will be
     subject  to  Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and
     at the same  times as would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and
     discharge were not to occur.

           (3) In the case of an election under Section 1303, the Company  shall
     have delivered to the Trustee an  Opinion  of Counsel  to  the  effect that
     the Holder of the  Outstanding Securities  of such series will not
     recognize gain  or  loss for Federal income tax purposes as result of the
     deposit and Covenant  Defeasance  to be effected  with  respect  to  the
     Securities  of  such series and will be subject  to  Federal income tax on
     the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the
     case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.

           (4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
     Certificate to the effect that the Securities  of such series, if then
     listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted as a result of such
     deposit.

           (5) No Event of Default or event that (after notice or lapse  of
     time  or both) would become an Event  of  Default shall  have occurred and
     be continuing at the time  of  such deposit or, with regard to any Event of
     Default or any  such event  specified in Sections 501(6) and 501(7), at any
     time on  or  prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being
     understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after
     such 90th day).

           (6) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's
     Certificate  and  an  Opinion  of  Counsel,  each stating  that all
     conditions precedent with respect to  such Defeasance or Covenant
     Defeasance have been complied with.

           (7)  Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall  not result  in
     the trust arising from such deposit constituting an  investment company
     within the meaning of the  Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
     unless such trust shall  be
     qualified   under   such  Act  or  exempt  from   regulation thereunder.

Section 1305.  Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign

      The  provisions of this Article shall be applicable to  any sinking fund
for the retirement of Securities of a series  except as  otherwise  specified
as  contemplated  by  Section  301  for Securities of such series.

      The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms
of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a  "mandatory sinking fund
payment", and any payment in excess of such  minimum  amount provided for by the
terms of Securities  of any  series  is herein referred to as an "optional
sinking  fund
payment".   If  provided for by the terms of  Securities  of  any series,  the
cash  amount of any sinking  fund  payment  may  be subject  to  reduction as
provided in Section 1402. Each  sinking fund payment shall be applied to the
redemption of Securities  of any  series  as provided for by the terms of
Securities  of  such series.

Section 1402.  Satisfaction   of  Sinking  Fund   Payments   with Securities.

      The  Company  (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities  of  a series (other
than any previously called for redemption) and  (2) may  apply  as  a credit
Securities of a series which  have  been converted  pursuant to Article Twelve
or Securities of  a  series which  have  been acquired or redeemed either at the
election  of the  Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or  through
the  application  of  permitted optional  sinking  fund  payments pursuant  to
the terms of such Securities or otherwise,  in  each case  in  satisfaction of
all or any part  of  any  sinking  fund payment with respect to the Securities
of such series required to be  made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as
provided for by  the terms of such series; provided that such Securities  have
not  been  previously  so  credited.  Such  Securities  shall  be received  and
credited for such purpose by the  Trustee  at  the Redemption  Price  specified
in such  Securities  for  redemption through  operation  of the sinking fund and
the  amount  of  such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 1403.  Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.

      Not  less  than 45 days prior to each sinking fund  payment date  for any
series of Securities, the Company  will deliver  to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for
that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied  by  payment of cash and the portion thereof,  if  any,
which  is  to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of  that
series pursuant to Section 1402 and will also deliver to the Trustee any
Securities to be so delivered.  Not less than  15 nor  more than 45 days before
each such sinking fund payment date the  Trustee shall select the Securities to
be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in
Section 1103 and  cause  notice of the redemption thereof to be given  in  the
name  of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided
in  Section  1104.   Such  notice having  been  duly  given,  the redemption of
such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in
Sections 1106 and 1107.

       This   instrument  may  be  executed  in  any  number   of counterparts,
each of which so executed shall be deemed to be  an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

      IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF, the parties hereto have  caused  this Indenture  to
be  duly executed, and their respective  corporate seals to be hereunto affixed
and attested, all as of the day  and year first above written.

generally accepted accounting principles in effect immediately before the
relevant change in generally accepted accounting principles became effective,
until either such notice is withdrawn or such covenant is amended in a manner
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Required Banks.

               SECTION 1.03.  Types of Borrowings.  The term "Borrowing"
denotes the aggregation of Loans of one or more Banks to be made to the
Borrower pursuant to Article II on a single date and for a single Interest
Period.  Borrowings are classified for purposes of this Agreement either by
reference to the pricing of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a
"Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of Euro-Dollar Loans) or by
reference to the provisions of Article II under which participation therein is
determined (i.e., a "Committed  Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.01
or 2.05 in which all Banks participate in proportion to their Commitments,
while a "Money Market Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.03 in which
the Bank participants are determined on the basis of their bids in accordance
therewith).


                                  ARTICLE II

                                  THE CREDITS

               SECTION 2.01.  Commitments to Lend.  During the Revolving
Credit Period, each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, to make loans to the Borrower pursuant to this
Section from time to time in amounts such that the aggregate principal amount
of Committed Loans by such Bank at any one time outstanding shall not exceed
the amount of its Commitment.  Each Borrowing under this Section 2.01 shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount
available in accordance with Section 3.02(c)) and shall be made from the
several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments.  Within
the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, repay,
or to the extent permitted by Section 2.11, prepay Loans and reborrow at any
time during the Revolving Credit Period under this Section 2.01.

               SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Committed Borrowing.  The Borrower
shall give the Agent notice (a "Notice of Committed Borrowing") not later than
10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (w) the Domestic Business Day before each
Base Rate Borrowing, (x) the second Domestic Business Day before each CD
Borrowing, (y) the fourth Euro-Currency Business Day before each Euro-Currency
Borrowing and (z) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before each Euro-Dollar
Borrowing, specifying:

               (a)   the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic
         Business Day in the case of a Domestic Borrowing or a Euro-Currency
         Business Day in the case of a Euro-Currency Borrowing or a
         Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

               (b)   the aggregate amount (in Dollars) of such Borrowing,

               (c)   whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be CD
         Loans, Base Rate Loans or Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans,
         and, if Euro-Currency Loans, the currency thereof in accordance with
         the provisions of Section 2.05, and

               (d)   in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the duration of
         the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of
         the definition of Interest Period.

               SECTION 2.03.  Money Market Borrowings.

               (a)   The Money Market Option.  In addition to Committed
Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.01, the Borrower may, as set forth in this
Section, request the Banks during the Revolving Credit Period to make offers
to make Money Market Loans in United States Dollars only to the Borrower.  The
Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower
may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set
forth in this Section.

               (b)   Money Market Quote Request.  When the Borrower wishes to
request offers to make Money Market Loans under this Section, it shall
transmit to the Agent by telex or facsimile transmission a Money Market Quote
Request substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto so as to be received no
later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the fifth Euro-Dollar
Business Day prior to the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a
LIBOR Auction or (y) the Domestic Business Day next preceding the date of
Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in
either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Agent shall have
mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date
of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate
Auction for which such change is to be effective) specifying:

               (i)   the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall be a
         Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a LIBOR Auction or a Domestic
         Business Day in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction,

             (ii)    the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall be
         $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,

            (iii)    the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
         subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period, and

             (iv)    whether the Money Market Quotes requested are to set
         forth a Money Market Margin or a Money Market Absolute Rate.

The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for more than one
Interest Period in a single Money Market Quote Request.  No Money Market Quote
Request shall be given within five Euro-Dollar Business Days (or such other
number of days as the Borrower and the Agent may agree) of any other Money
Market Quote Request.

               (c)   Invitation for Money Market Quotes.  Promptly upon
receipt of a Money Market Quote Request, the Agent shall send to the Banks by
telex or facsimile transmission an Invitation for Money Market Quotes
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, which shall constitute an
invitation by the Borrower to each Bank to submit Money Market Quotes offering
to make the Money Market Loans to which such Money Market Quote Request
relates in accordance with this Section.

               (d)   Submission and Contents of Money Market Quotes.  (i)
Each Bank may submit a Money Market Quote containing an offer or offers to
make Money Market Loans in response to any Invitation for Money Market Quotes.
Each Money Market Quote must comply with the requirements of this subsection
(d) and must be submitted to the Agent by telex or facsimile transmission at
its offices specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01 not later than (x) 2:00
P.M. (New York City time) on the fourth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 9:30 A.M.
(New York City time) on the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an
Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the
Borrower and the Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to
the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the
first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be
effective); provided that Money Market Quotes submitted by the Agent (or any
affiliate of the Agent) in the capacity of a Bank may be submitted, and may
only be submitted, if the Agent or such affiliate notifies the Borrower of the
terms of the offer or offers contained therein not later than (x) one hour
prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or
(y) 15 minutes prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of an
Absolute Rate Auction.  Subject to Articles III and VI, any Money Market Quote
so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Agent
given on the instructions of the Borrower.

               (ii)  Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the
form of Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify:

               (A)   the proposed date of Borrowing,

               (B)   the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which
         each such offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be
         greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (x)
         must be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (y) may not
         exceed the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers
         were requested and (z) may be subject to an aggregate limitation as
         to the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers being
         made by such quoting Bank may be accepted,

               (C)   in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below
         the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (the "Money Market
         Margin") offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a
         percentage (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to
         or subtracted from such base rate,

               (D)   in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of
         interest per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the
         "Money Market Absolute Rate") offered for each such Money Market
         Loan, and

               (E)   the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Money Market Quote may set forth up to five separate offers by the quoting
Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation
for Money Market Quotes.

               (iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it:

               (A)   is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto
         or does not specify all of the information required by subsection
         (d)(ii);

               (B)   contains qualifying, conditional or similar language;

               (C)   proposes terms other than or in addition to those set
         forth in the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or

               (D)   arrives after the time set forth in subsection (d)(i).

               (e)   Notice to Borrower.  The Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that
is in accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that
amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market
Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote
Request.  Any such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the
Agent unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct
a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote.  The Agent's notice to the
Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market
Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified
in the related Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal
amounts and Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case
may be, so offered and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate
principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers in any single Money
Market Quote may be accepted.

               (f)   Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Not later than 10:30
A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to
the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in
either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Agent shall have
mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date
of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate
Auction for which such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify
the Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it
pursuant to subsection (e).  In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice
of Money Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of
offers for each Interest Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may accept
any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

               (i)   the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market
         Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the
         related Money Market Quote Request,

             (ii)    the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must
         be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,

            (iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
         ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the
         case may be, and

             (iv)    the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described
         in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the
         requirements of this Agreement.

               (g)   Allocation by Agent.  If offers are made by two or more
Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as
the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in
respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the
principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are
accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as
possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Agent may deem appropriate) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers.  Determinations
by the Agent of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

               SECTION 2.04.  Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.

               (a)   Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if
any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be
revocable by the Borrower.

               (b)   Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as
provided in subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such
Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City,
to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01 or, subject to the
provisions of Section 2.05, if such Borrowing is to be made in an Alternative
Currency, make available the Equivalent Amount of such Alternative Currency
on that day (in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of
international transactions in such Alternative Currency) to the account of the
Agent at such place in the country whose currency is the relevant Alternative
Currency or such other country as is mutually agreed to by the Borrower and
the Agent as shall have been notified by the Agent to the Banks by not less
than four Domestic Business Days' notice.  Unless the Agent determines that any
applicable condition specified in Article III has not been satisfied, the
Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower
at the Agent's aforesaid address.

               (c)   If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on which
the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Loan denominated in
the same currency from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its
new Loan to make such repayment and only an amount equal to the difference (if
any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be
made available by such Bank to the Agent as provided in subsection (b), or
remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as provided in Section 2.12, as the case
may be.

               (d)   Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank
prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to
the Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such
Bank has made such share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing
in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.04 and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not
have so made such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount
is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the
interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.08 and (ii) in the case
of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Bank shall repay to the Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's
Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.  Nothing in
this subsection (d) shall be deemed to relieve any Bank from its obligation to
extend Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have
against any Bank as a result of any default by such Bank hereunder.  The
failure of any Bank to make Loans hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank
from its obligation to make the Loans required to be made by it hereunder.

               SECTION 2.05.  Euro-Currency Loans in an Alternative Currency.

               (a)  Each Bank severally agrees to make Euro-Currency Loans
pursuant to Section 2.01 in an Alternative Currency upon receipt by the Agent
of a notice from the Borrower, such receipt to be not less than four
Euro-Currency Business Days prior to the date of Borrowing, requesting that
such Euro-Currency Loan be denominated in the Alternative Currency specified
in such notice for the Interest Period specified in such notice.

               (b)  Any Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.01 which is to be made
in an Alternative Currency shall be advanced in the Equivalent Amount of the
Dollar Amount thereof and shall be repaid or prepaid in such Alternative
Currency in the amount of the Alternative Currency borrowed.  Interest payable
on any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be paid in such
Alternative Currency.

               (c)  Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions
referred to in subsection (a) above with respect to any Borrowing, if there
shall occur on or prior to the date of such Borrowing any material change in
political conditions or change in exchange controls which would make it
impracticable for the Euro-Currency Loans comprising such Borrowing to be
denominated in the Alternative Currency specified by the Borrower, then the
Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, and
such Loans shall not be denominated in such Alternative Currency but shall be
made on the date of such Borrowing in Dollars as Base Rate Loans, unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent forthwith that it elects not to borrow on such
date.

               SECTION 2.06.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank shall be
evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of such Bank for the account
of its Applicable Lending Office in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of such Bank's Loans.

               (b)   Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent,
request that its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a separate Note in
an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each
such Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with
appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans
of the relevant type.  Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such
Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the
context may require.

               (c)   Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to Section
3.01(a), the Agent shall forward such Note to such Bank.  Each Bank shall
record the date, amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by it and the
date and amount of each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect
thereto and, in the case of Euro-Currency Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency, the currency, amount and Dollar Amount of such Loans, and may, if
such Bank so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of its Note,
endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to
evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then
outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank to make any such
recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower
hereunder or under the Notes.  Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by
the Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its
Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.

               SECTION 2.07.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan included in any
Borrowing shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and
payable, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

               SECTION 2.08.  Interest Rates.  (a)  Each Base Rate Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from
the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to
the Base Rate for such day.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any
Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable
to Base Rate Loans for such day.

               (b)   Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the CD Margin for such day
plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Interest Period; provided that if
any CD Loan or any portion thereof shall, as a result of clause (2)(b) of the
definition of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less than 30 days,
such portion shall bear interest during such Interest Period at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period.  Such interest shall be
payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest
Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first day
thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any CD Loan shall bear
interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of 2% plus the higher of (i) the sum of the CD Margin for such day
plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to the Interest Period for such Loan and
(ii) the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.

               "CD Margin" means a rate per annum determined in accordance
with the Pricing Schedule.

               The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means
a rate per annum determined pursuant to the following formula:


                         [ CDBR          ]*
               ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
                         [ 1.00 - DRP ]

               ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
               CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
                DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
                 AR  =  Assessment Rate

         __________
         *  The amount in brackets being rounded upward, if
         necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%


               The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period is the
rate of interest determined by the Agent to be the average (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum
bid at 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as practicable)
on the first day of such Interest Period by two or more New York certificate
of deposit dealers of recognized standing for the purchase at face value from
each CD Reference Bank of its certificates of deposit in an amount comparable
to the principal amount of the CD Loan of such CD Reference Bank to which such
Interest Period applies and having a maturity comparable to such Interest
Period.

               "Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement (including without limitation any
basic, supplemental or emergency reserves) for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars
in respect of new non-personal time deposits in dollars in New York City
having a maturity comparable to the related Interest Period and in an amount
of $100,000 or more.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on
and as of the effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve Percentage.

               "Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual assessment rate
in effect on such day which is payable by a member of the Bank Insurance Fund
classified as adequately capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within the meaning of 12
C.F.R. Section 327.3(e) (or any successor provision) to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (or any successor) for such Corporation's (or such
successor's) insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the
United States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as
of the effective date of any change in the Assessment Rate.

               (c)   Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar
Margin for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable
to such Interest Period.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than
three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.

               "Euro-Dollar Margin" means a rate per annum determined in
accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

               The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded
upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage.

               The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest
Period means the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher
1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are
offered to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank
market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Euro-Dollar Business Days
before the first day of such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal
to the principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar Reference
Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time
comparable to such Interest Period.

               "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as
prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any
successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank
of the Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five
billion dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any
other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of
extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United
States office of any Bank to United States residents).  The Adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

               (d)   Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar
Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate
per annum equal to the higher of (i) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin
for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to the
Interest Period for such Loan and (ii) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar
Margin for such day plus the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary,
to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (x) the average (rounded upward,
if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum
at which one day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three
Euro-Dollar Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than
six months as the Agent may select) deposits in Dollars in an amount
approximately equal to such overdue payment due to each of the Euro-Dollar
Reference Banks are offered to such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank in the London
interbank market for the applicable period determined as provided above by (y)
1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage (or, if the circumstances
described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for
such day).

               (e)   Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Money Market LIBOR Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the
Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in
accordance with Section 2.08(c) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing
were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market
Margin quoted by the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.
Each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a
rate per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank
making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.  Such interest shall be
payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest
Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the
first day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Money Market
Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day.

               (f)  Each Euro-Currency Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Currency
Margin for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable
to such Interest Period.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than
three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.

               "Euro-Currency Margin" means a rate per annum determined in
accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

               The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded
upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Currency
Reserve Percentage.

               The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest
Period means the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher
1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in the relevant
Alternative Currency are offered to each of the Euro-Currency Reference Banks
in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two
Euro-Currency Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period in an
amount approximately equal to the principal amount of the Euro-Currency Loan
of such Euro-Currency Reference Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply
and for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period.

               "Euro-Currency Reserve Percentage" means for any day that
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as
prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any
successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank
of the Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five
billion dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any
other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on Euro-Currency Loans is determined or any category of
extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United
States office of any Bank to United States residents).  The Adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Euro-Currency Reserve Percentage.

               (g)  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Currency
Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate
per annum equal to the higher of (i) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Currency
Margin for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable
to the Interest Period for such Loan and (ii) the sum of 2% plus the
Euro-Currency Margin for such day plus the quotient obtained (rounded upward,
if necessary, to the next higher of 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (x) the average
(rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the
respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such amount due remains
unpaid more than three Euro-Currency Business Days, then for such other period
of time not longer than six months as the Agent may select) deposits in the
relevant Alternative Currency in an amount approximately equal to such overdue
payment due to each of the Euro-Currency Reference Banks are offered to such
Euro-Currency Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the applicable
period determined as provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Currency
Reserve Percentage (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of
Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the
rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day).

               (h)   The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable
to the Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower
and the participating Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its
determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

               (i)   Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to
furnish quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this Section.  If any
Reference Bank does not furnish a timely quotation, the Agent shall determine
the relevant interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations
furnished by the remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such
quotations is available on a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01
shall apply.

               SECTION 2.09.  Facility Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the account of the Banks ratably a facility fee at the Facility Fee
Rate (determined daily in accordance with the Pricing Schedule).  Such
facility fee shall accrue (i) from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date of termination of the
Commitments in their entirety), on the daily aggregate amount of the
Commitments (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the
Termination Date or such earlier date of termination to but excluding the date
the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Loans.  Accrued fees under this Section
shall be payable quarterly on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 31 and upon the date of termination of the Commitments in their
entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety).

               SECTION 2.10.  Optional Termination or Reduction of
Commitments.  The Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days'
notice to the Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans
are outstanding at such time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, the
aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Loans.

               SECTION 2.11.  Mandatory Termination of Commitments.  The
Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date, and any Loans then
outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable
on such date.

               SECTION 2.12.  Mandatory and Optional Prepayments.  (a)  If, on
any March 31, June 30, September 30 or December 31, the sum of (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (except Euro-Currency
Loans) and (ii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent of all outstanding
Euro-Currency Borrowings exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of the
Commitments, then the Borrower shall prepay, first, any Borrowing bearing
interest at the Base Rate and, second, any other Borrowing or Borrowings, in
each case as the Borrower may elect in a notice to the Agent, to an extent
such that the sum of (i) and (ii) above does not exceed 100% of the aggregate
amount of the Commitments.

               (b)  Subject in the case of any Fixed Rate Borrowing to Section
2.14, the Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to
the Agent, prepay any Domestic Borrowing (or any Money Market Borrowing
bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) or upon at
least three Euro-Currency Business Days' or Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice
to the Agent, prepay any Euro-Currency Borrowing or Euro-Dollar Borrowing, as
the case may be, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in
part in amounts aggregating $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000,
by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest
thereon to the date of prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment shall be
applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such
Borrowing.

               (c)   Except as provided in Section 2.12(a) or (b), the
Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any
Money Market Loan prior to the maturity thereof.

               (d)   Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this
Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and
of such Bank's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall
not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

               SECTION 2.13.  General Provisions as to Payments.  (a)  The
Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans
and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York
City, to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01.  The Agent will
promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment
received by the Agent for the account of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be due on a
day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any
payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Currency Loans or the
Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Currency Business
Day or a Euro-Dollar Business Day, as the case may be, the date for payment
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Currency Business Day
or Euro-Dollar Business Day, as the case may be, unless such Euro-Currency
Business Day or Euro-Dollar Business Day, as the case may be, falls in another
calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next
preceding Euro-Currency Business Day or Euro-Dollar Business Day, as the case
may be.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Money
Market Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is
extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable
for such extended time.

               (b)  All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes in an Alternative Currency pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be made in
such Alternative Currency in such funds as may then be customary for the
settlement of international transactions in such Alternative Currency for the
account of the Agent, at such time and either in London, England or at such
other place as shall have been agreed upon by the Agent and the Borrower and
notified by the Agent to the Borrower and the Banks by not less than four
Euro-Currency Business Days' notice.  The Agent will promptly cause such
payments to be distributed to each Bank in like funds.

               (c)   Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume
that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and
the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to
each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.
If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment,
each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount
to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

               SECTION 2.14.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower makes any
payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article
II, VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period
fixed pursuant to Section 2.07(d), or if the Borrower fails to borrow or
prepay any Fixed Rate Loans (including a failure to borrow in a specified
Alternative Currency due to the occurrence of any event described in Section
2.05(c), unless the Borrower elects not to make any such Borrowing in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.05(c)) after notice has been given
to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.04(a) or 2.11(c), the Borrower shall
reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or
expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the
related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining,
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of
margin for the period after any such payment or failure to borrow or prepay,
provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a certificate as
to the amount of such loss or expense, which certificate shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and calculation of the amount claimed and shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

               SECTION 2.15.  Computation of Interest and Fees.  Interest
based on the Prime Rate hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  All other
interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

               SECTION 2.16.  Judgment Currency.  If for the purposes of
obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the
Borrower hereunder or under any of the Notes in the currency expressed to be
payable herein or under the Notes (the "specified currency") into another
currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the
specified currency with such other currency at the Agent's New York office on
the Euro-Currency Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is
given.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Bank
or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall, notwithstanding any judgment
in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the
extent that on the Euro-Currency Business Day following receipt by such Bank
or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such
other currency such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance
with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other
currency; if the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than
the sum originally due to such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, in the
specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
judgment, to indemnify such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, against
such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds
(a) the sum originally due to any Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, in
the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Banks as a result
of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Bank under
Section 9.04, such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such
excess to the Borrower.

               SECTION 2.17.  Extension of Termination Date.  The Termination
Date may be extended, in the manner set forth below, on the last day of the
Revolving Credit Period (determined without regard to the last clause in the
definition thereof) and on each anniversary thereof (such day and each such
anniversary thereof being hereinafter referred to as an "Extension Date") for
a period of one year after the date on which the Termination Date would
otherwise have occurred.  If the Borrower wishes to request an extension of
the Termination Date as of any Extension Date, it shall give notice to that
effect to the Agent not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to such
Extension Date, whereupon the Agent shall notify each of the Banks of such
request.  Each Bank will use its best efforts to respond to such request,
whether affirmatively or negatively, within 15 days.  If all of the Banks
respond affirmatively, then, subject to receipt by the Agent prior to such
Extension Date of counterparts of an extension agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the parties hereto, the Termination Date shall be extended,
effective on such Extension Date, for a period of one year.  If less than all
of the Banks respond affirmatively, then, subject to the affirmative response
of Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or Cayman Island Branches, (1) the Borrower
may replace any or all of the Banks which did not respond affirmatively with
one or more other banks (including any of the Banks (an "Existing Bank")) so
long as each such bank (other than an Existing Bank) is reasonably acceptable
to the Agent and the aggregate commitment of such banks (including the increase
in the Commitment of each Existing Bank) equals the aggregate Commitments of
the Banks which did not respond affirmatively, at which time (I) the Borrower,
the Agent, the Banks which did respond affirmatively and such other bank or
banks shall execute and deliver an extension agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to the parties thereto, pursuant to which the Termination Date
shall be so extended for a period of one year, and (II) the Borrower, the
Agent, the Banks which did not respond affirmatively and such other bank or
banks (including each Existing Bank which has agreed to increase its
Commitment) shall execute and deliver one or more Assignment and Assumption
Agreements as contemplated by Section 9.05(c) with respect to the Commitments
of the Banks which did not respond affirmatively which are being assumed by
such other bank or banks (including each Existing Bank which has agreed to
increase its Commitment) or, if the provisions of clause (1) are not
operative, (2) the Agent will promptly notify each of the Banks which did so
respond affirmatively of the names of the other Banks which so responded
affirmatively and of the aggregate amount of their then existing Commitments.
In the event that clause (2) is operative, each Bank (including Deutsche Bank
AG, New York and/or Cayman Island Branches, the "Initial Banks") which
initially responded affirmatively and subsequently receives such a notice from
the Agent will use its best efforts to respond to the Agent, whether
affirmatively or negatively, within 15 days as to whether it will agree to
extend the Termination Date for a period of one year for its then existing
Commitment, but with an aggregate Commitment equal to the sum of the then
existing Commitment of each Initial Bank.  If each Initial Bank responds
affirmatively, then, subject to receipt by the Agent prior to such Extension
Date of counterparts of an extension agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the parties thereto, the Termination Date shall be extended,
effective on such Extension Date, for a period of one year, but with an
aggregate Commitment equal to the sum of the Commitment of each Initial Bank,
provided that such extension shall be effective only if all amounts owing
hereunder to the Banks are paid in full on such Extension Date.  If any
Initial Bank does not so respond affirmatively within such 15 days, then the
Termination Date shall not be so extended.  No Bank shall incur any liability
or responsibility as a result of the failure of it or any other Bank or the
Agent to respond to any request made by the Agent pursuant to this Section
2.17 or otherwise to comply with any provision of this Section 2.17 and the
Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any failure by it or any Bank to
use its best efforts or otherwise comply with any provision of this Section
2.17.

         as the Required Banks may reasonably request;

               (c)   an opinion of Piper & Marbury, counsel for the Borrower,

               (e)   all documents the Agent may reasonably request relating
         to the existence of the Borrower, the corporate authority for and the
         validity of this Agreement and the Notes, and any other matters
         relevant hereto, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent.

The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of the Closing
Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

               SECTION 3.02.  Borrowings.  The obligation of any Bank to make
a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing is subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions:

               (a)   the fact that the Closing Date shall have
         occurred on or prior to December 31, 1994;

               (b)   receipt by the Agent of a Notice of Borrowing as required
         by Section 2.02 or 2.03, as the case may be;

               (c)   the fact that, immediately after such Borrowing, the sum

         exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments;

               (d)   the fact that, immediately before and after such
         Borrowing, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

         than Euro-Currency Loans) and (ii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent of
         all Euro-Currency Loans (on such date in each case after taking into
         account such Borrowing and the use of the proceeds thereof) will not
         exceed 105% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments; and

               (f)   the fact that the representations and warranties of the
         Borrower contained in this Agreement (except, in the case of a
         Refunding Borrowing, the representations and warranties set forth in
         Sections 4.04(c) and 4.05, as to any matter which has theretofore
         been disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the Banks, including
         items disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the Banks by virtue of
         any information provided pursuant to Section 5.01 of this Agreement)
         shall be true on and as of the date of such Borrowing.

Each Borrowing hereunder shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty
by the Borrower on the date of such Borrowing as to the facts specified in
clauses (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section.


                                  ARTICLE IV

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

the laws of the State of Maryland, and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
carry on its business as now conducted, other than such licenses,

its Subsidiaries.

               SECTION 4.03.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and each Note, when executed and

and Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company in the form filed with the
governmental body, agency or official which regulates insurance companies in
the jurisdiction in which such companies are respectively domiciled for the
quarter ended September 30, 1994 has been delivered to the Agent on behalf of
each of the Banks and fairly presents, in accordance with statutory accounting
principles, the information contained therein.

               SECTION 4.05.  Litigation.  Subject to matters disclosed in the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.04(a), (b) and (c), there is no
action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the Borrower
threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in
which there is a reasonable expectation of an adverse decision which
reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which in any
manner draws into question the validity of this Agreement or the Notes.

               SECTION 4.06.  Compliance with ERISA.  Each member of the ERISA
Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding standards of
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan and is in
compliance in all material respects with the presently applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan.  No member
of the ERISA Group has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard
under Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii)
failed to make any contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan
or in respect of any Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment to any Plan or
Benefit Arrangement, which in either case would trigger the provisions of
Section 412(n) or 401(a)(29) of the Internal Revenue Code (or any
corresponding provisions of ERISA) or (iii) incurred any liability under Title
IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under Section 4007
of ERISA.

               SECTION 4.07.  Environmental Matters.  In the ordinary course
of its business, the Borrower conducts an ongoing review of the effect of
Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates
associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital
or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties
presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required
to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards
imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any
related constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or
permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in
the nature of operations conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in
connection with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any
actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any
related costs and expenses).  On the basis of this review, the Borrower has
reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and costs, including the
costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

               SECTION 4.08.  Taxes.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
filed all United States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax
returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due
pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, other than any such assessments being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which any reserves required
under generally accepted accounting principles have been established.  The
charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in the
opinion of the Borrower, adequate in all material respects.

               SECTION 4.09.  Subsidiaries.  Each of the Borrower's corporate
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all
corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.

               SECTION 4.10.  Not an Investment Company.  The Borrower is not
an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

               SECTION 4.11.  Full Disclosure.  All information heretofore
furnished by the Borrower to the Agent or any Bank for purposes of or in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby is, and
all such information hereafter furnished by the Borrower to the Agent or any
Bank will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of
which such information is stated or certified.  The Borrower has disclosed to
the Banks in writing any and all facts which materially and adversely affect
or may affect (to the extent the Borrower can now reasonably foresee), the
business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of the Borrower to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

         and for the portion of the Borrower's fiscal year ended at the end of
         such quarter, setting forth in the case of such consolidated
         statements of operations and cash flows in comparative form the

         (i) whether anything has come to their attention in the course of
         their examination of the financial statements of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries to cause them to believe that any Default existed on the
         date of such statements and (ii) confirming the calculations set

         required to give notice to the PBGC of any "reportable event" (as
         defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Plan, other
         than a reportable event for which 30-day notice to the PBGC has been

         corresponding provisions of ERISA), a certificate of the chief
         financial officer or the chief accounting officer of the Borrower

financially sound and reputable insurers or through self-insurance programs
appropriate to the type and amount of the risk insured, insurance with respect
to its properties and business, and the properties and business of its
Subsidiaries, against loss or damage of the kinds customarily insured against
by reputable companies in the same or similar businesses, such insurance to be
of such types and in such amounts (with such deductible amounts) as is
customary for such companies under similar circumstances.  The Borrower will

will cause each Subsidiary (other than any Excluded Subsidiary) to preserve,
renew and keep in full force and effect, their respective corporate existence
and their respective rights, privileges and franchises necessary or desirable

rights, privileges and franchises which, if not preserved, renewed or kept in
force, will not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

               SECTION 5.05.  Compliance with Laws.  The Borrower will comply,
and cause each Subsidiary to comply, with all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules, regulations, and requirements of governmental authorities (including,
without limitation, Environmental Laws and ERISA and the rules and regulations
thereunder) except where the necessity of compliance therewith is contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings or where the failure to comply with such
laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and requirements will not, in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

               SECTION 5.06.  Negative Pledge.  Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary will create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset now
owned or hereafter acquired by it, except:

               (a)   Liens existing on the date of this Agreement securing
         Debt outstanding on the date of this Agreement in an aggregate

         Schedule I hereto;

               (b)   any Lien existing on any asset of any corporation at the
         time such corporation becomes a Subsidiary and not created in

         such asset, provided that such Lien attaches to such asset
         concurrently with or within 90 days after the acquisition thereof;

               (d)   any Lien on any asset of any corporation existing at the
         time such corporation is merged or consolidated with or into the
         Borrower or a Subsidiary and not created in contemplation of such
         event;

               (e)   any Lien existing on any asset prior to the acquisition
         thereof by the Borrower or a Subsidiary and not created in
         contemplation of such acquisition;

               (f)   any Lien arising out of the refinancing, extension,
         renewal or refunding of any Debt secured by any Lien permitted by any
         of the foregoing clauses or clause (j) below of this Section,
         provided that such Debt is not increased and is not secured by any
         additional assets;

               (g)   Liens arising in the ordinary course of its business
         (including Liens arising in the ordinary course of its insurance
         business) which (i) do not secure Debt or Derivatives Obligations,
         (ii) do not secure any obligation (except obligations arising in the
         ordinary course of its insurance business) in an amount exceeding
         $50,000,000 and (iii) do not in the aggregate materially detract from
         or impair the use or value of the asset or assets subject thereto in

               (i)   Liens securing obligations of the type referred to in
         clause (vii) of the definition of Debt as long as such Liens arise in
         the ordinary course of the Borrower's or the Subsidiary's, as the
         case may be, business and such Liens are in amounts and otherwise are
         on terms consistent with then existing practices in the repurchase
         business;

               (j)   Liens securing Non-Recourse Debt (including Non-Recourse

         the proviso to the definition of Non-Recourse Debt);

               (k)   Liens on securities or cash of any Insurance Company
         Subsidiary which secure its obligations as a reinsurer (as opposed to
         a ceding insurance company) under reinsurance contracts entered into
         with Persons which are licensed or authorized to do an insurance
         business in any jurisdiction; and

               (l)   Liens not otherwise permitted by the foregoing clauses of
         this Section securing Debt in an aggregate principal or face amount
         at any date not to exceed 5% of Adjusted Consolidated Tangible Net

               SECTION 5.07.  Consolidations, Mergers and Sales of Assets;
Ownership by USF&G Corporation.  The Borrower will not (i) consolidate or
merge with or into any other Person, other than a merger in which the Borrower
is the surviving corporation or a merger solely for the purpose of
reincorporating the Borrower in another jurisdiction, in each case provided no
Default shall exist at, or immediately after, such merger, or (ii) sell, lease
or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the
assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any other
Person.  The Borrower will at all times own all of the outstanding voting
securities of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company.

               SECTION 5.08.  Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the Loans made
under this Agreement will be used by the Borrower for general corporate
purposes.  None of such proceeds will be used, directly or indirectly, for the
purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any
"margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U.

               SECTION 5.09.  Ratio of Debt to Adjusted Consolidated Tangible
Net Worth.  The aggregate amount of Debt (other than Non-Recourse Debt) of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall at no time exceed 55% of Adjusted
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth.

               SECTION 5.10.  Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth.
Adjusted Consolidated Tangible Net Worth will at no time be less than the sum
of (i) $1,050,000,000 plus (ii) 50% of the consolidated net income of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the period commencing on
October 1, 1994 and ending at the end of the Borrower's then most recent
fiscal quarter (treated for this purpose as a single accounting period).  For
purposes of this Section, if consolidated net income of the Borrower and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries for any period shall be less than zero, the amount
calculated pursuant to clause (ii) above for such period shall be zero.

               SECTION 5.11.  Transactions with Affiliates.  The Borrower will
not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay any
funds to or for the account of, make any investment (whether by acquisition of
stock or indebtedness, by loan, advance, transfer of property, guarantee or
other agreement to pay, purchase or service, directly or indirectly, any Debt,
or otherwise) in, lease, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any assets,
tangible or intangible, to, or participate in, or effect any transaction in
connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement with, any
Affiliate unless such payment, investment, lease, sale, transfer, disposition,
participation or transaction is on terms and conditions at least as favorable
to the Borrower or such Subsidiary as the terms and conditions which would
apply in a similar transaction with a Person not an Affiliate; provided,
however, that the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not prohibit the
Borrower from declaring or paying any lawful dividend or distribution so long
as, after giving effect thereto, no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.


                                  ARTICLE VI

                                   DEFAULTS

         payment owed by it in respect of any Material Financial Obligations

         accelerate the maturity thereof;

               (g)   the Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than an Excluded

         receiver, liquidator, rehabilitator, dissolver, conservator,
         custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part of
         its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the
         appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an
         involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall

         proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60
         days; or an order for relief shall be entered against the Borrower or
         any Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) under the federal
         bankruptcy laws as now or hereafter in effect; or any governmental
         body, agency or official shall apply for, or commence a case or other
         proceeding to seek, an order for the rehabilitation, conservation,
         dissolution or other liquidation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
         (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) or of the assets or any
         substantial part thereof of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or
         any other similar remedy;

               (i)   any member of the ERISA Group shall fail to pay when due
         an amount or amounts aggregating in excess of $5,000,000 which it
         shall have become liable to pay under Title IV of ERISA; or notice of
         intent to terminate a Material Plan shall be filed under Title IV of
         ERISA by any member of the ERISA Group, any plan administrator or any
         combination of the foregoing; or the PBGC shall institute proceedings
         under Title IV of ERISA to terminate, to impose liability (other than
         for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA) in respect of, or to cause
         a trustee to be appointed to administer any Material Plan; or a
         condition shall exist by reason of which the PBGC would be entitled
         to obtain a decree adjudicating that any Material Plan must be
         terminated; or there shall occur a complete or partial withdrawal
         from, or a default, within the meaning of Section 4219(c)(5) of
         ERISA, with respect to, one or more Multiemployer Plans which could
         cause one or more members of the ERISA Group to incur a current
         payment obligation in excess of $5,000,000;

               (j)   enforceable judgments or orders for the payment of money
         in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate shall be rendered and
         entered against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than an Excluded
         Subsidiary) and such judgments or orders shall continue unsatisfied
         and unstayed for a period of 30 days; or

               (k)   any person or group of persons (within the meaning of
         Section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
         shall have acquired beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule
         13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under said
         Act) of 30% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the
         Borrower; or, during any period of twelve consecutive calendar
         months, individuals who were directors of the Borrower on the first
         day of such period shall cease to constitute a majority of the board
         of directors of the Borrower;

then, and in every such event, the Agent shall (i) if requested by Banks
having more than 50% in aggregate amount of the Commitments, by notice to the
Borrower terminate the Commitments and they shall thereupon terminate, and
(ii) if requested by Banks holding Notes evidencing more than 50% in aggregate
principal amount of the Loans, by notice to the Borrower declare the Notes
(together with accrued interest thereon) to be, and the Notes shall thereupon
become, immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower;
provided that, in the case of any of the Events of Default specified in clause
(g) or (h) above with respect to the Borrower, without any notice to the
Borrower or any other act by the Agent or the Banks, the Commitments shall
thereupon terminate and the Notes (together with accrued interest thereon)
shall become immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest
or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

               SECTION 6.02.  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall give notice
to the Borrower under Section 6.01(c) promptly upon being requested to do so
by any Bank and shall thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.


                                  ARTICLE VII

                                   THE AGENT

               SECTION 7.01.  Appointment and Authorization.  Each Bank
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the Notes as
are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

               SECTION 7.02.  Agent and Affiliates.  Deutsche Bank AG, New
York and/or Cayman Island Branches shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising
the same as though it were not the Agent, and Deutsche Bank AG, New York
and/or Cayman Island Branches and its affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not the Agent
hereunder.

               SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agent.  The obligations of the Agent
hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to take any
action with respect to any Default, except as expressly provided in Article VI.

               SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  The Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

               SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agent.  Neither the Agent nor any
of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or
employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required
Banks or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their
respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement or any
borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any
condition specified in Article III, except receipt of items required to be
delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection herewith.  The Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing
(which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing)
believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.

               SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall, ratably in
accordance with its Commitment, indemnify the Agent, its affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such
indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any
action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

               SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent
or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking any action under this Agreement.

               SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any
time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such
resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent, subject, provided that no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, to the Borrower's approval, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial
bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or
of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  After
any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this
Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent.

               SECTION 7.09.  Agent's Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Agent.


                                 ARTICLE VIII

                            CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

               SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate
or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Fixed Rate Borrowing:

               (a)   the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that deposits
         in the applicable currency and amounts are not being offered to the
         Reference Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

               (b)   in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or
         more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Agent that
         the Adjusted CD Rate or the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate,
         as the case may be, as determined by the Agent will not adequately
         and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their CD Loans
         or Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, for
         such Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make
CD Loans or Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be,
shall be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least two
Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a
Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on
such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such
Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR
Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and
including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day.

               SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Currency
Lending Office or Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive
after the date of this Agreement (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful
or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Currency Lending Office or Euro-Dollar
Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Currency Loans or
Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon
until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to
make Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended.  Before
giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall
designate a different Euro-Currency Lending Office or Euro-Dollar Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will
not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
If such Bank shall determine in good faith that it may not lawfully continue
to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar
Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall
immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such
Euro-Currency Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, together with accrued interest
thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Currency Loan or
Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal
principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be
payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar
Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

               SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  (a) If on or
after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation
to make Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in
the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable
Lending Office) with any request or directive after such date (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without
limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, but excluding (i) with respect to any CD Loan any such
requirement included in an applicable Domestic Reserve Percentage and (ii)
with respect to any Euro-Currency Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement
included in an applicable Euro-Currency Reserve Percentage or Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage, as the case may be), special deposit, insurance assessment
(excluding, with respect to any CD Loan, any such requirement reflected in an
applicable Assessment Rate) or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable
Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office)
or on the United States market for certificates of deposit or the London
interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note
or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans and the result of any of the
foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount
of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand
by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such
increased cost or reduction.

               (b)   If any Bank shall have determined in good faith that,
after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation,
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive after
the date hereof regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its
Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below
that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such
adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies
with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be
material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank
(with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for
such reduction.

               (c)   Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent
of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which
will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A
certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting
forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall, if
submitted in good faith, be conclusive in the absence of manifest error;
provided that any certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 8.03(c) shall
(i) in the case of a certificate in respect of amounts payable pursuant to
Section 8.03(a), set forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the
calculation of such amounts, and (ii) in the case of a certificate in respect
of amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.03(b), set forth at least the same
amount of detail in respect of the calculation of such amounts as such Bank
provides in similar circumstances to other similarly situated borrowers and
also include a statement by such Bank that it has allocated to its Commitment
or outstanding Loans no greater than a substantially proportionate amount of
any reduction of the rate of return on such Bank's capital due to the matters
described in Section 8.03(b) as it has allocated to each of its other
commitments to lend or any outstanding loans to similarly situated borrowers
that are affected similarly by such adoption or change.  Subject to the
foregoing, in determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

               SECTION 8.04.  Taxes.  (a)  For purposes of this Section 8.04,
the following terms have the following meanings:

               "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any
payment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and
the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed
on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Agent (as
the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is
located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office
is located, or, in the case of the Agent and each Bank, such taxes which would
not have been imposed on the Agent or such Bank but for any present or former
connection between the Agent or such Bank and the jurisdiction imposing such
tax (other than any such connection arising from the Agent or the Bank having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under,
or enforced, this Agreement or the Notes) and (ii) in the case of each Bank,
any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments but only to the
extent that such Bank (a) is subject to United States withholding tax at the
time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (b) subsequently
becomes subject to United States withholding tax solely by reason of the change
of its Applicable Lending Office by such Bank.

               "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or documentary
taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies
(other than franchise taxes or taxes imposed on the net income of a Bank or
the Agent), which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or
under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect
to, this Agreement or any Note.

               (b)   Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the
account of any Bank or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made
without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower
shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such
payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 8.04) such Bank or the Agent (as the case may
be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower
shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

               (c)   The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation,
any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 8.04) paid by such Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto.  This indemnification shall be paid within
15 days after such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) makes demand
therefor.

               (d)   Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature
pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the
case of each other Bank, and from time to time thereafter if requested in
writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able
to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service form 1001
or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts the Bank
from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on
payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the
income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

               (e)   For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to
provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(d)
(unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring
subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be
provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section
8.04(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided
that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate
of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver
a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank
shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

               (f)   If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to
or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.04, then such Bank
will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the
judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such
additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.

               SECTION 8.05.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed
Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Currency Loans or
Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank
has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect to any of
its CD Loans or Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower
shall, by at least five Euro-Currency Business Days' (in the case of
Euro-Currency Loans) or Euro-Dollar Business Days' (in all other cases) prior
notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of
this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank
notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or
demand for compensation no longer exist:

               (a)   all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as
         CD Loans or Euro-Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
         be, shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and
         principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Fixed
         Rate Loans of the other Banks), and

               (b)   after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Currency Loans or
         Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, has been repaid, all payments
         of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Fixed
         Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.


                                  ARTICLE IX

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

               SECTION 9.01.  Notices.  All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank
wire, telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to
such party:  (x) in the case of the Borrower or the Agent, at its address,
facsimile number or telex number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (y)
in the case of any Bank, at its address, facsimile number or telex number set
forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party,
such other address, facsimile number or telex number as such party may
hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower.
Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if
given by telex, when such telex is transmitted to the telex number specified
in this Section and the appropriate answerback is received, (ii) if given by
facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in
this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (iii) if given by mail,
72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class
postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iv) if given by any other means,
when delivered at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices
to the Agent under Article II or Article VIII shall not be effective until
received.

               SECTION 9.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the Agent or
any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any
Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
law.

               SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower
shall pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Agent, in
connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any
waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged
Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Agent and each Bank, including (without duplication)
the reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel in connection with
such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other
enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.

               (b)   The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank,
their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and
employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
(whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought
or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or
proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall
have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction and provided, further, that no Bank shall have the right to be
indemnified hereunder in any such proceeding wherein the parties thereto are
only such Bank and any other Person to whom such Bank shall have granted a
participation in, or assigned all or a proportionate part of, its Commitment
or its Loans or Notes or its rights or obligations hereunder or under its
Notes.

               SECTION 9.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank agrees that if
it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise,
receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and
interest due with respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the
proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of
principal and interest due with respect to any Note held by such other Bank,
the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such other
adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of
principal and interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be
shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall
impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim
it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of
indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder.  The
Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Note, whether or not
acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of
set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as
fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

               SECTION 9.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the
Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected
thereby, by the Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall,
unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any
Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or
subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or
rate of interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, except as provided below,
(iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fees hereunder or for any reduction or termination of any
Commitment, (iv) designate any currency as an Alternative Currency pursuant to
the last clause of the definition thereof and (v) change the percentage of the
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the
number of Banks (including, without limitation, the Initial Banks), which
shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this
Section or any other provision of this Agreement.

               SECTION 9.06.  Successors and Assigns. (a)  The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of all Banks.

               (b)   Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or
other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its
Commitment or any or all of its Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a
Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice
to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the
performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to
which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such
Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations
of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not
agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 9.05 without the consent of the
Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent
provided in its participation agreement, but subject to Section 9.06(e) below,
be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating
interest.  An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by
subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this
Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance
with this subsection (b).

               (c)   Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or
other financial institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part
(equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $10,000,000, and
provided that after giving effect thereto the Commitment of the assigning Bank
is equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $10,000,000) of all,
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and such
Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit H hereto
executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the
subscribed consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and the Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that if an
Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately
prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required; and provided
further that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the
transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Money Market Loans.  Upon execution
and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor
Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor
Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as
set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be
released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no
further consent or action by any party shall be required.  Upon the
consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor
Bank, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that,
if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee.  In connection with any
such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Agent an administrative
fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $2,500.  If the Assignee
is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state
thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to
exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes in accordance with Section 8.04.

               (d)   Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank.  No such
assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

               (e)   No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any
Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
8.03 or 8.04 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect
to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02, 8.03 or
8.04 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office
under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to
such greater payment did not exist.

               SECTION 9.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks represents to the
Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon
any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension
or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

               SECTION 9.08.  Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.  This
Agreement and each Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.  The Borrower hereby submits to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City
for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  The Borrower irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

               SECTION 9.09.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof.  This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Agent of
counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of
any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received,
receipt by the Agent in form satisfactory to it of telegraphic, telex,
facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a
counterpart hereof by such party).

               SECTION 9.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE
AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.



               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of
the day and year first above written.

                               PRICING SCHEDULE


               The "Euro-Currency Margin" and "Euro-Dollar Margin", "Base Rate

Rate


               For purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the
following meanings:

               "Level I Status" exists at any date if, at such date, the
Borrower's long-term debt is rated BBB or higher by S&P and Baa2 or higher by
Moody's.

               "Level II Status" exists at any date if, at such date, (i) the
Borrower's long-term debt is rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Baa3 or higher by
Moody's and (ii) Level I Status does not exist.

               "Level III Status" exists at any date if, at such date, (i) the
Borrower's long-term debt is rated BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by
Moody's and (ii) neither Level I Status nor Level II Status exists.

               "Level IV Status" exists at any date if, at such date, (i) the
Borrower's long-term debt is rated BB or higher by S&P and Ba2 or higher by
Moody's and (ii) none of Level I Status, Level II Status and Level III Status
exists.

               "Level V Status" exists at any date if, at such date, no other
Status exists.

               "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

               "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Group.

               "Status" refers to the determination of which of Level I
Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, Level IV Status or Level V Status
exists at any date.

               The credit ratings to be utilized for purposes of this Schedule
are those assigned to the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of the
Borrower without third-party credit enhancement (the "Long-Term Securities"),
and any rating assigned to any other debt security of the Borrower shall be
disregarded.  The rating in effect at any date is that in effect at the close
of business on such date.  For purposes of determining Status:  (i) if at any
date the rating of the Long-Term Securities by Moody's shall be higher or
lower than the comparable rating by S&P by one rating level (it being
understood that for these purposes an S&P rating of A+ is comparable to a
Moody's rating of A1, an S&P rating of A is comparable to a Moody's rating of
A2, and so forth), then the rating of the Long-Term Securities by each of
Moody's and S&P shall be deemed to be the higher of the two ratings; and (ii)
if at any date the rating of the Long-Term Securities by Moody's shall be
higher or lower than the comparable rating by S&P by two or more rating levels
(it being understood that for these purposes an S&P rating of A+ is comparable
to a Moody's rating of A1, an S&P rating of A is comparable to a Moody's
rating of A2, and so forth), then the rating of the Long-Term Securities by
each of Moody's and S&P shall be deemed to be the comparable S&P and Moody's
ratings at the midpoint between the two actual ratings, or, if there shall be
no rating at the midpoint, the next higher rating from the midpoint between
the two actual ratings.  For example, if the Long-Term Securities are rated
BBB by S&P and Ba1 by Moody's, the Long-Term Securities shall be deemed to be
rated BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's; and if the Long-Term Securities are
rated BBB+ by S&P and Ba1 by Moody's, the Long-Term Securities shall be deemed
to be rated BBB by S&P and Baa2 by Moody's.

               For value received, USF&G CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation

   (the "Bank"), for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, the unpaid
principal amount of each Loan made by the Bank to the Borrower pursuant to the

AG, New York Branch, New York, New York or (ii) if in an Alternative Currency,
in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international
transactions in such Alternative Currency at the place specified for payment
thereof pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

               All Loans made by the Bank, the respective types and maturities
thereof and, in the case of Euro-Currency Loans, the currency and Dollar
Amounts thereof, and all repayments of the principal thereof shall be recorded
by the Bank and, if the Bank so elects in connection with any transfer or
enforcement hereof, appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing
information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding may be endorsed by
the Bank on the schedule attached hereto, or on a continuation of such
schedule attached to and made a part hereof; provided that the failure of the
Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Credit Agreement.

Agreement dated as of December 1, 1994 among the Borrower, the banks listed on

                                OPINION OF THE
                        GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE BORROWER






To the Banks and the Agent
  Referred to Below
c/o Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or
  Cayman Island Branches, as Agent
31 West 52nd Street
New York, New York  10019

Dear Sirs:

               I am General Counsel for USF&G Corporation (the "Borrower") and
have acted in such capacity in connection with the Credit Agreement (the
"Credit Agreement") dated as of December 1, 1994 among the Borrower, the banks
listed on the signature pages thereof and Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or
Cayman Island Branches, as Agent.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are
used herein as therein defined.  This opinion is being rendered to you at the
request of my client pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.

               I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.

               Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

               1.  The Borrower has all governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted,
other than such licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals which, if not
held or obtained by the Borrower, do not, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.

               2.  To the best of my knowledge after responsible inquiry, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement
and the Notes do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision
of any material agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or result in
the creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries.

               3.  To the best of my knowledge after responsible inquiry,
there is no action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or
arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official, in which there is a
reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could have a Material
Adverse Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity of the
Credit Agreement or the Notes, except as may have been disclosed in the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.04(a), (b) or (c) of the Credit
Agreement.

               4.  Each of the Borrower's corporate Subsidiaries is a
corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
carry on its business as now conducted, other than such licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals which, if not held or obtained by the
Borrower or such Subsidiary, do not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.


                                    Very truly yours,


                                                               EXHIBIT F




                          OPINION OF PIPER & MARBURY,
                           COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER






                          To the Banks and the Agent
  Referred to Below
c/o Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or
  Cayman Island Branches, as Agent
31 West 52nd Street
New York, New York  10019

Dear Sirs:

               We have acted as counsel for USF&G Corporation (the "Borrower")
in connection with the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of
December 1, 1994 among the Borrower, the banks listed on the signature pages
thereof and Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or Cayman Island Branches, as
Agent.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein
defined.  This opinion is being rendered to you at the request of our client
pursuant to Section 3.01(c) of the Credit Agreement.

               We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.

               Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

               1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of Maryland, and has all
corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted.

               2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action
by the Borrower by or in respect of, or filing by the Borrower with, any
governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a
default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower.

               3.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Borrower and each Note constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(including public policy limitations on the indemnification provisions
thereof).


                                    Very truly yours,



                                                               EXHIBIT G




                                  OPINION OF
                    DAVIS POLK & WARDWELL, SPECIAL COUNSEL
                                   FOR THE AGENT







To the Banks and the Agent
  Referred to Below
c/o Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or
  Cayman Island Branches, as Agent
31 West 52nd Street
New York, New York  10019

Dear Sirs:

               We have participated in the preparation of the Credit Agreement
(the "Credit Agreement") dated as of December 1, 1994 among USF&G Corporation,
a Maryland corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks listed on the signature
pages thereof (the "Banks") and Deutsche Bank AG, New York and/or Cayman
Island Branches, as Agent (the "Agent"), and have acted as special counsel for
the Agent for the purpose of rendering this opinion pursuant to Section
3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are
used herein as therein defined.

               We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.

               Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the
Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and
each Note constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, in each
case enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity.

               We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and the
foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the
federal laws of the United States of America.  In giving the foregoing
opinion, we express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any
jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Bank is located which
limits the rate of interest that such Bank may charge or collect.  Insofar as
the foregoing opinion involves matters governed by the laws of Maryland, we
have relied, without independent investigation, upon the opinion of Piper &
Marbury, counsel for the Borrower, a copy of which has been delivered to you.

               This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the
above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other
purpose or relied upon by any other person without our prior written consent.

                                       Very truly yours,



                                                           EXHIBIT H



                      ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT




               AGREEMENT dated as of _________, 19__ among [ASSIGNOR] (the
"Assignor"), [ASSIGNEE] (the "Assignee"), USF&G CORPORATION (the "Borrower")
and DEUTSCHE BANK AG, NEW YORK AND/OR CAYMAN ISLAND BRANCHES, as Agent (the
"Agent").


                               W I T N E S E T H


               WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the
"Agreement") relates to the Credit Agreement dated as of December 1, 1994
among the Borrower, the Assignor and the other Banks party thereto, as Banks,
and the Agent (the "Credit Agreement");

               WHEREAS, as provided under the Credit Agreement, the Assignor
has a Commitment to make Loans to the Borrower in an aggregate principal
amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $__________;

               WHEREAS, Committed Loans made to the Borrower by the Assignor
under the Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $__________
are outstanding at the date hereof; and

               WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the Assignee all of
the rights of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement in respect of a portion
of its Commitment thereunder in an amount equal to $__________ (the "Assigned
Amount"), together with a corresponding portion of its outstanding Committed
Loans, and the Assignee proposes to accept assignment of such rights and
assume the corresponding obligations from the Assignor on such terms;

               NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

               SECTION 1.  Definitions. All capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit
Agreement.

               SECTION 2.  Assignment.  The Assignor hereby assigns and sells
to the Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement
to the extent of the Assigned Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such
assignment from the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of the
Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the Assigned Amount,
including the purchase from the Assignor of the corresponding portion of the
principal amount of the Committed Loans made by the Assignor outstanding at
the date hereof.  Upon the execution and delivery hereof by the Assignor, the
Assignee[, the Borrower and the Agent] and the payment of the amounts
specified in Section 3 required to be paid on the date hereof (i) the Assignee
shall, as of the date hereof, succeed to the rights and be obligated to
perform the obligations of a Bank under the Credit Agreement with a Commitment
in an amount equal to the Assigned Amount, and (ii) the Commitment of the
Assignor shall, as of the date hereof, be reduced by a like amount and the
Assignor released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement to the
extent such obligations have been assumed by the Assignee.  The assignment
provided for herein shall be without recourse to the Assignor.

               SECTION 3.  Payments.  As consideration for the assignment and
sale contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor
on the date hereof in Federal funds the amount heretofore agreed between
them.(*) It is understood that commitment and/or facility fees accrued to the
date hereof are for the account of the Assignor and such fees accruing from
and including the date hereof are for the account of the Assignee.  Each of
the Assignor and the Assignee hereby agrees that if it receives any amount
under the Credit Agreement which is for the account of the other party hereto,
it shall receive the same for the account of such other party to the extent of
such other party's interest therein and shall promptly pay the same to such
other party.

               [SECTION 4.  Consent of the Borrower and the Agent.  This
Agreement is conditioned upon the consent of the Borrower and the Agent
pursuant to Section 9.06(c) of the Credit Agreement.  The execution of this
(*)      Amount should combine principal together with accrued interest and
breakage compensation, if any, to be paid by the Assignee, net of any portion
of any upfront fee to be paid by the Assignor to the Assignee.   It may be
preferable in an appropriate case to specify these amounts generically or by
formula rather than as a fixed sum.
Agreement by the Borrower and the Agent is evidence of this consent.  Pursuant
to Section 9.06(c) the Borrower agrees to execute and deliver a Note payable
to the order of the Assignee to evidence the assignment and assumption
provided for herein.]

               SECTION 5.  Non-Reliance on Assignor.  The Assignor makes no
representation or warranty in connection with, and shall have no
responsibility with respect to, the solvency, financial condition, or
statements of the Borrower, or the validity and enforceability of the
obligations of the Borrower in respect of the Credit Agreement or any Note.
The Assignee acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance on
the Assignor, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement and will continue to be responsible for making its own independent
appraisal of the business, affairs and financial condition of the Borrower.

               SECTION 6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

               SECTION 7.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.



               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to
be executed and delivered by their duly authorized officers as of the date
first above written.

        2.1. Issuance of Letters of Credit

                (a)     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Issuing Bank agrees, in reliance on the agreement of the other
Banks set forth in Section 2.2, to issue standby letters of credit (the
"Letters of Credit"; each, individually, a "Letter of Credit") during
the Commitment Period for the account of the Applicant, or jointly and
severally for the account of the Applicant and each Co-Applicant
delivering a Letter of Credit Request.  The aggregate face amount of
Outstanding Letters of Credit issued during the Commitment Period shall
not at any time exceed the amount of the Commitment.  Each Letter of
Credit issued pursuant to this Section shall have a Stated Expiration
Date.  No Letter of Credit shall be issued if the conditions set forth
in Section 6 have not been satisfied.

                (b)     Each Letter of Credit shall be issued for the account
of the Applicant, individually, or for the account of the Applicant and a
Co-Applicant, jointly and severally,  in support of an obligation of the
Applicant or of the Applicant and a Co-Applicant in favor of a
beneficiary which has requested the issuance of such Letter of Credit
as a condition to a transaction entered into in connection with the

Applicant's or the Co-Applicant's reinsurance business.  The Applicant,
and any Co-Applicant, as the case may be, shall give the Agent a Letter
of Credit Request for the issuance of each Letter of Credit by 11:00
A.M., three Business Days prior to the requested Date of Issuance.
Each Letter of Credit Request executed by a Co-Applicant shall provide
that such Co-Applicant shall be, from and after the Date of Issuance of
the Letter of Credit which is requested, a party hereto and shall have
all the rights and obligations of a Co-Applicant under this Agreement
and under the other Credit Documents to which it is a party.  Such Letter
of Credit Request shall specify (i) the beneficiary of such Letter of
Credit and the obligations of the Applicant and/or Co-Applicant in
respect of which such Letter of Credit is to be issued, (ii) the
Applicant's proposal as to the conditions under which a drawing may be
made under such Letter of Credit and the documentation to be required
in respect thereof, (iii) the maximum amount to be available under such
Letter of Credit, and (iv) the requested Date of Issuance.  Upon receipt
of such Letter of Credit Request, the Agent shall promptly notify the
Issuing Bank and each other Bank thereof.  The Issuing Bank shall, on
the proposed Date of Issuance and subject to the other terms and con-
ditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit.  Each
Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Issuing Bank, with such provisions with respect to the condi-
tions under which a drawing may be made thereunder and the documen-
tation required in respect of such drawing as the Issuing Bank shall
reasonably require.  The parties agree that a Letter of Credit
substantially in the form of Exhibit D shall be deemed to be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank; provided, how-
ever, that Letters of Credit issued pursuant hereto need not be in the
form of said Exhibit D.  Each Letter of Credit shall be used solely for
the purposes described therein.

                (c)     Each payment by the Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under
a Letter of Credit shall give rise to an immediate obligation on the part
of the Applicant, or to an immediate joint and several obligation on the
part of the Applicant and the Co-Applicant, as the case may be,  to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount thereof on the Business Day on
which the Issuing Bank shall have notified the Applicant that payment
of such draft has been made to the beneficiary, provided that a failure
to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall not constitute an Event of Default
hereunder until the date occurring two Business Days after the Issuing
Bank's giving notice to Applicant of demand for payment of such draft,
provided that the Applicant shall by such date have paid the full
amount of such draft, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed
from the date of payment of such draft, calculated at the rate set forth
in Section 2.3.


        2.2. Letter of Credit Participation and Funding Commitments

                (a)     Each Bank hereby unconditionally and ir-
revocably, severally for itself only and without any notice to or the
taking of any action by such Bank, takes an undivided participating
interest in the obligations of the Issuing Bank under and in connection
with each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of the amount of such Letter of Credit.  Each Bank shall be
liable to the Issuing Bank for its Commitment Percentage of the
unreimbursed amount of any draft drawn and honored under each Letter of
Credit.  Each Bank shall also be liable for an amount equal to the
product of its Commitment Percentage and any amounts paid by the
Applicant or any  Co-Applicant that are subsequently rescinded or
avoided, or must otherwise be restored or returned.  Such liabilities
shall be unconditional and without regard to the occurrence of any
Default or Event of Default or the compliance by the Applicant or any
Co-Applicant with any of their obligations under the Credit Documents.

                (b)     The Agent will promptly notify each Bank (which notice
shall be promptly confirmed in writing) of the date and the amount of any
draft presented under any Letter of Credit with respect to which full
reimbursement of payment is not made by the Applicant or any Co-Applicant
immediately, and forthwith upon receipt of such notice, such Bank (other
than the Issuing Bank) shall make available to the Agent for the account
of the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such
unreimbursed draft at the office of the Agent specified in Section 11.2,
in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available
funds, before 4:00 P.M., on the day such notice was given by the Agent,
if the relevant notice was given by the Agent at or prior to 1:00 P.M.,
on such day, and before 12:00 Noon, on the next Business Day, if the
relevant notice was given by the Agent after 1:00 P.M., on such day.  The
Agent shall distribute the payments made by each Bank (other than the
Issuing Bank) pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to the
Issuing Bank promptly upon receipt thereof in like funds as received.
Each Bank shall indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and the Issuing
Bank from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including li-
abilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) resulting from any failure on the part of such Bank
to provide, or from any delay in providing, the Agent with such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of the amount of any payment made by the Issuing
Bank under a Letter of Credit in accordance with this clause (b) above
(except in respect of losses, liabilities or other obligations

suffered
by the Issuing Bank resulting from the gross negligence or willful mis-
conduct of the Issuing Bank).  If a Bank does not make available to the
Agent when due such Bank's Commitment Percentage of any unreimbursed
payment made by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit (other than
payments made by the Issuing Bank by reason of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct), such Bank shall be required to pay interest to
the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank on such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of such payment at a rate of interest per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate plus 1% from the date such Bank's payment is due
until the date such payment is received by the Agent.  The Agent shall
distribute such interest payments to the Issuing Bank upon receipt
thereof in like funds as received.

                (c)     Whenever the Agent is reimbursed by the Applicant or
any Co-Applicant, for the account of the Issuing Bank, for any payment
under a Letter of Credit and such payment relates to an amount
previously paid by a Bank in respect of its Commitment Percentage of the
amount of such payment under such Letter of Credit, the Agent will pay
over such payment to such Bank (i) before 4:00 P.M. on the day such pay-
ment from the Applicant or the Co-Applicant is received, if such payment
is received at or prior to 1:00 P.M. on such day, or (ii) before 12:00
Noon on the next succeeding Business Day, if such payment from the
Applicant or the Co-Applicant is received after 1:00 P.M. on such day.

        2.3.    Interest Rate

                If all or any portion of any reimbursement obligation in
respect of a Letter of Credit shall not be paid on the Business Day on
which the Issuing Bank shall have notified the Applicant that payment of
such draft has been made, such overdue amount shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% from the date of
such nonpayment until paid in full (whether before or after the entry of
a judgment thereon).  All such interest shall be payable on demand.
Interest computed with reference to the Federal Funds Rate shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days
elapsed, and interest computed with reference to the BNY Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year, as applicable, for the
actual number of days elapsed.

        2.4. Termination or Reduction of Commitment

                The Applicant shall have the right, upon at least three
Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, at any time to
terminate or reduce the amount of the Commitment in an amount of
$10,000,000 or such amount plus multiples of

$5,000,000 in excess
thereof, provided that after giving effect thereto, the Commitment
shall not be less than the Letter of Credit Exposure at such time.  Any
reduction of the Commitment shall be applied pro rata according to the
Commitment Percentage of each Bank.  Simultaneously with any reduction
of the Commitment the Applicant shall pay the Commitment Fee accrued on
the amount by which the Commitment has been reduced.

        2.5. Amendments to Each Letter of Credit

                (a)     At any time during the Commitment Period, upon at
least three Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, the
Applicant, together with the Co-Applicant, if any, and the beneficiary of
an Outstanding Letter of Credit, shall have the right to request that
such Letter of Credit be amended, including an amendment to increase or
reduce the undrawn face amount thereof and/or to extend for up to one
year from the date of such amendment the then Stated Expiration Date.
Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall exist and be
continuing, the Agent shall request that the Issuing Bank amend such
Letter of Credit to give effect to such increase, reduction and/or ex-
tension, and the Issuing Bank shall, upon presentation of the Letter of
Credit, either amend such Letter of Credit or issue a substitute Letter
of Credit containing such amended terms.

                (b)     Following the Termination Date, upon at least three
Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, the Applicant,
together with the Co-Applicant, if any, and the beneficiary of an
Outstanding Letter of Credit, may request that such Outstanding Letter of
Credit be amended, including an amendment to increase or reduce the
undrawn face amount thereof, provided that any such increase in the face
amount, after giving effect to any reductions requested to take effect on
the same date as such increase, shall not cause an increase in the
aggregate undrawn face amount of Outstanding Letters of Credit at such
date.  Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall exist and be
continuing, the Agent shall request that the Issuing Bank amend such
Letter of Credit to give effect to such amendment, and the Issuing Bank,
shall upon presentation of the Letter of Credit, either amend such
Letter of Credit or issue a substitute Letter of Credit containing such
amended terms.

        2.6. Extension of Commitment and Termination Date

                Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall exist and
be continuing, the Applicant may request that the Commitment be extended
for an additional period of 364 days by giving written notice of such
request (an "Extension Request") to the Agent during the period not more
than 180 days but not less than 60 days prior to the then Termination
Date, and upon

the receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly no-
tify each Bank of such request.  If each Bank consents to such Ex-
tension Request during the Extension Consent Period by giving written
notice thereof to the Applicant and the Agent, then effective on the
first day of the Extension Consent Period, the then applicable
Termination Date shall be extended by 364 days.  If all of the Banks have
not consented to such Extension Request during the Extension Consent
Period and such non-consenting Bank or Banks have not been replaced
pursuant to Section 2.16 during the Extension Consent Period, the Termina-
tion Date shall not be extended.

        2.7. Extension of the Stated Expiration Date of Each Letter of Credit

                The Stated Expiration Date of each Letter of Credit shall be
one year from its Date of Issuance hereunder, or, if extended during the
Commitment Period as provided in Section 2.5, such later date.  In
addition, if each Bank so consents, the Stated Expiration Date of each
Letter of Credit may be extended for one additional year from the then
Stated Expiration Date.  The Agent will notify each Bank not less than 80
days prior to the then Stated Expiration Date with respect to each
Outstanding Letter of Credit that such Letter of Credit will be
automatically extended for one year unless any Bank shall notify the
Agent not less than 71 days prior to the then Stated Expiration Date that
such Bank does not consent to such extension.  If any Bank shall so
notify the Agent that it does not so consent, the Agent shall notify the
Applicant not less than 70 days prior to the then Stated Expiration Date
that such Letter of Credit shall not be extended.  Upon receipt of
such notification, the Applicant may obtain a replacement Bank for each
such non-consenting Bank pursuant to Section 2.16.  If each such
non-consenting Bank has not been replaced pursuant to Section 2.16 on or
prior to 46 days prior to the Stated Expiration Date, the Agent shall
notify the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit not less than 45 days
prior to the Stated Expiration Date that the Stated Expiration Date will
not be extended.  If no Bank notifies the Agent that it does not con-
sent to such extension of the Letter of Credit, the Stated Expiration
Date of the Letter of Credit will be automatically extended for one
year, without further action.  Each Letter of Credit may be extended in
the manner set forth an unlimited number of times.

        2.8.    Obligations Absolute

                (a) The obligations of the Applicant and each Co-Applicant under
this Agreement and the Credit Documents to which it is a party shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with

the terms of this Agreement, irrespective of
any circumstances, including, without limitation, the
following:

                (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit;

                (ii) any amendment or waiver of, or consent to
departure from, all or any of the other Credit Documents;

                (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or
other right which the Applicant, any Co-Applicant, or any other
Person may have at any time against any beneficiary or any trans-
feree of a Letter of Credit (or any Person or entity for whom any
such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issu-
ing Bank, the Agent, any Bank, any participant or assignee, or
any other Person or entity, whether in connection with this
Agreement, any other Credit Document or any unrelated transaction;

                (iv) any statement or any other document presented
under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or
invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect whatsoever;

                (v)     payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate which does
not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit; or

                (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

        2.9. No Liability of the Issuing Bank

                It is understood that in making any payment under a Letter of
Credit (a) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents
presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set
forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented
under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the
beneficiary equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any docu-
ment presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be
insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be
in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document
presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or
invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any
respect whatsoever; and (b) any noncompliance of the documents presented
in an immaterial respect under a Letter of Credit with the terms

thereof
shall in each case not be deemed wilful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Issuing Bank.

        2.10. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy

                (a)     If on or after the date hereof the adoption of any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law,
rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by the Issuing Bank or any Bank with any request
or directive after such date (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any
such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
credit extended by, the Issuing Bank or any Bank or shall impose on any
Bank any other condition affecting its Commitment or the term thereof or
its obligation to issue or participate in Letters of Credit and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Issuing
Bank or such Bank of issuing or maintaining the Letters of Credit or its
obligations pursuant to Section 2.2, or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by the Issuing Bank or such Bank under this
Agreement with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by the Issuing Bank
or such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such
Issuing Bank or Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Applicant shall pay
to the Issuing Bank or such Bank such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate the Issuing Bank or such Bank for such increased cost or
reduction.

                (b)     If the Issuing Bank or any Bank shall have determined
in good faith that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any
change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or any request or directive after the date hereof
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of the Issuing Bank
or such Bank (or its parent) as a consequence of such Issuing Bank's or
Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which the Issuing
Bank or such Bank (or its parent) could have achieved but for such adop-
tion, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Issuing Bank or Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15
days after demand by such Issuing Bank or Bank (with a copy to the
Agent), the Applicant shall pay to the Issuing Bank or such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Issuing Bank or such
Bank (or its parent) for such reduction.

                (c)     The Issuing Bank and each Bank will promptly notify the
Applicant and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring
after the date hereof, which will entitle the Issuing Bank or such Bank
to compensation pursuant to this Section.  A certificate of the Issuing
Bank or any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting
forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall,
if submitted in good faith, be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error; provided that any certificate delivered pursuant to this Section
2.10(c) shall (i) in the case of a certificate in respect of amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.10(a), set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for and the calculation of such amounts, and (ii) in the case of a
certificate in respect of amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10(b),
set forth at least the same amount of detail in respect of the
calculation of such amounts as Issuing Bank or Bank provides in similar
circumstances to other similarly situated applicants for letters of
credit and also include a statement by the Issuing Bank or such Bank that
it has allocated to its Commitment hereunder no greater than a substan-
tially proportionate amount of any reduction of the rate of return on
such Issuing Bank's or Bank's capital due to the matters described in
Section 2.10(b) as it has allocated to its other commitments to issue or
participate in letters of credit to similarly situated applicants for
letters of credit that are affected similarly by such adoption or change.
Subject to the foregoing, in determining such amount, the Issuing Bank
or such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

        2.11. Taxes

                (a)     For purposes of this Section 2.11, the following terms
have the following meanings:

                "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any
payment by the Applicant or any Co-Applicant pursuant to this Agreement,
and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of
the Issuing Bank, each Bank and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income,
and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under
the laws of which the Issuing Bank, such Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is
located or, in the case of the Issuing Bank, the Agent and each Bank,
such taxes which would

not have been imposed on the Issuing Bank, the
Agent or such Bank but for any present or former connection between the
Issuing Bank, the Agent or such Bank and the jurisdiction imposing such
tax (other than any such connection arising from the Agent, the Issuing
Bank or the Bank having executed, delivered or performed its obligations
or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement) and (ii) in the
case of the Issuing Bank and each Bank, any United States withholding tax
imposed on such payments but only to the extent that the Issuing Bank or
such Bank (a) is subject to United States withholding tax at the time
such Issuing Bank or Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (b)
subsequently becomes subject to United States withholding tax solely by
reason of the change of any lending office by such Bank.

                "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar
charges or levies (other than franchise taxes or taxes imposed on the net
income of the Issuing Bank, the Agent or a Bank), which arise from any
payment made pursuant to this Agreement or from the execution or delivery
of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement.

                (b)     Any and all payments by the Applicant or any
Co-Applicant to or for the account of the Issuing Bank, any Bank or the
Agent hereunder shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that, if the Applicant or Co-Applicant shall be required
by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the
sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all re-
quired deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 2.11) such Issuing Bank, Bank or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Applicant or
Co-Applicant shall make such deductions, (iii) the Applicant or
Co-Applicant shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv)
the Applicant or Co-Applicant shall furnish to the Agent, at its address
referred to in Section 11.2, the original or a certified copy of a re-
ceipt evidencing payment thereof.

                (c)     The Applicant and any Co-Applicant agrees to indemnify
the Issuing Bank, each Bank and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or
Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.11) paid by such Issuing Bank, Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses)

arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  This indemnification shall
be paid within 15 days after such Issuing Bank, Bank or the Agent (as the
case may be) makes demand therefor.

                (d)     Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the
signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a
Bank in the case of each other Bank, and from time to time thereafter if
requested in writing by the Applicant (but only so long as such Bank re-
mains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Applicant with Internal
Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is
entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party which exempts the Bank from United States withholding
tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for
the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable
pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States.

                (e)     For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed
to provide the Applicant with the appropriate form pursuant to Section
2.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally
was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 2.11(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes
imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise
exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes
subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
hereunder, the Applicant shall take such steps as such Bank shall
reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

                (f)     If the Applicant is required to pay additional amounts
to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 2.11, then
such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its lending office if, in the
judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such
additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.

        2.12. Agent's Records

                The Agent's records regarding the amount of each Letter of
Credit, each payment by the Applicant or any Co-Applicant of
reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit and other
information relating to the Letters of Credit shall be presumptively
correct absent manifest error.


        2.13. Use of Proceeds

                The Applicant and Co-Applicants will use the Letters of
Credit only to collateralize reinsurance liabilities assumed by direct
and indirect Subsidiaries of the Applicant.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any Credit Document, the Applicant and each
Co-Applicant agrees that no part of the proceeds of any Letters of
Credit will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether
immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any "margin
stock" within the meaning of Regulation U.

        2.14. Cash Collateralization

                If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
Applicant shall on the Business Day it receives notice from the Agent,
deposit in an account with the Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank
and the Banks, an amount in cash equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure
as of such date.  Such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral
for the payment and performance of all obligations of the Applicant and
Co-Applicants hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.  The Agent
shall have exclusive domain and control over such account.  Moneys in
such account shall (a) automatically be applied by the Agent to reimburse
the Issuing Bank for Letter of Credit payments and disbursements, and
(b) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the
Applicant and Co-Applicants for the then outstanding Letter of Credit
Exposure.  If the Applicant is required to provide an amount of cash col-
lateral hereunder as a result of an Event of Default, such amount (to the
extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Applicant
within five Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or
waived.

        2.15. Replacement of Banks

                (a)     If any Bank refuses to consent to an Extension Request
pursuant to Section 2.6 or notifies the Agent that it refuses to consent
to the extension of any Stated Expiration Date with respect to any
Outstanding Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.7, the Borrower shall
have the right, if no Default or Event of Default then exists, to
replace such Bank (any such Bank being referred to herein as a "Replaced
Bank") with one or more Eligible Assignee or Assignees, each of which
shall be acceptable to the Agent and the Issuing Bank, and such Replaced
Bank shall assign to such Eligible Assignee or Assignees who are willing
to so purchase the same for such Replaced Bank, all (but not less than
all) of such Replaced Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
provided that such Eligible Assignee or Assignees shall pay to such
Replaced Bank, an amount equal to all interest, fees and other

amounts
owing or accrued to such Replaced Bank to the date of such assignment,
but without any premium.

                (b)     In the event that any Bank no longer meets the criteria
contained in the definition of "Eligible Assignee" (any such Bank being
referred to herein as an "Affected Bank"), the Agent shall have the
right, upon notice to such Affected Bank, to require such Affected Bank,
pursuant to Section 11.6 hereof, to assign to one or more Eligible
Assignee or Assignees who are willing to so purchase the same from such
Affected Bank, all (but not less than all) of such Affected Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, provided that such Eligible
Assignee or Assignees shall pay to such Affected Bank, an amount equal to
all interest, fees and other amounts owing or accrued to such Affected
Bank to the date of such assignment, but without any premium.  The fact
that any Bank no longer meets the definition of an Eligible Assignee does
not affect the Issuing Bank's obligation to issue Letters of Credit
hereunder.

                (c)     For each assignment, the parties shall execute and
deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.  Upon such
execution and delivery, from and after the effective date specified in
such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the assignee thereunder shall
be a party hereto and the assignor Bank released from its obligations
hereunder to the extent provided therein.


3.      FEES; PAYMENTS

        3.1.    Commitment Fee

                The Applicant agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of
the Banks in accordance with each Bank's Commitment Percentage, a fee
(the "Commitment Fee"), during the Commitment Period, equal to 0.20% per
annum on the average daily Available Amount.  The Commitment Fee shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June,
September and December of each year, commencing on the first such day

shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number
of days elapsed.

        3.2. Letter of Credit Commissions

                The Applicant agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of
the Banks in accordance with each Bank's Commitment Percentage,

including the Date of Issuance
thereof to and including the expiration date thereof (including any
expiration or cancellation prior to the Stated Expiration Date), at a
rate per annum equal to 0.65% per annum on the average daily amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  The Letter of
Credit Commissions shall be (i) calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year for the actual number of days elapsed, (ii) payable quarterly in
arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of
each year and on the date that the Commitment shall expire and (iii)

Applicant agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank, for its own account, its
standard fees and charges customarily charged to customers similar to
the Applicant with respect to any Letter of Credit.


4.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        In order to induce the Agent and the Banks to enter into this
Agreement and the Issuing Bank to issue the Letters of Credit and the
Banks to participate therein, the Applicant makes the following
representations and warranties to the Agent, each Bank and the Issuing
Agent:

        4.1. Corporate Existence and Power

                The Applicant is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland,
and has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business
as now conducted, other than such licenses, authorizations, consents and

aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

        4.2. Corporate and Governmental Authorization; No Contravention

                The execution, delivery and performance by the Applicant of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to which it is or will be a
party are within the Applicant's corporate powers, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official
and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of
applicable law or regulation or of the articles of incorporation or by-

        4.3. Binding Effect

                This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of

        4.4. Financial Information

                (a)     The consolidated statement of financial position and
shareholders' equity of the Applicant and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1993 and the related consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by
Ernst & Young and set forth in the Applicant's 1993 Form 10-K, a copy of
which has been delivered to each of the Banks, fairly present, in con-
formity with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated
financial position of the Applicant and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as
of such date and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for such fiscal year.

                (b)     The unaudited consolidated statement of financial
position and shareholders' equity of the Applicant and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the six months then ended,

generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent
with the financial statements referred to in subsection (a) of this
Section, the consolidated financial position of the Applicant and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for such six month period (subject to normal
year-end adjustments).

                (c)     Except as disclosed in the Applicant's Latest Form 10-Q
or in any Form 8-K filed by the Applicant under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 after the Applicant's Latest Form 10-Q and provided to the
Banks prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 1993 there

Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.

                (d)     A copy of a duly completed and signed Annual Statement

Company Subsidiary

is domiciled for the year ended December 31, 1993 has
been delivered to the Agent on behalf of each of the Banks and fairly
presents, in accordance with statutory accounting principles, the
information contained therein.

                (e)     A copy of a duly completed and signed Quarterly

livered to the Agent on behalf of each of the Banks and fairly presents,
in accordance with statutory accounting principles, the information
contained therein.

        4.5. Litigation

                Subject to matters disclosed in the financial statements
referred to in Section 4.04(a), there is no action, suit or proceeding
pending against, or to the knowledge of the Applicant threatened against
or affecting, the Applicant or any of its Subsidiaries before any court
or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in which
there is a reasonable expectation of an adverse decision which
reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which
in any manner draws into question the validity of this Agreement or the
Credit Documents.

        4.6. Compliance with ERISA

                Each member of the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations
under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue
Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all material
respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan.  No member of the ERISA
Group has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Sec-
tion 412 of the Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed
to make any contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or
in respect of any Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment to any Plan
or Benefit Arrangement, which in either case would trigger the provisions
of Section 412(n) or 401(a)(29) of the Internal Revenue Code (or any cor-
responding provisions of ERISA) or (iii) incurred any liability
under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums
under Section 4007 of ERISA.


        4.7. Environmental Matters

                In the ordinary course of its business, the Ap-
plicant conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws
on the business, operations and properties of the Applicant and its
Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates
associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any
capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of
properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating
expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with
environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of
any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating
activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility
or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations
conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in connection
with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any actual
or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any
related costs and expenses).  On the basis of this review, the Applicant
has reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and costs,
including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        4.8. Taxes

                The Applicant and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns
which are required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due
pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the
Applicant or any Subsidiary, other than any such assessments being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which any
reserves required under generally accepted accounting principles have
been established.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of
the Applicant and its Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other
governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Applicant,
adequate in all material respects.

        4.9. Subsidiaries

                Each of the Applicant's corporate Subsidiaries, including
without limitation, each Co-Applicant which is a corporation, is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all
corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now
conducted.


        4.10. Not an Investment Company

                Neither the Applicant nor any Co-Applicant is an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

        4.11. Full Disclosure

                All information heretofore furnished by the Ap-
plicant to the Agent or any Bank for purposes of or in connection with
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby is, and all such
information hereafter furnished by the Applicant to the Agent or any Bank
will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of
which such information is stated or certified.  The Applicant has
disclosed to the Banks in writing any and all facts which materially and
adversely affect or may affect (to the extent the Applicant can now
reasonably foresee), the business, operations or financial condition of
the Applicant and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
the ability of the Applicant to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

        (i)      Liens securing obligations of the type referred to in

                The Applicant will not (i) consolidate or merge with or into

provided no Default shall exist at, or immediately after, such merger,
or (ii) sell, lease or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, all
or substantially all of the assets of the Applicant and its Subsidiaries,

tangible, to, or participate in, or effect any transaction in connection
with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement with, any Affiliate

participation or transaction is on terms and conditions at least as
favorable to the Applicant or such Subsidiary as the terms and conditions
which would apply in a similar transaction with a Person not an Af-
filiate; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this Section
shall not prohibit the Applicant from declaring or paying any lawful
dividend or distribution so long as, after giving effect thereto, no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time
thereafter during the continuance thereof, (a) if such event is an Event
of Default specified in clause (i) or (j) above, the Commitment shall

Credit Documents, and (b) if such event is any other Event of Default,
any or all of the following actions may be taken: (i) with the consent
of the Required Banks, the Agent may, and upon the direction of the

remedies and other rights provided pursuant to the Credit Documents.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, presentment, demand,
protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived.
Each Credit Party hereby further expressly waives and covenants not to
assert any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, redemption or simi-
lar laws, now or at any time hereafter in force which might delay,
prevent or otherwise impede the performance or enforcement of any
Credit Document.

                In the event that the Commitment shall have been terminated

Agent and the Banks from or on behalf of the Applicant shall be applied
by the Agent and the Banks in liquidation of the obligations of the Ap-
plicant under the Credit Documents in such manner and order as the Agent
shall in its discretion determine and any funds received by the Agent and
the Banks from and or behalf of any Co-Applicant shall be applied by the
Agent and the Banks in liquidation of the obligations of such
Co-Applicant with respect to Letters of Credit requested by such

shall determine.


10.     THE AGENT

        10.1. Appointment

                Each Bank and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably desig-
nates and appoints BNY as Agent hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents and each such Bank and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably
authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of the Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms
of the Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are rea-
sonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary elsewhere in any Credit Document, the Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities other than those expressly set forth
therein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank or the Issuing
Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read

into the Credit Documents or
otherwise exist against the Agent.

        10.2. Delegation of Duties

                The Agent may execute any of its duties under the Credit
Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled
to rely upon the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties.

        10.3. Exculpatory Provisions

                Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable
for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
Person under or in connection with the Credit Documents (except the Agent
for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible
in any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals, statements, rep-
resentations or warranties made by any Credit Party or any of-
ficer thereof contained in the Credit Documents or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or
received by the Agent under or in connection with, the Credit Documents
or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, perfection,
enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Credit Documents or for
any failure of any Credit Party or any other Person to perform its obli-
gations thereunder.  The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any
Bank or the Issuing Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance
or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, the Credit Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Credit Party.  The Agent shall not be under any liability
or responsibility whatsoever, as Agent, to any Credit Party or any
other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance,
or any breach, by any Bank or the Issuing Bank of any of its obliga-
tions under any of the Credit Documents.

        10.4. Reliance by Agent

                The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, opinion, letter, cablegram, telegram, fax, telex
or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversa-
tion believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to
any Credit Party), independent accountants and other experts se-
lected by the Agent.  The Agent may treat each Bank and the Issuing Bank,
or the Person designated in the last notice filed with it under this
Section, as the holder of all of the interests of such Bank or Issuing
Bank hereunder until written notice of transfer, signed by such Bank or
Issuing Bank (or the Person designated in the last notice filed with the
Agent) and by the Person designated in such written notice of transfer,
in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, shall have been filed
with the Agent.  The Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or
pass upon the validity, effectiveness, enforceability, perfection or
genuineness of the Credit Documents or any instrument, document or com-
munication furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and
the Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective
and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what
they purport to be.  The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or
refusing to take any action under the Credit Documents unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks as it
deems appropriate.  The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Credit Documents in ac-
cordance with a request or direction of the Required Banks, and such
request or direction and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks, including all future Banks
and the Issuing Bank.

        10.5. Notice of Default

                The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has
received written notice thereof from the Issuing Bank, a Bank or the
Applicant or any Co-Applicant.  In the event that the Agent receives such
a notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Issuing
Bank, the Banks and the Applicant.  The Agent shall take such action
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be directed
by the Required Banks, provided, however, that unless and until the
Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not
be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be
in the best interests of the Banks.

        10.6. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks

                Each Bank and the Issuing Bank expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employ-
ees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any rep-
resentations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent
hereinafter, including any review of the affairs of any Credit Party,
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Agent to any Bank or the Issuing Bank.  Each Bank and the Issuing Bank
represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without re-
liance upon the Agent or any other Bank or the Issuing Bank, and based on

such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own evaluation of and investigation into the business, operations,
Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Credit Parties and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement.
Each Bank and the Issuing Bank also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, evaluations and
decisions in taking or not taking action under any Credit Document, and
to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as
to the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition
and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties.  Each Bank further
represents that it meets the criteria contained in the definition of a
"Eligible Assignee" hereunder.  Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent
hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank or the Issuing Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, Property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may come into
the possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employ-
ees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

        10.7. Indemnification

                Each Bank agrees to indemnify and reimburse the Agent in its
capacity as such (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Applicant
and without limiting the obligation of any Credit Party to do so), in the
amount of its pro rata share (based on its Commitment Percentage
hereunder), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever including, without limitation,
any amounts paid to the Banks (through the Agent) by the Applicant or any
Co-Applicant pursuant to the terms of the Credit Documents, that are
subsequently rescinded or avoided, or must otherwise be restored or
returned) which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Credit
Documents or any other documents contemplated by or referred to therein
or the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the Agent under or in connection with any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the pay-
ment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
to the extent resulting solely from the finally adjudicated gross neg-
ligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.  Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand
for its pro rata share of any unpaid fees owing to the Agent, and any
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) payable by the Applicant under Section 11.5, to the
extent that the Agent has not been paid such fees or has not be reim-
bursed for such costs and expenses, by the Applicant or any other Credit
Party.  The failure of any Bank to reimburse the Agent promptly upon
demand for its pro rata share of any amount required to be by the Banks
to the Agent as provided in this Section shall not relieve any other
Bank of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Agent for its pro
rata share of such amount, but no Bank shall be responsible for the fail-
ure of another Bank to reimburse the Agent for such other Bank's pro rata
share of such amount.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the
payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Documents.

        10.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity

                The Agent and its respective affiliates may make loans to,
accept deposits from, issue letters of credit for the account of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with, any Credit Party as
though the Agent were not Agent hereunder.  With respect to its
commitment and participation as Bank with respect to Letters of Credit,
the Agent, in its individual capacity and not as Agent, shall have the
same rights and powers under the Credit Documents as any Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank"
and "Banks" shall in each case include the Agent in its individual
capacity and not as Agent.

        10.9. Successor Agent

                If at any time the Agent deems it advisable, in its sole
discretion, it may submit to each of the Banks and the Issuing Bank a
written notice of its resignation as Agent under the Credit Documents,
such resignation to be effective upon the earlier of (i) the written
acceptance of the duties of the Agent under the Credit Documents by a
successor Agent and (ii) on the 30th day after the date of such notice.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to ap-
point from among the Banks a successor Agent.  If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and accepted such ap-
pointment in writing within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which successor Agent shall be a com-
mercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America
or any State thereof and having a combined capital, surplus, and
undivided profits of at least $100,000,000.  Upon the ac-
ceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and
the retiring Agent's rights, powers, privileges and duties as Agent under
the Credit Documents shall be terminated.  The Applicant, Co-Applicant,
Issuing Bank and the Banks shall execute such documents as shall be
necessary to effect such appointment.  After any retiring Agent's
resignation as Agent, the provisions of the Credit Documents shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under the Credit Documents.  If at any time there
shall not be a duly appointed and acting Agent, the Applicant agrees to
make each payment due under the Credit Documents directly to the Issuing
Bank and the Banks entitled thereto during such time.


11.     OTHER PROVISIONS

        11.1. Amendments and Waivers

                With the written consent of the Required Banks, the Agent and
the appropriate Credit Parties may, from time to time, enter into writ-
ten amendments, supplements or modifications of the Credit Documents

Banks may execute and deliver to any such parties a written instrument
waiving or a consent to a departure from, on such terms and conditions
as the Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of
the Credit Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its con-
sequences; provided, however, that:

Credit Commissions or change any other term or provision which relates
to the Commitment or the Letters of Credit; and

                (c)     without the written consent of the Agent, no such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall

amend, modify or
waive any provision of Section 10 or otherwise change any of the rights
or obligations of the Agent hereunder or under the Credit Documents.

                Any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall
apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the parties
to the applicable Credit Document, the Banks, the Agent, the Issuing
Bank and all future Banks.  In the case of any waiver, the parties to the
applicable Credit Document, the Banks and the Agent shall be restored
to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents to the extent provided for in such waiver, and any Default or
Event of Default waived shall not extend to any subsequent or other
Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Credit Documents may not be amended orally or by any course of
conduct.

shall not be effective until received, and any notice of
payment or demand for payment under Section 2.1(c) shall not be effective

party to a Credit Document may rely on signatures of the parties thereto

originally signed.

        11.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies

                No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the
part of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank, any right, remedy, power
or privilege under any Credit Document shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege under any Credit Document preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers and privileges under the Credit
Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, pow-
ers and privileges provided by law.

        11.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties

                All representations and warranties made under the Credit
Documents and in any document, certificate or statement delivered pursu-
ant thereto or in connection therewith shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Credit Documents.


        11.5. Payment of Expenses and Taxes

                The Applicant agrees, promptly upon presentation of a
statement or invoice therefor, and whether any Letter of Credit is issued
(i) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all its out-of-pocket costs and ex-
penses reasonably incurred in connection with the development, prepara-
tion and execution of, the Credit Documents and any amendment,
supplement or modification thereto (whether or not executed), any
documents prepared in connection therewith and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby, including syndication, and,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of Special Counsel, (ii) to pay or reimburse the Agent, the Issuing Bank
and the Banks for all of their respective costs and expenses, in-
cluding, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel, incurred in connection with (A) any Default or Event of Default
and any enforcement or collection proceedings resulting therefrom or
in connection with the negotiation of any restructuring or "work-out"
(whether consummated or not) of the obligations of the Credit Parties un-
der any of the Credit Documents, (B) the enforcement of this Section,
(iii) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank, the Issuing Bank and the
Agent harmless from and against, any and all recording and filing fees
and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay
in paying, stamp, excise and other similar taxes, if any, which may be
payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution
and delivery of, or consummation of any of the transactions con-
templated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any
waiver or consent under or in respect of, the Credit Documents and any
such other documents, and (iv) to pay, indemnify and hold each Bank,
the Issuing Bank and the Agent and each of their respective officers,
directors and employees harmless from and against any and all other li-
abilities, obligations, claims, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
disbursements) with respect to the enforcement and performance of
the Credit Documents, the use of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit
(all the foregoing, collectively, the "indemnified li-
abilities") and, if and to the extent that the foregoing indemnity may
be unenforceable for any reason, the Applicant agrees to make the
maximum payment permitted or not prohibited under applicable law; pro-
vided, however, that the Applicant shall have no obligation hereunder to
pay indemnified liabilities to the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank
arising from the finally adjudicated gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank or claims between
one indemnified party and another indemnified party.  The agreements in
this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitment and the
payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Documents.


        11.6. Assignments and Participations

                (a)     The Credit Documents shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Applicant, the Co-Applicants, the Banks, the Issuing
Bank, the Agent, all future Banks and their respective successors and
assigns, except that no Credit Party may assign, delegate or transfer
any of its rights or obligations under the Credit Documents without the
prior written consent of the Agent and each Bank.

                (b)     Each Bank shall have the right at any time, upon
written notice to the Agent of its intent to do so, to sell, assign,
transfer or negotiate all or any part of such Bank's rights under the
Credit Documents to one or more of its affiliates which would otherwise
be Eligible Assignees, to one or more of the other Banks (or to affili-
ates of such other Banks which would be an Eligible Assignee) or, with
the prior written consent of the Applicant, the Issuing Bank and the
Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be
required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default), to sell, assign, transfer or negotiate all or any part of
such Bank's rights and obligations under the Credit Documents to any
other bank, insurance company, pension fund, mutual fund or other finan-
cial institution which meets the criteria of Eligible Assignee,
provided that (i) each such sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation
(other than sales, assignments, transfers or negotiations to affiliates
of such Bank shall be in a minimum amount of $3,000,000, provided that
the assigning Bank retains a Commitment Percentage equivalent to
$5,000,000 following such assignment, and (ii) there shall be paid to
the Agent by the assigning Bank a fee (the "Assignment Fee") of $3,000.
For each assignment, the parties to such assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Agent for its acceptance and recording an Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement.  Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording by the Agent, from and after the effective date specified in
such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment
and Acceptance Agreement, the assignor Bank thereunder shall be re-
leased from its obligations under the Credit Documents.  Upon any such
sale, assignment or other transfer, the Commitment Percentages set
forth in Exhibit A shall be adjusted accordingly by the Agent and a new
Exhibit A shall be distributed by the Agent to the Applicant and each
Bank.

                (c)     Each Bank may grant participations in all or any part
of its Commitment Percentage to one or more banks, insurance companies,
financial institutions, pension funds or mutual funds, provided that
(i) such Bank's obligations under the Credit Documents shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Bank

shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties to the Credit Documents for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) the Applicant, the Issuing Bank, the Agent and the other Banks
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection
with such Bank's rights and obligations under the Credit Documents, (v)
no sub-participations shall be permitted and (vi) the voting rights of
any holder of any participation shall be limited to decisions that only
do any of the following: (A) subject the participant to any additional
obligation, (B) reduce interest, any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, or (C) postpone any date fixed for the payment of
reimbursement obligations, interest or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder.  The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that any such
participant shall for purposes of Sections 2.11 and 2.12 be deemed to
be a "Bank"; provided, however, the Applicant shall not, at any
time, be obligated to pay any participant in any interest of any Bank
hereunder any sum in excess of the sum which the Applicant would have
been obligated to pay to such Bank in respect of such interest had such
Bank not sold such participation.

                (d)     No Bank shall, as between and among the Applicant, any
Co-Applicant, the Issuing Bank, the Agent and such Bank, be relieved of
any of its obligations under the Credit Documents as a result of any
sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation of, or granting of par-
ticipations in, all or any part of its Commitment Percentage, except that
a Bank shall be relieved of its obligations to the extent of any such
sale, assignment, transfer, or negotiation of any part of its Com-
mitment Percentage.

                (e)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section, any Bank may at any time or from time to time assign all or
any portion of its rights under the Credit Documents to a Federal Reserve
Bank, provided that any such assignment shall not release such assignor
from its obligations thereunder.

        11.7. Counterparts

                Each Credit Document may be executed by one or more of the
parties thereto on any number of separate counterparts and all of said
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same document.  It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Credit
Document to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by
the party to be charged.  A counterpart of any Credit Document or to any
document evidencing, and of any an amendment, modification, consent or
waiver to or of any Credit Document transmitted by fax shall be deemed to
be an originally executed counterpart.  A set of the copies of the
Credit Documents signed by all the parties thereto shall be deposited
with each of the Applicant

and the Agent.  Any party to a Credit Document
may rely upon the signatures of any other party thereto which are
transmitted by fax or other electronic means to the same extent as if
originally signed.

        11.8. Adjustments; Set-off

                (a)     If any Bank (a "Benefited Bank") shall at any time
receive any payment or collateral in respect of the Letter of Credit
Obligations in excess of its pro rata share (based on its Commitment
Percentage) (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant
to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 9.1 (i) or
(j), or otherwise), such Benefited Bank shall purchase from each of the
other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's participation in the
Letter of Credit Obligations, and shall provide each of such other Banks
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as
shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Bank to share the excess pay-
ment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of
the Banks, provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Bank,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  The Ap-
plicant and Co-Applicants agree that each Bank so purchasing a portion
of another Bank's percentage of Letter of Credit Obligations may exercise
all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off,
to the extent not prohibited by law) with respect to such portion as
fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such portion.

                (b)     In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, under Section 9.1(a) or (b), each Bank shall have the
right, without prior notice to the Applicant, any such notice being
expressly waived by each Credit Party to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, to set-off and apply against any indebtedness, whether
contingent, matured or unmatured, of such Credit Party to such Bank, any
amount owing from such Bank to such Credit Party, at, or at any time af-
ter, the happening of any of the above-mentioned events.  To the extent
not prohibited by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be
exercised by such Bank against such Credit Party or against any trustee
in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee
for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attach-
ment creditor of such Credit Party, or against anyone else claiming
through or against such Credit Party or such trustee in bankruptcy,
custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment
creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right

of set-off shall not
have been exercised by such Bank prior to the making, filing or issu-
ance, or service upon such Bank of, or of notice of, any such petition,
assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for
the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena,
order or warrant.  Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the applicable
Credit Party, the Issuing Bank and the Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

        11.9. Construction

                Each Credit Party represents that it has been represented by
counsel in connection with the Credit Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby and that the principle that agreements are to be
construed against the draftsman shall be inapplicable.

        11.10. Indemnity

                The Applicant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank and their respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents (each an
"Indemnified Person") from and against any loss, cost, liability, dam-
age or expense (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel of such Indemnified Person, including all local counsel hired by
any such counsel) incurred by such Indemnified Person in investigating,
preparing for, defending against, or providing evidence, producing
documents or taking any other action in respect of, any commenced or
threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or investigation under
any federal securities law or any other statute of any jurisdiction, or
any regulation, or at common law or otherwise, which is alleged to
arise out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact by any Credit Party in any document
or schedule executed or filed with any Governmental Authority by or on
behalf of any Credit Party; (ii) any omission or alleged omission to
state any material fact required to be stated in such document or sched-
ule, or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which made, not misleading; or (iii) any acts,
practices or omissions or alleged acts, practices or omissions of any
Credit Party or its agents relating to the use of the proceeds of any
or all Letters of Credit made by the Applicant which are alleged to be
in violation of Section 2.13, or in violation of any federal securities
law or of any other statute, regulation or other law of any jurisdic-
tion applicable thereto.  The indemnity set
forth herein shall be in addition to any other obligations or li-
abilities of the Applicant and/or Co-Applicant to each Indemnified Person
under the Credit Documents or at common law or otherwise, and shall
survive any termination of the Credit Documents, the expiration of the
Commitment and the payment of all obligations of the Applicant and
Co-Applicants under the Credit Documents, provided that the Applicant
shall have no obligation under this Section to an Indemnified Person
with respect to any of the foregoing to the extent found in a final
judgment of a court having jurisdiction to have resulted primarily out
of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnified Person
or arising solely from claims between one such Indemnified Person and
another such Indemnified Person.

        11.11. Governing Law

                The Credit Documents and the rights and obligations of the
parties thereunder shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without
regard to principles of conflict of laws.

        11.12. Headings Descriptive

                Section headings have been inserted in the Credit Documents
for convenience only and shall not be construed to be a part thereof.

        11.13. Severability

                Every provision of the Credit Documents is intended to be
severable, and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, il-
legal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall not be affected
or impaired thereby, and any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or en-
forceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.

        11.14. Integration

                All exhibits to a Credit Document shall be deemed to be a
part thereof.  The Credit Documents embody the entire agreement and
understanding among the Credit Parties, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and
the Banks with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings among the Credit Parties, the Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Banks with respect to the subject matter
thereof.


        11.15. Consent to Jurisdiction

                Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in the City
of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to the Credit Documents.  Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted or not prohibited by law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any
claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  Each Credit Party hereby
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in such a court, after all appropriate appeals, shall be
conclusive and binding upon it.

        11.16. Service of Process

                Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service
of process in any suit, action or proceeding by sending the same by
first class mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier ser-
vice, to the address of such Credit Party set forth in or referred to in
Section 11.2 or in the applicable Credit Document executed by such Credit
Party.  Each Credit Party hereby agrees that any such service (i) shall
be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any
such suit, action, or proceeding, and (ii) shall to the fullest extent
enforceable by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon
and personal delivery to it.

        11.17. No Limitation on Service or Suit

                Nothing in the Credit Documents or any modification, waiver,
consent or amendment thereto shall affect the right of the Agent or any
Bank to serve process in any manner permitted by law or limit the right
of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank to bring proceedings against
any Credit Party in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdic-
tions in which such Credit Party may be served.

        11.18. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY

                THE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK, THE BANKS AND EACH CREDIT PARTY
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREIN.  FURTHER, EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK, OR THE BANKS,
OR COUNSEL TO THE AGENT OR THE BANKS, HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT THE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK OR THE BANKS WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO
JURY TRIAL PROVISION.  EACH CREDIT PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AGENT, THE
ISSUING BANK AND THE BANKS HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, INTER ALIA, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.



                IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly
authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT



        This Assignment and Acceptance Agreement is made and entered into
as of _____ __, 19__, by and between ____________ (the "Assignor") and
____________ (the "Assignee").

R E C I T A L S

        A.      The Assignor, certain other banks (together with any prior
assignees, the "Banks") and The Bank of New York, as agent (the "Agent")
and as issuing bank (the "Issuing Bank"), are parties to that certain
Letter of Credit Agreement dated as of October 25, 1994 (the "Agreement")
with USF&G Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Applicant") and
certain subsidiaries of the Applicant party thereto.  Pursuant to the
Agreement, the Banks agreed to participate in Letters of Credit issued by
the Issuing Bank under the Agreement in accordance with their Commitment
Percentage. The Assignor's Commitment (without giving effect to the
assignment effected hereby or to other assignments thereof which have
not yet become effective) is specified in Item 1 of Schedule 1 hereto.
The Assignor's percentage of the Letter of Credit Exposure (without giv-
ing effect to the assignment effected hereby or to other assignments
thereof which have not yet become effective) is specified in Item 2 of
Schedule 1 hereto.  All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
are used herein as defined in the Agreement.

        B.      The Assignor wishes to sell and assign to the Assignee, and
the Assignee wishes to purchase and assume from the Assignor, the portion
of the Assignor's Commitment specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 hereto
(the "Assigned Commitment").

        The parties agree as follows:

        1.      Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein and in the Agreement, the Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the
Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the
Assignor, without recourse, on the date set forth above (the "Assignment
Date") all obligations of the Assignor under the Agreement with respect
to the Assigned Commitment.  As consideration for the assignment and sale
contemplated hereby, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the date
hereof the amount heretofore agreed between them.

        2.      Representation and Warranties. Each of the Assignor and the
Assignee represents and warrants to the other that (a) it has full power
and legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform the
provisions of this Agreement; (b) the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement have been authorized by all action, corporate or
otherwise, and do not violate any provisions of its charter or by-laws or
any contractual obligations or requirement of law binding on it; and (c)
this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.  The Assignor
further represents that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such interest is free
and clear of any adverse claim created by the Assignor.  The Assignee
further represents that it is an "Eligible Assignee" as said term is
defined in the Agreement.

        3.      Condition Precedent. The obligations of the Assignor and the
Assignee hereunder shall be subject to the fulfillment of the condition
that the Assignor shall have complied with the other applicable
provisions of Section 11.6 of the Agreement.

        4.      Notice of Assignment. The Assignor agrees to give notice of
the assignment and assumption of the Assigned Commitment to the Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Applicant and hereby instructs the Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Applicant to make all payments with respect to the
Assigned Commitment directly to the Assignee at the applicable office
specified on Schedule 2 hereto; provided, however, that the Applicant,
the Agent and the Issuing Bank all shall be entitled to continue to deal
solely and directly with the Assignor in connection with the interests so
assigned until the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Applicant, to the
extent required by Section 11.6 of the Agreement, shall have received
notice of the assignment, the Applicant (and if required, the Agent and
the Issuing Bank) shall have consented in writing thereto, and the Agent
shall have recorded and accepted this Agreement and received the
Assignment Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 11.6 of the
Agreement.  From and after the date (the "Effective Date") on which the
Agent shall notify the Applicant and the Assignor that the requirements
set forth in the foregoing sentence shall have occurred and all consents
(if any) required shall have been given, (i) the Assignee shall be deemed
to be a party to the Agreement and, to the extent that rights and
obligations thereunder shall have been assigned to Assignee as provided

delegated to the Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto.  After the Effective Date, the Agent
shall make all payments in respect of the interest assigned hereby
(including payments of interest, fees and other amounts) to the
Assignee.  The Assignor and Assignee shall make all ap-
propriate adjustment in payments under the Assigned Commitment for
periods prior to the Effective Date hereof directly between themselves.
If the Assignee is not a United States Person as defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code, the Assignee shall deliver herewith the forms
required by Section 2.11(d) of the Agreement to evidence the Assignee's
complete exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect to

        5.      Independent Investigation. The Assignee acknowledges that it

recourse and, except as provided in Section 2 hereof, without represen-
tation or warranty.  The Assignee further acknowledges that it has made
its own independent investigation and credit evaluation of the Applicant
and any Co-Applicant in connection with its purchase of the Assigned
Commitment.  Except for the representations or warranties set forth in
Section 2, the Assignee acknowledges that it is not relying on any
representation or warranty of the Assignor, expressed or implied, in-
cluding without limitation, any representation or warranty relating to
the legality, validity, genuineness, enforceability,
collectibility, interest rate, repayment schedule or status of the
Assigned Commitment, the legality, validity, genuineness or
enforceability of the Agreement, or any other Credit Document referred to
in or delivered pursuant to the Agreement, or financial condition or
creditworthiness of the Applicant, any Co-Applicant or any other Person.
The Assignor has not and will not be acting as either the
representative, agent or trustee of the Assignee with respect to matters
arising out of or relating to the Agreement or this Agreement.  From and
after the Effective Date, except as set forth in Section 4 above, the
Assignor shall have no rights or obligations with respect to the Assigned
Commitment.

        6.      Consent of the Applicant.

                Pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.6 of the Agreement,

hereunder shall be in funds available at the place of payment on the same
day and shall be made by wire transfer to the account designated by the
party to receive payment.


        8.      Integration. This Agreement shall supersede any prior
agreement or understanding between the parties (other than the Agreement)
as to the subject matter hereof.

        9.      Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and shall
be binding upon both parties, their successors and assigns.

        10.     Headings. Section headings have been inserted herein for
convenience only and shall not be construed to be a part hereof.

        11.     Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended,

hereto, and may not be amended, changed, waived or modified in any manner
inconsistent with Section 11.7 of the Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Agent.

        12.     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of, the State of New York.

FORM OF OPINION OF
GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE APPLICANT





                                                        ______________, 1994



To the Parties Listed
On Schedule A Hereto


Re:Letter of Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 1994, by
and among USF&G CORPORATION (the "Applicant"), each
Subsidiary of the Applicant which is a party thereto (each,
a "Co-Applicant"), the Banks party thereto, and THE BANK OF
NEW YORK, as Agent and Issuing Bank (the "Agreement")


Dear Sirs:

                I am General Counsel for USF&G Corporation (the "Applicant")
and have acted in such capacity in connection with the Letter of Credit
Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of October 25, 1994 among the
Applicant, the Co-Applicants, if any, listed on the signature pages
thereof, the banks listed on the signature pages thereof and The Bank of
New York, as Agent and Issuing Bank.  Terms defined in the Credit
Agreement are used herein as therein defined.  This opinion is being
rendered to you at the request of my client pursuant to Section 5.5 of
the Agreement.

                I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have
conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed
necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

                Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

                1.      The Applicant has all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business
as now conducted, other than such licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals which, if not held or obtained by the Applicant, do not, in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                2.      To the best of my knowledge after responsible inquiry,
the execution, delivery and performance by the Applicant of the
Agreement and each other Credit Document to which it is a party do not
contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of any material
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument
binding upon the Applicant or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the
creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of the
Applicant or any of its Subsidiaries.

                3.      To the best of my knowledge after responsible inquiry,
there is no action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened against or
affecting the Applicant or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or
arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official, in which there
is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could
materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial
position or consolidated results of operations of the Applicant and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole or which in any manner
draws into question the validity of the Agreement except as may have
been disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 4.4(a)
of the Agreement.

                4.      Each of the Applicant's corporate Subsidiaries is a
corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all
material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, other than such
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals which, if not held or
obtained by the Applicant, do not, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.


                                                        Very truly yours,

NEW YORK, as Agent and Issuing Bank (the "Agreement")


Dear Sirs:

                We have acted as counsel for USF&G Corporation (the
"Applicant") in connection with the Letter of Credit Agreement (the
"Agreement") dated as of October 25, 1994 among the Applicant, the
Co-Applicants, if any, listed on the signature pages thereof, the banks

and as Issuing Bank.  Terms defined in the Agreement are used herein as
therein defined.  This opinion is being rendered to you at the request
of our client pursuant to Section 5.5 of the Agreement.

                We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have
conducted such other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed
necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

                Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

                1.      The Applicant is a corporation validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Maryland, and has all corporate powers
required to carry on its business as now conducted.


                2.      The execution, delivery and performance by the
Applicant of the Agreement and each other Credit Document to which it is
a party are within the Applicant's corporate powers, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by the
Applicant by or in respect of, or filing by the Applicant with, any
governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or
constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or
regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Applicant.

                3.       The Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Applicant and each other Credit Document delivered on
the Effective Date constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Applicant, in each case enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
equity (including public policy limitations on the indemnification
provisions thereof).


                                                Very truly yours,

Re:Letter of Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 1994, by
and among USF&G CORPORATION (the "Applicant"), each
Subsidiary of the Applicant which is a party thereto (each, a
"Co-Applicant"), the Banks party thereto, and THE BANK OF NEW

        We have acted as Special Counsel to the Agent in connection with
the Agreement.  Capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the

hereof otherwise requires.

        We have examined originals or copies certified to our satisfaction
of the documents required to be delivered pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 5 and 6 of the Agreement.  In conducting such examination, we
have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to originals
of all documents submitted to us as copies.

        Based upon the foregoing examination, and relying with your
permission upon the opinions of John Lummis, general counsel to the
Applicant and Piper & Marbury, counsel to the Applicant, we are of the
opinion that all legal preconditions to the issuance of the first Letter
of Credit have been satisfactorily met.

                This opinion is rendered solely for your benefit in
connection with the transactions referred to herein and may not be relied
upon by any other Person.

                In rendering the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as
to laws other than the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws
of the United States of America.

Very truly yours,

                               USF&G CORPORATION



                     ENABLING RESOLUTIONS TO ESTABLISH

                  1994 STOCK PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF USF&G



        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has previously considered and approved
in concept various employee recognition and bonus programs, including the VIP
(Value-Involvement-Performance) Program, RAVE (Recognize a Valued Employee),
Chairman's Club T.R.I.P. and WIN, pursuant to which employees of the Corporation
or its subsidiaries may receive options to purchase shares of the Corporation's
Common Stock (all such programs, together with similar all-employee programs
approved by the Compensation Committee from time to time, are hereinafter
referred to as the "Employee Stock Option Programs");

        WHEREAS, the Board desires to formally authorize and reserve for
issuance shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Employee Stock Option
Programs;

NOW, WHEREFORE, it is hereby:

RESOLVED, that the Corporation grant, from time to time pursuant to the Employee
Stock Option Programs, options for the purchase of Common Stock of the
Corporation; provided, however, that all such grants shall: (i) be made only to
employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries as designated by the
Compensation Committee; (ii) not be made to any person subject to Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (iii) provide for an option exercise price
per share as determined by the Compensation Committee from time to time, but in
no instance shall such price be less than the fair market value of a share
of authorized and issued Common Stock of the Corporation on the date the option
is granted (fair market value shall be the average of the high and low sale
prices quoted on the New York Stock Exchange composite listing on the date in
question or if there were no quotations on such date, on the next preceding
trading day on which there were such quotations); (iv) provide for a period for
exercising such options of not more than ten years and one day from the date of
grant; (v) not constitute incentive stock options intended to qualify under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; (vi) provide that
no share of Common Stock shall be issued until full payment therefor has been
made to the Corporation and that the holder of the option shall have none of the
rights of a shareholder until the shares are actually issued; (vii) be non-
transferable and non-assignable (including by pledge or hypothecation), except
that valid option rights may be transferred by testamentary instrument or by
laws of descent and distribution; (viii) during such holder's lifetime, be
exercisable only by the grantee and not be transferable or assignable; (ix)
otherwise be on such terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations as shall be
established from time to time by the Compensation Committee, including, without
limitation, any provisions regarding vesting, exercise, termination, and
forfeiture; and (x) be made only as and when approved by the Compensation
Committee.

RESOLVED, that there be and hereby are approved and reserved for issuance
pursuant to any such Employee Stock Option Programs, subject to further action
of the Compensation Committee to authorize such issuance, an aggregate of up to
2,500,000 shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, and such shares, upon
issuance thereof pursuant to any of the Employee Stock Option Programs as
provided in the immediately preceding resolution, shall constitute duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock
of the Corporation.

RESOLVED, that in the event of changes in the Common Stock of the Corporation by
reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalizations, mergers,
consolidations, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the
Compensation Committee shall make such adjustments as shall be just and
equitable in the number and kind of shares reserved for purchase under the
Employee Stock Option Programs, the number and kind and option price of shares
covered by options granted, and in any other matters which relate to the options
and which are affected by any such changes.

RESOLVED, that any shares subject to an option which remain unpurchased at the
expiration, termination or cancellation of an option and options or shares which
are otherwise forfeited, surrendered or reacquired, shall again be available for
use under the Employee Stock Option Programs.

RESOLVED, that the President, any Executive Vice President, Senior Vice
President, Vice President or the Secretary (hereinafter "Officers of the
Corporation"), as they deem appropriate, make application to the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc., the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., the London Stock Exchange and
the Stock Exchanges of Basle, Geneva, and Zurich, Switzerland for the listing,
subject to official notice of issuance, of up to 2,500,000 shares of Common
Stock reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Option Programs; and the
Secretary be and hereby is authorized to prepare, execute and deliver an
appropriate listing application, to appear before the respective exchanges and
to do any and all other things which are necessary or desirable in connection
therewith.

RESOLVED, that the Officers of the Corporation be and they are hereby authorized
and directed to prepare, with the cooperation of counsel and accountants for the
Corporation, and to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission such
registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and any required amendments and supplements thereto, as may be
necessary from time to time to register the shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation or any other securities required to be registered in connection with
the Employee Stock Option Programs (all such securities, including the Common
Stock, is hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Securities"), all
to the extent the appropriate officers of the Corporation deem appropriate.

RESOLVED, that the Chairman of the Board of Directors and President, any
Executive Vice President, or the Senior Vice President-General Counsel, and each
of them, be and they are hereby authorized and empowered to execute from time to
time by and in the name of the Corporation the registration statements referred
to above and any amendments and supplements thereto and to file the same with
the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the execution of such registration
statements and of any amendments and supplements thereto by the officers and
directors of the Corporation either personally or by any one of Norman P.
Blake, Jr., Dan L. Hale or John A. MacColl acting as attorney-in-fact of such
officers or directors pursuant to a power or powers of attorney, be and the same
is hereby specifically authorized.

RESOLVED, that John A. MacColl, be and he is hereby designated as "agent for
service" of the Corporation in connection with any such registration statements
and the filing thereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

RESOLVED, that the Officers of the Corporation are each authorized and directed
in the name and on behalf of the Corporation to take any and all action which
they may deem necessary or advisable in order to obtain a permit, register, or
qualify the Securities for issuance under the Employee Stock Option Programs in
accordance with the terms thereof or to request an exemption from registration
of the Securities or to register or obtain a license for the Corporation as
dealer or broker under the securities laws of such of the states of the
United States of America as such officers may deem advisable, and in connection
with such registrations, permits, licenses, qualifications, and exemptions to
execute, acknowledge, verify, deliver, file, and publish all such applications,
reports, issuer's covenants, resolutions, irrevocable consents to service
of process, powers of attorney, and other papers and instruments as may be
required under such laws, and to take any and all further action which they may
deem necessary or advisable in order to maintain such registrations in effect
for as long as they may deem to be in the best interest of the Corporation.

RESOLVED, that it is desirable and in the best interest of the Corporation that
to the extent required by law the Securities be qualified or registered for sale
in various states; that the Officers of the Corporation are each authorized to
determine the states in which appropriate action shall be taken to qualify or
register for sale all or such part of the Securities as said Officers may deem
advisable; that said Officers are hereby authorized to perform on behalf of the
Corporation any and all such acts as they deem necessary or advisable in order
to comply with the applicable laws of any such states, and in connection
therewith to execute and file all requisite papers and documents, including, but
not limited to, applications, reports, surety bonds, irrevocable consents, and
appointments of attorneys for service of process; and the execution of any such
Officer of any such paper or document or with the doing by him of any act in
connection with the foregoing matters shall conclusively establish his or her
authority therefor from the Corporation and the approval and ratification by the
Corporation of the papers and documents so executed and the act so taken.

RESOLVED, that if in any such state where any of the Securities are to be
registered or qualified for issuance under the Employee Stock Option Programs in
accordance with the terms thereof, or where the Corporation is to be registered
in connection with the Employee Stock Option Programs, a prescribed form of
resolution or resolutions is required to be adopted by the Board of Directors,
each such resolution shall be deemed to have been, and is adopted by this
resolution; and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation is
hereby authorized to certify the adoption of all such resolutions as
though such resolutions were now presented to and adopted at this meeting, all
such resolutions to be inserted in the minute book of the Corporation on pages

Exhibit 10R



                              USF&G CORPORATION

                        STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 1991

As Amended and Restated



Purpose and Types of Awards



        The purpose of the USF&G Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 1991, as
amended and restated herein (the "Plan"), is to provide officers and other key
employees (collectively, "Key Persons") of USF&G Corporation and designated
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Corporation") with additional incentives to
continue and increase their efforts with respect to the Corporation and to
develop a personal and active interest in the broader growth and greater
financial success of the Corporation.


        The Plan provides for granting Key Persons options, stock appreciation
rights, stock awards and performance awards (collectively, "Awards").  Awards
may be granted separately or in tandem with other Awards, or in lieu of other
compensation or other Awards otherwise payable to a Key Person either at the
election of the Committee or, under rules approved by the Committee from time to
time, at the election of the Key Person.



ARTICLE I - Administration



        (a)     The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee
(the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors, consisting of not less
than two members, each of whom qualifies as a "disinterested" and "outside"
director pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service
under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), respectively.



        (b)     Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have full
and complete authority in its discretion to grant Awards under the Plan,
prescribe agreements evidencing such Awards and establish programs for granting
Awards, and to take all other actions necessary to carry out the purpose and
intent of the Plan, including, but not limited to, the authority to determine
(i) the Key Persons to whom, and the time or times at which Awards shall be
granted, (ii) the types of Awards to be granted, (iii) the number of shares to
be covered by each Award, and (iv) all terms and conditions with respect to each
Award.



        (c)     The Committee shall have full and complete authority to
administer and interpret the Plan and all agreements evidencing Awards under the
Plan and all programs providing for Awards, to prescribe, amend and rescind
rules and regulations relating to it, to determine the terms and provisions of
the respective agreements entered into (which agreements need not be identical)
with respect to Awards, to establish various programs for granting Awards under
the Plan and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or desirable for
the operation and administration of the Plan.



        (d)     The Committee shall have the power to designate which of the
present and future affiliated and subsidiary corporations the Key Persons of
which shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.



        (e)     The Committee shall have the authority to accelerate the
time in which any Award may be exercised or becomes payable and to waive, in
whole or in part, any restriction or condition with respect to such Award,
including, but not limited to, any restriction or condition with respect to the
vesting or exercisability of any Award following termination of any Key
Person's employment.



        (f)     All determinations made by the Committee shall be final and
conclusive.





ARTICLE II - Participation in the Plan



        (a)     Participation in the Plan shall be limited to such Key Persons
of the Corporation as shall from time to time be designated by the Committee.
At the discretion of the Committee, an employee may be deemed to be a Key Person
as a result of his status or position with the Corporation or as a result of
individual efforts in connection with a specific project.



        (b)     No member of the Board of Directors who is not also an officer
or employee of the Corporation shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.



ARTICLE III - Common Stock Subject to the Plan



        (a)     Subject to the provisions of Sections (c) and (d)  of this
Article, the total number of shares of the authorized Common Stock of the
Corporation which may be issued under the Plan pursuant to Awards granted on or
after April 1, 1994 shall be 4,000,000 shares; provided, however, that the
number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to
incentive stock options intended to qualify under section 422 of the Code,
shall be determined without regard to Section (d) of this Article.  In no event,
however, shall there be issued under the Plan on or after April 1, 1994, more
than 2,000,000 shares of restricted stock, subject to adjustment under Section
(c) but without regard to Section (d) of this Article III.  The total number of
shares of Common Stock subject to issuance under the Plan, and any balance
remaining unoptioned or unawarded, shall be reserved for those purposes during
the life of the Plan.



        (b)     Subject to the provisions of Section (c) of this Article, from
and after April 1, 1994 and until this Plan shall terminate pursuant to Article
XVI, no Key Person shall be eligible to receive an Award or Awards under the
Plan for, in the aggregate, more than 500,000 shares of Common Stock.  Awards to
any such person which are subsequently terminated, canceled, forfeited, or
reacquired shall nevertheless be counted when determining whether such maximum
number of shares has been issued.  No Key Person shall be eligible to receive an
Award or Awards granted under the Plan before April 1, 1994, for, in the
aggregate, more than 700,000 shares.



        (c)     In the event of changes in the Common Stock of the Corporation
by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalizations, mergers,
consolidations, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the Board of
Directors shall make such appropriate adjustments in the number and kind of
shares reserved for purchase by or Award to Key Persons under the Plan, the
number and kind and the price of shares covered by Awards granted, the maximum
number of shares for which any one person shall be eligible to receive or
exercise Awards, the minimum number of shares as to which Awards shall be
exercisable at any one time, and in any other matters which relate to Awards
and which are affected by the changes referred to above.



        (d)     If for any reason an Award or portion of an Award expires or is
terminated, surrendered, canceled, forfeited or reacquired pursuant to rights
reserved upon issuance thereof, then the number of shares of Common Stock
covered by the Award or portion of the Award shall be restored to the number of
shares available for Awards under the Plan as if the Award or portion of the
Award had never been issued, except to the extent shares are actually issued and
such restoration is restricted by Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  In the event
an Award is exercised and paid in cash, any shares subject to such Award shall
again be subject to issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan, except
to the extent shares are actually issued and such restoration is restricted by
Section 16 of the Exchange Act.





ARTICLE IV - Options



        (a)     The Committee in its discretion may grant options to any Key
Person on such terms and conditions as it shall, in its discretion, deem
advisable, subject to Section (b) of this Article IV.  Options granted under the
Plan may be either incentive stock options intended to qualify under section 422
of the Code, or non-qualified stock options not intended to so qualify.



        (b)     The option exercise price per share with respect to each option
shall be determined by the Committee from time to time, but in no instance shall
such price be less than the fair market value of a share of the authorized and
issued Common Stock of the Corporation on the date the option is granted.  Fair
market value shall be the average of the high and low sales prices quoted on the
New York Stock Exchange composite listing on the date in question or if there
were no quotations on such date, on the next preceding trading day on which
there were such quotations.



        (c)     The terms of an option may provide for the award of a new option
when the exercise price has been paid by tendering shares of Common Stock,
provided that such replenishment feature shall be limited to any extent required
by rules, regulations, or interpretations under the Exchange Act with respect to
any particular grant in the case of a Key Person who is or becomes subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Any option which would automatically be granted
pursuant to this Section (c) without any further Committee action may cover not
more than the number of shares tendered and shall have an exercise price set
at the then fair market value of such shares. ARTICLE V - Stock Appreciation
Rights



        (a)     The Committee in its discretion may grant stock appreciation
rights to any Key Person on such terms and conditions as it shall, in its
discretion, deem advisable.



        (b)     A stock appreciation right shall entitle the holder to receive
the number of shares of Common Stock determined under Section (c) below, without
payment to the Corporation.  In lieu of issuing shares upon exercise of a stock
appreciation right, the Committee may elect to make a cash payment equal to the
fair market value on the exercise date of the shares determined under Section
(c) below, or make such payment partially in shares and partially in cash in
such proportions as the Committee determines.



        (c)     The number of shares to be issued upon the exercise of a stock
appreciation right shall be determined by dividing:



                (l)     the number of shares subject to or specified by the
stock appreciation right as of the exercise date multiplied by the amount by
which the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date
exceeds the exercise price specified by such stock appreciation right; by



                (2)     the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the
exercise date; provided, however, that the total number of shares that may be
received pursuant to any stock appreciation right issued in tandem with any
option shall not exceed the total number of shares subject to such option.



ARTICLE VI - Stock Awards



        (a)     The Committee in its discretion may grant stock awards to any
Key Person on such terms and conditions as it shall, in its discretion, deem
advisable, subject to the limitations set forth in Section (a) of Article III
and Section (b) of this Article VI.  A stock award may be denominated in shares
of Common Stock, units of Common Stock or stock-equivalent units, and may be
paid in Common Stock, in cash, or in a combination of Common Stock and cash.



        (b)     The issuance of restricted stock shall be pursuant to restricted
stock agreements approved by the Committee.  In each restricted stock agreement,
the participant shall agree to remain in the employment of the Corporation for a
specified period (which shall be at least one year from the date of the award),
at the pleasure of the Corporation, and at such compensation as the Corporation
shall determine from time to time.  In the event that a participant is
permanently separated from the Corporation for any reason other than death,
retirement, permanent disability, or other events specified by the Committee,
within the period of time stated in the restricted stock agreement, the
restricted stock shall be forfeited or shall be subject to repurchase at the
prices specified in such agreements unless, at the discretion of the Committee,
which discretion shall be exercised within 30 days after the separation, the
forfeiture or repurchase is waived by the Committee.

ARTICLE VII - Performance Awards



        The Committee may in its discretion make performance awards payable in
Common Stock, cash or a combination thereof on account of attainment of one or
more performance goals established by the Committee.  Performance goals
established by the Committee may be based on the Corporation's operating income
or one or more other business criteria selected by the Committee that apply to
an individual or group of individuals, a business unit or the Corporation as a
whole, over such performance period as the Committee may designate.  The
Committee in its discretion may recommend to the Board of Directors that the
material terms of any performance award or program with respect to some or all
Key Persons be submitted for approval by the shareholders.



ARTICLE VIII - Amendment and Discontinuance



        The Board of Directors may amend, modify or discontinue the Plan or
waive any of its provisions, except that no such amendment, modification, waiver
or discontinuance shall revoke or alter the terms of any valid Award previously
granted in accordance with the Plan without the consent of the holder of
the Award, except as permitted under Article IX below.  The Board of Directors
and the Committee may not take any action to increase or decrease the exercise
price of any outstanding options granted under Article IV, except as provided in
Section (c) of Article III.  To the extent required under Rule 16b-3
with respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and, with
respect to incentive stock options, to the extent required by the Code, no
action by the Board of Directors which materially modifies the Plan shall become
effective without the approval of the shareholders of the Corporation.



ARTICLE IX - Government Regulations



        The obligations of the Corporation to issue any Common Stock under this
Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and the
obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Committee.  The Board of Directors of the
Corporation may make such changes as may be necessary or appropriate to comply
with the rules and regulations of any governmental authority.



ARTICLE X - Payment of Exercise or Purchase Price



        (a)     The exercise or purchase price for any Award shall be payable
(i) in U.S. dollars in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to
the Corporation, (ii) in the discretion of the Committee, through the delivery
of Common Stock or other securities issued by the Corporation with a fair market
value on the date the Award is exercised or purchased equal to the total amount
due, or (iii) for any other lawful consideration as determined by the Committee.
A holder of an Award shall have none of the rights of a shareholder until the
shares of Common Stock covered by the Award are issued to him or her.



        (b)     The Committee may authorize the Corporation to grant loans or to
guarantee loans from a third party to holders of Awards in conjunction with such
Awards, upon such terms as the Committee deems appropriate.



ARTICLE XI - Transferability of Awards



        Awards under the Plan shall be nontransferable (including by pledge,
assignment or otherwise) other than (i) by will or law of descent and
distribution, and (ii) to the extent allowable under Rule 16b-3 with respect to
persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.



ARTICLE XII - Withholding Taxes



        Key Persons shall pay to the Corporation, or make provision satisfactory
to the Committee for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld in
respect of Awards under the Plan no later than the date of the event creating
the tax liability.  In the Committee's discretion, such tax obligations may be
paid in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, including shares retained
from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their fair market value on
the date of delivery.  The Corporation may, to the extent permitted by law,
deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to
the holder of an Award.



ARTICLE XIII - Applicable Law



        The validity, interpretation and administration of this Plan and any
rules, regulations, determinations or decisions made hereunder, and the rights
of any and all persons having or claiming to have any interest herein or
hereunder, shall be determined exclusively in accordance with the laws of the
State of Maryland, without regard to the choice of laws provisions
thereof, except to the extent federal law controls.



ARTICLE XIV - Effect on Prior Awards



        All awards made under the Plan prior to the effective date of this
amended and restated Plan shall continue in accordance with the terms of the
Plan prior to the effective date of such amendments, except that such awards
shall be treated as Awards under this amended and restated Plan for purposes of
Section (d) of Article III and any shares of Common Stock which become available
for regrant shall be added to the maximum number of shares issuable under the
Plan on or after April 1, 1994.


ARTICLE XV - No Employment Contract Implied



        Except as may otherwise be determined in writing by the Committee,
nothing in this Plan, any agreement executed in connection with this Plan or any
Award, or by virtue of a grant of an Award, shall be construed or deemed to
create or imply any contract of employment with any Key Person or create any
rights except as specifically provided in writing.


ARTICLE XVI - Effective Date and Termination of Plan



        The Plan as amended and restated herein shall be effective as of April
1, 1994, subject to approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast in person or by proxy, at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held on
May 4, 1994, or any adjournment thereof.  If the amended and restated Plan is
not approved by shareholders as contemplated herein, then the Plan, prior to
such amendment and restatement, shall continue in accordance with its terms.
The Plan will terminate on May 22, 2001, unless sooner terminated by the Board
of Directors.

        This Long-Term Incentive Program (the "Program") has been established by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") pursuant
to the USF&G Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 1991, as amended and restated
(the "Plan"), for the purpose of granting "Performance Awards" pursuant to
Article VII of the Plan.  Performance Awards granted under the Program are

or prior to the date that the Performance Goals are established.



        (c)     "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.



        (d)     "Cumulative Operating Income of the Corporation for the
Performance Period" means net income from continuing operations on a
consolidated basis for a designated Performance Period adjusted (i) to exclude
net realized gains or losses on investments, other than such gains or losses of
or impairment provisions for investments in (1) real estate, (2) Private
Placements and (3) consolidated subsidiaries or minority owned investments
accounted for using the equity method, in each case other than Excluded
Investments; (ii) to exclude federal income tax benefits arising from net
operating loss carryforwards or adjustments to the valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets if such tax benefits exceed what would otherwise be the
federal tax expense on income for such Performance Period; and (iii) to
substitute for the actual amount of catastrophe losses reported during such
Performance Period, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying three
(3) by the Adjusted Average CAT Loss.  The calculation described above shall be
determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") on a basis
consistent with the Corporation's audited financial statements for the fiscal
year ending on the day before the first day of such Performance Period.



        (e)     "Earned Performance Award" means an actual award of a specified
number of Stock Units which the Committee has determined have been earned and
are payable for a particular Performance Period.



        (f)     "Excluded Investments" means any investments included in
subclauses (1), (2) or (3) of clause (i) of Section (d) of this Article I which
the Committee designates to be excluded from the calculation of net realized
gains and losses for the indicated Performance Period, provided such designation
is made on or prior to the date that the Performance Goals for such
Performance Period are established.



        (g)     "Fundamental Corporate Transaction" means, and shall be deemed
to occur on, the date (i) of the first purchase of shares of the Common Stock of
the Corporation pursuant to a tender offer or an exchange offer (other than one
made by the Corporation or holding company for the Corporation) for all or
any part of the Corporation's Common Stock, (ii) of approval of the shareholders
of the Corporation of a merger, consolidation, sale, statutory or other share
exchange, or disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets
in which the Corporation (or holding company for the Corporation) will not
survive as a publicly-owned corporation operating the business it operated prior
to such transaction, or (iii) on which any entity, person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock (whether in one
or a series of transactions), directly or indirectly, amounting to 30% or more
of the outstanding shares of such class.  A "holding company for the
Corporation" means, in the foregoing sentence, an entity that becomes a holding
company for the Corporation without altering or planning to alter in any
material respect the shareholders of the Corporation or the business of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries as a whole, other than a case in which an
acquisition of another company by the Corporation or the holding company is
being accomplished concurrently.



        (h)     "Participant" shall mean Key Persons (as defined in the Plan)
selected by the Committee to participate in this Program for a stipulated
Performance Period.



        (i)     "Payment Deferral Election" shall mean a payment deferral
election of a Participant with respect to a Stock Unit.



        (j)     "Performance Goal" shall mean a specified target for Cumulative
Operating Income of the Corporation for a Performance Period, as specified by
the Committee.

        (k)     "Performance Period" shall mean a period of time covering three
(3) fiscal years of the Corporation, as specified by the Committee.



        (l)     "Permanent Disability" means the Participant's inability to
substantially perform the essential duties of his or her occupation in the usual
and customary way due to bodily injury, mental or psychological impairment, or
disease, which inability is reasonably expected to last not less than two (2)
years.  Determination of whether or not a Participant's condition constitutes
Permanent Disability as defined herein shall be in the sole discretion of the
Committee.



        (m)     "Private Placements" means the Corporation's investments in
Chancellor Capital Management, Inc. and in any other investment made on or after
January 1, 1994 in a class of securities the offering of which was not
registered at the time of such investment under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act") nor acquired pursuant to an offering under Rule 144 or
Rule 144A of the Securities Act, or were otherwise not publicly traded at the
time of issuance and were offered only to one or more qualified investors at the
time the investment was first made by the Corporation.  "Private Placements"
shall not include investments which are included under clauses (i)(1) or (i)(3)
of Section (d) of this Article I.



        (n)     "Pro Rata Basis" means a method of allocating Stock Units in the
event a Participant does not complete a full Performance Period but is
nevertheless eligible to receive Stock Units with respect to such Performance
Period.  In such event, the Participant shall be eligible for such number of
Stock Units as he or she would have received if such Participant had completed
such Performance Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of whole months in such Performance Period completed by such Participant,
and the denominator of which is 36.



        (o)     "Restricted Participant" means any Participant who is a "covered
person" under section 162(m) of the Code.  Determination of whether or not a
Participant is a Restricted Participant shall be made based upon the year any
Stock Units are to be actually paid under the Program, without regard to any
Payment Deferral Election.  A "Named Restricted Participant" is any Participant
who, in the Committee's judgment, could be a Restricted Participant.  The
determination of which Key Persons could be Restricted Participants is made
solely for purposes of ensuring that any compensation subsequently payable to
such Participant under the Program is not disqualified from deductibility from
gross income for federal income tax purposes under section 162(m) of the Code
and consequently shall be made liberally.



        (p)     "Stock Unit" shall mean a unit which represents one share
of Common Stock of the Corporation, par value of $2.50 per share, and which is
valued by reference to, and is otherwise based upon, one share of Common Stock.
Stock Units shall not represent an actual ownership interest in Common Stock and
the Participant shall have no voting or other rights as a shareholder in respect
of the Stock Units, or, except as specifically provided in Article V, any right
to payment on account of dividends or distributions in respect of the Common
Stock.



        (q)     "Stock Unit Account" shall mean a bookkeeping account
established by the Corporation for each Participant which may be credited with
Stock Units earned pursuant to one or more Earned Performance Awards and
deferred pursuant to a Payment Deferral Election.



        (r)     "Target Performance Award" shall mean a targeted award of a
specified number of Stock Units which may be earned and payable based upon the
Performance Goal for a particular Performance Period, all as determined by the
Committee.  The Target Performance Award shall be a factor in the Committee's
ultimate determination of the Earned Performance Award.



        (s)     "Unforeseeable Emergency" shall mean a severe financial hardship
to the Participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of
the Participant or a dependent (as defined in section 152(a) of the Code) of the
Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other
similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of
events beyond the control of the Participant.  The circumstances that will
constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency will depend upon the facts of each case,
but, in any case, an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exist to the extent that
such hardship is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation by
insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the
extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial
hardship, or (iii) by termination of further deferrals under this Program.
Unforeseeable Emergency does not include the need to send a Participant's child
to college or the desire to purchase a home.



ARTICLE II - Administration and Agreements with Participants



        (a)     Except to the extent provided herein with respect to the
Administrator, this Program shall be supervised and administered by the
Committee.  The Committee shall have all authority provided in the Plan to
operate and administer this Program and any and all determinations by the
Committee shall be final and conclusive.



        (b)     This Program and any Awards (as defined in the Plan)
granted hereunder shall be subject to such additional conditions, restrictions
and limitations, including any regarding vesting and forfeiture, as shall be
approved from time to time by the Committee or included in any agreements
regarding such Awards with the Participants.



ARTICLE III - Performance Awards



        (a)     As soon as reasonably practicable and with respect to each
Performance Period, the Committee shall determine (i) the Participants in the
Plan for such Performance Period, (ii) the Performance Goal to be used for the
Target Performance Award, (iii) the number of Stock Units subject to each Target
Performance Award, and (iv) any other material terms relating to the Target
Performance Award.



        (b)     Notwithstanding Section (a) of this Article III, the
determinations required above shall be made:  (i) prior to the first day of each
Performance Period or by such later date as may be permitted under regulations,
interpretations or guidance provided under section 162(m) of the Code, with
respect to Named Restricted Participants and (ii) at such other time as the
Committee deems appropriate with respect to any Participant who was not eligible
to participate in the Program at the time that Target Performance Awards were
made to other Participants, but who became eligible thereafter.  The Committee
shall at the time of the determinations made under clause (i) of this Section
(b), identify any Named Restricted Participants.



        (c)     Within 120 days after the end of each Performance Period, the
Committee will determine whether the Performance Goal was met.  The Committee
shall certify, in writing, that the Performance Goal and other material terms of
the Target Performance Award were in fact satisfied.  The Committee's
determination of all such matters shall be final and conclusive.



        (d)     At the same time as the Committee makes the certification
required by Section (c) of this Article III or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the Committee shall determine the Earned Performance Award for each
Participant.  Such determination may result in an increase or decrease in the
number of Stock Units payable based upon such Participant's Target Performance
Award, and shall be based upon such factors as the Committee shall determine in
its sole discretion, but including the Target Performance Award and the
performance of the Participant's unit and the Participant's individual
performance during the Performance Period.



        (e)     Stock Units earned by a Participant as determined by the
Committee shall be paid in an equal number of shares of Common Stock as soon as
practicable after the determination by the Committee required pursuant to
Section (d) of this Article, unless the Participant has properly executed and
delivered a Payment Deferral Election in accordance with Section (a) of
Article V.  If the Participant is then a person subject to Section 16(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and has not
made an effective Payment Deferral Election, and payment of any Stock Unit is
made within six (6) months of the Committee's certification referred to in
Section (d) of this Article with respect to such Stock Unit, then the
certificate for such shares shall be held by the Corporation for a period of six
(6) months from the date of the Committee's determination and delivered as soon
as practicable following the expiration of such six-month period.  During such
six-month period, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a shareholder
with respect to such Common Stock, except that such Common Stock shall not be
transferable by the Participant except as provided in Article XI of the Plan.
Payment of Stock Units is also subject to the mandatory Payment Deferral
Election provided for under Section (i) of Article V.



        (f)     In the event the Corporation shall during any Performance Period
make a material acquisition of assets or businesses which was not contemplated
at the time that the Committee established the Performance Goal for such
Performance Period, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to exclude
from the calculation of Cumulative Operating Income of the Corporation for the
Performance Period any income, gains, losses or other affects of or relating to
such acquired assets or businesses.  In the event the Corporation shall during
any Performance Period make a material disposition of assets or businesses which
relate to the Corporation's core insurance operations and which was not
contemplated at the time that the Committee established the Performance Goal for
such Performance Period, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to
adjust the Performance Goal for such Performance Period to take into account any
increase or decrease in operating income which may result from such disposition
of assets or businesses, offset by any gains or losses realized upon such
disposition.



        (g)     In the event of a Fundamental Corporate Transaction, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to terminate any Performance
Periods not then completed and make a payment of Stock Units on a Pro Rata
Basis.



        (h)     In the event of a Participant's death, Permanent Disability
or retirement under the Corporation's tax-qualified defined benefit plan, in
each case while the Participant is employed by the Corporation, the Committee
shall provide for payment of Stock Units with respect to any Performance Period
which began but was not completed at the time of such death, Permanent
Disability or retirement.  Such Stock Units shall be paid on a Pro Rata Basis at
the same time as Stock Units are paid to other Participants with respect to that
particular Performance Period.



        (i)     The Committee shall have the authority to make such further
changes to a Participant's Target Performance Award, the Performance Goal or
other matters as it deems appropriate, as the result of unforeseen events or
otherwise, in the manner and to the extent determined by the Committee in its
sole discretion.



        (j)     Notwithstanding any discretion permitted the Committee to
increase or decrease the number of Stock Units payable to a Participant upon the
completion of a Performance Period, adjust Target Performance Awards or the
Performance Goal, or with respect to other matters, the Committee's discretion
shall be limited as follows:  (i) no action may be taken hereunder which
would result in an Earned Performance Award larger than the Target Performance
Award granted to (x) any Named Restricted Participant or (y) any other
Participant if as a result of such action and the application of section 162(m)
of the Code, compensation deemed payable hereunder to such Participant with
respect to such Performance Period would become an expense to the Corporation
which would not be deductible from gross income for federal income tax purposes
(although any such action may be effective with respect to all other
Participants); (ii) the aggregate Earned Performance Awards awarded with respect
to a Performance Period shall not exceed the aggregate Target Performance Awards
to Participants who are eligible to receive Stock Units at the completion of the
Performance Period; and (iii) no single Participant shall be eligible to receive
more than  60,000 Stock Units with respect to a single Performance
Period.



ARTICLE IV - Tax Withholding



        The Corporation may withhold any applicable federal, state or local
taxes at such time and upon such terms and conditions as required by law or
determined by the Corporation.  Subject to compliance with any requirements of
applicable law, including requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the
Committee may permit or require a Participant to have any portion of any
withholding taxes payable in respect of a distribution of Common Stock satisfied
through the retention by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock having a fair
market value equal to the withholding amount.



ARTICLE V - Payment Deferral Election



        (a)     A Participant may defer receipt of Stock Units with respect
to all or any integral part of an Earned Performance Award by executing and
delivering to the Administrator a Payment Deferral Election.  Such Payment
Deferral Election: (i) must specify the date or dates on which payment of any
Stock Units earned with respect to a Performance Period shall be made (which
date shall not be less than six (6) months from the date payment would
otherwise have been made); (ii) must be submitted before the first day of the
second year of the Performance Period to which the deferral relates or on such
other date as may be specified in writing by the Committee; (iii) must be made
in writing on a form provided by the Administrator; and (iv) is subject to such
other conditions, restrictions or limitations as may be specified from time to
time by the Administrator or the Committee.



        (b)     In the event a Participant makes a Payment Deferral Election,
the Administrator shall establish and maintain a Stock Unit Account with respect
to such Participant.  At the time that an Earned Performance Award would
otherwise be paid in shares of Common Stock as provided in Section (e) of
Article III, the number of Stock Units earned under such Earned Performance
Award and deferred pursuant to a Payment Deferral Election shall be credited to
the Participant's Stock Unit Account and paid on the payment date specified by
such Payment Deferral Election.


        (c)     As and when any cash dividends are paid in respect of the
Common Stock, each Participant who has made a Payment Deferral Election shall be
entitled to receive, with respect to all Stock Units credited to his or her
Stock Unit Account, a cash payment in an amount equal to the dividend which
would have been paid to the Participant if such Stock Units actually had
represented shares of Common Stock.  The right to this cash dividend-equivalent
payment shall apply to cash dividends paid on account of any record date during
which the Stock Unit is credited to the Participant's Stock Unit Account, and
shall be paid directly to the Participant.



        (d)     Appropriate adjustment shall be made to the number of Stock
Units in any Stock Unit Account in the event of changes in the Common Stock of
the Corporation by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalization,
mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, to
the extent contemplated by and in accordance with Section (c) of Article
III of the Plan.



        (e)     In the event of any other distribution of property to holders of
the Common Stock not covered by Sections (c) and (d) of this Article V, then the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for a fair market value
equivalent payment directly to Participants on account of Stock Units credited
to such Participant's Stock Unit Account on the record date for such
distribution.  Any such distribution shall be at such time, in such amount and
in such form (including cash, securities or other property) as the Committee
shall determine.



        (f)     Except as provided in Section (i) of this Article V, a Payment
Deferral Election shall cease to be effective and all Stock Units credited to a
Participant's Stock Unit Account shall become immediately due and payable in the
event of a Participant's death or Permanent Disability, or in the event the
Committee exercises its discretion under Section (g) of Article III, in the
event of a Fundamental Corporate Transaction.  The Committee may, upon a
determination of Unforeseeable Emergency by the Committee, in its sole
discretion, permit a Participant to withdraw all or a portion of the Stock Units
credited to his or her Stock Unit Account.



        (g)     Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate
a person or trust as beneficiary or beneficiaries (both primary and contingent)
to whom payments of Stock Units credited to his or her Stock Unit Account shall
be made if the Participant dies before all such Stock Units have been
distributed.  Any beneficiary(ies) designation shall be made in writing on a
form prescribed by the Committee and filed with the Administrator, shall become
effective only when received and accepted by the Administrator and may be
changed by filing a new designation with the Administrator on a prescribed form.
The filing of a new beneficiary designation will cancel all beneficiary
designations previously filed.



        (h)     If a Participant who has Stock Units credited to his or her
Stock Unit Account  fails to designate a beneficiary as provided above, or if
all designated beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then payment of any
Stock Units shall be made to the Participant's personal representative, executor
or administrator.



        (i)     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article V and
unless specifically determined otherwise by the Committee,  if at the time of
any payment of Stock Units to a Participant under this Program (including if the
time of such payment is determined as a result of a Payment Deferral Election)
any compensation deemed payable hereunder would be an expense to the Corporation
which would not be deductible from gross income for federal income tax purposes
as a result of the application of section 162(m) of the Code, then such
Participant shall automatically be deemed to have elected a Payment Deferral
Election with respect to any portion of such payment which would be non-
deductible, and such Payment Deferral Election shall continue from year to year
with respect to any such non-deductible payments.  In such event the Participant
shall be entitled to all rights he or she would have had if a Payment
Deferral Election had been made.


ARTICLE VI - Nontransferability



        A person's rights and interests under the Program prior to the delivery
of certificates for Common Stock in full payment of all Stock Units shall be
solely the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Corporation and such
rights may not be assigned, pledged, or transferred in any manner except, in the
event of a Participant's death, to his designated beneficiary as provided
herein with respect to Stock Units credited in a Stock Unit Account, or, by will
or the laws of descent and distribution.  Stock certificates shall only be
delivered to the Participants or beneficiaries entitled to receive them or to
their authorized legal representatives.



ARTICLE VII - Modification and Waiver



        The Board of Directors may amend, modify or discontinue the Program or
waive any of its provisions, except that no such amendment, modification, waiver
or discontinuance shall revoke or alter the terms of any valid Earned
Performance Award or Stock Unit previously granted in accordance with the
Program without the consent of the holder thereof, except as permitted under
Article III or Article VIII below.  To the extent required under Rule 16b-3 with
respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and to the extent
required by section 162(m) of the Code with respect to Restricted Participants,
no action by the Board of Directors which materially modifies the Plan shall
become effective without the approval of the shareholders of the Corporation.



ARTICLE VIII - Government Regulations



        The obligations of the Corporation to issue any Stock Units or Common
Stock under the Program shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and
regulations and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as
may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.  The Board of Directors
of the Corporation may make such changes as may be necessary or appropriate to
comply with the rules and regulations of any governmental authority.



ARTICLE IX - Plan Governs



        In the event of any conflict between the Program and the Plan,
the terms of the Plan shall govern.

(A)  Shares issuable under stock options (691,776 shares in 1994, 1,301,361
shares in 1993, 613,974 shares in 1992) have not been used as common stock
equivalents in the computation of primary earnings per common share presented on
the face of the Consolidated Statement of Operations because the dilutive effect
is not material.
(B)  Fully diluted earnings per common share amounts are calculated assuming the
conversion of all securities whose contingent issuance would have a dilutive
effect on earnings.  The effect of assuming conversion of the preferred stock
(30,959,211 shares in 1992) is antidilutive and, therefore, the amounts

Chairman's Letter

Introduction
We entered 1994, the initial year of our "build with vision" phase of
development, after establishing a viable business platform during three
arduous years of restructuring our company. In 1994 we continued to achieve
strong earnings growth and improved returns. We further strengthened our
balance sheet, refined corporate and business segment strategies, and
implemented a broad array of new product, market, and technology
development initiatives.

1994 Performance
Consolidated
Net income in 1994 was $232 million, compared with $165 million in 1993.
On an earnings per share basis, we earned $2.14/share in 1994, which
compares favorably with $1.38/share in 1993. The primary drivers of this
improvement were growth in consolidated operating income and recognition
of income tax benefits. Consolidated operating income in 1994 was $130
million, representing a 35 percent growth over $96 million in 1993. USF&G
defines operating income as income from continuing operations before
realized gains and losses, facilities exit costs, the cumulative effect
of accounting changes, and certain income tax benefits. This performance
resulted from the continued improvement in property/casualty underwriting
results combined with life insurance profits. Consolidated revenues and
controllable expenses remained essentially flat compared with 1993. The
property/casualty ("P/C") company earned $194 million in operating income
in 1994 and reported a 108.4 combined ratio, outperforming the estimated
industry average (including policyholder dividends) of 109.4 and
our 1993 combined ratio, also 109.4. F&G Life returned to profitability,
earning $12 million in operating income after three consecutive years of
operating losses.

Property/Casualty Company
Our P/C company is pursuing a hybrid "regional/specialist" strategy.
The "regional" aspect of this strategy requires each of our 30
entrepreneurially managed branch operations to develop and execute a
winning game plan for its respective markets. The product/market scope of
each branch is dictated by its own discrete strategy. Specific agency
management and market development plans are established by setting
priorities and determining the required level of product and service support.
In particular, personal lines and small business commercial lines are
pursuing highly focused regional strategies driven by branches focused on
penetrating high-density markets to achieve scale and leverage distribution
costs.

The "specialist" aspect of this strategy involves our middle market
commercial lines and our specialty businesses. In the first case, we
have developed a broad array of customized market capabilities
to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. The resulting products
are designed to penetrate targeted industry sub-segments. In 1994, middle
market businesses grew direct written premium by 10 percent, while
maintaining strong underwriting and price discipline and

<PAGE> 4
realizing a 12 point improvement in renewal retentions. As a result of this
market strategy, a shift toward more profitable product lines, and improved risk
management, middle market underwriting performance has continued to improve,
with its calendar year loss ratio lowered six points to 78.7 percent.

Our specialty businesses, Fidelity/Surety and F&G Re (reinsurance), achieved
net written premium growth in their most profitable lines and impressive
underwriting profits. Each business is pursuing market extension strategies.
Fidelity/Surety ("F/S") grew its net written premium by 11 percent as a
result of improved marketing effectiveness both domestically and
internationally. It expanded its market scope by establishing a Canadian
subsidiary (Northern Indemnity), a strategic alliance in Mexico, and
increased capability to serve international clients doing business in
North America. F/S reported a 90.9 percent combined ratio.

F&G Re grew written premium in its most profitable product line, traditional
risk, by 52 percent. Much of this growth is a result of the establishment in
1993 of a London liaison office which has improved our ability to compete in
the international market. F&G Re's other product line, finite risk, suffered
a decline in growth because the imposition of new regulatory guidelines
(SFAS 113) resulted in less demand for this product. We anticipate, however,
regaining sales momentum for this line as a result of new product development
efforts. F&G Re achieved a 90.6 percent combined ratio.

In summary, our middle market commercial lines and specialty businesses made
significant progress in achieving growth and improving profitability.
Personal lines and small business commercial lines experienced a decline in
net written premium as each business underwent market repositioning and
efforts to improve cost competitiveness.

Life Company
In 1994, F&G Life returned to profitability as a result of the fundamental
restructuring of this business in 1992. We significantly reduced structural
costs, substantially improved the overall quality of management and the skill
base, and embarked upon a comprehensive upgrade of information systems,
migrating to a more advanced platform. In addition, we completely redesigned
and expanded the entire product line to improve competitiveness and margins
while establishing new channels of distribution. The culmination of all these
efforts is reflected in our 1994 performance. New business grew 40 percent
on the strength of new higher-margin products sold through the new
distribution channels. Product spreads have improved as a result of the
steady run-off of unprofitable mature books of business and more effective
asset/liability management. The overall investment portfolio also improved
as a result of a reduction in nonperforming or under-performing assets.
Looking forward, I anticipate sustained earnings growth from F&G Life.


Industry Overview
Balance sheet quality is becoming increasingly more important as the

USF&G's number one core value is "customer first."  Fair and prompt claim
settlement allows us to demonstrate this.  Gil operates out of the Denver area
and is one of seven general adjusters strategically placed throughout the
country to settle our customers' largest, most complex claims.  Having highly
recognized specialists like Gil enables USF&G to attract and retain substantial
accounts.

<PAGE> 5
confluence of market and regulatory forces is placing significant strain on
the financial strength of P/C insurance companies. Since 1992, P/C companies
have incurred unprecedented high levels of catastrophic losses which have
depleted surplus. Compounding this pressure has been the growing recognition
of the industry's need to strengthen overall reserves for environmental and
asbestos liabilities. It has been estimated that the industry reserves are
inadequate by amounts ranging from $60 billion to $90 billion. Concomitant
with the reserve questions has been the issuance of two regulations, Risk
Based Capital ("RBC") and SFAS 115, that place further strain on the balance
sheet and earnings power of insurance companies.

These market and regulatory forces are defining relative balance sheet
quality as a competitive benchmark. Since 1991 USF&G has been steadily
improving the quality of its balance sheet without compromising its strong
reserve position. In addition, our surplus is well above RBC standards,
providing confidence in our capacity to write new business and withstand
unforeseen adversity.

Corporate Strategy
An important strategy consideration as we build with vision is the outlook
for our major business segments' earnings growth and return characteristics.
Our accountability to you as a shareowner is to establish complementary
sources of earnings and a predictable and attractive earnings stream. USF&G
has four major sources of earnings with distinctive growth and return
characteristics.

The P/C company possesses three major sources of earnings: high frequency/
low severity business lines (i.e., personal and small business commercial
lines), middle market commercial lines, and specialty businesses. The high
frequency/low severity businesses experience high volumes of transactions
with limited levels of individual policy exposures. These businesses are
commodity prone with increasing price sensitivity. They require intense
management focus to gain cost competitiveness and economies of scale. If
competitively managed, these businesses should contribute high
earnings growth and moderate returns.

Our middle market commercial lines compete in a market that is constantly
redefined in terms of price/value differentiation. Regional and national multi-
line carriers converge to compete in this segment. USF&G's refined
market segmentation allows for development of customized product packages
that achieve competitive value differentiation by targeting specific industry
markets. This earnings source contributes a moderate rate of growth and
higher returns than the high frequency/low severity businesses.

The third source of P/C earnings are the specialty lines of business. F&G Re,
Fidelity/Surety, and certain commercial product lines (i.e., inland marine
and excess property) currently comprise USF&G's specialty businesses. These
businesses, which underwrite very specialized risks, compete based upon
financial strength and expertise of their skilled professionals.
Characteristically, these

Improved Service Award" from the Independent Insurance Agents of America in New
Jersey.

<PAGE> 6
businesses contribute a more volatile and less predictable source of earnings
growth, but at higher rates of return.

F&G Life provides a growing and more predictable source of earnings which
should realize operating leverage as it continues to grow. Historically,
F&G Life's profitability has been compromised by the quality of its
investment portfolio and narrow spreads. Prospectively, growth and returns
should improve as a result of the successful development and marketing of
higher margin products through newly established channels of distribution.
Better asset/liability management should improve spreads as well.

1995 Outlook
Company-wide
I anticipate consolidated operating income to continue to grow and related
returns to improve, despite a significant incremental investment in
developing our information systems. Consolidated revenues should grow
modestly, while controllable expenses will be managed consistently with
revenue growth. The company's overall earnings power should be enhanced in
future years by the successful completion of two pending acquisitions,
Victoria Financial Corporation and Discover Re Managers, Inc.


Acquisitions
Both pending acquisitions (Victoria Financial and Discover Re), should
financially and strategically enhance our future performance. Each has
met our rigorous evaluation criteria: is nondilutive on an operating earnings
per share basis, grows at a faster rate than the industry and earns a 15
percent ROE or greater, makes an underwriting profit, provides operating
synergies, possesses strong management and skill base, represents superior
"buy" versus "make" economics, and is culturally compatible. Victoria
Financial participates in the nonstandard personal auto market. It has grown
successfully since its inception in 1986 and consistently had a combined
ratio under 100 percent. It has strong management, systems, and skill base.
The integration of a nonstandard auto product line into our existing
operations will provide our agents a single market for both standard and
nonstandard auto, and allow the leveraging of distribution costs to help
drive down our expense ratio. It additionally will protect our existing book
of business from intrusion by other nonstandard auto product providers
attempting to penetrate the standard auto insurance market.

Discover Re participates in the alternative risk transfer ("ART") market, one
of the fastest growing segments of the commercial insurance market. The ART
market serves the self-insurance market which has been steadily displacing
the traditional risk transfer market over the last couple of decades.
Discover Re accesses the self-insured market through agents and brokers. It
structures reinsurance facilities and intermediates the distribution of risk.
It offers consulting services, participates in the reinsurance facility at
the layer just above the primary risk taken by the client, and provides
administrative

innovative approach to migrating away from our current mainframe environment.

oversight for third-party risk management services. It has
grown significantly since its founding four years ago and reported an
underwriting profit in 1994. Discover Re also represents a new market for our
excess property and workers' compensation product lines.

As the P/C industry continues to undergo a shake-out and further
consolidation, we stand ready to benefit from this market instability. In
1994, we considerably strengthened the management and technical skill base of
our branch operations. Also, we expanded our market coverage by adding five
satellite underwriting offices and improved our overall agency sales
management practices.

High Frequency/Low Severity Businesses
The high frequency/low severity businesses (i.e., personal and small business
commercial lines) will continue to penetrate targeted regional markets,
introduce new products, and improve cost effectiveness through reengineering
and automation.

Personal lines will continue to roll-out its new agency interface system and
penetrate attractive high density/regional markets. It will also integrate
Victoria Financial's nonstandard auto line into our existing distribution
channels, further strengthening the franchise with our agents.

Small business commercial lines will continue to focus on penetrating
targeted regional markets. In addition, we will be introducing a completely
reengineered product and supporting systems capability. This is part of our
long-term reengineering and automation efforts to improve cost effectiveness.

Middle Market Commercial Lines Business
Middle market commercial lines will benefit from the considerable increase
of skilled loss control engineers and underwriting specialists placed in
field operations last year. In addition, we expect to benefit from the
introduction of five major customized product packages in 1994 targeted at
the construction, manufacturing, and services market segments. We plan to
introduce additional products this year to fill out our broad array of highly
competitive products.

Speciality Businesses
The specialty businesses portfolio will be further expanded with the
inclusion of Discover Re, as well as the planned startup of an excess and
specialty risk company. These new businesses, along with Fidelity/Surety and
F&G Re, represent a formidable assembly of high growth/high return
businesses. We expect to continue to build this major business segment
through selective acquisitions and internal business ventures.

Fidelity/Surety, after achieving impressive growth in 1994, is expected to
continue to grow. We will emphasize Fidelity/Surety's underwriting
profitability while broadening its international market presence.

We expect F&G Re to continue growing premium by improving our international

<PAGE> 8
marketing effectiveness and enhancing our finite risk product.

Prospectively, our strategy is to expand our portfolio of specialty
businesses and invest in marketing and cost/service quality effectiveness of
our high frequency/low severity businesses. We additionally plan to improve
the competitiveness of our value-added approach to the commercial lines
middle market.

F&G Life
F&G Life's new business growth and profitability should be further enhanced
by its entry into the "Senior" market. It has developed new product
capabilities in this area and has recently established a new strategic
alliance with a major regional broker to penetrate this market. In addition,
continued improvement in the quality of its investment portfolio and product
spreads should be realized.

Reengineering/Systems Initiatives
Despite much effort over the last several years to improve our cost
competitiveness, much progress still needs to be made. We need to redesign
our business processes to achieve competitive cost parity. To accomplish
this, we formed a senior management task force to reengineer our business
processes over the next several years. To facilitate this effort, we are
migrating our current mainframe systems to a client server system. The impact
of these efforts should begin to materialize in 1996, with the full benefit
of efficiency and cost effectiveness being realized in 1997-1998 and beyond.

Conclusion
Our resolve to maximize earnings in order to increase shareholder value is
firm. In 1994 we entered the "build with vision" phase. We developed new
products and business lines. We broadened and enhanced the earnings power of
our company. We also recognized the critical need to become more cost
competitive and embarked on a major effort to accomplish this. In 1995 we
should benefit from our company's enhanced competitiveness and ability to
capitalize upon market instability. Looking forward, I anticipate continued
improvement in earnings quality and growth.

Throughout this letter you have seen outstanding USF&G professionals who are
making a difference in the successful building of our company. They represent
the creative energy and dedication of our people to be the best. On behalf of
all of the people of USF&G, I wish to express our appreciation for the
confidence you have placed in us. We will continue to build a superior
company worthy of your investment.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting

Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the financial
statements and other information presented in this annual
report. The financial statements are prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Informed judgments and
estimates are used to measure transactions not concluded by
year-end.

Internal Controls
Management is also responsible for the system
of internal control. The system of internal control encompasses
the organizational structure, selection and training of
personnel, communication and enforcement of policies and
procedures, and an ongoing internal audit program.  The internal
controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
financial records are reliable for preparing financial
statements, that transactions are completed as authorized, and
that assets are safeguarded. Management and USF&G's internal
auditors regularly review these controls and assess their
adequacy and effectiveness.

Audit Committee
The Board of Directors maintains an audit
committee of directors who are not employees of USF&G. The
committee meets regularly with management, internal auditors,
and independent auditors to review internal control and
financial reporting matters. Both the internal and independent
auditors have full and free access to the audit committee.

Independent Auditors
USF&G engages Ernst & Young LLP to conduct
independent audits of the financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted  auditing standards. Their audits
include reviews and tests of internal controls, transactions,
and other information they consider necessary  to express an
opinion on the financial statements.

"USF&G" or "the Corporation") and discusses the results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1994. The analysis
focuses on the performance of USF&G's business segments and its
investment portfolio.

 Net income                               $ 232   $ 165   $  28

The table below shows the components by major business segment
of income (loss) from continuing operations before realized
gains, facilities exit costs, income taxes and cumulative effect
of adopting new accounting standards.

(in millions)                              1994    1993    1992
Property/casualty insurance                $194    $182   $  (3)
Life insurance                               14      (6)     (4)
Parent and noninsurance                     (79)    (83)   (106)
Income (loss) from continuing
 operations before realized gains,
 facilities exit costs, income taxes
 and cumulative effect of adopting
 new accounting standards                  $129    $ 93   $(113)

Property/casualty insurance segment income (loss) from
continuing operations before realized gains, facilities exit
costs, income taxes and cumulative effect of adopting new
accounting standards increased $12 million from 1993 to 1994 due
to improved underwriting  results. The life insurance segment's
$20 million improvement from 1993 to 1994 was due to the
combined effects of higher product sales and improved spreads on
annuity products. The major factors influencing the improvement
in the parent and noninsurance  segment for 1994 are the
improved results from noninsurance subsidiaries and reduced
interest expense partially offset by a loss on long-term
subleases.

Other items affecting net income include a $183 million charge
related to the planned consolidation of the Corporation's
Baltimore headquarters facilities (refer to Section 1.2 of this
Analysis). Also included in net income is a $281 million income
tax benefit  primarily related to the recognition of deferred
tax assets (refer to Section 9 of this Analysis).

The $137 million improvement in net income from 1992 to 1993 was
driven by a $200 million improvement in property/casualty
underwriting results. The 1992 net income included $51 million
in restructuring charges related to branch office consolidation
which has been completed.

1.2. Facilities exit costs
As a result of USF&G's restructuring activities in the early
1990s and ongoing efforts to improve the overall cost effectiveness
of the Corporation, USF&G's available headquarters office space
significantly exceeds it needs, particularly at the 40-story office
building ("the Tower") in downtown Baltimore. USF&G sold the Tower
in 1984 and subsequently leased it back. Since 1991, the  total headquarters
staff has decreased by approximately 28 percent, including a 48
percent decrease in the number of employees who are located at
the Tower. During 1994, USF&G developed and committed to a plan
to consolidate its Baltimore headquarters facilities. The plan
encompasses relocating all USF&G personnel currently residing at
the Tower to the Mount Washington facilities in Baltimore which
USF&G owns. Implementation of the plan began in January 1995.
The relocation of Tower personnel will begin in mid-1995 and is
expected to be completed by the end of 1996. The lease on the
Tower, which expires in September 2009, will not be terminated.
Approximately 30 percent of the Tower is currently sublet and
USF&G intends to sublet the remaining space as it is vacated.

The facilities exit costs of $183 million recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1994 represent the present value of the rent and
other operating expenses incurred under the Tower lease from the
time USF&G vacates the Tower through the expiration of the lease
in 2009. Approximately $28 million of unamortized deferred gain
arising from the 1984 sale-leaseback was also recognized upon
adoption of the facilities exit plan. Potential future sublease
income was not considered in calculating the facilities exit
costs. To the extent that additional or extended subleases are
signed in the future, the present value of income to be received
over the term of such a sublease will be recognized in the
period the sublease is signed.

2. Property/Casualty Insurance Operations
Property/casualty insurance operations, the principal business
segment, accounted for 84 percent of USF&G's revenues in 1994,
compared with 85 percent and 88 percent in 1993 and 1992, respectively,
and 67 percent of its assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993, compared
with 63 percent at December 31, 1992. Financial results for this
segment are as follows:

(in millions)                          1994     1993     1992
Premiums earned*                    $ 2,283  $ 2,327  $ 2,533
Losses and loss expenses             (1,691)  (1,758)  (2,088)
Underwriting expenses                  (792)    (796)    (872)
Net underwriting losses                (200)    (227)    (427)
Net investment income                   423      433      475
Restructuring charges                     -        -      (46)
Other revenues and (expenses), net      (29)     (24)      (5)
Income (loss) from continuing
 operations before realized gains,
 facilities exit costs,income taxes
 and cumulative effect of adopting
 new accounting standards           $   194  $   182  $    (3)
*See Glossary of Terms

Improved underwriting results were the primary
reason for the increase in property/casualty income in 1994 when
compared with 1993 and 1992 (refer to Section 2.2 of this
Analysis). The decrease  in net investment income is
attributable to an investment base which declined in order to
meet cash flow needs (refer to Section 5.1 of  this Analysis).
The 1993 fluctuation in other revenues and expenses primarily
reflects the decision to eliminate certain policyholders'
dividends in 1992 and the reversal in that year of previously
accrued but unpaid dividends. Restructuring charges relating to
branch office consolidations also affected results in 1992.

2.1. Premiums earned
Premiums earned totaled $2.3 billion in 1994 and 1993,
compared with $2.5 billion in 1992. The table below shows
the major components of premiums earned and premiums written.

Direct voluntary premiums written increased two percent in 1994
in response to management's strategies to grow business in
targeted  market segments. These growth strategies follow
planned actions  to exit unprofitable markets and product lines
in 1993 which had reduced premium production by nine percent in
that year. The increase in ceded reinsurance is primarily the
result of risk management as part of USF&G's strategy to enter
the excess property  market in commercial lines. Additionally,
USF&G ceded $5 million of catastrophe reinsurance premiums under
an assessment by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund which
was established in response to 1992's Hurricane Andrew. Premiums
from involuntary pools and associations decreased 47 percent in
1994, after a 10 percent decrease in 1993, as USF&G continued to
reduce exposure in these unprofitable markets. Other premium
adjustments relate primarily to changes in earned but not
reported premiums and unbilled installment premiums. Traditional
risk assumed reinsurance premiums increased substantially in
1994 as USF&G expanded into international reinsurance markets,
while the demand for finite risk reinsurance has decreased as a
result of the new accounting requirements of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 113 and Emerging
Issues Task Force ("EITF") 93-6 which were issued in 1993.

The table below shows net premiums earned and the statutory loss
ratios by lines of property/casualty insurance including results
from voluntary and involuntary pools and associations. The table
illustrates the changes in premium mix from 1992 to 1994.
Management's focus on reducing exposure to less profitable lines
of insurance has been a key factor in the improved underwriting
results. The most dramatic examples are the workers'
compensation line and assumed reinsurance. Workers' compensation
has a cumulative three-year  statutory loss ratio of 143.8 and
represented 13 percent of total  property/casualty premiums
earned in 1992 but only 5 percent in 1994. Assumed reinsurance
premiums increased from 6 percent of total premiums earned in
1992 to 17 percent in 1994, with a  cumulative three-year
statutory loss ratio of 69.9 as of  December 31, 1994.

In 1995, management will continue to develop strategies to
achieve a more profitable mix of business by further penetrating
target markets, implementing new products and services, and
enhancing underwriting and customer service structures through
improved technology and performance.

2.2. Underwriting results
Underwriting results represent premiums earned less incurred losses,
loss expenses and underwriting expenses. It is not unusual for
property/casualty insurance companies to have underwriting losses
that are offset by investment income.

Underwriting gains (losses) by major business category are as
follows:

(in millions)                             1994      1993      1992

Consolidated property/casualty underwriting ratios, calculated
based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and
statutory accounting practices, are as follows:

                                          1994      1993      1992
GAAP Underwriting Ratios:
 Loss ratio                               74.0      75.6      82.4
 Expense ratio*                           34.7      34.2      34.4
 Combined ratio                          108.7     109.8     116.8
Statutory Underwriting Ratios:
 Loss ratio                               73.1      75.4      82.0
 Expense ratio                            35.0      33.7      34.9
 Combined ratio                          108.1     109.1     116.9
*See Glossary of Terms
Statutory underwriting ratios exclude the effects of
policyholder dividends which, if included, would increase the
ratios by 0.3 each year.

Underwriting results improved $27 million from 1993 to 1994 and
$200 million from 1992 to 1993. The improvements generally
resulted from management's actions to improve product/market
mix, apply stricter underwriting standards, and improve claims
practices, as well as from lower incurred catastrophe losses in
1994 and 1993 when compared to 1992 (refer to Section 2.4 of
this Analysis). The rate of improvement in 1994 was not as
dramatic as that seen in 1993 since net catastrophe losses were
relatively consistent from 1993 to 1994 after decreasing $72
million from 1992 to 1993. Additionally, significant weather
related losses not designated as catastrophe losses had an
adverse effect on 1994 results, particularly in personal lines.
The statutory loss ratio has improved 8.9 points overall since
1992, and 6.7 points in that same period when catastrophe losses
are excluded. The overall improvement of $16 million in
involuntary underwriting results since 1992 reflects
management's actions to reduce exposure to involuntary business
in states with substantial involuntary market burdens. The major
impact of these actions was felt in 1992 when involuntary
underwriting results improved more than $100 million when
compared to previous years. While management will remain focused
on controlling involuntary underwriting losses, the degree of
improvement is expected to be less than that realized in
previous years. The increase in involuntary underwriting losses
in 1993 over 1992 was primarily due to an assessment of loss
reserves from involuntary workers' compensation insurance pools.

Improved premium mix and reduced costs have been the main
reason for the improved underwriting results since 1990, despite
continuing competitive pressures. Management intends to monitor
the premium mix and costs and implement other strategies with
the goal of continuing the improvement in underwriting results,
although such improvements cannot be assured. These strategies
include the introduction of specialty products, continued
penetration of targeted industries and market segments, further
development  of underwriting expertise, reduced catastrophe
exposure and  investments in technological advancements.
Management will also continue to focus on improving product
pricing, although intense competitive pressures in the
property/casualty insurance industry, especially in the pricing
of commercial lines products, is expected  to continue to
restrict underwriting results.

Commercial Lines
Commercial lines products include property,
auto, inland marine, workers' compensation, and general and
umbrella liability coverage for businesses. The commercial lines
business has two distinct market segments--middle market and
small business. USF&G has further defined the middle market into
three strategic business units in an effort to better service
customers and improve profitability:  service businesses,
contractors, and manufacturers.

The following table shows the components of underwriting
results for commercial lines:

GAAP and statutory underwriting ratios are as follows:

                                          1994      1993      1992

Commercial lines branch office voluntary direct premiums written
increased 4 percent in 1994, compared with decreases of 11
percent and 20 percent in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
increase is  primarily the result of new business growth in
targeted market  segments. Although net premiums written in the
commercial lines business have declined, the largest components
of the decline have been the reduced participation in voluntary
pools and the decrease in involuntary premium, both of which
have benefited net underwriting results. The involuntary
business losses were $31 million less in 1994 than in 1993,
after increasing $9 million from 1992 to 1993. The improved
involuntary results arose primarily from management actions to
reduce workers' compensation premiums which led to reduced
participation in the involuntary workers' compensation pools.

Underwriting results in the commercial lines category improved
$37 million over 1993 and $120 million from 1992 to 1993. This
improvement is primarily the result of the change in the mix of
business and the application of stricter underwriting standards,
as well as lower catastrophe losses in 1994 and 1993.

In commercial lines, the mix of the least profitable line of
business, workers' compensation, with a 1994 statutory loss
ratio of 121.0,  has decreased from 21 percent of commercial
lines premiums  earned in 1992 to 11 percent in 1994, while the
mix of the two  most profitable lines of business, auto and core
property, has increased. Commercial auto, with a statutory loss
ratio of 58.8 in 1994, increased from 30 percent of commercial
lines premiums earned in 1992 to 32 percent in 1994. USF&G's
core commercial property business consists of fire/allied and
inland marine products, which had a statutory loss ratio of 62.1
in 1994. Premiums from these product lines increased from 15
percent of commercial lines premiums earned in 1992 to 19
percent in 1994.

The statutory loss ratio for commercial lines improved 4.9
points  in 1994 from 1993 and 8.8 points in 1994 from 1992.
Management believes the improved loss ratio trend is evidence of
the positive effects of the strategies implemented to improve
underwriting results. Also contributing to the improvement over
1992 is the reduction  in catastrophe losses (refer to Section
2.4 of this Analysis). Losses incurred from Hurricane Andrew
represented approximately 1.6 points of the 1992 commercial
lines statutory loss ratio.

In January 1995, USF&G entered into a definitive agreement to
purchase all of the outstanding equity of Discover Re Managers,
Inc. ("Discover Re"). The transaction is expected to close in
the second quarter of 1995. Discover Re provides insurance,
reinsurance and related services to the alternative risk
transfer ("ART") market,  primarily in the municipalities,
transportation, education and retail sectors. The ART market
represents approximately 30 percent of the commercial insurance
market. This acquisition facilitates USF&G's access to the ART
market and, management believes, provides increased growth
potential by augmenting certain of the existing core commercial
lines insurance operations.

Fidelity/Surety
The fidelity/surety segment provides contract
and non-contract surety bonds to construction companies,
commercial businesses  and individuals; financial institution
bonds to banks, stockbrokers and credit unions; and fidelity
bonds to commercial businesses and governmental entities.

The following table shows the components of underwriting results
for fidelity/surety:

Fidelity/surety experienced an improvement in underwriting
results in 1994 due to increased premiums and decreased losses.
The regionalization of USF&G's surety business in 1993 led to
further penetration of existing contract surety markets in 1994,
while new products and further expansion into financial
institutions markets resulted in premium growth in the fidelity
lines. Losses decreased in 1994 after a $23 million increase in
1993 which was primarily a result of unfavorable loss
developments on a limited number of prior years' claims.

Personal Lines
Personal lines products include auto, homeowners, watercraft
and personal excess insurance for individuals and families.

The following table shows the components of underwriting results

Branch office voluntary premium has declined only 4 percent in
1994, after declining 10 percent in 1993. In 1994, the net
premium decrease resulted from management's plans to improve the
agency force and exit certain involuntary markets, and from
increased ceded reinsurance. The net premium decreases in 1993
were a result of planned management actions to exit certain
unprofitable markets  and to reduce writings in high risk
catastrophe areas.

The increased underwriting loss in 1994 is primarily due to
increased losses from the homeowners line of business which was
adversely affected in 1994 by significantly higher than normal
first quarter weather related losses not designated as
catastrophe losses. Winter storms and the Northridge earthquake
in the first quarter of 1994 produced most of the $32 million in
catastrophe losses for the  personal lines business, primarily
in homeowners. Exclusive of these catastrophe losses, the
homeowners statutory loss ratio was 84.2 in 1994, compared with
107.3 when catastrophe losses are included. Although the
personal lines statutory loss ratio increased 3.5 points in
1994, almost half of that increase is the result of catastrophe
losses. The personal lines statutory loss ratio improved 9.3
points from 1992 to 1993 (a 3.5 point improvement excluding
Hurricane Andrew in 1992).

Management's strategies to reduce exposure in unprofitable
markets and lines of business, including reunderwriting the auto
book of business, applying stricter underwriting standards,
reducing exposure in certain high risk catastrophe areas and
introducing new products, have improved the underwriting results
and statutory loss ratios  of the auto and other personal lines
of business since 1992. These strategies are currently being
applied to the homeowners line, and  are anticipated to result
in improvements in 1995 in selected target  markets.

Underwriting losses from involuntary markets were relatively
consistent from 1993 to 1994, and increased $5 million from 1992
to 1993. The increase in 1993 losses was due to unfavorable
development on prior years' claims and costs associated with
third party administrators managing the assigned risk
involuntary business.

In December 1994, USF&G entered into a definitive agreement to
purchase all of the outstanding stock of Victoria Financial
Corporation ("Victoria"). The transaction is expected to close
in the second quarter of 1995. Victoria is an insurance holding
company which specializes in nonstandard auto coverage.
Management believes that this acquisition will allow USF&G to
enhance premium retention and grow the personal lines business
through an expanded product portfolio.

Assumed Reinsurance
Reinsurance products are managed by F&G Re
and marketed through national and international reinsurance
brokers. The  reinsurance segment has historically produced
underwriting gains.

The following table shows the components of underwriting
results for assumed reinsurance lines:

 Combined ratio                            90.6      91.9      93.9

Underwriting results in this category continue to be favorably
affected by increased premiums due to the strong demand for
reinsurance. Recent large catastrophe losses, such as Hurricane
Andrew  in 1992 and the Northridge earthquake in 1994, have
increased the demand for traditional risk reinsurance in both
the international and domestic property catastrophe markets.

Net premiums written in the international market for traditional
risk assumed reinsurance increased to $120 million in 1994 from
$49 million in 1993. This growth in international writings
accounts for over 87 percent of the increase in traditional risk
premiums written. This increase is offset by the reduced demand
for finite risk assumed reinsurance as a result of the
accounting requirements of SFAS No. 113 and EITF 93-6 which were
issued in 1993.

2.3. Losses incurred and loss reserves
Losses and loss expenses incurred totaled $1.7 billion in 1994,
compared with $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion in 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The reduction is due primarily to lower premium
volume and actions taken to better manage claims and claim costs
and reduce exposures in undesirable markets. The reduction from 1992 to
1993 is also due to lower catastrophe losses. Reserves for
unpaid losses and loss expenses totaled $6.1 billion at December
31, 1994, a decrease of $229 million from December 31, 1993. The
impact of adopting SFAS No. 113 increased reserves by $1.2
billion at December 31, 1993 when compared with December 31,
1992. This new accounting standard eliminated the previous
practice of reporting assets and liabilities net of the effect
of  reinsurance. Excluding the effects of SFAS No. 113, reserves
in  1993 declined $264 million from 1992.

Selected claims information for the property/casualty segment is
as follows:

(dollars in millions)                     1994      1993      1992
At December 31:
 Net reserves                           $5,084    $5,276    $5,540
 Number of outstanding claims           81,024    91,285   103,952
For the year ended December 31:
 Losses paid                            $1,883    $2,022    $2,252
 Number of new claims                  342,292   352,194   395,697

Although reserve levels have been reduced, the 8 percent
decrease  in net reserves since 1992 is significantly less than
the decreases in earned premiums, losses paid and claim activity
over the same period. Earned premiums decreased $250 million, or
10 percent, since 1992, while losses paid decreased 16 percent
over the same period. The number of outstanding claims at
December 31, 1994 declined by 22 percent compared with December
31, 1992, and the number of new claims reported (excluding
catastrophe claims) declined 13 percent from 1992 to 1994.

USF&G categorizes environmental, asbestos and other long-term
exposures where multiple claims relate to a similar cause of
loss (excluding catastrophes) as "common circumstance claims."
Reserves for losses that have been reported and certain legal
expenses are established on the "case basis." Common
circumstance claims which have emerged, while substantial, are a
relatively small portion of total claim payments and reserves.
Case reserves for these claims are approximately three percent
of the total reserves for unpaid losses  and loss expenses at
December 31, 1994 and 1993.

The most significant common circumstance claim exposures include
negligent construction, environmental, and asbestos claims. Case
reserves for these exposures represent 82 percent of total
common  circumstance case reserves at December 31, 1994. Other
common circumstance claim categories stem from a variety of
situations such as lead paint, toxic fumes, breast implants,
sexual molestation and other disparate causes, provisions for
which are included in the total common circumstance case
reserves.

The following tables set forth selected information for each of
the three primary categories of common circumstance claims, net
of ceded reinsurance.

  Total                                   $125      $125      $126

The increase in environmental incurred losses is primarily due
to  an increased allocation of bulk reserves from other lines of
business based on enhancements in the actuarial database with
respect to such claims. This reallocation did not effect
management's assessment of the overall adequacy of the reserve
position. Management believes that USF&G's reserve position is
adequate relative to its exposure to environmental and asbestos
matters, and compares favorably to other large property/casualty
insurers. USF&G's customer base generally does not include large
manufacturing companies, which tend to incur most of the known
environmental and asbestos exposures. Many of USF&G's
environmental claims relate to small industrial  or
transportation accidents which individually are unlikely to
involve material exposures. In addition, USF&G has traditionally
been a  primary coverage carrier, having written relatively
little high-level excess coverage; therefore, liability
exposures are generally restricted to primary coverage limits.
USF&G's net paid losses and loss expenses for environmental and
asbestos claims have averaged approximately $35 million per year
over the last five years, or less than two percent of the
estimated industry level as of December 31, 1994, while USF&G's
related reserves at the end of 1994 are three percent of the
estimated industry total. In a study published in 1994, A.M.
Best Company, Inc., an insurance industry rating agency,
measured the environmental and asbestos reserves held by
property/ casualty insurers in terms of the number of years the
reserves could fund the average rate of payments, described as
the "survival ratio." USF&G's survival ratio of approximately 13
years for environmental and asbestos losses is almost double
A.M. Best's estimated 1994 industry average.

In 1994, approximately 28 percent of paid environmental claims
related to matters under which a USF&G insured was a potentially
responsible party ("PRP") under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly referred to
as "Superfund", but many of these PRPs were only peripherally
involved. In 1993, 35 percent of the environmental claims paid
related to Superfund.

The level of loss reserves for both current and prior years'
claims is continually monitored and adjusted for changing
economic, social, judicial and legislative conditions, as well
as for changes in historical trends as information regarding
such conditions and actual claims develops. Management believes
that loss reserves are adequate, but establishing appropriate
reserves, particularly with respect to environmental, asbestos
and other long-term exposure claims, is highly judgmental and an
inherently uncertain process. It is possible that, as conditions
change and claims experience develops, additional reserves may
be required in the future. There can be no assurance that such
adjustments will not have a material adverse effect on USF&G's
results of operations or financial condition.

2.4. Catastrophe losses
Gross catastrophe losses totaled $73 million in 1994,
compared with $81 million in 1993 and $292
million in 1992. These losses, net of losses ceded to
reinsurers, were $67 million in 1994, $68 million in 1993 and
$140 million in 1992. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance,
represented three percent of premiums earned for the years ended
December 31, 1994 and 1993, compared with six percent  for 1992.
Net catastrophe losses in 1994 included $23 million from the
Northridge earthquake in February, as well as approximately  $26
million from winter storms in the first quarter of the year,
while 1993's net catastrophe losses included $27 million from
the East Coast blizzard in March 1993. The 1992 losses, the
highest in USF&G's history, were primarily from Hurricane Andrew
in  Florida and hailstorms and tornadoes in Kansas and Oklahoma.

2.5. Ceded reinsurance
USF&G reinsures portions of its policy
risks with other insurance companies or underwriters.
Reinsurance allows USF&G to obtain indemnification against
losses associated with insurance contracts  it has written by
entering into a reinsurance contract with another insurance
enterprise (the reinsurer). USF&G pays (cedes) an amount to the
reinsurer which in turn agrees to reimburse USF&G for a
specified portion of any claims paid under the reinsured
contracts. Reinsurance gives USF&G the ability to write certain
individually large risks or groups of risks, and helps to
control its exposure to losses by ceding a portion of such large
risks. USF&G's ceding reinsurance agreements are generally
structured on a treaty basis whereby all risks meeting a certain
criteria are automatically reinsured. Shrinking capacity in the
reinsurance market and the high catastrophe losses in recent
years have increased prices and reduced the availability of
catastrophe reinsurance. Property catastrophe reinsurance costs
were $34 million in 1994 (including a $5 million assessment from
the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund), compared with $30
million and $26 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
current catastrophe structure shows improvement from prior years
by increasing USF&G's total reinsurance protection from $205
million in 1993  to $215 million in 1994, and by providing
greater protection in all treaty layers through increased
reinsurance placement. USF&G's property catastrophe loss
retention level at December 31, 1994 is  $75 million, which in
the event of a second loss, is lowered to $50 million. Loss
retention levels for 1993 and 1992 were $50 million and $23
million, respectively, and did not include any "second event"
protection.

2.6. Capacity
A key measure of both strength and growth capacity
for property/ casualty insurers is the ratio of premiums written
to statutory policyholders' surplus. At the end of 1994 and
1993, USF&G's premium-to-surplus ratio was 1.4:1, compared with
1.5:1 at the end of 1992. The industry average is approximately
1.3:1. Insurance regulators generally accept a ceiling for this
ratio of 3.0:1; therefore, at its  current ratio, USF&G has the
capacity to grow by writing new  business.

3. Life Insurance Operations                                                   s
Life insurance operations (F&G Life) represent 15
percent of USF&G's total revenues in 1994, compared with 14
percent and 13 percent in 1993 and 1992, respectively. F&G Life
also represents 33 percent of the assets at December 31, 1994,
compared with 34 percent and 37 percent at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

Financial results for F&G Life are as follows:

                                           Years Ended December 31
(in millions)                              1994      1993      1992

Net investment income                       317       321       349
Policy benefits                            (388)     (395)     (377)
Underwriting and operating expenses         (67)      (61)      (77)
Restructuring charges                         -         -        (3)
Income (loss) from continuing operations
 before realized gains, facilities exit
 costs, income taxes and cumulative effect
 of adopting new accounting standards     $  14     $  (6)    $  (4)

Income for the year ended December 31, 1994 improved when
compared with 1993 and 1992 as a result of continued positive
sales trends and improved profit margins, partially offset by
higher sales related expenses. The increase in sales is
attributed to the new product initiatives and refocused
distribution channels (refer to Section 3.2 of this Analysis).
Profit margins improved during the year as  current and
projected spreads between investment income and  interest
credited to policyholders improved compared with 1993  levels.
This resulted from lower rates being credited to annuities where
the guaranteed rate period has expired and improved spread
management on new and renewal business. The higher profit
margins are also attributable to the favorable retention of the
single premium deferred annuity ("SPDA") block, originally sold
in 1988 through 1990 by investment brokers (refer to Section 3.3
of this Analysis). The declining trend in net investment income
is primarily due to SPDA surrenders which are reducing the level
of invested assets. This trend is likely to continue in 1995.
This trend was  partially offset in 1994 by the recognition of
$8 million from the  sale of a timber investment.

3.1. Products
F&G Life issues annuity and life insurance
products. F&G Life's principal products are structured
settlements, deferred annuities (including tax sheltered
annuities), immediate annuities and life insurance products.
Structured settlements are immediate annuities principally sold
to the property/casualty company in settlement of insurance
claims.

Deferred annuity products accumulate cash values to which
interest is credited. In 1994, deferred annuities were credited
with interest rates that ranged between 4.0 and 9.5 percent,
depending upon  the year of issue and interest guarantee
duration. The majority of deferred annuities in force were
issued with initial interest guarantees from one to six years,
with most of these written between 1988 and 1990 with a six year
interest guarantee. The deferred annuities also include
provisions for charges if the annuitant chooses to surrender the
policy (see Section 3.3 of this Analysis). After the interest
guarantee expires, the interest crediting rates can be adjusted
annually on a policy's anniversary date.

Deferred annuity products are sold through independent agents,
insurance brokers and national wholesale distributors. F&G
Life's  tax sheltered annuity products ("TSAs") are deferred
annuities that provide retirement income. TSAs are sold through
a national wholesale distribution network primarily to teachers.

Other annuities sold by F&G Life primarily consist of single
premium immediate annuities ("SPIAs"). SPIAs provide a fixed
stream of payments over a fixed period of time or over an
individual's lifetime.

F&G Life markets universal life ("UL") and term life insurance
products, primarily through independent agents. UL insurance
provides a death benefit for the life of the insured and
accumulates cash values to which interest is credited. Term life
insurance provides a fixed death benefit if the insured dies
during the contractual period.

3.2. Sales
The following table shows life insurance and annuity sales
(premiums and deposits) by distribution system and product type:

(in millions)                              1994      1993      1992

 Tax sheltered annuities                     63        35         -
 Other annuities                             41        54        74
 Life insurance                              12         6        11
  Total                                    $286      $205      $155

Sales in 1994, led by structured settlement annuities, single
premium deferred annuities, and tax sheltered annuities, have
increased 40  percent over 1993 sales and 85 percent over 1992
sales. In its effort to continue the improvement in sales and
profitability, F&G Life intends to continue to concentrate on
the expansion of its existing distribution channels while also
developing other marketing networks. F&G Life is also continuing
the development of selected products, and modifying current
product offerings to meet customer needs. Despite F&G Life's
attention to expanding its distribution channels and to product
development, demand for its products is affected by fluctuating
interest rates and the relative attractiveness of alternative
investment, annuity or insurance products, as well as its credit
ratings. As a result, there is no assurance that the improved
sales trend will continue at the same level. Total life
insurance in force was $11.8 billion at December 31, 1994,
compared with  $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

3.3. Policy surrenders
Deferred annuities and universal life
products are subject to  surrender. Nearly all of F&G Life's
surrenderable annuity policies allow a refund of the cash value
balance less a surrender charge.  The surrender charge varies by
product. Single premium deferred annuities, which represent 67
percent of surrenderable business, have surrender charges that
decline from six percent in the first policy year to zero
percent in the seventh and later policy years. Newer products
that have been issued during 1994 have surrender charges that
decline from nine percent in the first policy year to zero
percent in the tenth and later policy years. Such built-in
surrender charges  provide protection against premature policy
surrender.

Policy surrenders totaled $576 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. This compares with $211 million and $192
million for 1993 and 1992, respectively. Surrender activity has
increased as a result of expiring surrender charges, primarily
on the investment  broker block of SPDA, as policyholders seek
other investment  alternatives.

During 1994, management had in place a policy conservation
program that provided policyholders with a competitive renewal
option within F&G Life once their surrender charge period had
expired. Through December 31, 1994, policyholders representing
approximately 27 percent of the expiring block elected this
option. An additional 23 percent of the expiring block was
retained under the terms of the original contract, free of
surrender charges and at short-term interest rates which are
adjusted annually.

The total account value of F&G Life's deferred annuities is
$2.3  billion, 15 percent of which is surrenderable at current
account value (i.e., without surrender charges). The surrender
charge period on an additional $1.3 billion of F&G Life's single
premium deferred  annuity products expires through the end of
1997, of which $515 million expires during 1995. The experience
thus far for $693 million of SPDAs where the surrender charge
period expired in the fourth quarter of 1993 through the fourth
quarter of 1994 indicates that on average, 50 percent of the
expiring block may surrender; however, in the future, a larger
percentage may surrender should interest rates continue their
upward trend. While this will put pressure on F&G Life's ability
to increase assets, given the relatively high interest rates
credited when these annuities were issued, overall profit
margins would continue to improve as they surrender or rollover
to new products with lower rates. Management believes that F&G
Life, with liquid assets equal to 124 percent of the surrender
value of  surrenderable business at December 31, 1994, continues
to maintain a high degree of liquidity and has the ability to
meet surrender  obligations for the foreseeable future.

3.4. Deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC")
Costs to acquire and issue annuities and life insurance policies are
generally deferred and amortized in future periods in relationship to
expected gross profits. The recoverability of these amounts is
regularly reviewed by management through monitoring of surrender
experience, projected investment spreads and other criteria.

Policy acquisition costs unfavorably affected results as $4
million, $8 million and $10 million of normally deferrable costs
were expensed in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, because
surrender experience and sales levels did not support the
continued deferral of such costs.

During the year ended December 31, 1994, $26 million of current
year expense has been deferred compared with $12 million and $11
million for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The increase in the deferral is due to the higher
level of sales and improved future spread income during 1994
compared with 1993 and 1992. Amortization of the beginning DPAC
balance was $21 million, $10 million and $25 million for the
years ended 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The rate of
amortization in future  periods would be accelerated if
surrender activity increases and/or product margins permanently
narrow.

4. Parent and Noninsurance Operations
Parent company interest and other unallocated expenses
and net losses from noninsurance operations were as follows:

improved slightly when compared to 1993. This improvement was
primarily a result of recognizing $6 million of dividend income
from an investment in an asset management company, as well as
improvements in management consulting operations and certain
real estate investments. Unallocated expenses increased over
1993 due primarily to a $9 million non-recurring loss on
long-term subleases. Interest expense was slightly lower in 1994
than 1993; however, interest expense is expected to increase in
1995 due to higher short-term interest rates (refer to Section 6
of this Analysis). The $18 million loss in 1992 related to an
oil and gas subsidiary which was merged with another oil and gas
company converting USF&G's interest into an equity investment of
the successor company.

5. Investments
USF&G's investment mix continues to reflect a
concentration in high quality fixed-income securities. Long-term
fixed maturities  comprised 83 percent of total investments at
December 31, 1994, compared with 84 percent and 81 percent at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Total investments have
decreased due to  unrealized losses in the available for sale
portfolio, as well as the use of proceeds from sales and
repayments of fixed maturities to meet cash flow needs,
primarily from SPDA surrenders. The following table shows the
distribution of USF&G's investment portfolio.

  Total                                    $743      $749      $817
Average Yields:
 Total investments                          6.9%      6.7%      7.3%
 Fixed maturities                           7.4%      7.7%      8.6%

Investment income for the period ended December 31, 1994
decreased $6 million or one percent, and $74 million or nine
percent when compared to the same periods of 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The decrease in investment income from fixed
maturities is primarily due to an investment base which declined
in order to meet SPDA surrenders and other cash flow needs. In
addition, given the relatively low long-term interest rate
environment, proceeds from sales,  maturities or repayments of
fixed maturities during 1993 and 1994 were reinvested in fixed
maturities with lower yields. Overall, investment income in
fixed maturities decreased by seven percent and ten percent when
compared to 1993 and 1992, respectively. Although interest rates
have increased in 1994, new purchases of fixed maturities
totaling $693 million were not significant enough to affect the
average yield.

The increase in net investment income from short-term
investments since 1993 primarily reflects the higher short-term
interest rate environment. Real estate and mortgage loan
investment income has increased as a result of the sale of
timberland investments, prepayment of a mortgage loan, and a new
loan program whereby USF&G is investing a greater percentage of
capital in commercial mortgage loans versus equity real estate.
Other income less expenses improved primarily due to USF&G's
share of earnings from an equity interest in Renaissance
Reinsurance Ltd. ("Renaissance Re"), an offshore  reinsurance
company. USF&G recorded $17 million of net investment income
from Renaissance Re during 1994 and $5 million  during 1993.
Future income from the investment in Renaissance Re is subject
to volatility and exposure to catastrophe losses and other risks
inherent in the property/casualty reinsurance industry. Reduced
interest expense accrued on ceded premiums held by USF&G
accounts for the remainder of the improvement in other net
investment income.

5.2. Net realized gains on investments
The components of net realized gains include the following:

                                           Years Ended December 31
(in millions)                              1994      1993      1992

   Net realized gains                      $  5      $  6      $148

Realized gains from real estate and other investments for 1994
resulted from the sale of timberland investments and USF&G's
portion of realized gains from investments in limited
partnerships. The $79 million in realized gains on fixed
maturities in 1993 is  primarily due to USF&G's repositioning a
portion of its fixed  maturity investments to more effectively
match the duration of its life insurance liabilities. The $179
million in realized gains in 1992  is the result of investment
sales to offset declines in capital and statutory surplus caused
by catastrophe losses in 1992. In 1992, USF&G realized $52
million of gains on equities and reallocated the proceeds to
relatively less volatile fixed maturities.

To reflect the impairments in the value of certain investments,
USF&G made provisions for impairment of $10 million in 1994
compared with $84 million in 1993 and $91 million in 1992.  Real
estate impairments in 1994 primarily related to specific
properties whose recent appraisal values reflected other than
temporary impairments. Real estate impairments were taken in
1993 to write down to net realizable value properties that were
sold or expected to be sold in the near term. Real estate
impairments in 1992 reflect both changes in circumstances
related to specific properties and general real estate market
deterioration. The impairment of fixed maturities relates to
specific investments whose impairment is considered other than
temporary. The 1993 impairments on equities related to specific
equity holdings which were sold shortly thereafter.

5.3. Unrealized gains (losses)
The components of the changes in unrealized gains (losses)
were as follows:

                                           Years Ended December 31
(in millions)                              1994      1993      1992

Deferred policy acquisition
 costs adjustment                            63       (30)        -
Equity securities                             3        23       (39)
Options, foreign currency and other           1         4        21
 Total                                    $(334)     $219      $(18)

USF&G adopted SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities," in the fourth quarter of 1993.
SFAS 115 requires that the portion of fixed maturity investments
classified as "available for sale" be recorded at market value
with  the unrealized gains/losses reported as a component of
shareholders' equity. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 115,
fixed maturities  available for sale were recorded at lower of
cost or market with no effect on shareholders' equity.
Unrealized gains on fixed maturities  at December 31, 1993
reflects the low interest rate environment of 1993. However,
rising interest rates during 1994 resulted in a decrease in the
unrealized gain on fixed maturities available for sale from $222
million at December 31, 1993 to an unrealized loss of $179
million at December 31, 1994. This was partially offset by a
related change in the DPAC adjustment from the prior year's
unrealized loss of $30 million to an unrealized gain of $33
million at December 31, 1994. This adjustment is made to reflect
assumptions about the effect of potential asset sales of fixed
maturities available  for sale on future DPAC amortization.

Increasing interest rates, which resulted in declining bond
prices, were responsible for the 10 percent decrease in the
fixed maturity portfolio's overall market-to-amortized cost
ratio from December 31, 1993. Interest rates rose an average 270
basis points during 1994.

Investments in mortgage-backed securities declined 20 percent
and 50 percent when compared with holdings at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively, due primarily to prepayments of the
underlying mortgages. While subject to prepayment risk, credit
risk related to USF&G's mortgage-backed securities portfolio at
December 31, 1994 is believed to be minimal since 99 percent of
such securities have AAA ratings or are collateralized by
obligations of the U.S.  Government or its agencies.
Asset-backed securities declined 19 percent and six percent when
compared with holdings at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, as a result of sales and maturities. The net
proceeds from sales, maturities and prepayments in 1994 were
generally reinvested into corporate investment-grade bonds.

Investment-grade bonds, including debt obligations of the U.S.
Government and its agencies, comprised 93 percent of the
portfolio at December 31, 1994, compared with 94 percent and 93
percent  at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The table
below shows the credit quality of the long-term fixed maturity
portfolio as of December 31, 1994.

USF&G's holdings in high-yield bonds comprised seven percent of
the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 1994,
compared with six percent at both December 31, 1993 and 1992. Of
the total high-yield bond portfolio, 72 percent is held by the
life insurance segment, representing 10 percent of its total
investments. The table below illustrates the credit quality of
USF&G's high-yield bond  portfolio at December 31, 1994.

The information on credit quality in the preceding two tables is
based upon the higher of the rating assigned to each issue by
either Standard & Poor's or Moody's. Where neither Standard &
Poor's nor Moody's has assigned a rating to a particular fixed
maturity issue, classification is based on 1) ratings available
from other recognized rating services; 2) ratings assigned by
the NAIC; or 3) an internal assessment of the characteristics of
the individual security, if no  other rating is available.

At December 31, 1994, USF&G's five largest investments in
high-yield bonds totaled $88 million in amortized cost and had a
market value of $72 million. None of these investments
individually exceeded $30 million. USF&G's largest single
high-yield bond  exposure represented five percent of the
high-yield portfolio and  0.3 percent of the total fixed
maturity portfolio.

5.5. Real estate
The table below shows the components of USF&G's
real estate  portfolio.

The increase in mortgage loans reflects USF&G's strategy of
maintaining a generally consistent level of real estate assets
while changing the mix to more traditional mortgage loans and
less equity real estate investments. This strategy is designed
to reduce risk and increase yields in the real estate portfolio.

USF&G's real estate investment strategy emphasizes
diversification  by geographic region, property type and stage
of development. The diversification of USF&G's mortgage loan and
real estate portfolio is as follows:

Real estate investments are generally appraised at least once
every three years. Appraisals are obtained more frequently under
certain  circumstances such as when there have been significant
changes in property performance or market conditions. All of
these appraisals are performed by professionally certified
appraisers.

At December 31, 1994, USF&G's five largest real estate
investments had a book value of $325 million. The largest single
investment was a land development project located in San Diego,
California with a book value of $93 million, or nine percent of
the total real estate portfolio.

Mortgage loans and real estate investments not performing in
accordance with contractual terms, or performing significantly
below expectation, are categorized as nonperforming.
Nonperforming real estate investments at December 31, 1994
declined 16 percent and  40 percent when compared with December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. This decline in nonperforming
real estate was a result of the combination of the sale of a
nonperforming real estate property, write-downs on other
specific properties, and reclassifications.

The book value of the components of nonperforming real estate
are as follows:

                                               At December 31

*See Glossary of Terms

Valuation allowances are established for impairments of mortgage
loans and equity real estate values based on periodic
evaluations of the operating performance of the properties and
their exposure to declines in value. The allowance totaled $98
million, or nine percent of the entire real estate portfolio, at
December 31, 1994, compared with $108 million, or 10 percent of
the total real estate portfolio, at both December 31, 1993 and
1992. The decrease in the reserves on real estate investments is
a result of applying the reserve to specific properties where
permanent impairment has occurred. In light of USF&G's current
plans with respect to the portfolio, management believes the
allowance at December 31, 1994 continues to adequately reflect
the current condition of the portfolio. Should deterioration
occur in the general real estate market or with respect to
individual properties in the future, additional reserves may be
required. Although USF&G anticipates that any sales of real
estate will be in an orderly fashion as and when market
conditions permit, if USF&G was required to dispose of a
significant portion of its real estate in the near term, it is
likely that it would recover amounts substantially less than the
related carrying values. Prospectively, efforts will continue to
reduce risk and increase yields in the real estate portfolio by
selling equity real estate when it is advantageous to do so and
reinvesting the proceeds in medium-term mortgage loans.

6. Financial Condition
6.1. Assets
USF&G's assets totaled $13.8 billion at December 31, 1994,
compared with $14.3 billion and $13.1 billion at the end of
1993 and 1992, respectively. The $561 million reduction in 1994
is primarily due to a $401 million reduction in the market value
of the fixed maturity investments classified as available for sale.
In addition, proceeds from the sale of investments were used to meet
cash flow needs.

6.2. Debt
USF&G's corporate debt totaled $586 million at
December 31, 1994, compared with $574 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992. The increase in corporate debt is mainly
attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments of $13
million from non-U.S. dollar denominated debt. As a result of
entering into forward contracts, there was no effect on net
income from the translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated debt.

Proceeds from two debt offerings in 1994 were used to retire
other  portions of USF&G Corporation's debt. During the first
quarter of 1994, proceeds of $126 million from the issuance of
Zero Coupon Convertible Notes were used to redeem higher
interest bearing medium and long-term notes. USF&G also issued
$150 million  8 3/8% Senior Notes due 2001 in the second quarter
of 1994, the proceeds from which were used to repay a portion of
the short-term bank credit facility (see Section 7 of this
Analysis).

USF&G's real estate and other debt totaled $30 million at
December 31, 1994, compared with $44 million and $42 million  at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Real estate debt
increased as a result of the restructuring of a real estate
partnership where USF&G became a controlling general partner.
Shortly thereafter, USF&G defeased all but $9 million of such
debt. Real estate debt was reduced by $11 million as a result of
a deed-in-lieu of  foreclosure, whereby property in which USF&G
has a partnership interest was conveyed back to the lender, and
further reduced by the early payoff of a $11 million real estate
loan.

6.3. Shareholders' equity
USF&G's shareholders' equity totaled
$1.4 billion at December 31, 1994, $1.5 billion at December 31,
1993 and $1.3 billion at  December 31, 1992. The decrease was
primarily the result of the $401 million decline in unrealized
gains on fixed maturity investments available for sale reduced
by a $63 million change in the related life insurance segment's
DPAC adjustment. Net income of $232 million less common and
preferred dividends of $64 million partially offset the
reduction in equity.

6.4. Regulatory risk-based capital
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
has adopted model regulations which establish minimum capitalization
requirements based on a "risk-based capital" formula. These  regulations,
which were first effective for property/casualty companies for the year
ended December 31, 1994 and for life insurance companies for the
year ended December 31, 1993, establish four levels  at which
corrective action must be taken. These levels are:  (1) the
"company action level," at which the company must submit a
comprehensive financial plan with specific proposals to address
certain financial problems; (2) the "regulatory action level,"
at which the appropriate regulatory authorities will perform a
financial analysis and order certain corrective actions; (3) the
"authorized control level," at which the regulatory authorities
may place the company under regulatory control; and (4) the
"mandatory control level," at which the regulatory authorities
must place the company under  regulatory control.

Application of these levels depends upon the insurer's "adjusted
risk-based capital" as a percentage of the "minimum risk-based
capital." Risk-based capital is calculated after adjusting
capital for certain asset, credit, market, underwriting, off
balance sheet and other risks inherent in the assets,
liabilities and business of the insurer. Various levels of
corrective actions are required if the adjusted risk-based
capital is less than 200% of the authorized control level
risk-based capital.

USF&G Company had adjusted risk-based capital of $1.62 billion
as of December 31, 1994, which represented 382% of the
authorized control level risk-based capital. F&G Life had
adjusted risk-based capital of $427 million and $441 million as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, which represented
422% and 396% of the authorized control level risk-based capital
as of those dates. Accordingly, as of the dates indicated, both
USF&G Company and F&G Life had adjusted risk-based capital above
the levels which would require corrective action.

6.5. Capital strategy
In January 1994, USF&G filed a shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. As of the time this  registration statement went
into effect, USF&G had available $647 million of unissued debt,
preferred stock, common stock and warrants to purchase debt and
stock. This registration statement was reduced by $126 million
after the issuance of the Zero Coupon Convertible Notes and by
$149 million after the issuance of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes.
Subject to capital market conditions, USF&G plans to  refinance
up to $300 million of debt over the next several years.

During 1994, USF&G called for redemption 2.4 million shares of
its Series C Preferred Stock. The remaining shares were called
for redemption effective February 24, 1995. As a result of these
calls, over 93 percent of the Series C Preferred Stock converted
into 14.7 million shares of common stock in accordance with the
terms  of the Series C Preferred Stock. Pursuant to arrangements
the  Corporation previously entered into with an unaffiliated
financial institution, USF&G sold 716,600 shares of common stock
to this institution to fund a portion of the cash redemptions
resulting from these calls.

In December 1994, USF&G entered into a definitive agreement  to
purchase all of the outstanding stock of Victoria Financial
Corporation for approximately 4.1 million shares or $55.3
million  of USF&G's common stock, depending on the average
market price of USF&G common stock over a specified period
preceding the  closing of the transaction. Victoria is an
insurance holding company which specializes in nonstandard auto
coverage. Additionally, in  January 1995, USF&G entered into a
definitive agreement to purchase all of the outstanding equity
of Discover Re Managers, Inc.  for approximately 5.4 million
shares or $78.5 million of USF&G's common stock. Discover Re
provides insurance, reinsurance and related services to the
alternative risk transfer market. Both  transactions are
expected to close in the second quarter of 1995.

As further explained in Section 7.2 of this Analysis, USF&G
negotiated a $400 million credit facility in 1994 to replace the
$700 million facility that was due to expire in March 1995.

7. Liquidity
Liquidity is a measure of an entity's ability to
secure enough cash  to meet its contractual obligations and
operating needs. USF&G requires cash primarily to pay
policyholders' claims and benefits, debt and dividend
obligations, and operating expenses. USF&G's sources of cash
include cash flow from operations, credit facilities, marketable
securities and sales of other assets. Management believes that
internal and external sources of cash will continue to exceed
USF&G's short-term and long-term needs.

7.1. Cash flow
USF&G had cash flow from operating activities of
$115 million for the year ended December 31, 1994 and $87
million and $97 million for the years ended December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. The growth of cash flows from operating
activities for 1994 as compared to 1993 is due primarily to
large repayments made to reinsurers in 1993 because of new
accounting pronouncements that initiated the termination of
several reinsurance contracts. In addition, deposits and
withdrawals of universal life and investment contracts, which
for GAAP reporting purposes are considered financing activities,
had a net cash outflow of $418 million in 1994 as compared to
$196 million and $125 million for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

7.2. Credit facilities
At December 31, 1994, USF&G maintained a
$400 million committed credit facility with a group of foreign
and domestic banks. This represents the renegotiation of a prior
credit facility of $700 million at December 31, 1993. Management
elected to reduce the size of the facility due to the reduction
in borrowings against it and the Corporation's reestablished
access to capital markets. Borrowings outstanding under the
credit facility totaled $215 million at  December 31, 1994 and
$375 million at both December 31, 1993 and 1992. The credit
agreement contains restrictive covenants pertaining to
indebtedness, tangible net worth, liens and other matters. USF&G
was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1994,
1993 and 1992.

In addition, at December 31, 1994, USF&G maintained a $100
million foreign currency credit facility and a $100 million
letter of credit facility. There were no borrowings on the
foreign currency credit facility or the letter of credit
facility at December 31, 1994.

7.3. Marketable securities
USF&G's fixed-income, equity security
and short-term investment portfolios are liquid and represent
substantial sources of cash.  The market value of its
fixed-income securities was $8.3 billion at December 31, 1994
which represents 94 percent of its amortized cost. At December
31, 1994, equity securities, which are reported at market value
on the balance sheet, totaled $70 million. Short-term
investments totaled $421 million.

7.4. Liquidity restrictions
There are certain restrictions on
payments of dividends by insurance subsidiaries that may limit
USF&G's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. The
Maryland Insurance Code requires the Maryland Insurance
Commissioner's prior approval for any dividend payments during a
12 month period from a Maryland insurance subsidiary, such as
USF&G Company, to its holding company which exceeds  10 percent
of policyholders' surplus as of the prior calendar year  end. In
addition, notice of any other dividend must be given to the
Maryland Insurance Commissioner prior to payment, and the
Commissioner has the right to prevent payment of such dividend
if it is determined that such payment could impair the insurer's
surplus or financial condition. Dividends of approximately $157
million are currently available for payment to USF&G Corporation
from USF&G Company during 1995 without prior regulatory
approval. Dividends paid to USF&G Corporation from USF&G Company
totaled $125 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992. USF&G's insurance
subsidiaries' admitted assets for statutory purposes included a
total  of approximately $244 million in receivables from the
parent and affiliated companies.

7.5. Technology upgrades
USF&G has initiated a plan to upgrade
its information technology and convert its mainframe based
systems to a client server based  system. During 1995, USF&G
plans to invest over $20 million  in this project. Total
expenditures over the next three years on this project are
estimated to be approximately $50 million. USF&G's plan is to
recover this investment through future cost savings and
competitive advantages.

8. Regulation
USF&G's insurance subsidiaries are subject to
extensive regulatory oversight in the jurisdictions where they
do business. This regulatory structure, which generally operates
through state insurance departments, involves the licensing of
insurance companies and agents,  limitations on the nature and
amount of certain investments, restrictions on the amount of
single insured risks, approval of policy forms and rates,
setting of capital requirements, limitations on dividends,
limitations on the ability to withdraw from certain lines of
business such as personal lines and workers' compensation, and
other matters. From time to time, the insurance regulatory
framework has been the subject of increased scrutiny. At any one
time there may be numerous initiatives within state legislatures
or state insurance departments to alter and, in many cases,
increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and
their businesses. Proposals to adopt a federal regulatory
framework have also been discussed. It is not possible to
predict the future impact of increasing state or potential
federal regulation  on USF&G's operations. Additional
information regarding legal  and regulatory contingencies may be
found in Note 13, "Legal  Contingencies," to the consolidated
financial statements.

8.1. Proposition 103
In November 1988, voters in the State of
California passed Proposition 103, which required insurers doing
business in California to  rollback most property/casualty
premium prices in effect between November 1988 and November 1989
to November 1987 levels, less an additional 20 percent discount,
unless an insurer could establish that such rate levels
threatened its solvency. In May 1989, the California Supreme
Court ruled that an insurer does not have to face insolvency in
order to qualify for an exemption from the rollback requirements
and is entitled to a "fair and reasonable return."

The California Insurance Department's authority to establish
regulations setting forth a basis for determining what
constitutes a "fair  and reasonable return" has been the subject
of significant controversy. In August 1994, the California
Supreme Court issued its opinion in 20th Century Insurance
Company v. Garamendi, affirming the  California Insurance
Department's authority to establish a broad industry-wide
formula for implementing Proposition 103. The 20th Century
Insurance Company subsequently settled the matter with the
California Insurance Department, and on February 22, 1995,  the
United States Supreme Court denied the writ of certiorari filed
by the other litigants in the proceedings.  It is not clear how
the current regulations adopted by the California Insurance
Department will apply to USF&G, and there are many issues which
remain unsettled. The range of liability to USF&G could be from
less than $10 million up to approximately $31  million,
including interest. The ultimate outcome of this issue is  not
expected to have a material adverse effect on USF&G's results
of operations or financial position since any such liability is
not expected to materially exceed amounts already reserved.

8.2. Maine "Fresh Start" litigation
In 1987, the State of Maine
adopted workers' compensation reform legislation which was
intended to rectify historic rate inadequacies and encourage
insurance companies to reenter the Maine voluntary workers'
compensation market. This legislation, which was popularly known
as "Fresh Start," required the Maine Superintendent of Insurance
to annually determine whether the premiums collected for
policies written in the involuntary market and related
investment income were adequate on a policy-year basis. The
Superintendent was required to assess a surcharge on policies
written in later policy years if it was determined that rates
were inadequate. Assessments were to be borne by workers'
compensation policyholders, except that for policy years
beginning in 1989 the Superintendent could require insurance
carriers to absorb up to 50 percent of any deficits if the
Superintendent found that insurance carriers failed to make good
faith efforts to expand the voluntary market and depopulate the
residual market. Insurance carriers which served as servicing
carriers for the involuntary market would be obligated to pay 90
percent of the insurance industry's share. The Maine Fresh Start
statute requires the Superintendent to annually estimate each
year's deficit for seven years before making a final
determination with respect to that year.

In March 1993, the Superintendent affirmed a prior Decision and
Order (known as the "1992 Fresh Start Order") in which he found,
among other things, that there were deficits for the 1988, 1989
and 1990 policy years, and that insurance carriers had not made
a good faith effort to expand the voluntary market and
consequently were required to bear 50 percent of any deficits
relating to the 1989 and 1990 policy years. The Superintendent
further found that a portion of these deficits were attributable
to servicing carrier inefficiencies and poor investment
practices and ordered that these costs be absorbed by insurance
carriers. Also, in May 1993, the Superintendent found that
insurance carriers would be liable for 50 percent of any
deficits relating to the 1991 policy year (the "1993 Fresh Start
Order"), but indicated that he would make no further
determinations regarding the portions of any deficits
attributable to alleged  servicing carrier inefficiencies and
poor investment practices until his authority to make such
determinations was clarified in the various suits involving
prior Fresh Start orders.

USF&G was a servicing carrier for the Maine residual market in
1988 through 1991. USF&G withdrew from the Maine voluntary
market and as a servicing carrier effective December 31, 1991.
USF&G joined in an appeal of the 1992 Fresh Start Order which
was filed April 5, 1993 in the Maine Superior Court. In
addition to The Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company and
USF&G, the National Council of Compensation Insurance ("NCCI")
and several other insurance companies which were  servicing
carriers during this time frame have instituted similar appeals.
Similar appeals of the Superintendent's 1993 Fresh Start Order
have been filed by USF&G, the NCCI and several other  servicing
carriers in the same court. The appeals of the 1993 Fresh Start
Order will be heard on a consolidated basis.

On October 17, 1994, the Superior Court of Maine upheld the
Superintendent's finding in the 1992 Fresh Start Order that the
insurance carriers failed to exercise their good faith best
efforts to expand the voluntary market and consequently were
required to bear 50 percent of the deficit relating to the 1989
and 1990 policy years. The Superior Court also held that the
Superintendent improperly held that $40 million of the deficit
should be attributed to the  carriers due to servicing carrier
inefficiencies and poor investment practices. USF&G and the
other parties challenging the Superintendent's order have
appealed to the Maine Law Court, the highest court in Maine, the
Superior Court's ruling on the carriers' lack of good faith, and
the Superintendent may likewise appeal the Superior Court ruling
that it was improper to shift $40 million of the deficit to
carriers due to alleged inefficiencies and poor investment
practices.

Estimates of the potential deficits vary widely and are
continuously revised as loss and claims data matures. If the
Superintendent were to prevail on all issues, then the range of
ultimate liability for USF&G, based on the most recent estimates
provided by the Superintendent and the NCCI, respectively, could
range from approximately $12 million to approximately $21
million.

8.3. Involuntary market plans
Most states require insurers to
provide coverage for less desirable  risks through participation
in mandatory programs. USF&G's participation in assigned risk
pools and similar plans, mandated now or in the future, creates
and is expected to create downward pressure on  earnings.

8.4. Withdrawal from business lines
Some states have adopted
legislation or regulations restricting or  otherwise limiting an
insurer's ability to withdraw from certain lines of business.
Such restrictions are most often found in personal lines and
workers' compensation insurance. They include prohibitions on
mid-term cancellations and limiting reasons based upon which an
insurer may non-renew policies, requirements for amendments to
underwriting standards, rates and policy forms to be approved by
state regulators, specifications of a maximum percentage of a
book  of business which may be non-renewed within the state
within any 12 month period, and prohibitions on exiting a single
line of  business within a state (thus requiring an insurer to
either continue an unprofitable line or give up all lines of
business and withdraw from a state entirely). Such restrictions
limit USF&G's ability to manage its exposure to unprofitable
lines and adversely affects  earnings to the extent USF&G is
required to continue writing unprofitable business.

8.5. Guaranty funds
Insurance guaranty fund laws have been
adopted in most states to protect policyholders in case of an
insurer's insolvency. Insurers doing business in those states
can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent companies
to policyholders and claimants. These assessments, under certain
circumstances, can be credited against future premium taxes. Net
of such tax credits, USF&G incurred $9 million of guaranty fund
expense in 1994 and $15 million and $13 million in 1993 and
1992, respectively.

Financial difficulties of certain insurance companies over the
past several years are expected to result in additional
assessments that could have a negative impact on future
earnings. State laws limit  the amount of annual assessments
which are based on percentages  (generally two percent) of
assessable annual premiums in the year of insolvency. The
ultimate amount of these assessments cannot be  reasonably
estimated, but are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on USF&G's financial position.

8.6. NAIC proposals
The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners ("NAIC") has proposed several model laws and
regulations which are in varying stages of discussion. The NAIC
has adopted model regulations which establish minimum
capitalization requirements based on a "risk-based capital"
formula (refer to Section 6.4 of this Analysis). The NAIC has
also proposed a Model Investment Law and amendments to the Model
Holding Company System Regulatory Act. These model acts address
investments which are permissible for property/casualty and life
insurers to hold, and investments in subsidiaries and
affiliates, respectively. Adoption of these model laws is
targeted for 1995. It is not expected that the final adoption of
these regulations by the NAIC will result in any material
adverse effect on USF&G's liquidity or financial position.

8.7. National health care
President Clinton and Congress have
considered various proposals  to enact a comprehensive national
health care system. Enactment  of certain of these proposals
would result in the coordination of the medical payment system
for workers' compensation and the medical payments component of
automobile insurance within a reformed national health care
system or a merger of workers' compensation and automobile
medical coverage into a reformed health care system. Although
some form of national health care may be enacted, it is unclear
whether or to what extent such legislation will address
workers' compensation or personal automobile insurance. No
reliable prediction can be made at this time as to the ultimate
outcome of the legislative deliberations regarding national
health care reform or the effect such legislation may have on
USF&G.

8.8. Superfund
The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), more commonly known
as "Superfund," is scheduled to be reauthorized in 1995.
Insurance companies, other businesses, environmental groups and
municipalities are advocating  a variety of reform proposals to
revise the cleanup and liability provisions of CERCLA. No
reliable prediction can be made as to the  ultimate outcome of
the legislative deliberations regarding the  reauthorization of
CERCLA or the effect such revisions may have  on USF&G.

8.9. Insurance regulatory information system
The NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") ratios are
intended to assist state insurance departments in their review
of the financial condition of insurance companies operating
within their respective states. IRIS specifies eleven industry
ratios and establishes a "usual range" for each ratio.
Significant departure from a number of ratios may lead to
inquiries from state insurance regulators. As of December 31,
1994, USF&G was within the "usual range" for all IRIS ratios.

8.10. Taxation of deferred annuities
From time to time, various proposals have been considered by Congress, the
Office of Management and Budget and the Department  of the Treasury to
include within current taxable income all or a  portion of the
interest payments which accrue on certain deferred annuity
products, including some deferred annuity products sold by F&G
Life. Currently, such interest is not taxed until the time of
distribution. All such proposals have focused exclusively on
deferred annuities and have not included annuities issued in
connection with structured settlements of claims or on tax
sheltered annuities. No  reliable prediction can be made at this
time as to the outcome of any such proposals or the effect such
proposals may have on F&G Life.

8.11. Federal antitrust legislation
Congress has considered various proposals to revise
the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. This act has historically
provided the insurance industry with broad antitrust exemptions.
Various proposals have been made which would repeal many of
those exemptions, although "safe harbors" may be preserved for
data collection, loss development, common policy forms, residual
market pooling arrangements and other areas essential to the
property/casualty insurance industry. No reliable prediction
can be made at this time  as to the outcome of any of these
proposals or the effect they may have on USF&G.

9. Income Taxes
Effective January 1, 1993, USF&G changed its
method of accounting for income taxes as required by SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This standard requires
recognition of future tax  benefits attributable to net
operating loss carry-forwards ("NOLs") and to deductible
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is required
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax asset may not be realized. The valuation allowance is
established based on an evaluation of positive and negative
evidence as to the likelihood of realizing some or all of the
deferred tax assets.

At December 31, 1993, USF&G had recorded a $119 million net
deferred tax asset, as it was the opinion of management it was
more likely than not that there would be sufficient future
taxable income to result in the realization of this benefit. The
primary negative evidence that existed at December 31, 1993 was
the cumulative pretax net losses for the years 1991 through
1993. The primary positive evidence at that time was forecasted
taxable income sufficient to recover a portion of the tax
benefit within three to five years and a tax planning strategy
to generate future taxable income to utilize such NOLs, if
necessary.

At December 31, 1994, the net deferred tax asset increased to
$416 million, primarily based on the increasing weight of
positive evidence which resulted in a $203 million net decrease
in the valuation allowance. Management reviews the valuation
allowance on a quarterly basis. Throughout 1994, the weight of
evidence became increasingly more positive as the core earnings
trend improved each quarter. As 1994 progressed, the negative
evidence of cumulative losses which were caused by 1991 results
became increasingly less of a factor. By the end of 1994,
cumulative pretax net income was positive from 1992 through
1994. Given the substantially reduced degree of negative
evidence and management's increased confidence in the
sustainability of the improved earnings of the core insurance
segments and, therefore, its enhanced ability to forecast future
taxable income, it became appropriate to reduce the valuation
allowance beginning in the second quarter of 1994. The largest
adjustment to the valuation allowance occurred in the fourth
quarter of 1994 as the Corporation continued to achieve its
forecasted results. This coincided with the elimination of the
negative evidence of three-year cumulative net losses and with
the completion of the Corporation's budgeting and mid-range
forecasting process, allowing for more reliable projections of
future taxable income.

USF&G has NOLs of $750 million which expire as follows:  $147
million in 2005 and $603 million in 2006. The NOLs available for
future utilization were generated primarily by the noninsurance
businesses of USF&G and nonrecurring charges related to the
business restructuring program. A majority of these noninsurance
businesses that caused a significant drain on prior earnings
have been sold, divested or liquidated by USF&G.

Future levels of net income and taxable income from the core
insurance operations are dependent on several factors, including
general economic and specific insurance industry conditions,
competitive pressures, catastrophe losses, adverse involuntary
loss experience, etc. Because of these risk factors, as well as
other factors beyond the control of management, no assurance can
be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to
utilize the NOLs or otherwise realize the deferred tax assets.
However, management has considered these  factors in reaching
its conclusion that it is more likely than not that there will
be sufficient future taxable income to result in the realization
of the recorded $416 million deferred tax asset. This
realization is dependent, in whole or in part, on USF&G+s
ability to generate future taxable income from ordinary and
recurring operations. Based on USF&G's evaluations,
approximately $1.2 billion of future taxable income would need
to be generated to realize the $416 million deferred tax asset.
If 1994 pretax net income before realized gains and facilities
exit costs of $129 million is assumed to be an average taxable
income for future years, then USF&G will be able to realize
enough income within nine years to fully recognize the net
deferred tax asset. This is well within the tax carry-forward
period. Further, management's three to five year forecast, which
reflects management's expectations as to earnings growth,
indicates sufficient future taxable income to, more likely than
not, realize the recorded asset.

USF&G's tax returns have not been reviewed by the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") since 1989 and the availability of the
NOLs could be challenged by the IRS upon review of returns
through 1993. Management believes, however, that IRS challenges
that  would limit the recoverability of $416 million in tax
benefits are unlikely, and adjustments to the tax liability, if
any, for years through 1994 will not have a material adverse
effect on USF&G's financial position.

10. Glossary of Terms

Account value:  Deferred annuity cash value available to
policyholders before the assessment of surrender charges.


Catastrophe losses:  Property/casualty insurance claim losses
resulting from a sudden calamitous event, such as a severe
storm, are categorized as "catastrophes" when they meet certain
severity and other criteria determined by a national organization.


Expense ratio:  The ratio of underwriting expenses to net
premiums written, if determined in accordance with statutory
accounting practices ("SAP"), or the ratio of underwriting
expenses (adjusted by deferred policy acquisition costs) to
earned premiums, if determined in accordance with GAAP.


High-yield bonds:  Fixed maturity investments with a credit
rating below the equivalent of Standard & Poor's "BBB." In
addition,nonrated fixed maturities that, in the judgment of USF&G, have
credit characteristics similar to those of a fixed maturity
rated below BBB are considered high-yield bonds.


Involuntary pools and associations:  Property/casualty insurance
companies are required by state laws to participate in a number
of assigned risk pools, automobile reinsurance facilities, and
similar mandatory plans ("involuntary market plans"). These
plans generally require coverage of less desirable risks,
principally for workers' compensation and automobile liability,
that do not meet the companies' normal underwriting standards. As
mandated by legislative authorities, insurers generally participate
in such plans based upon their shares of the total writings of certain
classes of insurance.


Liquid assets to surrender value:  Liquid assets (publicly
traded bonds, stocks, cash and short-term investments) divided by
surrenderable policy liabilities, net of surrender charges. A
measure of an insurance company's ability to meet liquidity
needs in case of annuity surrenders.


Loss ratio:  The ratio of incurred losses and loss expenses to
earned premiums, determined in accordance with SAP or GAAP, as
applicable. The difference between SAP and GAAP relates to
deposit accounting for GAAP related to certain financial
reinsurance assumed.


Nonperforming real estate:  Mortgage loans and real estate
investments that are not performing in accordance with their
contractual terms or that are performing at an economic level
significantly below expectations. Included in the table of
nonperforming real estate are the following terms:


 Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure:  Real estate to which title has
 been obtained in satisfaction of a mortgage loan receivable in
 order to prevent foreclosure proceedings.


 In-substance foreclosure:  Collateral for a mortgage loan is
 in-substance foreclosed when the borrower has little or no
 equity in the collateral, does not have the ability to repay the loan,
 and has effectively abandoned control of the collateral to USF&G.


 Land investments:  Land investments that are held for future
 development where, based on current market conditions, returns
 are projected to be significantly below original expectations.


 Nonperforming equity investments:  Equity investments with cash
 and GAAP return on book value less than five percent, but
 excluding land investments.


 Restructured loans and investments:  Loans and investments
 whose terms have been restructured as to interest rates,
 participation, and/or maturity date such that returns are
 projected to be significantly below original expectations.


Policyholders' surplus:  The net assets of an insurer as
reported to regulatory agencies based on accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners and the state of domicile.


Premiums earned:  The portion of premiums written applicable to
the expired period of policies.


Premiums written:  Premiums retained by an insurer, after the
assumption and cession of reinsurance.


Underwriting results:  Property/casualty pretax operating
results excluding investment results, policyholders' dividends,
and noninsurance activities; generally, premiums earned less losses
and loss expenses incurred and "underwriting" expenses incurred.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
1.1. Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"). These statements include the accounts of USF&G
Corporation and its subsidiaries ("USF&G," or "the
Corporation"). Intercompany transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 1994 presentation.

1.2. Permitted statutory accounting practices
Reporting practices for insurance subsidiaries prescribed or permitted
by state regulatory authorities (statutory accounting) differ from
GAAP. Statutory amounts for USF&G's insurance operations are as
follows:

USF&G's primary insurance subsidiaries, United States Fidelity
and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company") and Fidelity and Guaranty
Life Insurance Company ("F&G Life"), are domiciled in the State
of Maryland and prepare their statutory financial statements in
accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
the Maryland Insurance Administration. Prescribed statutory
accounting practices include state laws, regulations and general
administrative rules issued by the State of Maryland as well as
a variety of publications and manuals of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). Permitted
statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting
practices not so prescribed.

Property/Casualty Insurance:  USF&G Company received written
approval from the Maryland Insurance Administration to extend
the required disposal period for real property acquired as
security for loans or other obligations. Under the current
Maryland Insurance Code, these assets are required to be
disposed of within five years from the date of acquisition. The
Maryland Insurance Administration extended this time period for
certain properties up to no later than December 31, 1997. As of
December 31, 1994, this permitted transaction increased
statutory surplus by $19 million over what it would have been
had prescribed accounting practices been followed.

Life Insurance:  F&G Life has received permission from the
Maryland Insurance Administration to reduce non-admitted assets
by the  associated asset valuation reserve subcomponent ending
balance. As of December 31, 1994, this permitted accounting
practice had the effect of increasing statutory surplus by $15
million over what it would have been had prescribed accounting
practices been followed.

Since Maryland does not specifically prescribe by law or
regulation reserves for universal life policies or group
annuities, F&G Life follows reserving practices which are
permitted by the State of Maryland. These practices are as
follows:

Universal Life:  For older generation universal life ("UL")
policies, the full account value is held as a reserve. For newer
generation universal life policies, reserves are held based on a
calculation according to the NAIC UL Model Regulation, which has
been adopted by many states. The reserves calculated according
to the NAIC UL Model Regulation equal the account value at the
end of the surrender charge period which varies from 8 to 15
years.

Group Annuities:  Many of the group annuities are used to fund
qualified pension and/or profit sharing plans. For these
annuities, the funds are not allocated to individual
participants. The full account value is held as the reserve for
these annuities. For the group annuities where the funds and/or
benefits are allocated to the individual certificate holder,
reserves are calculated according to the laws prescribed for
individual annuities.

1.3. Investments
Fixed Maturities:  USF&G classifies fixed
maturities as "held to maturity" if it has both the positive
intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity or near
enough to maturity such that interest rate risk is substantially
eliminated as a pricing factor. Fixed maturities held to
maturity are carried at amortized cost. Changes in the market
values of these investments are generally not recognized in the
financial statements. Specific write-downs are taken when an
impairment is deemed other than temporary.

Fixed maturities that are bought and held principally for the
purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as
"trading securities." USF&G has no securities classified as
trading securities.

Fixed maturities not classified as either "held to maturity" or
"trading securities" are classified as "available for sale."
These securities are held for an indefinite period of time and
may be sold in response to changes in interest rates and the
yield curve, prepayment risk, liquidity needs, or other factors.
Effective December 31, 1993, upon the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," available
for sale fixed maturities are carried at market value, with
unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Unrealized gains or losses on fixed
maturities available for sale are offset by an adjustment to
life insurance deferred policy acquisition costs which is made
on a proforma basis as if the unrealized gains or losses on
those assets which match certain life insurance liabilities were
realized. At December 31, 1992, before adoption of SFAS No. 115,
fixed maturities available for sale were carried at the lower of
aggregate amortized cost or market value. Market value exceeded
amortized cost at December 31, 1992; therefore, there were no
unrealized losses reported in shareholders' equity.

Equity Securities and Options:  Investments in common and
preferred stocks are carried at market value with the resulting
unrealized gains or losses reported directly in shareholders'
equity. In 1992 premiums received on options written were
recorded as liabilities. The premiums paid on options purchased
were recorded as assets. Outstanding option positions were
carried at market value, and the resulting unrealized gains or
losses were reported directly in shareholders' equity. There
were no outstanding options at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

Securities Lending:  USF&G participates in a securities lending
program where certain securities from its portfolio are loaned
to other institutions for short periods of time. A fee is paid
to USF&G by the borrower. Collateral that exceeds the market
value of the loaned  securities is invested by the lending agent
to represent USF&G's interest. USF&G's interest in securities
lending is reported in other invested assets. USF&G's invested
assets and other liabilities include $6 million, $141 million
and $206 million at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, related to its interest in the securities lending
program.

Mortgage Loans and Real Estate:  Mortgage loans are carried at
unpaid principal balances. Real estate investments are reported
at cost adjusted for equity participation. Real estate acquired
through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is initially
recorded at estimated market value. Valuation allowances are
provided for probable impairments in estimated net realizable
value based on periodic evaluations. Specific write-downs are
taken when an impairment is deemed other than temporary.

Interest and Dividend Income:  Interest on fixed maturity
investments is recorded as income when earned and is adjusted
for any amortization of purchase premium or discount. Dividends
on equity securities are recorded as income on ex-dividend
dates.

Realized Gains and Losses:  Realized gains and losses on
the sale of investments are determined based on specific cost.
Realized losses are also recorded when an investment's net
realizable value is below cost and the decline is considered
other than temporary.

1.4. Recognition of premium revenues
Property/Casualty Insurance:  Property/casualty insurance premiums
are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the lives of the policies
and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated
under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned
premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to
the unexpired terms of policies in force. Unearned premiums also
include estimated and unbilled premium adjustments.

Life Insurance:  Premiums on life insurance policies with fixed
and guaranteed premiums and benefits, and premiums on annuities
with significant life contingencies are recognized when due.
Universal life policies and annuity contracts are issued on both
a single premium and recurring premium basis. Revenues for these
contracts consist  of policy charges assessed against benefit
account balances during  the period for the cost of insurance,
policy administration and  surrenders.

1.5. Unpaid losses, loss expenses and policy benefits
Property/Casualty Insurance:  The liability for unpaid
property/casualty insurance losses and loss expenses is based on
an evaluation of reported losses and on estimates of incurred
but unreported losses. The reserve liabilities are determined
using adjusters' individual case estimates and statistical
projections. The liability was reported net of estimated salvage
and subrogation recoverables of $116 million, $139 million and
$138 million at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Adjustments to the liability based on subsequent developments or
other changes in the estimate are reflected in results of
operations in the period in which such adjustments become known.

Certain liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses related
to  workers' compensation coverage are discounted to present
value. The carrying amount of such workers' compensation
liabilities, net of reinsurance and net of discount, was $1,598
million, $1,752 million and $1,798 million at December 31, 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively. Interest rates used to discount
these liabilities generally ranged from 3 percent to 5 percent.

Life Insurance:  Ordinary life insurance reserves are computed
under the net level premium method using assumptions for future
investment yields, mortality and withdrawal rates. These
assumptions reflect USF&G's experience, modified to reflect
anticipated trends, and provide for possible adverse deviation.
Reserve interest rate assumptions are graded and range from 4.25
percent to 8.25 percent. Universal life and deferred annuity
reserves are computed on the  retrospective deposit method,
which produces reserves equal to the cash value of the
contracts. Such reserves are not reduced for charges that would
be deducted from the cash value of policies surrendered.
Reserves on immediate annuities with guaranteed payments are
computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces
reserves equal to the present value of future benefit payments.

1.6. Deferred policy acquisition costs
Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions, brokerage, and other
expenses incurred at policy issuance, are generally deferred. Anticipated
losses, loss expenses, policy benefits and remaining costs of
servicing the policies are considered in determining the amount
of costs to be deferred. Anticipated investment income is
considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists
related to short-duration contracts. Amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs totaled $653 million, $673 million and
$738 million for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively, and are included in underwriting,
acquisition and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations.

Property/Casualty Insurance:  Property/casualty insurance
acquisition costs are amortized over the period that related
premiums are earned.

Life Insurance:  Life insurance acquisition costs are amortized
based on assumptions consistent with those used for computing
policy  benefit reserves. Acquisition costs on ordinary life
business are  amortized over their assumed premium paying
periods. Universal life and investment annuity acquisition costs
are amortized in proportion to the present value of their
estimated gross profits over the products' assumed durations,
which are regularly evaluated and adjusted as appropriate.

1.7. Property and equipment
Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
At December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, $186 million, $194 million and
$200 million, respectively, of property and equipment was included in
other assets. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. For the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, depreciation expense of $23
million, $21 million and $25 million, respectively, is included
in underwriting, acquisition and operating expenses.

1.8. Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for USF&G's foreign operations is the
applicable local currency. Foreign currency balance sheet accounts
are translated to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using
the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The
unrealized gains or losses, net of applicable deferred income
taxes, resulting from translation are included in shareholders'
equity.

Foreign currency gains and losses on transactions denominated in
a currency other than the entity's functional currency are
generally recorded in operations. Such gains and losses may be
reduced or effectively eliminated by certain financial
instruments used by USF&G to reduce its foreign exchange
exposure.

1.9. Earnings per common share
Primary earnings per common share are computed by subtracting dividends
on preferred stock from net income and then dividing by the weighted
average common shares outstanding during the period. The effect of
common stock equivalents is excluded from the calculations because their
effect is not material. Fully diluted earnings per common share
assume the conversion of all securities whose contingent
issuance would have a dilutive effect on earnings.

1.10. Facilities exit costs
During 1994, USF&G committed to a plan to consolidate its home office
operations in Baltimore, Maryland at its Mount Washington facility.
The facilities exit costs of $183 million represent the present value
of the rent and other operating expenses to be incurred under the lease
on the Corporation's principal office building from the time USF&G
vacates the building through the expiration of the lease  in
2009. (See Note 6.)

1.11. Acquisitions
In December 1994 and January 1995, respectively, USF&G signed definitive
agreements with two insurance holding companies, Victoria Financial
Corporation and Discover Re Managers, Inc., whereby USF&G will acquire
all of the outstanding shares and equity of the respective companies.
These transactions are subject to approval by the shareholders
of the companies to be acquired, and are expected to close in
the second quarter of 1995.

1.12. Supplemental cash flow information The Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows is presented using the "direct method,"
which reports major classes of cash receipts and cash payments.
A reconciliation of net income to net cash provided from
operating activities is as follows:

During 1994, USF&G received proceeds from sales or repayments of
fixed maturities of $1.2 billion. The table below illustrates
the source of 1994 proceeds.

Sales in 1994 of fixed maturities classified as held to
maturity involved 21 different issuers and were based on
evidence of significant deterioration of the issuers'
creditworthiness. The determination of significant credit
deterioration was based upon current developments related
specifically to the issuers. USF&G performed a detailed analysis
of the issuers' operating trends, cash flows and its ability to
meet debt service. USF&G's analysts continually monitor news
events, published financial results, rating agency reports and
other related financial information. Sales of fixed maturities
under such circumstances are not inconsistent with their
original classifications as held to maturity. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 115 in 1993, proceeds from sales of fixed
maturities held to maturity totaled $462 million with gross
gains of $20 million and gross losses of $12 million and
occurred primarily due to repositioning a portion of the
portfolio to more effectively match the duration of life
insurance liabilities. Proceeds from sales of fixed maturities
available for sale were $1.3 billion in 1993 with gross gains of
$73 million and gross losses of $2 million. In 1992, proceeds
from sales of fixed maturities held to maturity totaled $1.1
billion with gross gains of $68 million and gross losses of $9
million. Proceeds from sales of fixed maturities available for
sale were $4.8 billion in 1992 with gross gains of  $293 million
and gross losses of $193 million.

2.7. Investment commitments
USF&G has outstanding commitments to provide permanent financing for
various real estate development projects. The funded amounts of these
commitments are collateralized by the real estate projects. At December 31,
1994, unfunded commitments totaled approximately $7 million,
with approximately $3 million of this expected to be funded in
1995. USF&G has a potential commitment to fund $12 million under
the terms of a participatory note investment if certain
collateralization tests are not met.

2.8. Nonincome-producing investments
Fixed maturities held at December 31, 1994, for which no income
was recorded during 1994, totaled $2 million. In addition, nonperforming
real estate, defined as mortgage loans and real estate investments that
are not performing in accordance with their contractual terms or are
performing significantly below expectations, totaled $208
million at December 31, 1994.

Total reserve at end of year, gross        $6,100   $6,329    $5,540

Loss and loss expenses recorded in the current period financial
statements are affected by changes in estimates of insured
events occurring in prior periods. Losses incurred in 1994 but
related to prior years were a reduction of $5 million, or less
than 1 percent of 1994 incurred losses. Losses incurred but
related to prior years were $62 million in 1993, primarily as a
result of the strengthening of the unallocated loss expense
reserve for voluntary and servicing carrier business, and
increased by $78 million in 1992 primarily because of adverse
development on reinsurance assumed from underwriting pools and
associations.

Reserves for asbestos-related illnesses and environmental claims
cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques.
Liabilities are established for known claims (including the cost
of litigation) when sufficient information has been developed to
indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy, and
management can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition,
liabilities have been established to cover additional exposures
on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the
liabilities are reviewed and updated continually. Developed case
law and adequate claim history do not exist for such claims,
especially because significant uncertainty exists about the
outcome of coverage litigation and whether past claim experience
will be representative of future loss experience.

4.2. Short-term debt
For general corporate purposes, USF&G
maintained a committed, standby credit facility with a group of
foreign and domestic banks totaling $400 million at December 31,
1994. This new facility, which expires in 1997, represents the
renegotiation of a prior credit facility of $700 million which
was available at December 31, 1993. USF&G pays facility fees on
the total amount of the commitments which are based on its
long-term debt credit ratings. In order to minimize facility
fees, and due to the reduced borrowings against it, the
Corporation elected to reduce the size of the facility to its
current level. Borrowings against the facilities totaled $215
million at December 31, 1994 and $375 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992. Interest rates are based on current market rates.
USF&G was in compliance with the covenants contained in these
agreements at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992. The most
restrictive covenants require USF&G to maintain a tangible net
worth of at least $1.1 billion plus 50 percent of the net income
earned during the commitment period and an
indebtedness-to-capital ratio below 55 percent.

In 1994, USF&G also entered into agreements under which a $100
million foreign currency credit facility and a $100 million
letter of credit facility are available. USF&G pays facility
fees on the total amount of each commitment. There were no
borrowings against these facilities at December 31, 1994.

4.3. Debt extinguishments
With proceeds from the issuance of the
Zero Coupon Convertible Notes issued in March 1994, USF&G
extinguished $99 million principal of the Corporation's 8 7/8%
Notes due 1996 and $20 million principal of Medium-Term Notes
due 1994. Proceeds from the issuance of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes
in June 1994 were used to reduce the short-term credit facility
borrowings by $147 million. Real estate debt was reduced by $11
million as the result of prepaying notes due in 1995 and further
reduced $11 million as a result of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure
whereby property in which USF&G had a partnership interest was
conveyed back to the lender. Real estate debt increased by $63
million as a result of the restructuring of a real estate
partnership whereby USF&G became a controlling general partner.
Shortly thereafter, $54 million of this partnership debt was
defeased, reducing the amount that would otherwise have been
consolidated as a result of this restructuring to $9 million.

4.4. Shelf registrations
In January 1994, USF&G filed a shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. As of the time this  registration statement went
into effect, USF&G had available  $647 million of unissued debt,
preferred stock, common stock and warrants to purchase debt and
stock. This registration statement was reduced by $126 million
by the issuance of the Zero Coupon Convertible Notes and $149
million by the issuance of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes.

4.5. Redeemable debt
In 1994 and thereafter, the 5 1/2% Swiss Franc Bonds are redeemable
at par plus accrued interest. The Zero Coupon Convertible Notes are
redeemable beginning in 1999 for an amount equal to the original
issue price plus amortized original issue  discount.

4.6. Currency swaps
USF&G entered into currency swap agreements
in 1989 to hedge its foreign currency exposure on the SwF120
million 5 1/2% Swiss Franc Bonds. This hedge was canceled in
September 1994 and USF&G received a payment of approximately $19
million. USF&G then rehedged the repayment of the SwF120 million
Swiss Franc debt and interest payments with forward contracts.

4.7. Interest rate swaps
As of December 31, 1993, USF&G had outstanding an interest rate swap for
the notional amount of $25 million to exchange variable rate debt into
a fixed rate of 9.405%.  During 1994, USF&G entered into a new floating-for-
fixed-rate swap to reduce the floating rate
exposure created by the prior swap. In conjunction with the
issuance of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes, USF&G entered into two
interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million
which convert the fixed interest payments from the debt issuance
to floating rate debt for the first three years of the seven
year term of the debt.

These agreements involve, to varying degrees, interest rate and
credit risk. The notional amount represents the amount of the
underlying debt to which the swap applies, not future cash
requirements. The maximum credit risk related to the swap
agreements is the amount related to periodic settlements, which
is not material at December 31, 1994. USF&G seeks to manage the
credit risk through monitoring procedures and investigation of
counterparties to the transactions.

4.8. Interest
Interest expense incurred in the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $37 million, $41 million
and $40 million, respectively. Interest incurred and capitalized
in 1992 was $8 million. There was no interest capitalized in
1993 or 1994.

4.9. Maturities of long-term debt

Note 5 Financial Instruments and Derivatives
Fair value information is based on quoted market prices where available.
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on internal estimates using present value or other
valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly
affected by the assumptions used, such as applicable discount
rate and estimated future cash flows. Therefore, the derived
fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in
immediate settlement of the instrument. Fair value disclosure
requirements exclude certain financial instruments and all
nonfinancial instruments. The fair value of many insurance
related liabilities do not require disclosure. However, in its
strategy of asset/liability matching, USF&G takes into
consideration the future cash requirements of its insurance
related liabilities. Had a presentation of these liabilities
been made, due to their long-term nature, the fair value of
insurance related liabilities would have been significantly less
than their carrying value.

5.1. Financial instruments
Cash and Short-Term Investments:  The carrying amounts reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for these instruments
approximate their fair values.

Fixed Maturity Investments:  Fair values for publicly traded
fixed maturity investments are based on quoted market prices.
For privately placed fixed maturities, estimated fair values are
derived by discounting expected future cash flows using a
current market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality and
maturity of the investment. At December 31, 1994, the amortized
cost, carrying amounts and fair values of fixed maturity
investments were as follows:

                                   Amortized       Carrying        Fair
(in millions)                           Cost         Amount       Value
Publicly traded                       $8,580         $8,404      $8,038
Private placements                       230            227         218
 Total fixed maturity investments     $8,810         $8,631      $8,256

The preceding table includes fixed maturities available for sale
with a market and carrying value of $4.0 billion and amortized
cost of  $4.2 billion. Such investments are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at market value.

Equity Investments:  The carrying values of equity securities as
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are
based on quoted market prices and reflect their fair values.

Mortgage Loans and Policy Loans:  The fair values for mortgage
loans and policy loans are estimated based on discounted cash
flow  analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for
similar  loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Loans
with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the
calculations. At December 31, 1994, the carrying amounts and
fair values of investments in mortgage loans and policy loans
were as follows:

                                     Carrying            Fair
(in millions)                          Amount           Value
Mortgage loans                           $349            $331
Policy loans                               61              55

Other Assets and Other Liabilities:  Other invested assets
considered financial instruments include equity interests in
minority ownership investments, interests in limited
partnerships and related notes receivable. It is not practicable
to estimate their fair value due to the closely-held nature of
these investments.

Other assets and liabilities considered financial instruments
include agents' balances receivable, prepaid and accrued
expenses and other receivables generally of a short-term nature.
It is assumed the carrying value of these financial instruments
approximates their fair value.

Short and Long-Term Debt:  The carrying amount of USF&G's
short-term borrowings approximates its fair value. The fair
value of long-term debt is based on market quotes or estimated
discounted cash flow analyses, based on USF&G's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements. The carrying amounts and estimated fair value of
debt instruments at December 31, 1994 were as follows:

                                     Carrying            Fair
(in millions)                          Amount           Value
Corporate:
 Short-term                              $215            $215
 Long-term                                371             349
Real estate and other                      30              32
 Total                                   $616            $596

Investment Contracts:  Fair values for F&G Life's single
premium deferred annuities, other deferred annuities, single
premium  immediate annuities and supplementary contracts are
primarily derived by estimating the cost to extinguish its
liabilities under an assumption reinsurance transaction. The
estimated statutory profits the assuming company would realize
from the transaction are discounted at a typical internal rate
of return objective. If such a transaction were to occur, GAAP
would require the unamortized balance of deferred acquisition
costs associated with these liabilities be immediately expensed.
The amount of the related unamortized deferred acquisition costs
was approximately $98 million at December 31, 1994. The fair
values of the remaining liabilities under investment contracts
are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations, based on
interest rates currently being offered for like contracts with
similar maturities. The carrying amounts and estimated fair
values of F&G Life's liabilities for investment contracts at
December 31, 1994 are as follows:

                                     Carrying            Fair
(in millions)                          Amount           Value

Other deferred annuities                  349             319
Single premium immediate annuities
 and supplementary contracts              121             116
Funding agreements                          1               1
Group annuities                           130             124
 Total                                 $2,471          $2,378

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments:  The fair values of
USF&G's unfunded real estate commitments and its financial
commitment on investments are estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses, based on USF&G's current incremental borrowing
rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The estimates
of the fair value of USF&G's interest rate swaps were obtained
from the counterparties to the agreement or were derived by
discounting the expected future cash flows. The estimated fair
values of USF&G's off-balance sheet  financial instruments at
December 31, 1994, are as follows:

                                                Fair
(in millions)                                  Value
Liabilities:
 Unfunded real estate commitments               $  6
 Commitment on investments                        13
Debt-related Derivatives:
 Interest rate swaps                               7
 Currency forwards                                 2

5.2. Derivatives
USF&G uses derivative instruments to manage
foreign exchange and interest rate risk, reduce borrowing costs
and minimize the impact of rate fluctuations on the settlement
of debt and other financial instruments. USF&G is subject to the
risk that the counterparties will fail to perform. However,
these risks are mitigated by the credit quality of the
counterparties and the gains and losses of the underlying
instruments. USF&G does not use derivative instruments for
trading  purposes.

Foreign Exchange Rate Instruments:  The Corporation relies
predominantly on natural hedges to manage foreign exchange rate
risk by maintaining offsetting foreign asset and foreign
liability positions wherever possible, without sacrificing other
financing objectives. Foreign exchange derivative instruments in
use as of December 31, 1994 were two currency forward contracts
to purchase Swiss Francs for the principal and interest payment
associated with USF&G's  SwF120 million 5 1/2% Swiss Franc Bonds
due 1996. The difference between the spot rate at the initiation
of the forward contract and the forward rate is amortized over
the life of the forward contract as  foreign currency expense.

Interest Rate Instruments:  The Corporation uses interest rate
derivatives selectively to enable it to maintain a certain
fixed/floating rate exposure given the current and projected
interest rate environment. The interest rate environment in 1994
was one in which short-term floating rate obligations initially
provided lower cost financing, but entailed greater interest
rate risk and provided only short duration liquidity. At the
outset of 1994, USF&G had approximately 61 percent floating rate
debt ($375 million) and 39 percent fixed rate debt ($243
million). In June 1994, USF&G issued $150 million of 8 3/8%
Senior Notes due 2001, proceeds of which were used to repay a
portion of the floating rate debt. USF&G subsequently entered
into two interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of
$150 million in which it pays floating interest rates and
receives a fixed interest rate to maintain an appropriate
fixed/floating rate exposure. At December 31, 1994, USF&G had
approximately 59 percent floating rate debt ($364 million) and
41 percent fixed rate debt ($252 million).

Additionally, in 1994, USF&G entered into a $25 million
floating-for-fixed-rate swap to reduce the exposure created by a
1990 fixed-for-floating-rate swap. The new
floating-for-fixed-rate swap has terms similar to the remaining
terms of the 1990 transaction.

Other Instruments:  USF&G has issued financial instruments with
a maximum contingent liability of $2 million depending on the
market price of USF&G's common stock at the maturity of the
instruments.

Note 6 Leases
USF&G occupies office facilities under lease agreements that expire
at various dates through 2009. In addition, data processing, office
and transportation equipment is leased under agreements that expire
at various dates through 1999.

Most leases contain renewal options that may provide for rent
increases based on prevailing market conditions. Some leases
also may contain purchase options based on fair market values or
contractual values, if greater. All leases are accounted for as
operating leases. Rent expense for the years ended December 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992 was $62 million, $54 million and $58
million, respectively. Rent expense in 1994 included a $9
million loss on long-term  subleases.

The table below shows the future minimum payments to be made
under noncancelable leases at December 31, 1994.

 Total                       $333         $59           $22        $414

USF&G is also the lessor under various subleases on its office
facilities. The minimum rentals to be received in the future
under noncancelable subleases is $33 million at December 31,
1994.

USF&G's principal office lease involves a 40-story office
building ("the Tower") which the Corporation sold in 1984 and
subsequently leased back. During 1994, USF&G developed and
committed to a plan to consolidate its Baltimore headquarters
facilities. The plans encompass relocating all USF&G personnel
currently residing at the Tower to the Mount Washington
facilities in Baltimore which USF&G owns. Implementation of the
plan began in January 1995. The relocation of Tower personnel
will begin in mid-1995 and is expected to be completed by the
end of 1996. The facilities exit costs of $183 million recorded
in the fourth quarter of 1994 represent the present value of the
acceleration of net expenses, including rent and operating
expenses, to be incurred under the Tower lease from the time
USF&G vacates the Tower through the expiration of the lease in
2009. The lease on the Tower, which provides for rent increases
every five years through its expiration in September 2009,  will
not be terminated. USF&G will continue to make rental  payments
under the lease.

The deferred gain arising from the sale-leaseback was being
amortized over the noncancelable lease term prior to the
recognition of the facilities exit costs. For each of the years
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, amortization of
approximately $2 million is netted with underwriting,
acquisition and operating expenses. The unamortized amount of
the deferred gain of $30 million and $31 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively, is included in other liabilities.
The unamortized deferred gain of $28 million at December 31,
1994 was recognized upon adoption of the facilities exit plan
and is netted against the lease expenses included in the
facilities exit costs.

Note 7 Shareholders' Equity
7.1. Classes of stock
USF&G is authorized to issue 12 million shares of $50 par value
preferred stock and 240 million shares of $2.50 par value common
stock.

7.2. Preferred stock
USF&G has 4 million shares of $4.10 Series
A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred
Stock"), 1.3 million shares of $10.25 Series B Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock"), and
1.3 million shares of $5.00 Series C Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock") issued and
outstanding at December 31, 1994. USF&G had 4 million shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, 1.3 million shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, and 3.8 million shares of Series C Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

During 1994, USF&G called for redemption 2.4 million shares of
its Series C Preferred Stock. The remaining shares were called
for redemption effective February 24, 1995. As a result of these
calls, over 93 percent of the Series C Preferred Stock converted
into 14.7 million shares of common stock in accordance with the
terms  of the Series C Preferred Stock. Pursuant to arrangements
the Corporation previously entered into with an unaffiliated
financial institution, USF&G sold 716,600 shares of common stock
to this institution to fund a portion of the cash redemptions
resulting from these calls.

Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock entitles the holder
to an annual cumulative dividend of $4.10 and a liquidation
preference of $50 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Each share
of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder to an annual
cumulative dividend of $10.25 and a liquidation preference of
$100 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. At December 31, 1994, at
the option of the holder, subject to adjustment under certain
conditions, each share of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock
is convertible to 1.192 and 8.316 shares, respectively, of
USF&G's common stock. The Series A Preferred Stock is
exchangeable in whole at USF&G's option on any dividend payment
date for 8.2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due in 2011 at
a rate of $50 principal amount per share. Series B Preferred
Stock is not exchangeable.

Shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are redeemable for cash,
in whole or in part, at USF&G's option at $50.82 per share plus
accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The
redemption price declines to $50 per share in 1996. One half of
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
redeemable for cash, in part, at USF&G's option commencing in
1994 at $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends and a
premium that declines ratably to zero per share in 2001. The
remainder is redeemable beginning in 1995 and 1996. No
redemption may be made prior to 1997 unless the closing price of
the common stock exceeds 150 percent of the Series B Preferred
Stock conversion price and subject to certain other conditions.
In addition, if a change in control event should occur, then at
the election of each holder of Series B Preferred Stock, USF&G
will issue and sell additional nonredeemable equity securities
and apply the net proceeds thereof to redeem these shares, but
only if and to the extent any such proceeds are raised.

Holders of the preferred stock are not entitled to vote, except
that they may vote separately with respect to certain matters
including the authorizations of any additional classes of
capital stock that would rank senior to the preferred stock. In
the event that six quarterly  dividends for Series A Preferred
Stock or two quarterly dividends for Series B Preferred Stock
are unpaid, USF&G's Board of Directors will be increased by two
members, and holders of preferred stock may elect two directors
until all such dividends in arrears have been paid.

7.3. Dividend restrictions
Payment of dividends to USF&G Corporation by its insurance subsidiary
is subject to certain restrictions. The Maryland Insurance Code requires
the Maryland Insurance Commissioner's prior approval for any dividend
payments during a twelve month period from a Maryland insurance
subsidiary, such as USF&G Company, to its holding company which
exceeds 10 percent of policyholders' surplus. In addition,
notice of any other dividend must be given to the Maryland
Insurance Commissioner prior to payment, and the Commissioner
has the right to prevent payment of such dividend if it is
determined that such payment could impair the insurer's surplus
of financial condition. At December 31, 1994, $157 million of
dividends is currently available for payment to USF&G
Corporation from its insurance subsidiary during 1995 without
prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 1993, $154 million in
dividends was available for payment to USF&G Corporation from
its insurance subsidiary without restriction, of which $125
million of dividends was paid during 1994.

7.4. Changes in common stock shares

        Years Ended December 31
                                      1994          1993          1992
Common Stock:

 Outstanding, December 31       95,616,460    85,009,482    84,512,758

USF&G issued 9.9 million shares of common stock during 1994
related to the conversion of Series C Preferred Stock. Another
5.5 million common stock shares were issued in February 1995 for
the conversion of the remaining Series C Preferred Stock.
Additionally, USF&G expects to issue approximately 4.1 million
and 5.4 million shares of common stock in exchange for all of
the outstanding shares of Victoria Financial Corporation and
Discover Re Managers, Inc., respectively, when those merger
transactions close in the second  quarter of 1995.

7.5. Shareholder rights plan
USF&G has a shareholder rights plan ("the plan") to deter coercive or
unfair takeover tactics and to prevent a potential purchaser from gaining
control of USF&G without offering a fair price to all of the Corporation's
shareholders. Under the plan, each outstanding share of USF&G's
common stock has one preferred share purchase right (a "right")
expiring in 1997. Each right entitles the registered holder to
purchase 1/100 of a share of a new class of junior preferred
stock for $140. The rights cannot be exercised unless certain
events occur that might lead to a concentration in ownership of
common shares. At that time, the rights may be exercised for
common stock having a value of twice the exercise price. Under
certain conditions, the rights also become exercisable into
shares of common stock of a purchaser having a value of twice
the exercise price. USF&G will generally be entitled to redeem
the rights, at $.05 per right, any time before the tenth day
after a 20 percent position is acquired.

Note 8 Stock Ownership Plans
8.1. Stock options and stock purchase plans
Stock Options:  Stock options have been granted
to full-time officers and key employees under four incentive
plans: Long-Term Incentive Plan, Stock Option Plan of 1987,
Stock Option Plan of 1990, and Stock Incentive Plan of 1991. In
addition, the Employee Stock Option Plan of 1992 and the 1994
Stock Plan For Employees of USF&G granted eligible employees,
other than officers and key employees participating in other
stock incentive plans, options to purchase shares based on
market quotations at the time of grant. Activity under the stock
option plans is as follows:

                                      1994           1993           1992

Stock Purchase Plans:  Shares had been offered to employees
under the Employees' Stock Purchase Plans of 1985 and 1990. None
were offered in 1992, 1993 or 1994. The purchase price was 85
percent of the market value of USF&G's common stock on the grant
date or the end of the two-year purchase period, whichever was
less. Activity under the stock purchase plans is as follows:

                                         1994        1993        1992

Shares reserved                             -           -         N/A

Proceeds from the shares sold under the stock option and stock
purchase plans are credited to common stock and paid-in capital.
USF&G makes no charges to income for the plans. The number of
shares under the plans are adjusted for any future stock
dividends, stock splits or similar changes.

8.2. Directors stock plan
The Corporation adopted the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
(the "Directors Stock Plan") on May 12, 1993. Only the Corporation's
outside directors are eligible to participate, and participation is
mandatory. The Directors Stock Plan has two components: (i) annual
retainer awards, and (ii) retirement awards. The Directors Stock Plan
authorizes the issuance of up to 300,000 shares of the Corporation's
common stock, par value $2.50 per share. Activity
under the Directors Stock Plan is as follows:

                                        1994        1993
Outstanding, January 1               113,585           -
Stock units awarded                   17,115     135,885
Stock issued                         (34,198)    (22,300)
Outstanding, December 31              96,502     113,585

USF&G records compensation expense equal to the market value at
grant date of the vested stock or stock units awarded under the
Directors Stock Plan. In 1993, $2 million of compensation
expense was recognized relating to this plan. The 1994
compensation expense related to these plans was minimal and is
expected to continue to be so in future years.

Note 9 Retirement Benefits
9.1. Retirement plans
USF&G has noncontributory retirement plans covering
most regular full-time employees of the Corporation and its affiliates.
An employee's pension benefit is based on salary, years of service and
Social Security benefits. USF&G makes contributions to the retirement
plans based on amounts required to be funded under provisions of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The plans'
funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated
financial statements are as follows:

                                                    At December 31

 Net prepaid (accrued) pension cost           $(11)      $(41)      $ 14
Actuarial Assumptions:
 Weighted average discount rate               8.75%      7.50%      8.75%
 Average rate of increase in future
  compensation levels                          5.0        5.0        6.0
 Expected long-term rate of return on assets   8.5        8.5        9.5

As a result of the higher interest rate environment, USF&G
increased the discount rate assumption as of December 31, 1994,
which caused the accumulated benefit obligation to decrease. In
accordance with SFAS No. 87, USF&G recorded a minimum pension
liability for the underfunded amount, representing the
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the fair value of
the plans' assets, plus the amount of prepaid pension costs. The
minimum pension liability is reported as a separate reduction to
shareholders' equity.

The assets held by the plan consist primarily of fixed-income
and equity securities. USF&G classifies prepaid pension cost
with other assets and accrued pension cost with other
liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The components of net pension expense are as follows:

                                         Years Ended December 31
(in millions)                          1994       1993       1992

 Net periodic pension expense          $ 13       $ 10       $  3

9.2. Postretirement benefits
USF&G sponsors a defined dollar postretirement health care plan
(medical and dental) and noncontributory life insurance plan covering
most regular full-time employees of the Corporation and its affiliates.
USF&G's contributions and costs are determined based on the
annual salary and the type of coverage elected by covered
employees. USF&G's contributions to the plan are a percentage of
plan costs based on age and service of employees at retirement.
Additionally, the plan costs are capped at projected 1995 cost
levels, and retiree contributions are increased for the total
medical costs over the projected levels.

Effective January 1, 1993, USF&G adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions." This statement requires USF&G to accrue a liability
for the cost of health care, life insurance and other retiree
benefits when the employees' services are rendered. As permitted
under the new standard, the transition obligation of $52 million
at January 1, 1993 was recognized as an immediate charge to net
income by including the cumulative effect of adopting this
accounting standard. USF&G continues to fund the health care and
life insurance benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go
basis. The pay-as-you-go expenditures for postretirement
benefits were $5 million in 1994 and 1993, and $4 million in
1992.

The plans' combined funded status and amounts recognized
in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

                                                      At December 31
(in millions)                                       1994         1993

 Accrued postretirement benefit cost                $(53)        $(52)

USF&G classifies accrued postretirement benefit cost with other
liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost
are as follows:

                                                 Years Ended December 31
(in millions)                                        1994       1993
Service cost                                           $1         $1
Interest cost                                           4          4
 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost              $5         $5

The weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in per
capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., medical trend rate) for
the plans is 9.0 percent for 1995 (10.5 percent assumed for
1994) and is assumed to decrease to 5.5 percent in 2002 for
participants age 65 or younger, and 7.75 percent for 1995 (8.0
percent for 1994), decreasing to 5.5 percent for participants
over age 65, and remain at that level thereafter. Increasing the
assumed medical trend rate by one percentage point in each year
would increase the accumulated  postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately $4 million and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the year by approximately $0.4
million. The weighted average discount rate used in determining
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.75
percent at December 31, 1994 and 7.5 percent at December 31,
1993.

Note 10 Federal Income Taxes
USF&G Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal
income tax return. The provision for income taxes gives effect to
permanent differences between income before income taxes and taxable
income. Deferred federal income taxes are provided on temporary
differences and net operating loss carry-forwards (for 1994 and 1993)
and timing differences (for 1992) between financial and taxable income.

Effective January 1, 1993, USF&G changed its method of
accounting for income taxes as required by SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the standard, a deferred
tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future
tax effects attributable to net operating loss carry-forwards
("NOLs") and to temporary differences between the tax basis and
GAAP basis of an asset or a liability. A  valuation allowance is
required if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. As permitted under SFAS No. 109, 1992
financial statements have not been restated.

At December 31, 1994, the net deferred tax asset of $416 million
recorded by USF&G is supported by a combination of forecasted
taxable income and a tax strategy that USF&G would implement to
prevent NOLs from expiring. A valuation allowance of $279
million has been recognized to offset the gross deferred tax
assets.

10.1. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities

 Other                                                  62         85
 Net operating loss carry-forwards                     263        222
  Total deferred tax assets                            867        785
Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets            279        482
 Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance       588        303
  Net deferred tax assets                             $416       $119

At December 31, 1994, the net deferred tax asset increased to
$416 million, primarily based on the increasing weight of
positive evidence which resulted in a $203 million net decrease
in the  valuation allowance. Throughout 1994, the weight of
evidence became increasingly more positive as the core earnings
trend improved each quarter. As 1994 progressed, the negative
evidence of cumulative losses which were caused by 1991 results
became increasingly less of a factor. Given the substantially
reduced degree of negative evidence and management's increased
confidence in the sustainability of the improved earnings of
the core insurance segments and, therefore, its enhanced ability
to forecast future taxable income, it became appropriate to
reduce the valuation allowance. During 1993, the net decrease in
the valuation allowance was $56 million reflecting the change in
the realizability of the deferred tax asset. In addition, the
valuation allowance was increased  $15 million in 1993 due to
the tax rate change enacted in that year.

10.5. Net operating loss carry-forwards
At December 31, 1994, USF&G had NOLs remaining for tax return purposes
expiring in years 2005 and 2006. The amount and timing of recognizing
the benefit of these NOLs depends on future taxable income and
limitations imposed by tax laws. The approximate amounts of
USF&G's NOLs on a regular tax basis and an alternative minimum
tax ("AMT") basis at December 31, 1994 were as follows:

(in millions)                       Tax Return
Regular tax basis                         $750
AMT basis                                  553

Note 11 Reinsurance
During 1993, USF&G adopted SFAS No. 113,
"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts." This standard requires the effects of
reinsurance activity to be reported on a gross basis.
Reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums are
reported separately as assets, instead of the previous practice
of reporting such receivables net of the related loss and
unearned premium liabilities. The standard also establishes the
conditions required for a contract to be accounted for as
reinsurance and prescribes income recognition and reporting
standards for those contracts. The initial adoption of this
standard had no effect on net income, but increased assets and
liabilities by approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 1993.
USF&G reinsures portions of its policy risks with other
insurance companies or underwriters, and assumes policy risks
from other insurance companies and through participation in
pools and associations. Reinsurance gives USF&G the ability to
write larger risks and control its exposure to losses from
catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting
results. USF&G's ceding reinsurance agreements are generally
structured on a treaty basis whereby all risks meeting a certain
criteria are automatically reinsured. Amounts recoverable from
reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim
liability associated with the reinsured policy. Reinsurance
contracts do not relieve USF&G from its obligation to
policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligation
could result in losses to USF&G. USF&G evaluates the financial
condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of
credit risks arising from similar economic characteristics of
the reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses
from reinsurer insolvencies.

At December 31, 1994 and 1993, reinsurance receivables totaled
$554 million and $573 million, respectively. Of these amounts,
approximately $122 million and $150 million, respectively, were
associated with the Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Bureau
("WCRB"), a single voluntary reinsurance association of primary
workers' compensation insurers formed for the purpose of
providing excess of loss reinsurance to its members. USF&G is a
member of this pool. Each member is required to hold collateral,
for the benefit of all member companies, in the form of
investment-grade securities equaling 115 percent of the member's
share of outstanding receivables of the WCRB. This collateral
requirement mitigates the risk of WCRB becoming insolvent. Risk
of loss is minimal for the remainder of receivables due to
similar pool arrangements with collateral requirements, other
contracts where funds are withheld, or letters of credit
maintained. Credit risk is also diversified among numerous
reinsurers. Additionally, USF&G is active in the involuntary
market as a servicing carrier whereby USF&G processes business
for a pool but takes no direct underwriting risk because it is
directly reimbursed for the cost of processing policies and
settling any related claims. Servicing carrier receivables of
$706 million and $719 million associated with this business are
separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Included in assumed unpaid losses in the above table are $86
million, $110 million and $123 million related to loss portfolio
transfer agreements at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. USF&G has not entered into any such agreements to
cede its unpaid losses.

The ceded unpaid losses and assumed unpaid losses for 1993 were
reduced $464 million and $267 million, respectively, from 1992
due to a commutation involving the WCRB. At year end 1993, WCRB
members commuted the lowest layer of reinsurance for accident
years 1980 to 1992. As a result, USF&G was required to take back
all reserves previously ceded into the layer and return reserves
previously assumed.

Note 12 Financial Guarantees
12.1. Insurance guarantees
USF&G has underwritten and reinsured financial guarantee bonds for
principal and interest payments or installment notes when due.
The obligations guaranteed were issued by limited partnerships,
municipalities and commercial enterprises. Assessment is made of
the likelihood of loss in connection with these guarantees, and
at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, the reserve for such losses
was not material. The risk of loss under these guarantees is
diminished through reinsurance agreements and collateral.

As of December 31, 1994, USF&G was contingently liable for par
value amounts totaling less than $500 million on financial
guarantee exposures ceded through reinsurance agreements with a
monoline insurance company in which USF&G formerly had a
minority ownership interest. In addition, USF&G has other
financial guarantee obligations where the par value guaranteed
totaled $27 million at December 31, 1994, maturing in 1995.

12.2. Corporate guarantees
USF&G has also guaranteed the obligations of certain limited
partnerships where it has an equity interest. The risk of loss under these
guarantees is diminished by collateral in the underlying projects. The
guarantees totaled $13 million at December 31, 1994, with
maturities ranging from 1995 to 1999. In addition, USF&G has
line of credit commitments outstanding totaling $55 million.

Note 13 Legal Contingencies
USF&G's insurance subsidiaries are
routinely engaged in litigation in the normal course of their
businesses, including defending claims for punitive damages. As
a liability insurer, they defend third-party claims brought
against their insureds. As an insurer, they defend themselves
against coverage claims. Additional information regarding
contingencies that may arise from insurance regulatory matters
and regulatory litigation matters may be found in the Regulation
section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

In the opinion of management, such litigation and the litigation
described below is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on USF&G's consolidated financial position, although it
is possible that the results of operations in a particular
quarter or annual period would be materially affected by an
unfavorable outcome.

13.1. North Carolina workers' compensation litigation
On November 24, 1993, N.C. Steel, Inc. and six other North Carolina
employers filed a class action in the General Court of Justice,
Superior Court Division, Wake County, North Carolina against the
National Council on Compensation Insurance ("NCCI"), North
Carolina Rate Bureau, USF&G and eleven other insurance companies
which served as servicing carriers for the North Carolina
involuntary workers' compensation market. On January 20, 1994,
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking to certify a
class of all employers who purchased workers' compensation
insurance in the State of North Carolina after November 24,
1989. The amended complaint, which is captioned N.C. Steel,
Inc., et al., v. National Council on Compensation Insurance, et
al., alleges that the defendants conspired to suppress
competition with respect to the North Carolina voluntary and
involuntary workers' compensation business, thereby artificially
inflating the rates in such markets and the fees payable to the
insurers. The complaint also alleges that the carriers agreed to
improperly deny qualified companies from acting as servicing
carriers, improperly encourage agents to place employers in the
assigned risk pool, and improperly promote inefficient claims
handling. USF&G has acted as a servicing carrier in North
Carolina since 1990. The plaintiffs are pursuing their claims
under various legal theories, including violations of the North
Carolina antitrust laws, unlawful conspiracy, breach of
fiduciary duty, breach of implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, unfair competition, constructive fraud, and unfair
and deceptive trade practices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
compensatory damages, punitive damages for the alleged
constructive fraud and treble damages under the North Carolina
antitrust laws. On February 14, 1995, the trial court granted
the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs
have appealed the trial court's dismissal of the case. USF&G
believes that it has meritorious defenses and has determined to
defend the action vigorously.

13.2. Texas workers' compensation litigation
On April 18, 1994, Mi-De-Pizza, Inc. and ten other Texas insureds filed
an amended class action in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas
against the NCCI and all insurance companies and certain
insurance brokers that wrote workers' compensation insurance in
Texas during the period 1987 to 1991. The case, which was
subsequently consolidated with another case to which USF&G was
not a party and is now captioned Weatherford Roofing Company, et
al., v. Employers National Insurance Company, et al., alleges
that the defendants utilized rates and forms that had the effect
of charging premium rates in excess of the rates approved by
law. The plaintiffs are pursuing recovery of these alleged
excess charges under various legal theories, including breach of
contract, fraud, civil conspiracy and violation of the Texas
Insurance Code and the Texas Business and Commerce Code. USF&G
believes that it has meritorious defenses and has determined to
defend the action vigorously.

13.3. South Carolina workers' compensation litigation
On August 22, 1994, the Attorney General of the State of South Carolina
filed suit in the County of Greenville, South Carolina on behalf
of South Carolina employers that have allegedly been damaged as
a result of alleged unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Specifically, the Attorney General alleges that the NCCI, the
National Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Pool, USF&G and seven
other insurance companies which served as servicing carriers for
the South Carolina involuntary workers' compensation market,
conspired to fix servicing carrier fees at unreasonably high and
noncompetitive levels in violation of the South Carolina Uniform
Trade Practices Act, allegedly causing inflated deficits in the
involuntary market and an excessive expansion of the residual
market. The Attorney General alleges that the conspiracy
occurred for an unspecified period of time prior to January
1994. The Attorney General has indicated that he intends to
pursue recovery on behalf of all South Carolina employers who
have suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of such alleged
conduct, civil penalties of $5,000 for each willful violation,
and temporary and permanent injunctive relief. USF&G believes
that it has meritorious defenses and has determined to defend
the action vigorously.

13.4.  Alabama workers' compensation litigation
On September 14, 1994, three Alabama employers filed a class
action captioned Four Way Plant Farm, Inc., et al., v. National Council on
Compensation Insurance, et al., in the Circuit Court of Bullock
County, Alabama on behalf of all Alabama employers that have
allegedly been damaged as a result of an alleged conspiracy by
the NCCI, the National Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Pool,
USF&G and numerous other insurance companies which served as
servicing carriers for the Alabama involuntary workers'
compensation market, to fix servicing carrier fees at
unreasonably high and noncompetitive levels in violation of
Alabama law. The plaintiffs allege that the conspiracy occurred
during the period January 1, 1985 to January 1, 1994, and caused
inflated deficits in the involuntary market and an alleged
excessive expansion of the workers' compensation residual
market. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on behalf of
each member of the proposed class action. USF&G believes that it
has meritorious defenses and has determined to defend the action
vigorously.

Note 14 Information on Business Segments
USF&G's principal business segments are property/casualty insurance
and life insurance.

14.1. Operations

*The fourth quarter 1994 results reflect $183 million in facilities exit
costs as discussed in Note 6, and a $210 million tax benefit as discussed
in Note 10. The first quarter 1993 results include a $38 million net benefit
of adopting two new accounting standards. The third quarter 1992
results reflect $142 million in realized gains on investments,
$80 million of catastrophe losses as a result of Hurricane
Andrew, and $51 million of restructuring charges. The sum of
quarterly income (loss) per share amounts may not equal the full
year's amount due to stock issuances during presented periods.


Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors
USF&G Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of
financial position of USF&G Corporation as of December 31, 1994,
1993, and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of USF&G Corporation at December 31, 1994,
1993, and 1992 and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

In 1993, as a result of adopting new accounting standards and as
discussed in Notes 1, 2, 9, and 10 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation changed its methods of accounting
for certain investments in debt and equity securities,
postretirement benefits other than pensions, and income taxes.
