                                   PART I


ITEM 1 - BUSINESS


General
- -------

    Zing Technologies, Inc. ("Zing" or the "Company") is a holding company with
one material 98% owned operating subsidiary, Omnirel Corporation 
("Omnirel") (approximately 84% owned by Zing on a fully diluted basis), and
one non-material 90% owned operating subsidiary, Transition Analysis of
Component Technology, Inc. ("TACTech").  Zing was incorporated in New York
on October 17, 1969.

   Since June 26, 1991, when the Company acquired Omnirel, the Company has
engaged in the manufacture and sale of high reliability power semiconductor
multi-chip modules and packaged semiconductor components in its niche
market and has expanded its distribution into the high-end commercial and
industrial market.

   High reliability power semiconductor multi-chip modules are defined as
electronic components and are single-package devices with a power dis-
sipation of five watts or more.  They combine active power semiconductor
components and passive components (such as capacitors and resistors) which
form integrated smart power electronic circuits which control, drive and
regulate the input and output of power (electricity) in motion control and
power supply applications for use in electronic systems and equipment. 
Omnirel manufacturing techniques and design standards for the military and
high reliability industrial markets are more exacting than is the case for
commercial general purpose hybrid circuit components.  The products
manufactured by Omnirel include custom designed products as well as
standard commodity products.

   Omnirel produces both standard and custom products in a clean room
environment and is certified to MIL-STD 1772, the highest level of military
certification for a hybrid circuit manufacturer, and is registered to ISO
9001.  Omnirel's products are used where circuit density (including
miniaturization), electrical performance and reliability are critical
design requirements, such as in the defense, aerospace, commercial
transportation and medical device industries.  Omnirel's products are also
used in the production of industrial controls and power supplies where
these same criteria are needed.

   TACTech licenses proprietary computer software databases to military
semiconductor manufacturers, the Department of Defense and defense contrac-
tors.  The databases provide the end users with information useful in
determining the projected life cycle (obsolescence) of microcircuits and
discrete semiconductor devices used primarily in the manufacture of systems
for military and aerospace applications.  TACTech software also contains a
description and the general specification of each microcircuit and discrete
semiconductor device, thereby allowing the user to identify functionally
interchangeable devices from various manufacturers and to upgrade and rank
the devices according to life cycle and availability based on sources of
supply.  The TACTech database is 


                                     3

ZING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

believed to include virtually all standard microcircuits and discrete
devices with high reliability specifications used primarily for military or
aerospace application.  The database is constantly updated and delivered on
a real-time or near real-time basis.  The operations of TACTech are not
presently material to the Company.

   Until May 19, 1993, Zing was principally engaged in the business of
distributing high reliability electronic semiconductor components used in
military and aerospace equipment and providing value-added services under
the name Zeus Components, Inc.  Prior to May 19, 1993, Zing/Zeus was one of
the largest distributors in this niche market, representing over thirty
semiconductor manufacturers, with a product line which consisted of
integrated circuits, discrete semiconductors and passive components. 
Integrated circuits generally are sold at higher unit prices and at a
higher unit gross profit margin than discrete semiconductors.  Passive
components generally consist of capacitors and resistors.  

   On May 19, 1993, Zing sold the net assets of its high reliability
electronic component distribution and value added service businesses to
Arrow Electronics, Inc. (the "Arrow Sale").  Arrow (NYSE-ARW) is the
world's largest electronic components distributor.  The purchase price was
$24,254,000, representing a premium of approximately $3,000,000 over the
net book value of the assets transferred.  In May 1996, Zing is entitled to
receive up to $2,000,000 from Arrow as additional purchase price depending
on the performance of Arrow's high reliability electronic components and
value-added business.  Based upon information received to date, Zing
believes Arrow's sales are running at a rate which would make it more
likely than not that some or all of the $2,000,000 will be realized by
Zing.

Competition
- -----------

   The market for high reliability power semiconductor multi-chip modules
is fragmented.  There is no single firm which maintains a dominant
position, either in technology or in market share.  Based on recent
industry publications of Frost & Sullivan, Moody Associates and the
Semiconductor Industry Association, the total available market for high
reliability power semiconductor multi-chip modules within the United States
was approximately $300,000,000 in 1993 and $330,000,000 in 1994, and is
expected to grow at a rate greater than 10% (per annum) during the later
1990's.  The market for power hybrid products which Omnirel addresses is in
excess of $125,000,000 a year and approximately 65% of the sales to such
market are made by five manufacturers (including Omnirel) of power hybrid
components.  Omnirel is the only such manufacturer whose primary focus is
on high reliability power semiconductor multi-chip modules.  The principal
competitors of Omnirel are other hybrid manufacturers, original equipment
manufacturers with internal capability and power semiconductor manufac-
turers who offer multi-chip modules as a complementary product line. 
Omnirel distinguishes itself in the marketplace principally on the strength
of its focus on power applications.  It has complete design, manufacturing
and high reliability screening capabilities in-house, and has developed a
reputation for innovative solutions for customer needs.  The Company also
competes on the basis of pricing and delivery.

Marketing and Sales
- -------------------

   Omnirel markets its products through four regional sales managers in the
United States and twenty-five sales representative organizations world-
wide.  Omnirel sells both standard and custom products to approximately two
hundred customers world-wide.  Standard products are sold both through
distributors and directly to customers.  Custom products are sold directly
to customers.

   Omnirel publishes and distributes to its existing customers and poten-
tial new customers a catalogue of its standard products.  Omnirel
management has focused its marketing effort in the United States where
nineteen independent sales representatives are coordinated by Omnirel's
sales management.  Key accounts are also covered by area managers in each
sales region.  Six representatives/distributors are currently in place in
Europe marketing Omnirel's products.

   Omnirel's customers are primarily major electronic equipment and systems
manufacturers such as General Electric, Loral, Bendix, Hamilton-Standard,
Hughes Aircraft, Boeing, Texas Instruments, Raytheon and Motorola.  Sales
of various products to General Electric representing multiple industrial
and military/aerospace programs at four separate locations aggregated 65%
of Omnirel's sales revenues for fiscal year 1995 of which a single project
accounted for approximately 63% of 1995 sales.  Based upon orders already
placed, sales to General Electric are expected to represent a significant
portion of Omnirel's fiscal 1996 sales.  The Company expects that the
current General Electric orders will be filled during the first three
quarters of fiscal 1996, and while additional sales to such customer are
likely, revenues from General Electric are expected significantly to
decline over the next several years.  The amount of the decline is depen-
dent upon factors such as the level of General Electric's business, whether
Omnirel continues as General Electric's sole source supplier and whether
Omnirel can produce the products required by General Electric based upon
changing technology.  Arrow Electronics is Omnirel's exclusive distributor
of its single and multi-chip semiconductor devices for a period ending
December 31, 1996.

   Omnirel's customers outside the United States and export sales outside
the United States are as follows:

ZING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES


   Omnirel's backlog on June 30, 1995 was $15,900,000; $9,100,000 of which
is accounted for in the order from General Electric.  Approximately 90% of
the backlog is deliverable over the next 12-month period.

   For the fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993 Omnirel did not enter into any
contracts with either customers of the United States Government or any
agency of the United States Government.  Omnirel sells its products to
subcontractors of certain government agencies through customer purchase
orders.  Cancellation of purchase orders from time to time is customary in
the power hybrid component industry.  Under standard industry practices, in
the event of cancellation, Omnirel is entitled to reimbursement of costs
incurred and a reasonable profit for work performed prior to the cancel-
lation.

   The sale of Omnirel products is not seasonal.  However, the timing of
sales to Omnirel's principal customer was concentrated predominantly in the
fourth quarter, and to a lesser extent the third quarter, of fiscal 1995.

Supplier and Materials Used
- ---------------------------

   Unpackaged semiconductors, in chip form and other components such as
capacitors and resistor chips or surface mount devices, metal and plastic
packages and ceramic materials are used by Omnirel in the manufacture of
its products.  These materials and components, none of which are presently
in short supply, are purchased from time to time on the open market, and
Omnirel has no long term commitments for their purchase.  Omnirel is not
dependent on any one supplier for a primary material.  Omnirel has
agreements with a number of premier semiconductor manufacturers which allow
Omnirel to buy products directly from such manufacturers.  These agreements
allow Omnirel to be apprised of technological advances and developments.

Product Warranty
- ----------------

   Omnirel warrants that its products are free from defects in workmanship
and meet the agreed upon specifications supplied by the customer or
Omnirel's current published specifications.  Omnirel's liability for
defective products is limited solely to replacement thereof upon receipt
from the customer of notice of breach of warranty within periods varying
between three (3) and twelve (12) months of the date of shipment, depending
upon the product.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
- --------------------------------

   Omnirel does not possess any patents for proprietary manufacturing
processes.  Omnirel believes, however, that its proprietary processes and
product technologies are such that they give it a unique position in the
design and manufacture of power semiconductor hybrids and multi-chip
modules using semiconductor assembly technology.  The Omnirel name and logo
are unique trademarks.  While Omnirel considers that in the aggregate its
trademarks are important in its operation, it does not consider that one or
any group of trademarks is of such importance that termination could
materially affect its business.  TACTech maintains copyright protection for
its computer software and claims 


                                     6

ZING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

proprietary trade secret protection through customer licensing agreements.

Inventory
- ---------

   Omnirel follows industry standards for procurement, sale and return of
its inventory.  Materials are procured based upon purchase orders which
have standard terms and conditions including the right of return  for
inferior quality or non-compliance with purchase order terms.  Omnirel
inventory is maintained at its principal place of business in storage
facilities with temperature and humidity controls.  Omnirel stocks inven-
tory for standard products, and for certain of its custom products.

Environmental Compliance
- ------------------------

   Omnirel does not use hazardous materials in its manufacturing process
nor does the manufacturing process result in the discharge of potentially
hazardous material.  Omnirel does not expect to incur significant expen-
ditures relating to environmental compliance.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

   Generally, Omnirel's research and development expenditures involve
engineering and design of custom products for specific applications,
development of new packaging techniques and development of packaging for
new semiconductor devices.  Research and development expenditures for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 1995, June 30, 1994 and the nine months ended
June 30, 1993 were $1,055,000, $841,000 and $808,000, respectively or 4.7%,
7.3% and 1.5% of sales in the respective periods.

Employees
- ---------

   As of June 30, 1995, Zing had 157 employees, 102 of whom were employed
by Omnirel in a manufacturing capacity and 34 in clerical, administrative,
engineering or sales positions at Omnirel.  The Company employs five people
in executive or administrative functions, and TACTech employs four computer
programmers and an additional 12 persons in clerical, sales, customer
support and administrative roles.  None of Zing's employees are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement.

   In March 1995, in exchange for Omnirel's president's shares of Omnirel
common stock and his release of his rights to participate in Omnirel's
Management Incentive Rights Plan ("MIRP"), Omnirel granted its president options
to purchase up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Omnirel's common stock
pursuant to Omnirel's 1995 Non-Qualified Stock Option Exchange Plan.  Also
in March 1995 and concurrently with the grant of options to Omnirel's
president, Omnirel granted to other executive employees options to purchase
up to an aggregate of 34,000 shares of Omnirel's common stock pursuant to
Omnirel's 1995 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan in exchange for their MIRP
rights.  Such options were issued with exercise prices equal to or greater to 
the then fair market value of the Omnirel common stock underlying such options.
As a result of such exchange of shares and the option grants described above, 
Zing's direct ownership of Omnirel's outstanding shares increased from 
approximately 96% to approximately 98%; and, on a fully diluted basis, Zing's 
ownership of Omnirel could be reduced to approximately 84%.

Results of Operation - Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994
- ----------------------------------------------------------

   The Company reported income of $2,517,000 or $.94 per share for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1995 as compared to income before extraordinary items of
$162,000 or $.06 per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.  This
increase is principally a reflection of the increased profitability of the
business of its one material subsidiary, Omnirel.

   Consolidated net sales increased to $22,591,000 during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1995 from $11,483,000 for the comparable period.  Omnirel's net sales
in the 1995 fiscal year accounted for 95% of consolidated net sales as compared
to 92% of consolidated net sales in the 1994 fiscal year.  The balance of
consolidated net sales in each period is attributable to operation of the
Company's TACTech subsidiary.


                                       11

   Net sales from the Company's Omnirel subsidiary increased 102% for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 thereby accounting for the significant
increase in consolidated revenues for the reporting period.

   The growth in Omnirel's net sales was largely as a result of an ongoing
order placed by General Electric for multi-chip power module systems
containing power hybrid componentry.  These orders accounted for 63% of
Omnirel's fiscal 1995 sales compared to 16% for the comparable period.

   Net sales in TACTech increased approximately 37% in the fiscal 1995
period compared to the 1994 period due principally to an increase in the
subscriber base and a United States Department of Defense contract.

   Consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 was
$9,518,000 as compared to $4,846,000 for the comparable fiscal period. 
Omnirel's cost of goods sold increased comparably to net sales and remained
essentially constant as a percentage of net sales as the increased ef-
ficiency in usage of manufacturing facilities offset an increase in
material costs and applicable reserves.

   As a result of the increase in revenues, selling and general and
administrative expenses decreased to 28.1% of revenues for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1995 compared to 38.9% for the comparable period.  The 28.1%
ratio was achieved after $391,500 of expenses were incurred in the third
quarter of the 1995 fiscal year relating to the abandonment of a proposed 
restructuring of the Company in which stock of TACTech and Omnirel would 
have been distributed to shareholders of the Company.

   The Company also recorded an increase in depreciation and amortization
expense in the amount of $386,000 due to a change in estimate of the useful
lives of certain machinery and equipment owned by Omnirel due to Omnirel's
accelerated and additional use of its machinery and equipment in manufac-
turing.

   Interest expense declined approximately 50% during the fiscal year 1995
principally due to the Company's retirement in 1994 of all of its Senior
Subordinated Notes, partially offset by an increase in interest charges
during the 1995 fiscal year related to other borrowings of the Company and
Omnirel.

   Interest and other income increased approximately 25% during the 1995
fiscal year principally due to interest and dividend income and the fact
that net realized and unrealized gain on marketable securities amounted to
$27,000 in fiscal 1995 as compared to net realized and unrealized losses of
$74,000 in marketable securities for fiscal 1994.

   Provision for income taxes in fiscal 1995 in the amount of $325,000 was
after giving effect to the Company's utilization of $3,000,000 of the
Company's net operating losses and the related release of valuation
allowances previously established for such losses.  In fiscal 1994, the
Company adopted FASB 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Pursuant to FASB
109, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset, a deferred tax liability
and a valuation allowance account which resulted in the provision for

Results of Operation - Fiscal 1994 Compared to Nine Months Ended June 30, 1993
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Effective April 30, 1993, Zing sold to Arrow Electronics, Inc. the net
assets of its high reliability electronic component distribution and value-
added service businesses operated under the name "Zeus" ("Sold Business"). 
The purchase price was $24,254,000.  This represents a premium of ap-
proximately $3,000,000 over the net book value of the assets being
transferred which represents the value paid for a non-compete agreement. 
Zing is also entitled to receive, three years from the closing of the Arrow
sale, up to $2,000,000 from Arrow as additional purchase price depending on
the performance of Arrow's high reliability electronic components and
value-added business.

   Since the disposition of the Sold Business, the Company's operations are
principally a reflection of the business of its one significant subsidiary,
Omnirel.  The Company also changed its fiscal year at that time to June 30. 
As a consequence of these two changes, management's discussion of the
Company's results of operations are not directly comparable from fiscal
period to fiscal period.  To facilitate understanding of the comparative
results of the Company's ongoing operations, operations of the Company
excluding the Sold Business, as well as operations of the Company on a
fully consolidated basis, are described where practical.

   The Company reported income before extraordinary items of $162,000 or
$.06 per share, for the twelve month period ended June 30, 1994.  For the
nine month transitional fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, which included
results for seven of those months attributable to the Sold Business, the
Company sustained a loss before extraordinary items of $3,468,000 or $1.25
per share.

   Fiscal Year 1994 net income of $215,000 or $.08 per share includes
extraordinary income of $53,000 or $.02 per share representing income
realized from the repurchase by the Company of $11,650,000 face value of
its Senior Subordinated Notes.  The net loss for the 1993 fiscal period was
$3,623,000 or $1.31 per share, inclusive of an extraordinary loss of
$155,000 or $.06 per share representing deferred financing costs realized
from the repurchase by the Company of $1,600,000 face value of its Senior
Subordinated Notes.

   The improvement in 1994 fiscal year operating results compared to 1993
is due to a combination of a greatly reduced loss at Omnirel resulting from
improved sales and gross profit margins and the elimination of the losses
attributable to the Sold Business.  Omnirel sustained a net loss of
$440,000 (including the allocation of $150,000 of administrative overhead)
in the 1994 fiscal year, compared to a net loss of $1,773,000 in the prior
nine month period.

   Net sales for the 1994 period were $11,483,000, comprised primarily of
net sales of Omnirel of $10,586,000; for the nine month 1993 fiscal period,
excluding the Sold Business, consolidated net sales of $6,412,000 were
comprised primarily of Omnirel sales of $5,907,000.  The Company realized a
gross profit on 1994 net sales of $4,846,000 compared to a gross profit of
$2,165,000 on 1993 net sales, exclusive of the Sold Business.   Including
the Sold Business, the Company in 1993 realized gross profits of
$11,978,000 on net sales of $52,602,000.

   The Company's higher gross profit margins in 1994 compared to the prior
fiscal period are due

primarily to Omnirel's improvement in net sales without a comparable
increase in fixed costs, as well as to the elimination of less profitable
sales of Sold Business products.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4,465,000 for the
1994 period and, excluding the Sold Business, $3,001,000 for the June 30,
1993 fiscal period.  While Omnirel's expenses declined from 1993 to 1994 as
a percentage of its net sales, the company's increased as a percentage of
sales on a consolidated basis.  The Company's net sales declined much more
sharply, because of the elimination of the Sold Business in 1993, than did
consolidated selling expenses.  Corporate overhead is therefore allocated
in 1994 against a smaller revenue base than in 1993.

   Interest expense declined in 1994 compared to 1993 as a result of the
redemption by the Company of its Senior Subordinated Notes.

   As of July 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accou-
nting for Income Taxes".  This standard requires companies to change the
method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred to the liability
method.  As permitted under the statements, the Company has elected not to
restate the financial statements of prior years.  The adoption of FASB
Statement No. 109, on the 1994 year's operations is discussed in Note G to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

   In the 1995 fiscal year, the Company employed most of its cash and cash
equivalents in the acquisition of marketable securities.  Omnirel's
operations in fiscal 1995 were funded from internally generated cash and
available bank lines of credit.  During the 1995 fiscal year, Omnirel
reduced its intercompany debt owed to the Company by $1,930,000.

   In the 1994 fiscal year, the Company employed most of its cash and cash
equivalents, which were the proceeds of the 1993 sale of the Sold Business
to Arrow, to redeem its remaining Senior Subordinated Notes and to acquire
marketable securities.  Omnirel's operations, however, are funded from
internally generated cash, from intercompany borrowing, and from available
bank lines of credit.  

Impact of Inflation
- -------------------

   Inflation did not have significant impact on the operations of the
Company for all periods presented.

ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Shareholders and Board of Directors 
Zing Technologies, Inc.
Valhalla, New York


   We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of Zing Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries listed in
the accompanying index to the financial statements (Item 14(a)).  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the accompanying
index to financial statements (Item 14(a)) present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Zing Technologies, Inc.
and subsidiaries at June 30, 1995 and 1994 and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1995 and
June 30, 1994 and the nine months ended June 30, 1993 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

   As discussed in Note G to the consolidated financial statements, in 1994
the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
         -----------------------------------------------------------

   Business Segment Information: The Company operates primarily in one
business segment - sales of high reliability power semiconductor multi-chip
modules for use in military/aerospace and high-end industrial applications. 
The Company also markets a turnkey software package and database of
pertinent component information.  Prior to the sale described in Note B,
the Company also distributed semiconductors and passive components.

   Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  All sig-
nificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

   Revenue Recognition:  The Company recognizes sales at the time of
shipment/services provided.  Consistent with industry practice, Omnirel
warrants that its products are free from defects in workmanship and meet
the agreed upon specifications supplied by the customer or Omnirel's
current published specifications.  As of June 30, 1995, the Company has a
$343,000 warranty reserve.

   Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The Company considers all short-term liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
cash equivalents.

   Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out method) or market.

   Marketable Securities: In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accou-
nting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, " effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.  Under the new rules,
debt securities that the Company has both the positive intent and ability
to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost.  Debt securities that
the Company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available-
for-sale or trading and carried at fair value.  Unrealized holding gains
and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are carried as a
separate component of shareholders' equity.  Unrealized holding gains and
losses on securities classified as trading are reported in earnings.

    As of the beginning of fiscal 1995, the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement 115 and such adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial statements.

leased under capital leases, are stated at cost and are depreciated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
ranging from three to twenty five years.  Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the service lives of
the improvements, whichever is shorter.  The Company recorded an increase
in depreciation and amortization expense in the amount of $386,000 due to a
change in estimate of the useful lives of certain machinery and equipment
owned by Omnirel due to Omnirel's accelerated and additional use of its
machinery and equipment in manufacturing.


    Excess of Cost Over Assets Acquired:  The excess cost over assets
acquired is being amortized over fifteen years.  The Company periodically
reviews the carrying value of the excess of cost over assets acquired for
recoverability in relation to future earnings.

    Net Income Per Common and Common Equivalent Share:  Net income per
common and common equivalent share is based on the weighted average number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each period, including the
Common Stock equivalents of dilutive stock warrants.

Note C - Acquisition
         -----------


    On June 26, 1991, the Company acquired substantially all (approximately
96%) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Omnirel
Corporation ("Omnirel").  

    Under the terms of certain shareholder agreements, Omnirel has agreed
to and, in certain instances, may be required to repurchase the minority
shareholders' interest in Omnirel, at a formula price based on the fair
value, as defined, of the Omnirel stock or earnings.  In addition, Omnirel
established an Incentive Rights Plan ("Rights") whereby various members of
management have been granted rights, contingent upon attaining certain
earnings levels or other events, to appreciation in the market value of 20%
of the Omnirel's common stock, as defined, subject to certain forfeiture
and adjustment provisions.  The Rights were terminated in the 1995 fiscal
year.

    In connection with the acquisition, the Company loaned $250,000 to an
officer/director of Omnirel and the Company, to purchase Common Stock of
the Company on the open market, in exchange for a non-interest bearing
note.  The note is due July 1, 2001, is secured by the Company's Common
Stock, and is classified as a reduction of equity.  Subsequent to June 30,
1995, $80,000 of this note was repaid.  The Company also loaned the
officer/director $300,000 ($60,000 balance at June 30, 1995) in exchange
for a non-interest bearing note due in five equal annual installments,
commencing June 26, 1992, with interest imputed at an effective annual rate
of 9%.

Footnote (a) to table on prior page --  Omnirel has $972,000 outstanding
against the equipment line of credit at June 30, 1995.  Interest is payable
at the bank's prime rate plus 3/4% (10 1/2% at June 30, 1995).  The bank
has a security interest in the equipment purchased (which has a carrying
amount of $1,472,000 at June 30, 1995).  The new debt included a $300,000
line of credit payable on demand and a $1,200,000 equipment line of credit
payable over five years from respective draw downs with interest at the
bank's prime rate plus 1 1/2%.  The annual payment requirements for long-
term obligations subsequent to June 30, 1995 are as follows:

                         1996              $231
                         1997               230

                         2000                50

   The Company made interest payments of $1,003,000 during the nine months
ended 1993 and $286,000 during the year ended 1994 and $148,000 during the
year ended 1995.

   In fiscal 1993, the Company repurchased $1,600,000 face value of its 12
1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes for $1,548,000 and wrote off $25,000 in
corresponding deferred note issuance cost.  Further, the Company repur-
chased the remainder of the bonds ($11,650,000), and in connection
therewith wrote off the balance of the deferred financing costs resulting
in an extraordinary charge of $155,000 (1993) and realized an extraordinary
credit of $53,000 (1994).

Note G - Income Taxes
         ------------

   As of July 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accou-
nting for Income Taxes."  Under Statement No. 109, the liability  method is
used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse.  Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 109, 
income tax expense was determined using the deferred method.  Deferred tax
expense was based on items of income and expense that were reported in
different years in the financial statements and tax returns and were
measured at the tax rate in effect when the difference originated.

   At June 26, 1991 Omnirel had available approximately $6,230,000 of net
operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes.  As a result
of the adoption of Statement No. 109, the excess  of  cost over assets
acquired was reduced by approximately  $1,275,000.

non-current marketable equity securities was $1,539,000 and $3,467,000,
respectively.  During fiscal 1994, the Company engaged in short selling which
obligated the Company to replace the securities borrowed by purchasing the
identical securities at its then current market value.

     Net realized gains of $357,000 and losses of $74,000 on the sale of
marketable securities were included in the determination of net income for the
years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The cost of securities sold
was based on the first-in first-out method.

     For the year ended June 30, 1995, net unrealized losses of $335,000 were 
charged to income of which $307,000 was recorded during the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 1995 as a reduction in the market value of the non-current marketable 
equity securities portfolio which reduction was deemed to be other than 
temporary.

     To reduce the carrying amount of the current marketable equity securities
to market, which was lower than cost at June 30, 1994, a valuation allowance of
$42,000 (including gross gains of $32,000) was established with a corresponding
charge to net income.  To reduce the carrying amount of the non-current
marketable equity securities to market, which was lower than cost at June 30,
1994, a valuation allowance in the amount of $288,000 was established by a
charge to stockholders' equity.
