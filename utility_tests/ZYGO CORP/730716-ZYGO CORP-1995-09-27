                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business

                                   THE COMPANY

         Zygo Corporation (the "Company" or "Zygo"),  which was founded in 1970,
designs  develops,   manufactures,   and  markets  high-performance   noncontact
electro-optical measuring instruments and accessories,  and manufactures optical
components  to precise  tolerances  both for sale and for use as key elements in
its  own  products.   The  Company  operates  in  a  single  business   segment,
electro-optics,  and offers products which fall into two general categories: (1)
instruments and accessories and (2) precision optical components.  The Company's
business   strategy  is  to  select  market  segments  which  it  believes  have
significant growth potential and in which Zygo can reasonably expect to become a
leading  manufacturer;  to achieve and maintain a  leadership  position by using
distinctive  technologies  to provide  products  offering high  performance  and
quality;    and   to   maintain   its   position    through    customer-specific
applications-oriented   engineering   and  marketing.   The  Company   dedicates
substantial  resources  to  research  and  product  development  to enable it to
compete effectively in its market areas.

         The Company markets and sells its products  worldwide  through a direct
sales force and through independent distributors and sales representatives.  The
Company's  products  are sold to a broad  range of end  users,  including  major
corporations  and government  facilities.  Zygo competes on the basis of product
performance, applications engineering, customer support, reputation, and price.

         Almost all of the Company's instruments and accessories have the common
characteristic that they employ a laser or white light source to make noncontact
measurements.  Using light to achieve measurements requires specific techniques.
A  primary  technique  used  in  many  of  the  Company's   instruments  is  the
interference of light. There are a number of different generic instruments based
on  interference   of  light  and  therefore   called   interferometers.   These
interferometers  are used to measure the surface  shape,  surface  roughness  or
distance and position of an object or to provide  information about the object's
effect upon light transmitted through it.

         One type or class of interferometric measurement instruments is used by
companies and  laboratories  to measure,  align,  and inspect optics and optical
assemblies.  In industries which make or use ultra-precision  parts, such as the
electronics  industry,  such measurement products are used to inspect read/write
heads, to assemble CD laser pickups,  and to examine recording media. To be able
to  measure  parts  of  various  shapes  and  sizes,  it is  necessary  to offer
instruments of various  apertures ranging from an instrument with a beam size of
almost a meter to an instrument  which is  effectively a microscope.  Zygo has a
significant share of the market for such measurement products. Zygo has a number
of  competitors,   with  WYKO  Corporation  (Tucson,  Arizona)  being  the  most
significant one.

         Another type of interferometer is a distance  measuring  interferometer
system (DMI) which precisely  measures linear and angular  displacements.  There
are important and expanding  applications for such  instrumentation.  One is for
accurately  measuring  and  controlling -- while they are in motion -- the X, Y,
and  theta  stages  in  microlithography   equipment  that  is  used  in  making
semiconductors   and  flat-panel  video  displays.   Another  is  for  precisely
positioning  the write heads of servo track  writers  used to  manufacture  hard
disks for  computers.  Zygo's  DMI  products  compete  primarily  with  those of
Hewlett-Packard, which, it is estimated, is presently the market leader for such
products.

         Optical components are custom optics manufactured to customers' designs
and  specifications.  Zygo's fabrication  capabilities  include  ultra-precision
plano, spherical,  and precision machining of complex structural shapes. Optical
components are sold  principally on a competitive  bid basis and  competition is
intense.  However,  the Company  competes  primarily in the market for extremely
high-precision  optical  components where  reliability,  quality,  and technical
performance are the key criteria in the customer's purchase decision,  and where
price  may be a  secondary  factor.  This  industry  consists  of  many  optical
fabricators with which the Company  competes,  including Eastman Kodak Co., Bond
Optics, Inc., General Optics, Inc., and Continental Optics.

         The   following   table   shows  the  past  three   years  of  relative
contributions of instruments and accessories and precision optical components to
consolidated sales.

              PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS AND OPERATIONS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA

         Information  regarding  the  principal  customers  of the  Company  and
operations by geographic area for the years ended June 30, 1995, 1994, and 1993,
is included in note 10 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements on page 20
of the  Company's  1995  Annual  Report,  which note is  incorporated  herein by
reference.

         Export sales constituted  approximately  46%, 46%, and 38% of total net
sales for fiscal  years 1995,  1994,  and 1993,  respectively.  The  majority of
export sales have been in Japan,  Western  Europe,  and the Pacific  Rim.  Canon
Sales  Co.,  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of Canon  Inc.  (a major  stockholder  of the
Company),  is Zygo's  exclusive  distributor for sales in Japan.  Sales to Canon
Inc. and to Canon Sales Co., Inc.  accounted for approximately 30%, 32%, and 20%
of total Company net sales in fiscal years 1995,  1994, and 1993,  respectively.
In fiscal  1995 a leading  manufacturer  of  computer  disk  drives and  related
hardware and software  accounted  for  approximately  17% of the  Company's  net
sales. In fiscal 1993 sales to the University of Rochester of precision  optical
components accounted for approximately 12% of the Company's net sales.

                                     BACKLOG

         The Company's  backlog at June 30, 1995,  and 1994,  was  approximately
$12.9 million and $3.8 million,  respectively. The significant increase from the
prior  year  end  resulted  primarily  from  strong  demand  for  the  Company's
instrument products, particularly its distance measuring interferometers used in
motion control  applications  primarily in the semiconductor  industry,  and the
Company's  microscope  products  used in many  applications  in the  disk  drive
industry,  in particular  the Company's  Automated Air Bearing  analysis  system
which provides fully automated quantified measurement and analysis of read-write
heads.  Substantially  all of the backlog as of June 30, 1995, is expected to be
shipped in fiscal year 1996.  Historically,  cancellation or reduction of orders
has not had a significant impact on the Company's results of operations.

                         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

         Information  regarding the Company's  research and development costs is
set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on page 14 of the Company's
1995 Annual Report,  which statements are herein incorporated by reference.  The
Company  operates in an industry that is subject to rapid  technological  change
and  engineering  innovation.  Because the Company  believes that its ability to
compete  effectively in its markets depends in part on maintaining its expertise
in applying new technologies and developing new products,  the Company dedicates
substantial  resources  to research and  development.  During the second half of
fiscal 1995 the Company formed an R&D facility in Simi Valley,  California,  for
the purpose of developing  test and  measurement  instruments for the disk drive
industry.  The first such  product  development  effort at the new  facility  is
focused  on flying  height  testing.  The  Company  plans to  continue  spending
approximately  the  same  percentage  of net  sales  for  research  and  product
development  as it did in the  last  half  of  fiscal  1995.  Development  costs
associated  with  applications  engineering  or customer  paid  development  are
included in cost of goods sold,  the  majority of which  relate to research  and
development contracts with Canon Inc. (See Management's  Discussion and Analysis
of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition on page 10 of the Company's
1995 Annual Report, which information is incorporated herein by reference.)

                         PATENTS, LICENSES, TRADEMARKS,
                           AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

         The Company seeks to obtain  patents to protect  novel  features of its
products.  The Company holds 48 United States patents and 9 foreign patents, and
has 7 United  States  patent  applications  and 9  foreign  patent  applications
pending.  While these patents may enhance the Company's  competitive position in
certain  areas,  management  believes  that the Company  also depends upon trade
secrets,  the innovative skills of its technical  personnel,  the quality of its
products,  and its production and marketing  skills to maintain its  competitive
position.  The  Company  believes  that no part of its  business  is  materially
dependent upon its patents.  Zygo, the Zygo logo, and Maxim o3D are  registered,
and the Company also holds several nonregistered trademarks including Maxim oGP,
NewView 100, Growth Potential Interferometer, GPI, and ZMI-1000.

                       RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

         The Company's manufacturing operations are vertically integrated,  with
limited reliance on outside vendors for critical parts or services.  Most of the
components  purchased for use in the Company's  products are available from more
than one  supplier.  To date,  the Company  has not  experienced  a  significant
production delay from a parts shortage or loss of a single-source component.

                                    EMPLOYEES

         At fiscal year end, the Company employed 210 men and women.

Item 2.  Properties (land and facility owned)

         Company's manufacturing and administrative facility -
             Laurel Brook Road, Middlefield, Connecticut.
             Land Area:  Approximately 13 acres.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

         On June 29, 1988, the Company filed suit in the U.S.  District Court in
Arizona  against WYKO  Corporation for patent  infringement  based on the belief
that the WYKO 6000  interferometer  infringed  certain patents owned by Zygo. On
March 1, 1993, the United States District Court (District of Arizona) rendered a
Memorandum  Opinion and Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the matter of
the patent suit. The  conclusions of the court were that Zygo's patent is valid,
the WYKO  Model  6000  interferometer  infringes  the  Zygo  patent,  that  WYKO
Corporation is liable to Zygo  Corporation for any damages  suffered as a result
of WYKO's infringement of Zygo's patents by making,  selling, and using the WYKO
Model 6000  interferometer,  and that the amount of the  monetary  judgment  and
other relief shall be determined  following a trial on the issue of damages. The
damage phase trial was held from  November 29, 1993,  through  December 6, 1993.
The Court rendered its judgment on June 2, 1994, awarding the Company $2,668,710
plus recovery of certain costs to be awarded by the Court which were incurred by
the Company in connection  with the conduct of the trial and entered a permanent
injunction  prohibiting  further  sales of the WYKO Model  6000  interferometers
found to infringe.  An appeal of the District Court's decision was filed by WYKO
on August 9, 1994,  with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit located in
Washington,  D.C.  The oral  argument  of the  appeal  was heard by the Court of
Appeals on March 9, 1995.  No ruling has been  rendered by the Court of Appeals.
The Company has not recorded any gain from the District  Court's ruling and will
not until a final determination of the award is made.

                               PROFIT SHARING PLAN

                                  INTRODUCTION

     The Zygo  Corporation  Profit Sharing Plan was adopted by the Company as of
July 1, 1973. A tax credit  employee  stock  ownership plan feature was added to
the Zygo  Corporation  Profit Sharing Plan as of July 1, 1984.  Contributions of
Company common stock were last made to the employee stock  ownership  portion of
the Plan for the Plan Year  ended June 30,  1986.  The Zygo  Corporation  Profit
Sharing  Plan is hereby  amended and restated in its  entirety,  effective as of
July 1, 1989 (or such other date or dates otherwise  specified  herein) in order
to  satisfy  the  applicable  provisions  of the Tax  Reform  Act of  1986,  the
Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, the Revenue  Reconciliation Act
of 1989, the Revenue  Reconciliation Act of 1990, the Unemployment  Compensation
Amendments of 1992, and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.


                                    ARTICLE 1

                                   DEFINITIONS

     Wherever  used herein,  the masculine  includes the feminine,  the singular
includes the plural,  and the following terms have the following meanings unless
a different meaning is clearly required by the context.

     1.1.  "Account"  or  "Accounts"  means  any one or more of the  bookkeeping
accounts  established  and maintained  hereunder,  representing a  Participant's
interest in the Trust Fund.


<PAGE>

     1.2.   "Administrative   Committee"  means  the  administrative   committee
appointed hereunder to administer the Plan.

     1.3.  "Affiliate" means any entity (whether or not incorporated)  which, by
reason of its relationship  with the Company,  is required to be aggregated with
the Company under Section 414(b), 414(c), 414(m) or 414(o) of the Code.

     1.4.  "Beneficiary" means any person entitled to receive benefits under the
Plan by reason of the death of a Participant, former Participant or Beneficiary.

     1.5. "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

     1.6.  "Break in Service" means a Plan Year during which an individual  does
not  complete  more  than 500  Hours  of  Service.  Solely  for the  purpose  of
determining  whether a Break in Service occurs, an individual who is absent from
work because of the individual's pregnancy, the birth of the individual's child,
the  adoption  of a child by the  individual,  or the  care of the  individual's
newborn or newly adopted child, will be credited with the Hours of Service which
would  otherwise  have been  credited in the Plan Year in which the absence from
work begins if such crediting is necessary to prevent a Break in Service in that
Plan Year or, if not, in the following Plan Year.

     1.7.  "Code" means the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as it now exists and
as it is hereafter amended.

     1.8. "Company" means Zygo Corporation.

     1.9.  "Compensation"  means all cash compensation paid by an Employer to an
Employee  during a Plan Year which is  required  to be  reported as wages on the
Participant's  Form W-2 and such additional  amounts which are not includable in
the  Participant's  gross  income  during  said  Plan  Year  by  reason  of  the
application of Section 402(a)(8) of the Code, exclusive of commissions, bonuses,
overtime pay or other irregular compensation. Compensation in excess of $200,000
($150,000 for Plan Years  beginning after June 30, 1994), or such greater amount

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

as may be provided by Section  401(a)(17) of the Code,  will be disregarded  for
all purposes under the Plan.

     1.10. "Elective Contributions" means 401(k) contributions for a Participant
pursuant to the Participant's salary reduction election.

     1.11. "Employee" means an individual who regularly performs services for an

nonresident  alien and who  receives  no income from  sources  within the United
States.  Individuals  who are leased  employees  within  the  meaning of Section
414(n)(2) of the Code or who are  temporary  employees  will be deemed not to be
Employees  for purposes of the Plan.  For purposes of the Plan, an individual is
deemed to  regularly  perform  services  for an Employer if such  individual  is
expected to perform 1,000 hours of service each year.

     1.12.  "Employer" means the Company and any Affiliate which adopts the Plan
with the consent of the Board.

     1.13. "Employer Matching  Contributions" means matching  contributions made

accordance with Section 3.3 of the Plan.

     1.14.  "Employer Profit Sharing  Contributions"  means contributions (other
than qualified  nonelective  contributions and Employer Matching  Contributions)
made by an Employer in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Plan.

     1.15. "ERISA" means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
it now exists and as it is hereafter amended.

     1.16. "Highly Compensated  Employee" means an Employee described in Section
414(q) of the Code who is eligible to participate in the Plan.

     1.17. "Hour of Service" means:

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

          (a) each hour for which an individual  is directly or indirectly  paid
     or entitled to payment by the Company or an Affiliate  for the  performance
     of services;

          (b) each hour for which an  individual  is paid or entitled to payment
     directly or  indirectly by the Company or an Affiliate on account of his or
     her  absence  due to  vacation,  holiday,  illness,  incapacity  (including
     disability),  layoff,  jury  duty,  military  duty  or  leave  of  absence,
     provided,  however,  that an individual shall be credited with no more than
     501 Hours of Service in respect of any continuous period of absence; and

          (c) any additional hours for which back pay is awarded or agreed to by
     an Employer,  irrespective of mitigation of damages, which additional hours
     will be credited  to the period or periods to which the award or  agreement
     pertains rather than the period in which the award, agreement or payment is
     made (limited to 501 hours for a period during which the individual did not
     or would not have performed duties).

The  provisions  of  Section  2530.200(b)  of  the  regulations  issued  by  the
Department  of Labor  are  incorporated  herein by  reference  for  purposes  of
computing and crediting  Hours of Service for reasons other than the performance
of duties. No Hours of Service will be taken into account in respect of a period
described in Section  2500.200b-2(b)(3)  of the Department of Labor regulations.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  an  individual  will be credited with Hours of
Service  during a period of active  duty  with the  armed  forces of the  United
States  (based upon the number of hours which would have been worked during that
period)  if he or she  returns  to  active  employment  with the  Company  or an
Affiliate and actually performs an Hour of Service within the period provided by
law for the  protection  of his or her  re-employment  rights.  If an individual

                                       -4-

<PAGE>

incurs five  consecutive  Breaks in Service before having any vested interest in
his or her Account attributable to Employer contributions which are subject to a
vesting  condition,  then his or her  Hours  of  Service  prior to the  Break in
Service  will be  disregarded  for all purposes  hereof  relating to vesting and
eligibility  to participate  in such Employer  contributions  after the Break in
Service.

     1.18.  "Investment  Fund" means any one or more of the separate  investment
funds designated by the Administrative Committee for investment of the assets of
the Trust Fund (including,  without limitation, each separate fund maintained by
a  registered  investment  company,  if  any,  selected  by  the  Administrative
Committee).

     1.19.  "Non-Highly  Compensated Employee" means an Employee who is eligible
to participate in the Plan and who is neither a Highly Compensated  Employee nor
a family member of a Highly Compensated  Employee (within the meaning of Section
414(q)(6)(B) of the Code).

     1.20.  "Normal Retirement Date" means the date on which an Employee attains
age 65.

     1.21.  "Participant"  means  an  Employee  participating  in  the  Plan  in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

     1.22.  "Plan"  means the profit  sharing  plan as set forth  herein and any
amendments thereto.

     1.23.  "Plan  Year" means each  twelve-month  period  beginning  July 1 and
ending June 30.

     1.24.  "Tax  Credit  ESOP  Account"  means  the  account  maintained  for a
Participant  to reflect  the Company  stock,  if any,  held for the  Participant
pursuant to the tax credit employee stock ownership provisions of the Plan.

     1.25.  "Trust" means the trust  established  and  maintained as part of the
Plan.

                                       -5-

<PAGE>

     1.26.  "Trustee"  means the person or  persons  (including  a  corporation)
appointed and acting as trustee of the Trust.

     1.27.  "Trust Fund" means the assets of the Plan  consisting of the amounts
held in the Investment Funds.

     1.28.  "Valuation Date" means the last day of each Plan Year and such other
date or dates as the Administrative Committee (acting in its absolute discretion
and in a nondiscriminatory  manner) may determine for valuing any one or more of
the Investment Funds or the Trust Fund or a Participant's Account.

     1.29. "Year of Vesting Service" means a Plan Year in which an individual is
credited  with at least 1,000 Hours of Service for the Company or an  Affiliate,
whether or not as an Employee,  excluding Hours of Service before the individual
reaches  age 18. If an  individual  incurs  five  consecutive  Breaks in Service
before being fully vested in his or her Account,  then Years of Vesting  Service
(if any) after the Break in  Service  will be  disregarded  in  determining  the
individual's vested interest in his or her Account attributable to contributions
made before the Break in Service.


                                    ARTICLE 2

                                  PARTICIPATION

     2.1. General Participation Requirement. An Employee will automatically be a
Participant  on  July  1,  1989  (the  restatement  date)  if  he or  she  was a
Participant  in the Plan on June 30,  1989.  Any other  Employee  will  become a
Participant  on the first day of the  calendar  quarter  (starting  with July 1,
1989)  coincident  with or next following the date which is six months after the
date on  which  the  Employee  first  completes  an Hour of  Service;  provided,
however,  that, except as otherwise provided herein, an individual who is not an

                                       -6-

<PAGE>

Employee on that quarterly entry date will initially become a Participant on the
next succeeding date on which he or she is an Employee.

     2.2.  Re-employment  Rules. A former Employee who was a Participant and who
again becomes an Employee  will again become a  Participant  on the first day of
the calendar  quarter  coincident with or next following the date on which he or
she again completes an Hour of Service as an Employee;  provided, however, that,
with respect to Employer  contributions,  a nonvested former  Participant  whose
prior Hours of Service are  permanently  disregarded  (under the  definition  of
"Hour of  Service")  will be treated as a new  employee  when he or she  resumes
employment and again completes an Hour of Service.


                                    ARTICLE 3

     (a) Salary Reduction Election. Each Employee who is a Participant may elect

designated  percentage  must be at least 1% and may not be more  than  15%.  The
total amount of a Participant's  Elective  Contributions for a calendar year may
not be more than $7,000 (adjusted as provided by Section 402(g)(1) of the Code).

     (b) Contribution to Trust. The Employer will pay Elective  Contributions to

     (c)  Procedural  Rules.  Salary  reduction  elections  must be made on such
forms, and may be modified,  revoked or suspended subject to such advance notice
as may be reasonably required by the Administrative  Committee at such times and
in  accordance  with such  procedures  as may be  prescribed or permitted by the
Administrative  Committee  acting in a  uniform  and  nondiscriminatory  manner,
provided,  however,  that no more  than one  such  modification,  revocation  or
suspension  will be processed in any calendar  month. A  Participant's  election
will  terminate  when  the  Participant  ceases  to  be an  Employee,  and a new
withholding  election  must be  filed if he or she  wishes  to  resume  Elective
Contributions after again becoming an Employee.

     3.2. Qualified  Nonelective Employer  Contributions.  For any Plan Year, an
Employer,  acting  in its sole  discretion,  may  contribute  to the  Trust  for
allocation to the Account(s) of one or more Non-Highly  Compensated Employees an
amount necessary to enable the Plan to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) of the Code for
such Plan Year. Any such contributions will be treated as Elective Contributions
for all purposes  hereof except for the purpose of determining  eligibility  for
and the amount of any Employer Matching Contributions.

     3.3.  Employer  Matching  Contributions.  For each Plan Year, the Employer,
acting  in its sole  discretion,  may  declare  and  contribute  to the Trust an
Employer Matching  Contribution with respect to the Elective  Contributions made
by a Participant during the Plan Year;  provided,  however,  that, except to the
extent  necessary to comply with Section 401(m) of the Code,  Employer  Matching
Contributions,  if any, may only be made with respect to Elective  Contributions
of those  Participants  who are  Employees  on the last day of the Plan  Year of
reference. Employer Matching Contributions,  if any, will be paid to the Trustee
in cash and/or in shares of common  stock of the Company and will be credited to

                                       -8-

<PAGE>

Participants'  Accounts  in  accordance  with the  provisions  hereof as soon as
practicable after they are made.

     3.4.  Employer  Profit  Sharing  Contributions.  In  addition  to any other
contributions  under the Plan,  the Employer may declare and  contribute  to the
Trust for each  Plan  Year a  discretionary  non-matching  contribution  in such
amount  (if at  all)  as  the  Employer,  acting  in its  sole  discretion,  may
determine.  The Employer  Profit Sharing  Contribution  for a Plan Year (if any)
will be  allocated  as of the last day of the Plan Year  among the  Accounts  of
those  Participants  who are  Employees on the last day of the Plan Year and who
have  completed  at least  1,000  Hours of  Service  during the Plan Year in the
proportion that each such Participant's  Compensation for the Plan Year bears to
the total  Compensation  of all such  Participants  for the Plan Year.  Employer
Profit Sharing Contributions, if any, will be paid to the Trustee in cash and/or
in shares of common  stock of the Company and will be credited to  Participants'
Accounts in accordance with the provisions  hereof as soon as practicable  after
they are made.

     3.5. Employer Profit Sharing  Contribution of the Value of Unused Sick Pay.
For each Plan Year beginning  after June 30, 1994,  the Employer,  acting in its
sole discretion,  but in a uniform and nondiscriminatory  manner, may contribute
to the Trust on behalf of each Participant who is an Employee on the last day of
the Plan Year an amount up to the value of the unused  sick pay with  respect to
such  Participant for the Plan Year,  limited,  however,  to not more than three
days.  Any such  contributions  will be paid to the  Trustee  in cash  and/or in
shares of common stock of the Company and will be credited to the  Participants'
Accounts as of the last day of the Plan Year in accordance  with the  provisions
hereof as soon as practicable after they are made.

                                       -9-

<PAGE>

     3.6. Allocation of Forfeitures.  If a Participant  forfeits any part of his
or her  interest in the Plan,  the amount of the  forfeiture  (to the extent not
used to restore a prior  forfeiture for a re-employed  Participant in accordance
with the provisions hereof) will be allocated to eligible Participants' Accounts
as if such amount were an Employer Profit Sharing Contribution for the Plan Year
in which such forfeiture arises.

     3.7.   Voluntary   After-Tax   Contributions.   No  Participant   after-tax
contributions may be made or accepted under the Plan.

     3.8. Rollover Contributions. Subject to such rules as may be established by
the Administrative  Committee,  an Employee may make a rollover  contribution to
the Trust of (a) part or all of a  distribution  received from another  employee
benefit trust  described in Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code,  (b) part or all of a  distribution  received from a
qualified employee annuity plan described in Section 403(a)(1) of the Code which
meets the  requirements  of  Section  404(a)(2)  of the Code,  or (c) the entire
amount  received  (including  money and any other  property)  from an individual
retirement  account.  Any rollover  contribution  must meet the income  deferral
requirements  of  the  Code   (including  the  requirement   that  the  rollover
contribution  be  made  no  later  than  60 days  after  the  day on  which  the
Participant  received the payment or distribution from the other plan or account
in the  case of a  rollover  which is not a direct  rollover  from a  transferor
plan). The  Administrative  Committee and/or the Trustee may require an Employee
to furnish any relevant  information or documentation and to make any reasonable
representations  concerning  the  distribution  from the prior  plan or  account
before  deciding  whether  to accept a  rollover  contribution.  The amount of a
rollover  contribution shall be credited to the Participant's  Account and shall
equal the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of the property transferred
(subject to the right of the  Administrative  Committee or the Trustee to refuse

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

to accept  property),  determined as of the date the property is received by the
Trustee.

     3.9.  Transfers  from Other Plans.  Subject to the provisions of applicable
law, the Administrative  Committee may permit assets of other qualified plans to
be  transferred  to the Trust in a  plan-to-plan  transfer  other  than a direct
rollover.  The plan administrator  and/or plan trustee of a transferor plan will
furnish a breakdown of the assets being  transferred so that those assets can be
properly  allocated  to  corresponding  Accounts  established   hereunder.   The
Administrative  Committee  shall  take  such  action  as  may  be  necessary  or
appropriate in order to separately account for the assets of a transferror plan.
The accrued benefits of a transferor plan's  participants and the optional forms
of benefit  available  to those  participants  with  respect to the  transferred
assets will be preserved  hereunder to the extent  required by the provisions of
applicable  law.  If assets are  transferred  to the Trust from the trustee of a
trust maintained under another plan and if a determination is subsequently  made
that the  transferor  plan is not qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code or
that the  asset  transfer  is  otherwise  not  permissible,  then the  assets so
transferred, together with earnings (or reduced by losses), will be returned and
will be deemed to have been held by the  Trustee  in  separate  trust and not as
part of the Trust Fund.

     3.10.  Distribution  of Excess  Deferrals.  If, on or before March 1 of any
year, a Participant  notifies the  Administrative  Committee that all or part of
the  Elective  Contributions  made for his or her benefit  during the  preceding
taxable year  represents an excess deferral within the meaning of Section 402(g)
of the Code,  then the  Administrative  Committee  will cause the amount of such
excess  deferral to be distributed to the  Participant by the April 15 following
such notification.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

     3.11.  Return of  Contributions.  If a  contribution  by an Employer to the
Trust is (a) made by reason of a good faith  mistake of fact, or (b) believed by
the Employer in good faith to be deductible  under Section 404 of the Code,  but
the deduction is disallowed,  then the Trustee shall return to the  contributing
Employer the amount of the mistaken or nondeductible  contribution.  In no event
may the return of an Employer  contribution  cause the value of a  Participant's
interest  in the Trust to be reduced to an amount  which is less than the amount
it would have been had the mistaken or nondeductible contribution not been made.
The return of a  contribution  hereunder  must be made within one year after the
mistaken  contribution  is made or the deduction is disallowed,  as the case may
be.

                          LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS

     4.1. Statutory Nondiscrimination Requirements.

     (a) Elective  Contributions.  Elective  Contributions  for a Plan Year must
satisfy either of the following tests:

          (1) the average of the individual ratios (expressed as percentages) of
     Elective Contributions to Compensation (the "deferral percentages") for the
     Plan Year for all Highly Compensated Employees is not more than 125% of the
     average  of  the  deferral  percentages  for  all  Non-Highly   Compensated
     Employees; or

          (2) the average of the deferral percentages for all Highly Compensated
     Employees  is not more than twice the average of the  deferral  percentages
     for all Non-Highly Compensated  Employees,  and the average of the deferral

                                      -12-

<PAGE>



     percentages  for all  Highly  Compensated  Employees  does not  exceed  the
     average  of  the  deferral  percentages  for  all  Non-Highly   Compensated
     Employees by more than 2%.

Subject to the provisions of applicable  law, the  Administrative  Committee may
treat Employer Matching  Contributions for a Plan Year as Elective Contributions
if and to the  extent  such  treatment  would  enable  the Plan to  satisfy  the
provisions of this Section for the Plan Year and solely for that purpose.

     (b) Employer Matching Contributions.  Employer Matching Contributions for a
Plan Year must satisfy either of the following tests:

          (1) the average of the individual ratios (expressed as percentages) of
     the   Employer   Matching   Contributions   to  Total   Compensation   (the
     "contribution  percentages")  for the Plan Year for all Highly  Compensated
     Employees  is not  more  than  125%  of  the  average  of the  contribution
     percentages for all Non-Highly Compensated Employees; or

          (2)  the  average  of the  contribution  percentages  for  all  Highly
     Compensated   Employees   is  not  more  than  twice  the  average  of  the
     contribution  percentages for all Non-Highly Compensated Employees, and the
     average  of  the  contribution   percentages  for  all  Highly  Compensated
     Employees does not exceed the average of the  contribution  percentages for
     all Non-Highly  Compensated  Employees by more than 2% (provided,  however,
     that this clause 2 will not apply to the extent required by law in order to
     prevent  prohibited  multiple use of the 200%/2%  deferral  percentage  and
     contribution percentage nondiscrimination tests).

Subject to the provisions of applicable  law, the  Administrative  Committee may
treat  pre-tax  Elective  Contributions  for a Plan  Year as  Employer  Matching
Contributions if  and to the  extent such  treatment would  enable the  Plan  to

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

satisfy the provisions of this Section and solely for that purpose.

     4.2. Modification of Contribution Elections.  The Administrative  Committee
may modify a Participant's salary reduction election in order to enable the Plan
to  satisfy  the   limitations  of  applicable  law  with  respect  to  Elective
Contributions  and Employer  Matching  Contributions,  including the limitations
prescribed by Sections  401(k)(3),  401(m),  402(g)(1) and 415 of the Code.  The
modification  of a Participant's  election may not result in increased  Elective
Contributions for the Participant without his or her consent.

     4.3.  Excess  Elective  Contributions.  If  the  average  of  the  deferral
percentages for Highly Compensated  Employees for a Plan Year exceeds the amount
permitted  for that Plan Year,  then the excess will be eliminated in the manner
provided in this Section. First, in accordance with the provisions of applicable
law, the deferral percentages of some or all of the Highly Compensated Employees
will be  reduced  (in  descending  order  starting  with  the  highest  deferral
percentages)  until the  average  of the  deferral  percentages  for the  Highly
Compensated Employees satisfies one of the nondiscrimination  tests. Second, the
amount of each Highly Compensated  Employee's excess Elective Contributions will
be  determined  based upon the  reduction of his or her deferral  percentage  in
accordance  with the  preceding  sentence.  Third,  the  amount  of each  Highly
Compensated Employee's Elective Contributions,  as so determined,  together with
income  or  loss  thereon,  will  be  distributed  to  him or  her  as  soon  as
practicable,  but in no event later than the last day of the Plan Year following
the Plan Year for which the excess amount was contributed.

     4.4.  Excess  Employer  Matching  Contributions.  If  the  average  of  the
contribution  percentages  for  Highly  Compensated  Employees  for a Plan  Year
exceeds  the  amount  permitted  for that Plan  Year,  then the  excess  will be

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

eliminated in the manner provided in this Section. First, in accordance with the
provisions of applicable law, the contribution percentages of some or all of the
Highly Compensated  Employees will be reduced (in descending order starting with
the highest  contribution  percentages)  until the  average of the  contribution
percentages  for the  Highly  Compensated  Employees  satisfies  the  applicable
nondiscrimination test. Second, the amount of each Highly Compensated Employee's
excess  Employer  Matching  Contributions  will be  determined  based  upon  the
reduction of his or her contribution percentage in accordance with the preceding
sentence. Third, the amount of the Employer Matching Contributions made for each
Highly  Compensated  Employee  as so  determined,  together  with income or loss
thereon,  will be distributed to him or her. The amounts  determined  under this
Section will be paid as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the last
day of the Plan Year  following  the Plan Year for which the  excess  amount was
contributed.

     4.5. Other Limitations on Contributions  and Benefits.  The annual addition
to a  Participant's  Accounts for any limitation  year, when added to the annual
additions to his or her accounts under all other defined  contribution plans (if
any) maintained by the Company or an Affiliate for such year, may not exceed the
lesser of (a) $30,000 (or, if greater,  one-fourth  of the  limitation in effect
for the Plan Year under Section  415(b)(1)(A) of the Code), and(b) 25 percent of
the  Participant's  compensation  for the year (all as  determined in accordance
with  Section  415 of the Code).  If an  Employer  or an  Affiliate  maintains a
defined benefit  pension plan, a Participant's  benefits under that plan will be
reduced in lieu of a reduction of annual additions under this Plan if and to the
extent  necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 415(e) of the Code.

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

For the purposes of applying  Section 415 of the Code, the limitation  year will
be the calendar year.


                                    ARTICLE 5

                          ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENT FUNDS

     5.1. Maintenance of Accounts.  The Administrative  Committee will establish
and maintain separate Accounts for each Participant to reflect the Participant's
interest  in  the  Trust  attributable  to  Elective  Contributions   (including
qualified nonelective contributions),  Employer Matching Contributions, Employer
Profit Sharing  Contributions,  common stock of the Company contributed pursuant
to the tax credit  employee  stock  ownership  plan  provisions of the Plan, and
other Company  stock  contributions,  if any, as well as such other  Accounts or
sub-Accounts  as the  Administrative  Committee  deems necessary or desirable in
order to carry  out the  intent  and  purposes  of the  Plan or to  comply  with
applicable  law.  Each  Participant's  Accounts  will be  credited,  charged and
adjusted in accordance with the provisions hereof.

     5.2.  Adjustment of Accounts.  As of each Valuation Date with respect to an
Investment  Fund or the  Trust  Fund,  as the  case may be,  each  Participant's
Accounts will be adjusted to reflect  changes in the value of the  Participant's
interest in the Investment Fund or the Trust Fund since the last Valuation Date.
Unless the Administrative  Committee,  acting in a uniform and equitable manner,
determines otherwise, such adjustment shall be made as follows:

          (a)  first,  the  value of each  Account  will be  adjusted  as of the
     preceding Valuation Date to reflect  distributions,  transfers made thereto
     and withdrawals made therefrom since that Valuation Date;

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

          (b) second, each Account will be adjusted to reflect its proportionate
     share (based upon the adjusted Account values as of the preceding Valuation
     Date) of the net  increase  or  decrease  in the fair  market  value of the
     Investment Fund or Trust Fund since the last Valuation Date; and

          (c) third, as of each Valuation Date, each Participant's Accounts will
     be credited with the contributions (and transfers) made for or on behalf of
     the  Participant  as of the last day of, or for the period  ending on, such
     Valuation Date.

The  fair  market  value  of the  Trust  Fund  or any  Investment  Fund  will be
determined  with regard to expenses  incurred  by or  equitably  charged to such
Fund.

     5.3.  Establishment of Investment  Funds. The Trust Fund will be segregated
into such separate  Investment Funds as shall be established at the direction of
the Administrative Committee,  including,  without limitation, one or more fixed
income funds  (designed to preserve or minimize  loss of capital and to generate
income) and one or more general  investment  funds  (designed to generate income
and/or capital appreciation  primarily through investment in equity securities).
Amounts  contributed  or  accepted  pursuant  to the Plan will be  invested  and
re-invested   in  the  separate   Investment   Funds  in  accordance   with  the
Participants' and Beneficiaries' elections.

     5.4.  Investment  Directions.  Each Participant and Beneficiary will direct
the  investment  and   reinvestment  of  the  amounts  in  and/or   subsequently
contributed or transferred to his or her Accounts among the available Investment
Funds in such manner and subject to such  conditions as may be prescribed by the
Administrative   Committee   (or   its   designee).   In   the   absence   of  a
properly-transmitted  investment  direction,  the amounts in and/or subsequently
contributed to a Participant's (or Beneficiary's) Accounts will be invested in a
fixed income  Investment Fund designated for this purpose by the  Administrative

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

Committee.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein,  unless
otherwise  determined by the Board,  common stock of the Company  contributed to
the Plan as an employer  contribution  (other than stock attributable to the tax
credit employee stock ownership  provisions of the Plan) will remain invested in
Company  common stock and will not be subject to the  investment  direction  and
transfer  provisions  of this  Article.  The  segregated  Company  common  stock
accounts described in the preceding sentence will be maintained and administered
separate and apart from the Tax Credit ESOP Accounts.

     5.5.  Tax Credit ESOP  Accounts.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained  herein,  Tax Credit ESOP Accounts  established  for  Participants  in
respect of Company  stock  transferred  to the Trust  pursuant to the tax credit
employer stock ownership plan provisions of the Plan will remain  segregated for
the benefit of the  Participants  for whom such accounts are maintained and will
not be invested as part of the balance of the Trust Fund so long as such Account
remains invested in common stock of the Company.  Unless otherwise determined by
the Board,  a segregated Tax Credit ESOP Account will continue to be invested in
Company stock and will not be subject to the  investment  direction and transfer
provisions of this Article.


                                    ARTICLE 6

                  ELIGIBILITY FOR AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS

     6.1. Normal Retirement or Total Disability. A Participant who retires at or
after age 65 or whose  employment  terminates by reason of total disability will
be  entitled  to  receive  100%  of  his or her  Accounts  determined  as of the
Valuation Date coincident  with or next preceding the date of distribution  (and
adjusted for  contributions and withdrawals since that Valuation Date). For this

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

purpose,  total  disability  means the inability of a participant to perform the
duties of any occupation for which he or she is reasonably suited by reason of a
physical or mental illness or disease which is expected to result in death or to
last  indefinitely.  Subject to the  provisions  hereof and of  applicable  law,
distribution of the  Participant's  Accounts will be made as soon as practicable
after his or her retirement or termination of employment.  A retired or disabled
Participant's  Accounts  will  continue to be invested as part of the Trust Fund
and will continue to be adjusted in accordance with the provisions  hereof until
the distribution thereof is completed.

     6.2. Other  Termination of Employment.  A Participant  whose  employment is
terminated for any reason (other than death or total disability) prior to age 65
will  be  entitled  to  receive  the  sum of  (a)  100%  of his or her  Accounts
attributable  to  Elective   Contributions,   Employer  Matching  Contributions,
rollovers and transfers from another qualified plan, plus (b) 100% of his or her
Tax Credit ESOP Account, if any, in accordance with the provisions hereof and of
applicable  law, plus (c) the vested portion of his or her Account  attributable
to Employer Profit Sharing Contributions  determined under the following vesting
schedule as of the Valuation Date coincident  with or immediately  preceding the
distribution  date  (adjusted  for  contributions  and  withdrawals  since  that
Valuation Date):

      Years of Vesting Service                Percentage Vested
      ------------------------                -----------------
       Less than 1 ..............................     0%
                 1 ..............................    20%
                 2 ..............................    40%
                 3 ..............................    60%
                 4 ..............................    80%
                 5 or more ......................   100%

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Subject to the provisions  hereof and of applicable  law, the  distribution of a
terminated  Participant's  vested  Accounts  will be  made  at such  time as the
Participant elects. A terminated  Participant's vested Accounts will continue to
be  invested  as part of the Trust  Fund and will  continue  to be  adjusted  in
accordance with the provisions  hereof until the distribution of the Accounts is
completed.   The   Administrative   Committee,   acting   in   a   uniform   and
nondiscriminatory  manner,  may  establish  a rule  to  the  effect  that,  if a
terminated  Participant does not elect an immediate payout,  then, on or as soon
as practicable  after the last day of the calendar quarter following the quarter
in which the Participant's termination of employment occurs, the total amount of
the  Participant's  Accounts  will  be  automatically  invested  in one or  more
designated  fixed  income  funds  available  under the Plan (in  which  case the
investment  transfer elections  otherwise  available to active Participants will
not be available to the terminated Participant).

     6.3. Forfeitures. If, before being fully vested, a Participant's employment
ends or the  Participant  incurs five  consecutive  Breaks in Service,  then the
nonvested portion of the Participant's Account will be forfeited when the vested
portion of the  Participant's  Account is distributed  or, if earlier,  when the
Participant  incurs  five  consecutive  Breaks in Service.  If (a) a  forfeiture
arises with respect to a former  Participant  who receives a distribution of the
vested portion of his or her Account because of a termination of employment, (b)
the former Participant is later re-employed by an Employer before incurring five
consecutive Breaks in Service,  and (c) the former Participant repays the amount
of the prior  distribution  to the Plan  within  the time  required  by  Section
411(a)(7)(C)  of the Code,  then the  Employer  will  restore  the amount of the
forfeiture to the Participant's Account. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
if the  former  Participant's  vested  percentage  determined  under the  Plan's

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

vesting schedule is zero, then the Participant will be deemed to have received a
distribution  of his or her vested  portion of his or her Account at the time of
his or her termination of employment;  and the former participant will be deemed
to have  repaid the deemed  distribution  to the Plan at the  expiration  of the
repayment period permitted in Section  411(a)(7)(C) of the Code. The source of a
restoration made under this Section will be other forfeitures and, to the extent
necessary, additional Employer contributions.  Restoration of a prior forfeiture
will be credited to the Participant's Account as soon as practicable after it is
paid or otherwise made available to the Plan.

     6.4. Method of Payment.  Except as otherwise provided herein or required by
applicable law,  distribution  of a  Participant's  Accounts will be made in the
form of a single sum payment.  To the extent  required by applicable law, in the
case  of a  Participant's  Account  attributable  to  a  transfer  from  another
qualified plan, the  Administrative  Committee will make available such optional
payment  methods and shall comply with such  election  and other  administrative
procedures  as may be  necessary  in order to  comply  with  the  provisions  of
applicable law, including, without limitation,  Sections 401(a)(11),  401(a)(17)
and 411(d)(6) of the Code and regulations thereunder.

     6.5.  Transfer  Accounts.  To the extent required by applicable law, in the
case  of a  Participant's  Account  attributable  to  a  transfer  from  another
qualified plan, the  Administrative  Committee will make available such optional
methods  of  distribution   and  shall  comply  with  such  election  and  other
administrative  procedures  as may be  necessary  in  order to  comply  with the
provisions  of  applicable  law,   including,   without   limitation,   Sections
401(a)(11), 401(a)(17) and 411(d)(6) of the Code and regulations thereunder.

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

     6.6.  Required  Commencement of Benefits.  Unless a terminated  Participant
elects an earlier  distribution,  payment of his or her vested  Accounts will be
made no later than the April 1 following the close of the calendar year in which
the Participant attains age 70 1/2. Payment of an active Participant's  Accounts
must begin no later than the April 1 following the close of the calendar year in
which  the  Participant  attains  age 70 1/2  and,  prior  to the  Participant's
termination of employment, will be made at such times and in such amounts as are
necessary to satisfy the minimum distribution  requirements of Section 401(a)(9)
of the Code and regulations thereunder.

     6.7.  Cashout of Small Benefits.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained herein,  if the value of a Participant's  (or deceased  Participant's)
Accounts is less than $3,500,  then the total amount of those  Accounts  will be
distributed to the Participant (or  Beneficiary) in a single sum payment as soon
as practicable after the Participant's termination of employment or death.

     6.8. Death.

     (a)  Distribution  of Accounts.  If a Participant  dies before the complete
distribution of his or her Accounts, then the deceased Participant's Beneficiary
will be  entitled  to  receive a single  sum  payment  of the  balance  in those
Accounts  determined as of the Valuation Date  coincident with or next preceding
the date of distribution  (and adjusted for  contributions and withdrawals since
that Valuation  Date).  Subject to the provisions  hereof and of applicable law,
the  distribution of a deceased  Participant's  Accounts will be made as soon as
practicable after the deceased  Participant's  death (but in no event later than
one year  thereafter).  A deceased  Participant's  Accounts  will continue to be
invested  as  part of the  Trust  Fund  and  will  continue  to be  adjusted  in
accordance with the provisions  hereof until the  distribution of those Accounts
is completed.

                                      -22-

     (b)  Designation  of  Beneficiary.  Except as provided in subsection (c) of
this Section,  an individual may designate a Beneficiary by written notice filed
with the  Administrative  Committee and may change his or her Beneficiary at any
time by designating a new Beneficiary in the same manner,  and no notice need be
given to any prior designated  Beneficiary.  If no designated  Beneficiary shall
survive a deceased  Participant  or  Beneficiary,  then  payment of the deceased
Participant's Accounts will be made to the deceased Participant's estate.

     (c)  Spouse  Must Be  Beneficiary  of  Deceased  Married  Participant.  The
surviving  spouse of a deceased married  Participant  will be the  Participant's
Beneficiary  unless the surviving  spouse consents to the designation of another
Beneficiary.  The spouse's  consent must be in writing and must  acknowledge the
effect of the  Participant's  designation,  and the spouse's  signature  must be
witnessed by a notary public or an appropriate Plan official. Spousal consent to
a  different   Beneficiary   designation   will  not  be  required  if  (1)  the
Participant's  spouse  cannot be located,  (2) the  spouse's  consent  cannot be
obtained because of any other circumstances  permitted by applicable law, or (3)
the Participant's spouse has not been married to the Participant  throughout the
one-year period ending on the earlier of the date of the Participant's  death or
the date on which distribution of the Participant's Accounts begins.

     6.9.  Distributions  Made on or After January 1, 1993. This Section applies
to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision
of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's  election
under this  Section,  a  distributee  may  elect,  at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the Administrative Committee in accordance with applicable law, to
have any  portion of an  eligible  rollover  distribution  paid  directly  to an
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.  For

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

the  purposes of this  Section,  the  following  terms shall have the  following
meanings:

          (a) Eligible Rollover Distribution.  An eligible rollover distribution
     is any  distribution  of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of
     the distributee,  except that an eligible  rollover  distribution  does not
     include any  distribution  that is one of a series of  substantially  equal
     periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or
     life  expectancy)  of the  distributee  or the joint  lives (or joint  life
     expectancies)   of  the  distributee  and  the   distributee's   designated
     beneficiary,  or  for  a  specified  period  of  ten  years  or  more;  any
     distribution  to the extent such  distribution  is required  under  Section
     401(a)(9)  of the Code;  and the  portion of any  distribution  that is not
     includable in gross income (determined  without regard to the exclusion for
     net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).

          (b)  Eligible  Retirement  Plan.  An  eligible  retirement  plan is an
     individual  retirement  account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an
     individual  retirement  annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an
     annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified  trust
     described in Section  401(a) of the Code,  that  accepts the  distributee's
     eligible  rollover  distribution.  However,  in  the  case  of an  eligible
     rollover  distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan
     is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.

          (c)  Distributee.   A  distributee  includes  an  Employee  or  former
     Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving spouse
     and the Employee's or former  Employee's spouse or former spouse who is the
     alternate payee under a qualified  domestic  relations order, as defined in

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

     Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of
     the spouse or former spouse.

          (d) Direct Rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the
     eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

If a distribution is one to which Sections 401(a)(11) and 417 of the Code do not
apply, the distribution may commence less than 30 days after the required direct
rollover notice is given, provided that (a) the Participant is notified that he
or she has at least 30 days to consider the decision of whether to elect a
distribution and, if applicable, a particular distribution option, and (b) the
Participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution
and, if applicable, a particular distribution option.

                        IN-SERVICE WITHDRAWALS AND LOANS

     7.1. In-Service Withdrawals Generally. Subject to the provisions hereof and
of applicable law, a Participant may make in-service withdrawals from his or her
Accounts in the following order: rollover contributions (plus earnings) Employer

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

Profit Sharing  Contributions  (plus  earnings) to the extent  vested,  Employer
Matching Contributions (plus earnings) and Elective Contributions (plus pre-1988
earnings if any, thereon). The maximum withdrawal from an Account may not exceed
the  balance  in the  Account  as of  the  Valuation  Date  coincident  with  or
immediately preceding the withdrawal (reduced by withdrawals,  if any, made from
the Account since that Valuation Date). If the amount in a Participant's Account
is invested in more than one Investment  Fund, then withdrawals from the Account
will be allocated  among the applicable  Investment  Funds in accordance with an
order of priority  established by the Administrative  Committee on a uniform and
nondiscriminatory basis.

     7.2. Withdrawal Requests. Requests for in-service withdrawals must be filed
with the  Administrative  Committee  on forms  prescribed  or approved  for that
purpose. No more than one in-service  withdrawal request may be processed in any
calendar  month and no more than two such  requests may be processed  within any
12-month  period.  Withdrawal  amounts will be paid to a Participant  as soon as
practicable  after a  properly-completed  withdrawal  request is received by the
Administrative Committee.

     7.3. In-Service Withdrawals -- Special Rules.

     (a) General.  Except as otherwise  provided in this Section,  a Participant
may make an in-service  withdrawal only if the withdrawal (1) is made on account
of an immediate and heavy  financial need (as described in subsection (b) below)
and (2) is  necessary  to  satisfy  such  financial  need (as  determined  under
subsection (c) below).  The preceding  sentence shall not apply to an in-service
withdrawal  of rollover  contributions  or an  in-service  withdrawal  made by a
Participant  after  age 59 1/2,  provided,  however,  that only one of each such
non-hardship   withdrawals   will  be   permitted   during  the  period  of  the
Participant's Plan participation.

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

     (b) Immediate and Heavy  Financial  Need. For purposes of subsection (a) of
this  Section,  a  proposed  withdrawal  will be deemed to be on  account  of an
immediate  and  heavy  financial  need if the  proceeds  will be used to pay (1)
medical  expenses  of  the  Participant  or  of  the  Participant's   spouse  or
dependents;  (2) costs (exclusive of mortgage  payments) directly related to the
purchase  of the  Participant's  principal  residence;  (3)  tuition and related
education  fees for the next twelve months of  post-secondary  education for the
Participant or for the spouse,  children or other dependents of the Participant;
(4) amounts  required to prevent the eviction of the  Participant  from,  or the
foreclosure of a mortgage on, the Participant's principal residence; or (5) such
additional  expenses as may be specified by the  Internal  Revenue  Service as a
deemed immediate and heavy financial need for this purpose.

     (c) Amounts  Necessary to Meet the  Financial  Need.  A withdrawal  will be
deemed to be  necessary to satisfy an immediate  and heavy  financial  need of a
Participant  if (1) the amount of the  withdrawal is not more than the amount of
the immediate and heavy  financial  need; and (2) in the case of a withdrawal of
Elective  Contributions,  the Participant has obtained all loans,  distributions
and withdrawals otherwise available under the Plan and any other plan maintained
by the Company or an Affiliate.

     (d) Suspension of Future Elective Contributions. If a Participant withdraws
Elective  Contributions  on account of an immediate  and heavy  financial  need,
then,  notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary contained in the Plan
or in any  other  plan  maintained  by the  Employer  or an  Affiliate,  (1) the
Participant's  Elective Contributions (pre-tax and after-tax) under the Plan and
under any such other plan will be suspended  until the first day of the calendar
quarter  next  following  the date which is twelve  months after the date of the
withdrawal, and (2) the Participant's elective pre-tax deferral limitation under

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

Section  402(g)(1)  of the Code for the taxable year  following  the year of the
withdrawal will be reduced by the amount, if any, of the Participant's  Elective
Contributions  under the Plan (and elective  pre-tax  deferrals  under any other
plan  maintained by the Employer or an  Affiliate)  during the year in which the
withdrawal is made.

     7.4. Loans.

     (a) General.  Upon the  application  of a Participant,  the  Administrative
Committee, in accordance with a uniform and nondiscriminatory policy, may direct
the  Trustee to make a loan to the  Participant  from the  Participant's  vested
Accounts.  The amount of any such loan  shall not be less than  $1,000 and shall
not  exceed  the lesser of (1)  $50,000  reduced  by the  excess of the  highest
outstanding loan balance of the Participant during the one-year period ending on
the day before the loan is made over the Participant's  outstanding loan balance
immediately  prior to the loan or (2) an amount equal to 50% of the value of the
Participant's vested Accounts as of the date of such loan. For this purpose, the
value of a  Participant's  Account shall be determined as of the Valuation  Date
preceding  the  date  of  the  loan,  adjusted  to  reflect  any  contributions,
distributions or withdrawals since that Valuation Date.

     (b) Terms.  Any loan to a Participant  hereunder  shall be evidenced by the
Participant's recourse promissory note in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative  Committee,  shall bear a reasonable  rate of interest,  shall be
adequately  secured,  and  shall  be  payable  in  the  manner  provided  by the
Administrative  Committee  within 5 years after the date  thereof,  but no later
than the termination of the Participant's  employment for any reason.  Each loan
shall be repayable in equal  installments not less frequent than quarterly.  The
Administrative  Committee  shall  require a  Participant  who receives a loan to
irrevocably  authorize  the Employer to withhold  from  Compensation  and to pay

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

directly to the Trustee  the  amounts  required to be paid under the  promissory
note evidencing the Participant's loan obligation.  If, at the time benefits are
to be distributed to a Participant or his Beneficiary,  there remains any unpaid
balance  of a loan made  hereunder,  then such  unpaid  balance  (together  with
accrued  interest) shall become  immediately due and payable in full and, unless
paid,  such unpaid  balance  shall be deducted from the  Participant's  Accounts
before any distribution therefrom is made.

     (c)  No  Discrimination.   Loans  hereunder  shall  be  made  available  to
Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis.

     (d) Administrative Procedures. The Administrative Committee shall establish
such rules and  procedures  with respect to Plan loans as it deems  necessary or
advisable in order to comply with the provisions hereof and of applicable law.

     7.5.  Failure to Repay  Loans.  If a loan is made to a  Participant  with a
vested  interest in his  Accounts  and the  Participant  does not make a payment
required under the promissory note within the specified time, the Administrative
Committee  may cause the  amount due to be  deducted  from any  interest  in, or
payment or  distribution  from, the Trust Fund to which such  Participant or the
Participant's Beneficiaries may be entitled.


                                    ARTICLE 8

                           REQUIREMENTS FOR TAX CREDIT
                              ESOP ACCOUNT BALANCES

     8.1.  General.  This Article sets forth certain rules which will govern the
maintenance and  disposition of  Participants'  Tax Credit ESOP Accounts.  It is
intended  that those  Accounts  will  continue to be  invested in Company  stock
unless and until the ESOP  portion of the Plan is  terminated  by the Board,  at

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

which time,  at the election of the  Participants,  the Tax Credit ESOP Accounts
may be converted  into cash and reinvested as part of the remainder of the Trust
Fund or  distributed to the  Participants  for whom such Accounts are maintained
(if permitted  and subject to the  requirements  of applicable  law). It is also
intended  that, so long as the Tax Credit ESOP Accounts  continue to exist,  the
provisions  of this Article  will be applied and  construed in a manner which is
consistent  with  the  provisions  of  Sections  4975(e)  and  409 of  the  Code
applicable to those Accounts. A Participant's  interest in his or her Tax Credit
ESOP Account shall be nonforfeitable at all times.

     8.2.  Distribution.  A  Participant's  Tax  Credit  ESOP  Account  will  be
distributed to the Participant (or the  Participant's  Beneficiary,  as the case
may be) at the same time as, and as part of, the  distribution of the balance of
the Participant's Accounts in accordance with Article 6 hereof. The distribution
of a Tax Credit ESOP Account will be made in kind (in the form of Company  stock
or stock),  unless the Administrative  Committee,  acting in its sole discretion
and in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner,  establishes a procedure pursuant
to which Participants can elect to receive their Tax Credit ESOP Accounts in the
form of cash.

     8.3. Put Option.  In the case of a  distribution  of Company stock which is
not readily tradeable on an established  securities market within the meaning of
Section 409(h)(1)(B) of the Code, the Company shall provide the Participant with
a put option that complies with the  requirements of Section 409(h) of the Code.
If the put option is exercised,  the Company shall  repurchase the Company stock
distributed to the Participant as follows:

          (a) if the distribution  constitutes a total distribution,  payment of
     the fair market value of the Participant's Company stock shall be made (not
     less  frequently  than  annually) in  substantially  equal  payments over a

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

     period not exceeding five years,  the first  installment  shall be paid not
     later than 30 days after the Participant  exercises the put option, and the
     Company  will  pay a  reasonable  rate of  interest  and  provide  adequate
     security on amounts not paid within said 30-day period; or

          (b) if the distribution does not constitute a total distribution,  the
     Company shall pay the  Participant an amount equal to the fair market value
     of  the  Company  stock  repurchased  no  later  than  30  days  after  the
     Participant exercises the put option.

The period during which a  Participant  may exercise the put option shall be the
sixty day period  following  the date of  distribution  and if the option is not
exercised within such period,  an additional sixty day period  commencing on the
first anniversary of the date of the distribution.

     8.4. Voting Rights of Participants. Each Participant (or Beneficiary) shall
be entitled to direct the Plan as to the manner in which shares of Company stock
allocated to such Participant's (or Beneficiary's) Tax Credit ESOP Account shall
be voted.


                                    ARTICLE 9

                              TOP HEAVY PROVISIONS

     9.1. Effect of Top Heavy Status.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary,  if the Plan is a top heavy plan for any Plan Year,  and if any
Participant  who is a non-key  Employee  does not accrue the minimum  benefit or
contribution  described in Section 416(c)(1) or (c)(2) of the Code for that Plan
Year under this Plan and any other defined benefit and defined contribution plan
which is required or  permitted  to be  aggregated  with the Plan for purpose of

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

applying  Section 416 of the Code,  then the Company shall make such  additional
contributions, if any, on behalf of such Participant (regardless of whether such
Participant completes 1,000 hours of service for such Year and regardless of his
or her level of  compensation)  as shall be  necessary  in order to satisfy  the
minimum  contribution  requirements of Section 416(c)(2) of the Code (determined
with regard to Section 416(f) of the Code) with respect to such  Participant for
such Plan Year.  The minimum  contribution  will not be required (or the minimum
contribution  will be reduced,  as the case may be) for a Participant  if and to
the extent that the minimum top heavy  contribution  or benefit  requirement  is
satisfied by another qualified plan of the Employer or an Affiliate.

     9.2. Definitions and Special Rules.

     (a)  Top  Heavy  Status.  The  Plan  is a top  heavy  plan  if,  as of  the
determination  date, the aggregate Account values of all key Employees under the
Plan  (required to be taken into account for this  purpose)  plus the  aggregate
account values and the aggregate  present values of accrued benefits for all key
Employees under all other plans which are aggregated with this Plan (required to
be taken  into  account  for this  purpose)  exceed  sixty  percent  of all such
aggregate  values for all Employees or former  Employees  (other than former key
Employees)  under the Plan and such other plans.  The  determination  of the top
heavy  status  of the Plan will be made in  accordance  with the  provisions  of
Section 416 of the Code and the  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  which are
specifically incorporated herein by reference.

     (b)  Aggregation  of Plans.  Each plan of the  Employer or an  Affiliate in
which a key Employee participates and each other plan which enables such plan to
meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or Section 410(b) of the Code will be
aggregated with this Plan, and all additional plans which the Company designates
will be aggregated  with this Plan if and to the extent that the resulting group

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

of  plans  satisfies  the  coverage  and  nondiscrimination  tests  of  Sections
401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.

     (c) Determination  Date. For purposes of determining  whether the Plan is a
top heavy plan for a Plan Year,  the  determination  date is the last day of the
preceding Plan Year.

     (d) Key Employee. The term "key Employee" means a key employee described in
Section  416(i)(1)  of the  Code,  and the term  "non-key  Employee"  means  any
Employee who is not a key Employee.

                             ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN

     10.1. Organization of Administrative  Committee and Procedural Matters. The
Plan will be administered by an  Administrative  Committee  composed of at least
three  individuals  appointed  by the Board.  Each member of the  Administrative
Committee  will serve at the  pleasure  of the Board and  without  compensation.
Action by the  Administrative  Committee may be taken by a vote of a majority of
its members then serving or in a writing  without a meeting signed by all of its
members.  Unless the Board appoints officers,  the Administrative  Committee may
designate one of its members as the Chairman and shall elect a Secretary who may
but need not be a member  of the  Administrative  Committee.  No  member  of the
Administrative Committee shall participate in the determination of any of his or
her rights or benefits under the Plan.

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

     10.2. Powers of Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee will
administer  the  Plan and  will  have  complete  control  in the  administration
thereof.  In  exercising  any of its  discretionary  powers with  respect to the
administration of the Plan, the  Administrative  Committee will act in a uniform
and non-discriminatory manner. The Administrative Committee will have all powers
which are reasonably necessary to carry out its responsibilities  under the Plan
including,  without limitation,  the power to construe the Plan and to determine
all questions  which may arise  thereunder.  The decision of the  Administrative
Committee as to any disputed question arising hereunder,  including questions of
construction,  interpretation and administration,  shall be final and conclusive
on all persons. All disbursements by the Trustee, except for reasonable expenses
of administering the Trust assets, shall be made upon and in accordance with the
instructions of the Administrative  Committee.  Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, the Administrative  Committee shall have no power, authority or
responsibility  with respect to the  management,  investment or control of Trust
assets.

     10.3. Operation of Administrative  Committee.  The Administrative Committee
may adopt such rules and  regulations as it deems  necessary or appropriate  for
the conduct of its affairs. The Administrative  Committee may appoint from among
its members such  subcommittees  with such powers as it shall  determine and may
employ such accountants,  actuaries,  counsel,  administrators  and other agents
(clerical  and  otherwise)  and  services as it deems  necessary or desirable in
connection with the performance of its functions hereunder and in order to carry
out the provisions of the Plan.  Decisions and directions of the  Administrative
Committee may be communicated to the Trustee, a Participant, a Beneficiary,  the
Company or any other  person who is to receive  such  decision or direction by a
document signed by any one or more members of the  Administrative  Committee (or

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

persons other than members) so authorized, and such decision or direction of the
Administrative  Committee  may be  relied  upon by its  recipient  as being  the
decision or direction of the Administrative Committee.

     10.4.  Resignation or Removal.  Any member of the Administrative  Committee
may resign by giving  written  notice to the Board not less than 30 days  before
the effective date of his or her resignation.  Any member of the  Administrative
Committee may be removed,  with or without cause, at any time by the Board.  The
Board shall fill vacancies as soon as is reasonably  practicable after a vacancy
occurs and, until a new  appointment  is made, the remaining  members shall have
the full authority to act.

     10.5. Records and Reports. The Administrative  Committee shall keep records
of its proceedings and acts and shall keep or cause to be kept all such books of
account,  records  and other data as may be  necessary  in  connection  with the
performance of its functions hereunder.

     10.6. Expenses. All expenses incurred in connection with the administration
of the  Plan  and  the  Trust  Fund,  including,  without  limitation,  fees  of
accountants, actuaries, counsel, investment managers and other agents, and other
costs of administering the Plan and the Trust Fund, shall be paid by the Trustee
out of the Trust Fund, unless paid by the Company.

     10.7.  Indemnification.  The  Company  shall  indemnify  each member of the
Administrative  Committee,  each  member  of the  Board,  and  any of its (or an
Affiliate's)  employees to whom a fiduciary  responsibility  with respect to the
Plan is  allocated  or  delegated  from and against all  liabilities,  costs and
expenses,  including  counsel fees,  amounts paid in  settlement  and amounts of
judgments,  fines  or  penalties,  incurred  or  imposed  upon  such  person  in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding,  whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising by reason of or in connection with acts

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

or  omissions  in his or her  capacity  as a fiduciary  hereunder,  unless it is
established by the order of a court of competent  jurisdiction  that such act or
omission is the result of gross negligence or fraud.

     10.8. Claim for Benefits.  A disputed claim for benefits under the Plan may
be made to the Administrative Committee or its designee in writing. If the claim
contains  insufficient  information,  then the claimant  will be given notice of
additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim, and the claim
will be deemed filed when such  additional  information  is received.  Within 60
days after a claim is received,  the claimant will be notified whether the claim
is granted or denied in whole or in part.  If the claim is denied in whole or in
part,  the written  notification  will set forth,  in a manner  calculated to be
understood by the claimant,  (a) the specific  reason or reasons for the denial;
(b) specific  reference to pertinent  provisions of the Plan on which the denial
is based; and (c) an explanation of the Plan's claim review  procedure.  Failure
to give  notification  pursuant to this Section  within 60 days after receipt of
the claim will be deemed a denial of the claim for the purpose of  proceeding to
the review stage.

     10.9.  Review of Denied  Claims.  If a claim is denied in whole or in part,
then within 60 days after written notification of the denial (or after the claim
is deemed  denied),  the claimant may file with the  Administrative  Committee a
written request for a review of the claim. A claimant who timely files a request
for review of his or her claim may review  pertinent  documents and may submit a
written  statement  in support of the claim.  If the  claimant  so requests in a
timely-filed  application for review, the Administrative Committee will schedule
a  conference  with the claimant  (and/or an  authorized  representative).  Such
conference  will be held at the offices of the Company  within 60 days after the
Administrative Committee receives the claimant's written request for review. The
Administrative  Committee  will  communicate  its  decision  in  writing  to the

                                      -36-

<PAGE>

claimant  within 60 days after the written request for review is filed or within
30 days after the  conference,  whichever  is later,  setting  forth in a manner
calculated  to be  understood  by the  claimant  the  specific  reasons  for its
decision  and the  pertinent  provisions  of the Plan on which the  decision  is
based.


                                   ARTICLE 11

                                   TRUST FUND

     11.1. General. The Trust corpus will consist of all payments to the Trustee
as provided  herein,  together  with the net income or loss  (including  capital
items)  produced  by the  investments  of the  Trust  or the  sale  of any  such
investments, which will be added to or deducted from the Trust. The Trust assets
will be held,  administered and invested in the manner provided in the agreement
pursuant to which the Trust is governed.

     11.2. No  Diversion.  All assets of the Trust will be owned by the Trustee.
Except as otherwise provided herein, no part of the Trust assets may be used for
or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and
their Beneficiaries.

     11.3.  Benefits  Provided Solely by Trust Fund. All benefits  payable under
the Plan will be paid or provided solely from the Trust assets,  and neither the
Company nor any  participating  Employer nor any Affiliate assumes or shall have
liability or responsibility therefor.

     11.4. Employer Securities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no part of the Trust assets may be invested in  securities  of the Company or an
Affiliate  unless such  securities  constitute  qualifying  employer  securities
within the meaning of Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA and no part of the Trust assets

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

may be invested in real property  which is leased to the Company or an Affiliate
unless such real property  constitutes  qualifying employer real property within
the meaning of Section 407(d)(4) of ERISA. The Trustee or investment manager, as
the case may be,  may  invest  up to 100% of the  Plan's  assets  in  qualifying
employer securities and/or qualifying employer real property,  provided that any
such  investment is deemed  advisable and proper in carrying out the purposes of
the Plan and the Trust,  and  provided  further that such  investment  would not
constitute  a  prohibited  transaction  or  be  otherwise   impermissible  under
applicable law.

     11.5.  Appointment of Investment Manager. The Administrative  Committee may
appoint  one or more  investment  managers  to  manage  any  assets of the Plan,
including all or part of the assets of any Investment Fund. As used herein,  the
term  "investment  manager"  means any  person or entity  who:  (a) has power to
manage,  acquire or dispose of any assets of the Plan;  (b) is (1) registered as
an investment  adviser under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 (2) a bank, as
defined in that Act, or (3) an  insurance  company  qualified  under the laws of
more than one state to perform  services  described  in (a)  above;  and (c) has
acknowledged  in a writing  delivered to the  Administrative  Committee  and the
Trustee  that  he is a  fiduciary  with  respect  to the  Plan.  The  investment
manager(s) will have such powers and  responsibilities as may be conferred under
the Trust Agreement and the investment management agreement.

                           AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION

     12.1.  Company May Amend Plan. The Company reserves the right, by action of
the  Board at any time or from time to time,  to  modify  or amend  this Plan in
whole or in part. No amendment will:

          (a) vest in an Employer an interest in the Trust Fund;

          (b) cause or permit the Trust Fund to be diverted to any purpose other
     than the exclusive benefit of Participants and Beneficiaries;

          (c) decrease the Account of any  Participant  or eliminate an optional
     form of payment;

          (d) increase substantially the duties or liabilities of the Trustee or
     the members of the  Administrative  Committee  without its or their written
     consent; or

          (e) change  the  vesting  schedule  to one which  would  result in the
     nonforfeitable  percentage of a Participant's Account (determined as of the
     later of the date of adoption of the amendment or the effective date of the
     amendment) being less than the nonforfeitable percentage computed under the
     Plan without  regard to the amendment.  If the Plan's  vesting  schedule is
     amended, each Participant with at least three years of Service may elect to
     have his or her  nonforfeitable  percentage  computed without regard to the
     amendment.  The election must be made by the latest of the following dates:
     (1) 60 days after the amendment is adopted, (2) 60 days after the amendment
     becomes  effective,  or (3) 60 days after the Participant is issued written
     notice of the amendment.

                                      -39-

     12.2.  Withdrawal of Participating  Employer. An Employer may withdraw from
the Plan and the Trust  Fund by  giving  written  notice  to the  Administrative
Committee  of its intent to withdraw.  The  Administrative  Committee  will then
determine  the  portion  of the  Trust  Fund  attributable  to the  Participants
employed by the  withdrawing  Employer  and will notify the Trustee to segregate
those  assets and transfer  them to the  successor  trustee or trustees  when it
receives  a  designation  of the  successor  from the  withdrawing  Employer.  A
withdrawal will not terminate the Plan with respect to the withdrawing  Employer
if the Employer appoints a successor trustee or trustees and establishes another
plan and trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code.

     12.3. Termination.  The Board may terminate the Plan with respect to any or
all Employers.  Any Employer (by action of its board of directors) may terminate
the Plan with respect to itself.  If there is a partial or total  termination of
the Plan or there is a complete  discontinuance of an Employer's  Contributions,
all affected Participants will immediately become 100% vested in their Accounts.

     12.4.  Distributions  Upon  Termination.   Subject  to  the  provisions  of
applicable law (or the provisions of a Plan amendment adopted in connection with
a Plan termination), distribution of a Participant's Accounts as a result of the
termination of the Plan is permitted only if: (a) the balance of the Accounts is
not more than  $3,500,  or (b) the  balance  exceeds  $3,500  and either (1) the
Participant  consents to the  distribution  or (2) neither the  Employer nor any
Affiliate  maintains another defined  contribution plan. However if the Employer
or an Affiliate  maintains another defined  contribution plan, then, even though
the Participant's Accounts cannot be distributed without his or her consent, the
Accounts may be  transferred to the other defined  contribution  plan to be held
for the Participant's benefit.  Except to the extent required by applicable law,

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

all  distributions in respect of the termination of the Plan will be in the form
of single sum payments.

     12.5.  Statutory  Merger/Consolidation  Rule.  In the case of any merger or
consolidation  of the Plan with, or any transfer of assets or liabilities of the
Plan to, any other plan, the benefit which each Participant would be entitled to
receive  immediately  after the merger,  consolidation  or transfer (if the Plan
then  terminates)  shall be equal to or greater than the benefit he or she would
have been entitled to receive  immediately  before the merger,  consolidation or
transfer (as if the Plan had then terminated).


                                   ARTICLE 13

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     13.1.  No  Rights  Conferred.  Nothing  herein  will be  deemed to give any
individual any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate
or any other rights in the future other than as herein  specifically  set forth.
Except as  otherwise  specifically  required  herein or by law, no  Participant,
Beneficiary  or other  person will be  entitled  to inspect the books,  records,
reports, financial statements or tax returns of the Company.

     13.2.  Benefits  Limited to Trust  Fund.  No person  will have any right or
interest  in the Trust  other  than as  provided  herein.  Any final  payment or
distribution to a Participant or Beneficiary will be in full satisfaction of all
claims  against  the Trust,  the  Trustee,  the  Administrative  Committee,  the
Company,  an Affiliate,  the Board and any  fiduciary of the Plan or Trust.  The
Trustee or the Administrative Committee may require a Participant or Beneficiary
to execute a receipt  and a general  release of any and all such  claims  upon a

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

final payment or distribution,  or a receipt and/or release to the extent of any
partial payment or distribution.

     13.3.  Spendthrift  Provision.  Except to the extent  required  by law,  no
benefit  under  the  Plan  shall  be  subject  in any  manner  to  anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer,  assignment,  pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any
attempt to anticipate,  alienate, sell, transfer, assign, encumber or charge the
same shall be void. No such benefit shall be in any way liable for or subject to
the debts, contracts,  liabilities,  engagements or torts of any person entitled
to those benefits.  The Administrative  Committee will establish such procedures
as may be necessary or  appropriate  in order to comply with the  provisions  of
ERISA and the Code in  connection  with  domestic  relations  orders issued with
respect to a  Participant's  Accounts.  If an order so provides,  payment of the
interest of an alternate payee (as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code) may be
made in a single sum as soon as practicable after the  Administrative  Committee
determines that the order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order.

     13.4. Payment to Minors or Incompetents. If any person to whom a benefit is
payable  hereunder is an infant or if the  Administrative  Committee  determines
that any person to whom such  benefit is payable is  incompetent  by reason of a
physical  or  mental  disability,  the  Administrative  Committee  may cause the
payments  becoming  due to such  person  to be made  to  another  for his or her
benefit without responsibility of the Administrative Committee or the Trustee to
see to the application of such payments.

     13.5.  Headings.   The  headings  in  this  Plan  have  been  inserted  for
convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any  construction  of the
provisions hereof.

     13.6. Severability. If any provision of the Plan or the application of such
provision to any person or  circumstance  is held invalid,  the remainder of the
Plan (and the application of such provision to any person or circumstance  other

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

than  the  person  or  circumstance  to which  it is held  invalid)  will not be
affected thereby.

     13.7. Construction. The provisions of the Plan will be construed, regulated
and  administered  according  to the  provisions  of ERISA,  the Code and to the
extent not inconsistent  therewith or preempted thereby,  in accordance with the
laws of the State of Connecticut.

Commercial Promissory Grid Note                   Shawmut Bank Connecticut, N.A.

$3,000,000.00                                            Date:  December 1, 1994



     FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  the undersigned,  Zygo  Corporation (the  "Borrower"),
hereby  promises  to pay to the order of SHAWMUT  BANK  CONNECTICUT,  N.A.  (the
"Bank")  at the  office of the Bank at 777 Main  Street,  Hartford,  Connecticut
06115,  or at such  other  address  as the  holder  hereof  may  designate,  the
principal  sum of Three  Million  and  00/100  DOLLARS  ($3,000,000.00),  or the
aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount  of all  advances  made by the  Bank to the
Borrower  hereunder,  whichever is less,  in lawful money of the United  States.
During the period from the date hereof until November 30, 1995 (as such date may
be  extended,  in writing  from time to time,  in the Bank's  sole and  absolute
discretion,  the  "Termination  Date"),  unless an Event of Default  (as defined
below) occurs, the Borrower (SELECT ONE AND COMPLETE):

     [ ] may borrow, repay and reborrow.

     [x] may borrow, repay and reborrow;  provided, however, that for any period
of twelve (12)  consecutive  months there shall be no borrowings or reborrowings
and  no  outstanding  principal  under  this  Note  for  at  least  thirty  (30)
consecutive days.

     [ ] may  borrow  and  repay;  provided,  however,  that once any  amount is
repaid, such amount may NOT thereafter be reborrowed.

     The Borrower  also promises to pay interest on each advance at the rate per
annum  of zero  (-0-)  percentage  points  above  the  interest  rate  generally
announced by the Bank from time to time as its Base Rate (the "Base Rate"),  and
to pay all taxes  levied or assessed  upon said  advances  against any holder of
this Note and to pay all costs, including attorneys' fees, costs relating to the
appraisal  and/or  valuation of assets and all costs incurred in the collection,
defense, preservation, administration, enforcement or protection of this Note or
in any guaranty or endorsement of this Note, or in any litigation arising out of
the  transactions of which this Note or any guaranty or endorsement of this Note
is a part. All payments shall be applied first to the payment of interest on the
unpaid  principal of all advances due under this Note and the balance on account
of the principal due under this Note.

     This Note has been  executed and delivered  subject to the following  terms
and conditions:

     (1)  Advances.  All  advances  shall be due and payable on the  Termination
Date. The Bank is authorized (but not required) to charge principal and interest
and all other  amounts due under this Note to any account of the  Borrower  with
the Bank when and as it becomes  due. If any  advance is made,  the Bank may, at
its option, record on the books and records of the Bank or endorse on Schedule 1
hereto,  an  appropriate  notation  evidencing  any advance,  each  repayment on
account of the  principal  thereof,  and the amount of  interest  paid;  and the
Borrower authorizes the Bank to maintain such records or make such notations and
agrees that the amount shown on the books and records or on said  Schedule 1, as
applicable,  as outstanding  from time to time shall constitute the amount owing
to the Bank  pursuant  to this Note,  absent  manifest  error.  In the event the
amount  shown on Schedule 1 conflicts  with the amount  noted as due pursuant to
the books and  records  of the Bank,  the books and  records  of the Bank  shall
control the disposition of the conflict.

     (2) Interest.  Interest shall be payable monthly beginning January 1, 1995,
and continuing  thereafter on the same day of each  succeeding  month and on the
Termination Date.  Changes in the rate of interest resulting from changes in the
Base Rate  shall take place  immediately  without  notice or demand of any kind.
Interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a year of three  hundred
sixty  (360) days and actual days  elapsed.  Upon  default or after  maturity or
after judgment has been rendered on this Note, the unpaid  principal  balance of
all advances  shall, at the option of the Bank, bear interest at a rate which is
four (4) percentage  points per annum greater than that which would otherwise be
applicable.  If, at any time,  the rate of interest,  together  with all amounts
which  constitute  interest and which are reserved,  charged or taken by Bank as
compensation  for  fees,   services  or  expenses   incidental  to  the  making,
negotiating or collection of any advance  evidenced  hereby,  shall be deemed by
any  competent  court of law,  governmental  agency or  tribunal  to exceed  the
maximum rate of interest  permitted  to be charged by the Bank to the  Borrower,
then, during such time as such rate of interest would be deemed excessive,  that
portion of each sum paid attributable to that portion of such interest rate that
exceeds the maximum  rate of interest so  permitted  shall be deemed a voluntary
prepayment of principal.

     (3)  Additional  Payments.  If the Bank shall deem  applicable to this Note
(including,  in each case,  any borrowed and any unused  portion  thereof),  any
requirement of any law of the United States of America,  any regulation,  order,
interpretation,  ruling,  official directive or guideline (whether or not having
the force of law) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System,  the
Comptroller of the Currency,  the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation or any
other board or  governmental  or  administrative  agency of the United States of
America which shall impose, increase,  modify or make applicable to this Note or
cause this Note to be included in any reserve, special deposit, calculation used
in  the  computation  of  regulatory  capital  standards,  assessment  or  other
requirement  which  imposes  on the Bank any cost  that is  attributable  to the
maintenance  thereof,  then, and in each such event, the Borrower shall promptly

                                       1

<PAGE>

pay the Bank,  upon its demand,  such amount as will compensate the Bank for any
such  cost,  which  determination  may  be  based  upon  the  Bank's  reasonable
allocation of the  aggregate of such costs  resulting  from such events.  In the
event any such  cost is a  continuing  cost,  a fee  payable  to the Bank may be
imposed  upon the Borrower  periodically  for so long as any such cost is deemed
applicable by the Bank,  in an amount  determined by the Bank to be necessary to
compensate the Bank for any such cost, which determination may be based upon the
Bank's reasonable  allocation of the aggregate of such costs resulting from such
events.  The  determination  by the Bank of the existence and amount of any such
costs shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive.

     (4) Late Charge.  The Bank may collect a late charge not to exceed five (5)
percent of any installment of interest or principal,  or of any other amount due
to the Bank which is not paid or reimbursed by the Borrower  within fifteen (15)
days of the due date  thereof to defray the extra cost and  expense  involved in
handling such delinquent payment and the increased risk of  non-collection.  The
minimum late charge shall be $15.00.

     (5)  Review  Fee.  The  Borrower  agrees to pay to the Bank a review fee to
defray the Bank's expense  involved in continuing to review the condition of the
Borrower and  determining  whether the Bank will make requested  advances to the
Borrower.  The review fee shall be payable on a quarterly  basis,  commencing on
January  l,  1995  and on the  Termination  Date  and be in an  amount  equal to
$1,875.00.

     (6)  Prepayment.  The  Borrower  has the right to pay before due the unpaid
balance of this Note or any part thereof without penalty or premium.  If, at any
time, the aggregate principal amount of all advances outstanding under this Note
shall  exceed the maximum  amount  permitted by this Note,  the  Borrower  shall
immediately prepay so much of the outstanding  principal balance,  together with
accrued  interest on the portion of principal so prepaid,  as shall be necessary

assets  or  property  that  arises  hereunder  or from  the  performance  by the
undersigned hereunder,  including without limitation, any claim, right or remedy
of subrogation,  reimbursement,  exoneration,  contribution,  indemnification or
participation  in any claim,  right or remedy that the Bank may have against the
Borrower or any  collateral  for the  liabilities of the Borrower which the Bank
now has or  hereafter  acquires,  whether or not such  claim,  right,  or remedy
arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise.

     Upon any default of the Borrower, the liability of the undersigned shall be
effective  immediately  and payable on demand without any suit or action against
the Borrower.  No delay or omission on the part of Bank in exercising  any right
hereunder  shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right;  a waiver
on one  occasion  shall  not be a bar to or  waiver  of any  right on any  other
occasion.

     The liability of the undersigned with respect to any liability shall not be
terminated by, and the  undersigned  assents to any extension or postponement of
the  time of  payment  or any  other  indulgence,  any  modification, waiver  or
amendment  of  the  terms  of  any  agreement   relating  to  liabilities,   any
substitution,  exchange or release of collateral, the addition or release of any
party primarily or secondarily liable including any of the undersigned,  whether
or not notice thereof is given to the  undersigned.  The Bank shall have no duty
to collect or protect any collateral or any income thereon,  nor to preserve any
rights against other  parties,  and the Bank may proceed under this Guaranty and
Endorsement  immediately upon Borrower's  default without resorting to or regard
to any collateral or any other guaranty or source of payment.

<TEXT>


                                ZYGO CORPORATION

                     NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN

     1. Purpose. The purpose of the Zygo Corporation Non-Employee Director Stock
Option  Plan (the  "Plan") is to enable  Zygo  Corporation  (the  "Company")  to
provide stock options to members of its Board of Directors (the "Board") who are
not  also   employees  of,  or  consultants   to,  the  Company   ("Non-Employee
Directors").  It is  intended  that the Plan will  constitute  a "formula  plan"
within the meaning and for the purposes of Rule 16b-3  issued by the  Securities
and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The provisions of the Plan and of any option agreement made pursuant to the Plan
will be interpreted and applied accordingly.

     2. Stock Subject to the Plan. Except as otherwise  permitted by paragraph 6
hereof, the Company may issue and sell a total of [200,000] shares of its common
stock,  $.10 par value (the "Common  Stock"),  pursuant to the Plan. Such shares
may be either  authorized  and unissued or held by the Company in its  treasury.
New options may be granted under the Plan with respect to shares of Common Stock
which are covered by the  unexercised  portion of an option which  terminates or
expires.

     3.  Administration.  The Plan will be administered by the Board. Subject to
the provisions of the Plan and applicable law, the Board, acting in its sole and
absolute  discretion,  shall  have full power and  authority  to  interpret  the
provisions of the Plan and option  agreements  made under the Plan, to supervise
the  administration  of the  Plan,  and to  take  such  other  action  as may be
necessary  or desirable in order to carry out the  provisions  of the Plan.  The
decision  of the  Board as to any  disputed  question,  including  questions  of
construction,  interpretation and administration,  shall be final and conclusive
on all persons.


<PAGE>

     4. Automatic Option Grants. Options to purchase shares of Common Stock will
automatically be granted under the Plan to Non-Employee Directors as follows:

          (a) an option to  purchase  25,000  shares  of  Common  Stock  will be
     granted on the date this Plan is adopted by the Board, subject, however, to
     the approval of the Plan by the Company's stockholders at their next annual
     meeting, to each individual who is then serving as a Non-Employee Director;

          (b)  an  option  to  purchase  25,000  shares  of  Common  Stock  will
     automatically be granted to each new  Non-Employee  Director on the date of
     his or her initial election or appointment  subsequent to the date the Plan
     is adopted by the Board; and

          (c)  an  option  to  purchase  25,000  shares  of  Common  Stock  will
     automatically  be  granted  to  each  Non-Employee  Director  on the  fifth
     anniversary of the date on which an option was  previously  granted to such
     Non-Employee  Director,  provided  that he or she shall  have  continuously
     served  as a  director  of the  Company  through  such  fifth  anniversary;
     provided,  however,  that no option shall be granted  under this Plan to an
     individual  who  previously  received an option granted under the Company's
     Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan in his capacity as a Non-Employee  Director
     unless such individual shall have agreed to the termination of that portion
     of the prior option which would  otherwise first become  exercisable  after
     December 31, 1994.

     5. Terms and  Conditions  of Options.  Each option  granted  under the Plan
shall be evidenced by a written  agreement  containing  the following  terms and
conditions:

          a. Option  Price.  The purchase  price per share shall be equal to the
     fair  market  value of a share of  Common  Stock on the date the  option is
     granted. For this purpose, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

     on any date will be equal to the closing  sale price per share as published
     by a national  securities  exchange on which shares of the Common Stock are
     traded on such date or, if there is no sale of Common  Stock on such  date,
     the average of the bid and asked prices on such  exchange at the closing of
     trading on such date.

          b. Option Period.  Subject to the provisions hereof, the period during
     which an  option  may be  exercised  shall be ten  years  from the date the
     option is granted.

          c. Exercise of Options.

          (1) An option will become exercisable at the rate of 20% for each year
     of the optionee's continuous service as a director from the date the option
     is granted; provided, however, that, if an optionee completes more than six
     months  (but less than one year) of service  as a  director  in the year in
     which his or her service as a director  terminates,  then he or she will be
     credited  with  a  year  of  continuous  service  for  such  last  year  in
     determining  the portion of the option which is  exercisable at the time of
     such termination of service.  All or part of the exercisable  portion of an
     option may be exercised at any time during the option period,  except that,
     without the consent of the Board, no partial exercise of an option shall be
     made  for  less  than  [1,000]  shares.  An  option  may  be  exercised  by
     transmitting  to the Company (1) a written notice  specifying the number of
     shares to be  purchased,  and (2)  payment in full of the  purchase  price,
     together with the amount, if any, deemed necessary to enable the Company to
     satisfy  its  income  tax  withholding  obligations  with  respect  to such
     exercise (unless other  arrangements  acceptable to the Board are made with
     respect to the satisfaction of such withholding obligations).

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

          (2) The Company's  obligation to sell and deliver shares upon exercise
     of an option is subject to such  compliance  with  federal  and state laws,
     rules and regulations  applying to the  authorization,  issuance or sale of
     securities as the Company deems  necessary or advisable.  If at the time of
     any exercise of this option a Registration  Statement  under the Securities
     Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") shall not be effective  with respect to
     the shares to be acquired on such  exercise,  then,  as a condition to such
     exercise and the delivery of the shares,  the optionee shall deliver to the
     Company a written statement,  satisfactory in form and substance to counsel
     for the Company, confirming (a) the financial information pertaining to the
     Company  as to which  the  optionee  had  access  and (b)  that any  shares
     acquired by the optionee  upon  exercise of this option will be acquired by
     the optionee for his or her own account for  investment and not with a view
     to the  distribution  or resale of any such  shares.  Any  certificate  for
     shares issued upon the exercise of this option may at the Company's option,
     bear a legend stating that the shares  represented by such certificate were
     purchased only for  investment  and may be transferred  only if counsel for
     the Company is satisfied  that no  violation  of the Act is  involved.  The
     Company  shall be  entitled  to further  postpone  the time of  delivery of
     certificates for shares of its Common Stock for such additional time as the
     Company  shall  deem  necessary  or  desirable  to  enable it (i) to file a
     Registration  Statement  under  the Act with the  Securities  and  Exchange
     Commission with respect,  among others, to the shares of Common Stock which
     may be  purchased  under this  option,  or (ii) to comply  with the listing
     requirements of any securities  exchange upon which the Common Stock of the
     Company may be listed.

          d. Payment of Option  Price.  The  purchase  price of shares of Common
     Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option granted under the Plan
     shall be payable in cash or  check and/or previously-owned shares of Common

                                       -4-

<PAGE>

          
     Stock.  If the shares of Common Stock are tendered as payment of the option
     exercise price,  the value of such shares shall be the fair market value as
     of the date of  exercise.  If such tender  would  result in the issuance of
     fractional  shares of Common Stock,  the Company  shall instead  return the
     difference in cash or by check to the optionee.

          e. Rights as a Shareholder.  No shares of Common Stock shall be issued
     in respect of the exercise of an option  granted  under the Plan until full
     payment  therefor  has been  made.  The  holder of an option  shall have no
     rights as a  shareholder  with  respect to any shares  covered by an option
     until the date a stock certificate for such shares is issued to him or her.
     Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  no  adjustments  shall be made for
     dividends  or  distributions  of other  rights for which the record date is
     prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.

          f.  Nontransferability  of Options.  No option shall be  assignable or
     transferrable except upon the optionee's death to a beneficiary  designated
     by the optionee in accordance with procedures  established by the Board or,
     if no designated  beneficiary  shall survive the optionee,  pursuant to the
     optionee's  will or by the laws of  descent  and  distribution.  During  an
     optionee's  lifetime,  options may be exercised only by the optionee or the
     optionee's guardian or legal representative.

          g.  Termination  of  Service.  If an  optionee  ceases  to  serve as a
     director  of the  Company  for any  reason,  then each  outstanding  option
     granted  to him or her under the Plan  shall  terminate  on the date  three
     months after the date of such termination of service.

          h. Other  Provisions.  The Board may impose such other conditions with
     respect to the  exercise of options,  including,  without  limitation,  any

                                       -5-

<PAGE>
     conditions relating to the application of federal or state securities laws,
     as it may deem necessary or advisable.

     6. Capital Changes,  Reorganization,  Sale. If (a) the Company shall at any
time be  involved  in a  complete  or  partial  liquidation  or  reorganization,
including a merger,  consolidation,  or sale or distribution of assets,  (b) the
Company shall declare a stock dividend or subdivide or combine its Common Stock,
or (c)  any  other  event  shall  occur  which  in  the  judgment  of the  Board
necessitates  action by way of adjusting the terms of the option, then the Board
shall  forthwith  take any such action as in its judgment  shall be necessary to
preserve  to the  optionee  rights  substantially  proportionate  to the  rights
existing prior to such event or, in the case of a liquidation or reorganization,
terminate  the option upon notice  given at least  thirty (30) days prior to the
effective  date  of the  transaction,  or  provide  for  its  assumption  by any
surviving,  consolidated, or successor corporation;  provided, that in the event
that the  option  is  terminated,  the  option  shall be  exercisable  until the
effective date of such liquidation or  reorganization  in whole or in part as to
all shares then subject  thereto,  without  regard to any  installment  exercise
provisions (i.e., all vested and otherwise  nonvested options will be and become
exercisable until such effective date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right
to exercise options without regard to any installment  exercise provisions shall
not apply to any option holder who initiated  the  transaction  resulting in the
application  of this  paragraph 6 unless such person  initiated the  transaction
pursuant to instructions  or authority from the Company.  For the purpose of the
foregoing, actions taken by members of an option holder's family shall be deemed
to have been taken by him or her.

                                       -6-

     7. Amendment and  Termination of the Plan. The Board may amend or terminate
the Plan.  Except as  otherwise  provided  in the Plan  with  respect  to equity
changes,  any amendment  which would increase the aggregate  number of shares of
Common  Stock as to which  options  may be  granted  under the Plan,  materially
increase the benefits under the Plan, or modify the class of persons eligible to
receive  options  under  the  Plan  shall  be  subject  to the  approval  of the
stockholders of the Company.  No amendment or termination  may adversely  affect
any   outstanding   option   without  the  written   consent  of  the  optionee.
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  contained  herein or in any  option
agreement  made  hereunder,  the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5(a) of the Plan
and any other  provision of the Plan or of an option  agreement  relating to the
timing of option grants,  the amount of shares covered  thereby and the exercise
price  thereunder  may not be amended  more than once every six  months,  and no
amendment may be made to the Plan or an option agreement if, as a result of such
amendment, the Plan would no longer qualify as a "formula plan" under Rule 16b-3
issued  by the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  under  Section  16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     8. No Rights Conferred. Nothing contained herein will be deemed to give any
individual  any right to be retained or elected or re-elected as a member of the
Board.

     9. Governing Law. The Plan and each option  agreement  shall be governed in
all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware  without  giving effect to the
provisions relating to conflicts of law.

     10. Term of the Plan.  The Plan shall be  effective as of the date on which
it is adopted by the Board,  subject to the approval of the  stockholders of the


                                       -7-

<PAGE>

Company  within one year from the date of adoption  by the Board.  The Plan will
terminate  on the date ten  years  after  the date of  adoption,  unless  sooner
terminated by the Board.  The rights of optionees  under options  outstanding at
the time of the  termination of the Plan shall not be affected  solely by reason
of the  termination of the Plan and shall continue in accordance  with the terms
of the option (as then in effect or thereafter amended) and the Plan.

CORPORATE PROFILE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Zygo Corporation is a world leader in surface measurement technology and in
the  manufacture  of precision  surfaces.  Our precision  measuring  instruments
provide vital  information that enhances  productivity and lowers  manufacturing
costs of high technology  products by maintaining and improving  process control
as precision parts and systems are produced.  Zygo's measuring instruments serve
a  wide  variety  of  industries  including  data  storage,  semiconductor,  and
precision optics.

     Zygo's optical components are used in many applications,  including:  laser
fusion research,  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment, and aerospace optical
systems, as well as being an integral part of precision optical instruments.

     Founded in 1970, Zygo is a publicly owned company with shares traded on the
NASDAQ exchange. The Company is headquartered in a 100,000-square-foot  facility
in  Middlefield,  Connecticut,  with regional  sales,  service,  and  technology
centers in California and Singapore, and distributors/agents worldwide providing

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     From its founding in 1970,  Zygo has strived for  excellence  in everything
the company  does by  providing  products  and  services  that  exceed  customer
expectations in performance, quality and value.

     Zygo constructed the world's leading plano optics  fabrication  facility in
1971 and  introduced  its first  interferometer  in 1972.  With  this  measuring
instrument and several generations that followed, Zygo revolutionized the optics
industry by enabling routine  inspection of optical  components and systems with
unprecedented ease, accuracy, and flexibility.

     As Zygo grew it continued to develop technologically innovative products--a
distance  measurement  interferometer  to  precisely  measure  displacement  and
motion, and phase shifting and scanning white light interferometric  microscopes
to measure the shape and micro  roughness  of small  precision  surfaces.  These
innovative  instruments  are a major  part of  Zygo's  instrumentation  business
today.

     Zygo's  worldwide  reputation  for quality and  excellence  is a result and
tribute to the  creativity,  work, and commitment of Zygo's  employees both past
and  present.  As we mark the  company's  25th  anniversary,  we  reflect on the
milestones  reached  during  the first 25 years  (see pages 4 and 5) and set our
sights on an even more prosperous future.

TO OUR SHAREOWNERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your company  concluded  Fiscal 1995 by posting  record  performance in this our
25th  anniversary  year.  As we  announce  these  record  results  and our third
consecutive  year of improved  performance,  we also acknowledge the significant
milestones  reached  during our first 25 years as  displayed on pages 4 and 5 of
this annual report.  Net sales of $32.2 million for 1995 were up 34% as compared
to 1994 net sales of $24.1  million.  As was the case in fiscal 1994,  operating
profits,  pretax  profits and net earnings per share not only increased over the
previous  year  levels  but  attained  historical  highs for your  company.  Net
earnings of $.65 per share were almost three times the fiscal 1994 level of $.23
per share.  These  earnings  performance  records were  achieved  primarily as a
result of increased revenues and record high productivity within our operations.
Sales per employee  reached $173,000 and topped last year's previous record high
of $133,000 per  employee--a  gain of 30%. The strong demand for our  instrument
products  continued  throughout  fiscal 1995 and not only  fueled a  significant
revenue  increase,  but also established a year-end record backlog of nearly $13
million compared to a $3.8 million backlog at the end of fiscal 1994.

     Over the past three  years,  all of your  employees  have  dedicated  their
efforts to implement  the strategy put in place at the close of fiscal 1992,  to
significantly  improve  the revenue  growth and  financial  performance  of your
company.  This  strategy  has been  implemented  in three  phases:  securing and
strengthening the company's  foundation,  significantly  improving the company's
productivity  and  efficiency,  and  generating and  accelerating  the company's
revenue growth.


SECURING AND STRENGTHENING THE COMPANY'S FOUNDATION

Before  implementing  a plan to grow the  business,  it was  imperative  that we
solidify  the base upon which we would  launch and  sustain  our future  revenue
increases.  This effort, initiated at the close of fiscal 1992 and during fiscal
1993,  required us to reduce our employment  level to match the realities of the
then-depressed market conditions,  identify and prioritize the emerging needs of
our key markets,  and establish the new product development  programs that would
optimally satisfy those needs. These initiatives required the renewed dedication
and the best efforts of each  employee in our  organization.  As a result we are
now  identified as a preferred  supplier by many industry  leading  companies in
those  markets and have  enjoyed an almost 50%  increase in our  revenues  since
fiscal 1992.


SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY

The second  imperative  to our  strategy  was to improve  the  productivity  and
efficiency of our  operations  so that optimum  profits would be produced as our
revenues  increased.  At the core of this  effort  has been  our  total  quality
process improvement initiatives managed and implemented by our employees. All of
us at Zygo  understand  that revenue growth and improved  financial  performance
result from optimizing  customer  satisfaction  and improving the quality of the
way we do business.  Making these improvements requires a continuous improvement
process.  Since the beginning of fiscal 1993,  employees in every  department of
the  company  have  been  identifying  areas  of  waste  and  poor  quality  and
establishing  improvement projects.  They have focused their effort in 5 quality
improvement  areas:  improved  customer  satisfaction,  reduced waste,  improved
delivery dependability, reduced cycle time, and increased asset utilization. The
results of these efforts are most  impressive  with gross profit as a percentage
of net sales improving  steadily the past 3 years from 38% in fiscal 1992 to 44%
in  fiscal  1995 and our  productivity,  measured  by sales per  employee,  also
increasing  steadily  throughout  that period from  approximately  $107,000  per
employee to our record level of $173,000  per  employee.  These  efforts and the
improved  productivity  and  efficiency  resulting  from them have  allowed  the
company's  increased  revenues  to return the record  earnings  per share we now
enjoy.

GENERATE AND ACCELERATE THE COMPANY'S GROWTH POTENTIAL

Focusing our marketing and selling efforts on the leading  companies  within the
major industries we serve has allowed us to understand both the strategic trends
within those  industries  and the  specific  needs of those  customers.  A major
driving  force within those  industries  has been the need to reduce  production
defects and  significantly  increase  production  yields.  The previous cyclical
nature  of the  semiconductor  industry,  the data  storage  industry  and other
capital  goods sector  industries we serve,  have forced those  industries to no
longer depend on revenue growth to fuel financial performance  improvement,  but
rather  to focus on  production  yield  improvement.  We have  therefore  worked
closely  with the  leaders  of these  industries  to  transfer  our  measurement
technology  from  off-line  inspection  applications  to  on-the-production-line
process control applications.  By designing instrumentation that more accurately
detects defects and provides greater measurement  flexibility with significantly
increased throughput  capabilities,  we are now providing production improvement
systems to our  customers.  This ability to identify  product  defects,  collect
quantified  data on those  defects  and  provide  analysis  of those  defects to
upstream manufacturing  processes now make our instrumentation  valuable process
and yield improvement tools.

     Our  business  has  evolved  to  include  providing  integrated  production
solutions to our  customers  where  previously  we provided  almost  exclusively
off-line inspection instruments for the quality control laboratory. One of these
new  production-oriented  instruments is featured on page 6 of this report.  The
50% increase we have  enjoyed in the growth of our  instrument  and  accessories
business these last three years is a cumulative result of all of these efforts.

     We were most  gratified  during the past  fiscal  year with the  investment
community's response to our growth and improved financial performance and to see
the significant gains in the value of your company's  securities.  Responding to
increased demand for the company's securities,  your Board of Directors approved
a 3-for-2 stock split for shareowners of record on August 1, 1995,  payable as a
stock dividend on August 21, 1995.


OUTLOOK

We are very  optimistic  about the future  potential of your company as we enter
fiscal 1996.  Our improved  market  position,  our record high backlog,  and the
sustained  demand for our  products  and systems  bode well for  continuing  our
present  strong  performance  into fiscal 1996. For the longer term, the healthy
macroeconomic  projections  in the capital  goods  sector,  specifically  in the
computer, data storage and semiconductor  industries,  suggest that the economic
stimulus for the demand for our products should  continue.  In light of this, we
continue to invest heavily on new product  developments  specifically  geared to
serve the production improvement needs of our customers.

     You,  of course,  can count on all of our best  efforts to continue to move
your company forward as we take advantage of these improved  market  conditions.
As  always,  we thank you for your  continued  interest  in and  support of your
company.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[PHOTO]

o    Zygo's instrument product line consists of 7 major products within 3
     product families.

o    All instruments shipped in fiscal 1995 were introduced in the last 24
     months.

o    A major new product for 1995 was the AAB System shown at the right.


THE AAB SYSTEM

In the continuing effort to enhance financial  performance,  many industries are
focusing more effort on increasing production yields. Recognizing an opportunity
to assist in this effort,  Zygo is shifting its  corporate  direction to include
high-precision automated inspection systems for the production line.

     An excellent example is the in-process  inspection of precision  components
used in computer hard disk drives.  Manufacturers are continually  challenged to
increase  storage  capacity  while  reducing the physical size and cost of their
products.  As a result,  design  and  production  tolerances  are  shrinking  to
unprecedented  levels,  and  production  volumes  are at an all-time  high,  and
growing daily.

     To help keep pace with this demand,  disk storage  manufacturers  turned to
Zygo to provide automated, high-speed noncontact, quantitative inspection of the
tiny read/write heads that transfer electronic data to and from a spinning disk.
Zygo  responded  with the Automated  Air Bearing (AAB) Surface  Characterization
System.

     Based on Zygo's  MaximoGP  microscope,  the AAB System can  measure  20,000
heads  per  day to  extremely  tight  specifications.  Computer-controlled  part
positioning, automatic alignment, and special measurement software are optimized
for  high-speed  analysis  of  read/write  heads.  Also  included  is  real-time
statistical process control software to help monitor the production process.

     With Zygo's AAB System, manufacturers are now able to inspect 100% of their
heads at full production  volumes,  while valuable data is provided for refining
the control of the process.

PRECISION OPTICS

Zygo's  considerable  experience  with  complex  machining  of  special  optical
components  makes us a  competitive  choice for  projects  that demand  absolute
precision and performance. When a component's weight is important, as is usually
the case with aerospace components,  optical components must be designed to have
minimum mass while maintaining  opto-mechanical  stability. To manufacture these
complex designs,  computer  numerical control (CNC) machining  techniques may be
used to remove over 90% of the  component's  original mass in a process known as
"lightweighting." This process may be compared to a sculptor creating a delicate
statue, with a hollow interior, from a single block of stone.

     Microscopic subsurface stresses, a result of any glass shaping process, are
minimized by using a carefully  chosen sequence of  progressively  finer diamond
tools.  After  machining,  chemical  etching  techniques  may be used to further
increase the component's strength and reliability.

     Our expertise in this type of work provides our customers with an extensive
knowledge base for "design for manufacturability"  (DFM) considerations.  Zygo's
engineers often provide valuable design  alternatives which improve  performance
and reduce the cost of manufacturing.

     capabilities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results of Operations

Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994

Net sales of  $32,233,000  for fiscal 1995  increased  from fiscal 1994 sales by
$8,092,000  or 33.5%.  The  principal  reason for the  significant  increase was
additional sales of the Company's electro-optical  instrument products primarily
resulting from an improved economic climate in certain industry  segments,  most
notably semiconductor and data storage (disk drive) manufacturing,  and from the
introduction of a new fully-automated  electro-optical  instrument product which
is used by data  storage  industry  customers  to  improve  the  yield  of their
manufacturing  processes.  These increases were partially offset by a decline of
$340,000 in R&D contract  revenues  resulting from the completion in fiscal 1994
of a  research  and  development  contract  and  lower  sales  of the  Company's
precision custom optical components, which declined by $313,000 or 5.8% from the
year earlier.

     The Company's  sales outside the United States  amounted to  $14,981,000 in
fiscal 1995, an increase of $3,934,000  from fiscal 1994.  Sales in Japan during
fiscal 1995 amounted to $9,630,000,  an increase of $2,044,000 over fiscal 1994.
This increase  resulted  primarily from an increase in product sales in Japan in
fiscal 1995 of over 33% when compared to product sales in fiscal 1994, partially
offset by the absence in fiscal 1995 of R&D contract  revenues.  The significant
increase in product sales was primarily  due to the improving  Japanese  economy
and the strengthening of the semiconductor equipment market served by Canon Inc.
and Canon Sales Co., Inc., the Company's  exclusive  distributor in Japan. Sales
to other  geographic  markets outside the U.S.  amounted to $5,351,000 in fiscal
1995, a $1,890,000  increase from fiscal 1994. The 55% increase was  principally
the result of strong sales of the Company's  electro-optical  instruments to the
data  storage and  semiconductor  manufacturing  industry in the Pacific Rim and
increased sales in Europe as a result of an improved  general  economic  climate
there.

     Substantially  all of the Company's sales and costs are negotiated and paid
in U.S.  dollars.  Significant  changes  in the  values  of  foreign  currencies
relative to the value of the U.S.  dollar can impact the sales of the  Company's
products  in its  export  markets,  as would  changes  in the  general  economic
conditions  in those  markets.  The impact of such  changes in foreign  currency
values on the Company's sales cannot be measured.

     Gross  profit in fiscal  1995  amounted  to  $14,231,000,  an  increase  of
$3,615,000  (34.1%)  over gross profit in fiscal  1994,  principally  due to the
increase in sales and a slight  improvement  in gross  profit  margins on actual
shipments.  As a percentage of sales,  gross profit in fiscal 1995 was 44.2%, as
compared to 44.0% in fiscal 1994.

     Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses in fiscal 1995 decreased by
$138,000  from fiscal  1994.  As a  percentage  of sales,  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses  were 20.3% and 27.7% in fiscal  1995 and fiscal  1994,
respectively.  Selling  expenses,  including  salaries,  advertising,  and sales
promotion expenses related to the Company's electro-optical  instrument products
as well as  commissions  on higher sales,  increased  $307,000 from fiscal 1994.
Administrative expenses decreased by $445,000 principally as a result of reduced
legal expenses incurred in connection with the Company's litigation against WYKO
Corporation for patent  infringement,  currently  pending appeal,  the status of
which is  discussed  below  in the  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  section.
Additional   administrative  cost  reductions  reflect  the  completion  of  the
implementation  of a new Business  Management  Information  System and continued
strict cost controls.

     Research  and  development  costs in fiscal  1995  totaled  $3,967,000  and
increased by $1,181,000 or 42.4% from fiscal 1994. The increase was  principally
the result of spending  associated  with the  creation  and  operation of an R&D
facility  in  Simi  Valley,  California,  which  is  focused  on  designing  and
developing  production-oriented  test  and  measurement  products  for the  data
storage  industry.  The first product being  developed  there is a flying height
tester.  Additionally,  the amount of  expense  incurred  in fiscal  1995 at the
Company's  Middlefield,  Connecticut,  facility  increased  from  fiscal 1994 to
support several R&D projects underway there. As a percentage of sales,  research
and  development  costs  were 12.3% and 11.5% in fiscal  1995 and  fiscal  1994,
respectively.

     In fiscal 1995,  the Company had operating  profit of $3,727,000  (11.6% of
net sales) as compared to  $1,155,000  (4.8% of net sales) in fiscal  1994.  The
222.7% improvement  resulted principally from higher gross profit from increased
sales volume, partially offset by the increase in R&D expense.

     Interest  income in fiscal 1995 amounted to $372,000 and was $34,000 higher
than fiscal 1994,  principally  due to generally  higher  interest  rates on the
Company's  marketable  securities  and  short-term  cash  investments.  Interest
expense  decreased  in fiscal  1995 by  $11,000  from  $51,000  in  fiscal  1994
primarily as the result of lower  average  principal  balances on the  Company's
long-term debt, which was fully repaid in the quarter ended March 31, 1995.

     Backlog at June 30, 1995,  was  $12,993,000  compared to $3,782,000 at June
30, 1994.  The  $9,211,000  increase in backlog was primarily a result of strong
demand  for  all  of  the   Company's   electro-optical   instrument   products,
particularly  its distance  measuring  interferometers  used in precision motion
control  applications such as  microlithography  in semiconductor and flat-panel
display  manufacturing  and  its  microscope  products  used  in  a  variety  of
industrial  applications,  most notably in the production of read-write heads in
the  data  storage  industry.  The  backlog  of  the  Company's  electro-optical
instruments  and  accessories at June 30, 1995,  increased  $7,355,000 or nearly
400% from that at June 30, 1994. The backlog of the Company's  precision  custom
optical  components  increased  by  $1,834,000  (94%) from the year earlier as a
result of improved demand for sophisticated optical components.

     The  Company  reported  net  earnings  and  earnings  per common and common
equivalent  share of  $2,749,000  and  $.65,  respectively,  in  fiscal  1995 as
compared to $918,000  and $.23 per share in fiscal 1994.  All per share  amounts
are adjusted to reflect the Company's  3-for-2 stock split  effected in the form


                                       10

of a 50% stock  dividend which was paid on August 21, 1995, to  shareholders  of
record on August 1, 1995.

     The Company  continues to emphasize  strict cost control  while at the same
time  investing in product  development  and  marketing in order to maximize its
share of its markets and create new market opportunities.


Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993

Net sales of  $24,141,000  for fiscal 1994  increased  from fiscal 1993 sales by
$1,439,000 or 6%. The principal  reason for the increase was additional sales of
the Company's  electro-optical  instrument  products primarily resulting from an
improved  economic climate in certain industry  segments and the introduction of
several new  electro-optical  instrument  products  which  totally  replaced the
Company's   electro-optical   instrument  product  line.  These  increases  were
partially  offset by a decline of $1,020,000 in R&D contract  revenues and lower
sales  of  the  Company's   precision  custom  optical  components  due  to  the
culmination  of a significant  contract from the University of Rochester for its
laser fusion programs.

     The Company's  sales outside the United States  amounted to  $11,047,000 in
fiscal 1994, an increase of $2,350,000  from fiscal 1993.  Sales in Japan during
fiscal 1994 amounted to $7,586,000,  an increase of $2,939,000 over fiscal 1993,
which  occurred  despite the decline in fiscal  1994 of R&D  contract  revenues.
Product  sales in Japan  increased in fiscal 1994 by over 100% when  compared to
product sales in fiscal 1993. The significant  increase was due to the improving
Japanese  economy and the  strengthening of the  semiconductor  equipment market
served by Canon Inc.  and Canon Sales  Company  Inc.,  the  Company's  exclusive
distributor in Japan.

     Gross  profit in fiscal 1994  amounted to  $10,616,000  and was  $1,567,000
higher  than in  fiscal  1993  principally  due to the  increase  in  sales  and
improvement  in gross profit  margins on actual  shipments.  As a percentage  of
sales,  gross  profit in fiscal  1994 was 44.0%,  as compared to 39.9% in fiscal
1993.  The  gross  profit  percentage  of sales  improvement  was due in part to
benefits from  continued  improvement  of the Company's  cost  structure and the
impact of the  introduction  of new  lower-cost  instrument  products  partially
offset by the lack of higher margins  associated with the R&D contract  revenues
earned in fiscal 1993 and by the impact of continued  aggressive pricing actions
in response to sluggish market conditions in certain markets.

     Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses in fiscal 1994 increased by
$677,000  from fiscal  1993.  As a  percentage  of sales,  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses  were 27.7% and 26.4% in fiscal  1994 and fiscal  1993,
respectively.  Selling  expenses,  including  advertising  and  sales  promotion
expenses  related to the Company's new  electro-optical  instrument  products as
well as  commissions  on higher  sales,  increased  $52,000  from  fiscal  1993.
Administrative  expenses  increased  by $625,000  as a result of legal  expenses
incurred in connection with the Company's  litigation  against WYKO  Corporation
for patent infringement. Additional administrative costs incurred in fiscal 1994
were associated with the implementation of a new Business Management Information
System.

     Research  and  development  costs in fiscal  1994  totaled  $2,786,000  and
decreased  by  $291,000  from  fiscal  1993,  principally  as a result  of lower
spending on project materials as the majority of new products were introduced in
fiscal 1993 or early in fiscal  1994.  As a  percentage  of sales,  research and
development  costs  were  11.5%  and  13.6%  in  fiscal  1994 and  fiscal  1993,
respectively.  During the quarter ended September 30, 1992, the Company received
a $1,700,000  fixed price  research  and  development  contract  from Canon Inc.
Revenues under the contract were recorded under the  cost-to-cost  percentage of
completion method of accounting. The contract was completed in the first quarter
of fiscal 1994 with the final  $340,000 of net sales  under the  contract  being
recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 1993.

     In fiscal 1994, the Company had operating  profit of $1,155,000 as compared
to a $26,000 operating loss in fiscal 1993. The significant improvement resulted
principally from higher gross profit.

     Interest  income in fiscal 1994  amounted to $338,000  and was $41,000 less
than in fiscal 1993,  principally  due to lower  interest rates on the Company's
marketable securities. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 1994 by $18,000 from
$69,000 in fiscal 1993 primarily as the result of lower  principal  balances and
lower  interest  rates on the  Company's  long-term  debt in  fiscal  1994.  The
principal reason for the change in miscellaneous  income/expense--net  in fiscal
1994 versus fiscal 1993 was the absence of income,  which the Company recognized
in June  1993,  resulting  from a $400,000  contingent  payout by  LaserMike  in
conjunction with its purchase of the IMAGE product line in June 1992.

     Backlog at June 30, 1994, was $3,782,000 compared to $5,871,000 at June 30,
1993. Backlog declined primarily as a result of the culmination of a significant
contract from the  University  of Rochester  for its laser fusion  program which
significantly  impacted the backlog of the Company's  precision  custom  optical
components,  as well as the completion of the R&D contract with Canon  described
above.

     The  Company  reported  net  earnings  and  earnings  per common and common
equivalent share of $918,000 and $.23, respectively,  in fiscal 1994 as compared
to  $481,000  and $.12 per share in fiscal  1993.  Per share  figures  have been
adjusted to reflect the impact of the 3-for-2 stock split  effective  August 21,
1995.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

At June 30, 1995,  working  capital was  $17,072,000,  an increase of $2,183,000
from the amount at June 30, 1994, and the Company had cash and cash  equivalents
of  $2,428,000  and  marketable  securities   available-for-sale   amounting  to
$7,746,000 for a total of $10,174,000, a decrease of $230,000 from the amount of
cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable   securities  at  June  30,  1994.
Receivables increased by $2,187,000,  and inventory increased by $2,390,000 from
the amounts at June 30, 1994. The receivables  increase was due primarily to the

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

significant  growth in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 which were
$4,400,000  higher than the same  quarter in fiscal  1994,  partially  offset by
aggressive  collections  within the last quarter of the fiscal  year.  Inventory
increased primarily due to the growth in sales of the Company's  electro-optical
instruments.  Accounts  payable  increased  by  $1,360,000  in  fiscal  1995  to
$2,515,000,  principally  as a result of the increase in  inventories  and other
costs associated with the growth of the business. The Company's expenditures for
property,  plant,  and  equipment  totaled  $1,631,000  in fiscal 1995 which was
$281,000 less than the prior fiscal year. The principal  reason for the decrease
was lower expenditures for hardware,  software,  and consulting  associated with
the  implementation  of the Company's new fully integrated  Business  Management
Information System,  which was fully installed in the quarter ended December 31,
1994. Although the actual level will be influenced by many factors,  the Company
anticipates  that  expenditures  for plant and  equipment in fiscal 1996 will be
approximately  the same as in fiscal 1995. On June 23, 1995, the Company's Board
of Directors approved the purchase of approximately 22 acres of land adjacent to
the Company's  facility in  Middlefield,  Connecticut,  for a purchase  price of
$440,000. The land, which is jointly owned by Paul F. Forman, Sol F. Laufer, and
Carl A.  Zanoni,  founders of the  Company,  will  facilitate  expansion  of the
Company's  buildings  and/or parking  facilities in the future.  The purchase is
expected to occur during the quarter ending March 31, 1996. As of June 30, 1995,
there were no borrowings outstanding under the Company's $3,000,000 bank line of
credit.  Unused  amounts under the line of credit are  available for  short-term
working  capital  needs.  During the quarter  ended March 31, 1995,  the Company
prepaid all of its  outstanding  long-term  debt  obligation to the  Connecticut
Development  Authority.  Stockholders'  equity at June 30,  1995,  increased  by
$3,059,000  from the year  earlier  to  $22,333,000,  reflecting  net  income of
$2,749,000, increases in the Company's common stock and paid-in capital accounts
resulting  from the exercise of employee  stock options and the reduction of the
unrealized  loss, net of the related tax effect,  on the Company's  portfolio of
marketable securities of $65,000.

     The Company's  U.S.  federal income tax return for fiscal 1991 was reviewed
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) during fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1994. During
the quarter ended March 31, 1994, the Company  reached a settlement with the IRS
regarding  the audit of its fiscal 1991 tax  return.  In the  settlement,  which
affected both the fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 federal tax returns, a tax payment
of $432,700 was made to the IRS and interest of $91,600 which had accrued on the
balance was also paid.  As a result of amending  the fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992
federal tax returns,  the Company also filed  amended  returns with the State of
Connecticut  and with  various  other  states in which the  Company  pays income
taxes.  Taxes and interest paid to the states  amounted to $111,700 and $31,500,
respectively.  The tax payments  resulted  from the IRS'  disagreement  with the
Company as to the timing of certain tax deductions which the Company took on its
fiscal 1991 return  relative to  inventories.  Interest  payments  were  charged
against a miscellaneous  expense accrual  established at June 30, 1993, for this
purpose. Income tax payments amounted to $793,100 in fiscal 1995 (including cash
payments net of cash refunds of $565,600 and $227,500 of prior year overpayments
applied to fiscal  1995),  $1,185,000  in fiscal  1994  (including  $544,400  of
additional taxes owed for fiscal 1991), and $309,000 in fiscal 1993.

     As a result of  amending  the fiscal  1992 tax  returns,  the  Company  had
federal and state tax refunds  due  amounting  to  $102,800.  At June 30,  1995,
$88,900 of cash refunds had been received.  In addition,  $13,900 of refunds due
were applied to reduce the Company's taxes owed for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and
1995.

     In March  1994,  the Company  filed its fiscal  1993  federal and state tax
returns,  taking into account the roll forward effect of the timing  differences
created by the  above-mentioned  settlement,  and as a result,  had overpayments
amounting  to $187,600,  which were  applied to taxes owed for fiscal  1995.  In
March 1995,  the Company  filed its fiscal 1994  federal and state tax  returns,
which  because of the method of  calculating  and paying  estimated tax payments
throughout fiscal 1995 resulted in additional overpayments of $39,900 which were
also applied to taxes owed for fiscal 1995.

Zygo Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiary
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
June 30, 1995, 1994, and 1993


(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation--The  consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned Foreign Sales  Corporation  ("FSC")
subsidiary.  All material  transactions and accounts with the subsidiaries  have
been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.

     The Company also owns 100% of Zygo Credit  Corporation  which was formed in
fiscal 1983. Activity of Zygo Credit Corporation has been insignificant to date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents--The  Company considers cash and cash investments with
maturities at the date of purchase of less than three months to be cash and cash
equivalents.

Marketable  Securities--The  Company  considers  investments in securities  with
maturities  at the date of  purchase  in  excess of three  months as  marketable
securities. Marketable securities primarily consist of tax-exempt municipal debt
securities.  The Company  adopted  the  provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 115,  Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities  ("Statement 115") at June 30, 1994. The change in accounting
for  Marketable  Securities had no effect on retained  earnings.  All securities
held by the  Company  at June 30,  1995,  1994,  and 1993,  were  classified  as
available-for-sale  and  recorded at fair value.  Unrealized  holding  gains and
losses,  net of the related tax effect,  on  available-for-sale  securities  are
excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity until realized.

Inventories--Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of cost  (determined  on a
first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Revenue  Recognition--Sales,  other  than sales  under  long-term  research  and
development  contracts,  are recognized when units are shipped. Sales related to
long-term  fixed-price  research and development  contracts are recognized under
the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method of accounting.

Depreciation--Depreciation  rates are based on the estimated useful lives of the
various classes of assets and are computed using the straight-line method.

Research and Development  Costs--Research  and development costs are expensed as
incurred.

Income Taxes--Effective July 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  ("Statement 109").
The  cumulative  effect of that  change in the method of  accounting  for income
taxes in fiscal 1993 was not material.

Earnings Per  Share--Earnings  per common and common  equivalent  share  amounts
represent  primary  earnings per share and are based upon the  weighted  average
number of common shares  outstanding,  plus, when their effect is dilutive,  the
weighted  average number of shares  issuable upon exercise of outstanding  stock
options, less the weighted average number of common shares which could have been
repurchased  with the  proceeds  available  from  the  assumed  exercise  of the
outstanding  options.  Fully  diluted  earnings per share are not  significantly
different from primary earnings per share.

Gain  Contingency--The  Company was awarded  $2,668,710 plus recovery of certain
costs in a judgment  rendered by the United States  District Court  (District of
Arizona) on June 2, 1994.  The  Court's  decision  was  appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit located in Washington, D.C. by the defendant and
oral  arguments  of the appeal  were  heard by the Court on March 9,  1995.  The
Company has not and will not record any gain from the  district  court  judgment
until a final determination of the award is made.

Stock  Split--Subsequent  to fiscal 1995,  the Board of Directors of the Company
declared a 3-for-2 split of the Company's common shares, effected in the form of
a 50% stock  dividend paid on August 21, 1995, to  shareholders  of record as of
the close of business on August 1, 1995. All presentations  involving numbers of
shares  and  amounts  per share in 1995 and prior  years have been  restated  to
reflect the stock split.


(2) Marketable Securities

Marketable  securities at June 30, 1995,  consist  primarily of tax-exempt bonds
issued by various state and municipal agencies which are reported at fair value.
The unrealized  loss on marketable  securities of $4,889 (gross) is shown net of
its  related  tax  effect of $1,956 as a  separate  component  of  stockholders'
equity.

     Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. Realized gains and
losses  are   included  in  earnings   and  are  derived   using  the   specific
identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.

     The cost, gross unrealized  holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses,
and fair value for available-for-sale  securities at June 30, 1995, and June 30,
1994, were as follows:

                                             Gross           Gross

                                             $7,751         $7,746
                                             ======         ======


(3) Bank Line of Credit

The Company has a $3,000,000  unsecured bank line of credit with interest at the
bank's prime rate. The line of credit is available through November 30, 1995. At
June 30, 1995,  and June 30, 1994,  no amounts were  outstanding  under the bank
line of credit.


(4) Long-Term Debt

In the quarter  ended  March 31,  1995,  the  Company  retired its 1977 and 1981
Series   Industrial   Development   Bonds   totaling   $375,000  and   $150,000,
respectively,  prior to  scheduled  maturity.  This  transaction  resulted in no
extraordinary  gain or loss. The funds for these  retirements were obtained from
internally generated cash flows.

     Interest payments were $39,900,  $50,800, and $69,900 in fiscal 1995, 1994,
and 1993, respectively.


(5) Profit-Sharing Plan

The Company maintains a deferred  profit-sharing  plan under which substantially
all   full-time   employees  of  the  Company  are   eligible  to   participate.
Profit-sharing  expense  for the  years  ended  June 30,  1995,  1994,  and 1993
amounted  to  $440,000,  $147,500,  and  $77,500,  respectively.  Profit-sharing
contributions  are  determined  annually  at  the  discretion  of the  Board  of
Directors.

     Effective June 30, 1985, the existing  profit-sharing  plan was revised and
amended to incorporate a 401(k) tax deferred  payroll  deduction  program and an
Employee Stock Ownership Program.  Under the 401(k),  employees may contribute a
tax deferred amount of up to 15% of their compensation,  as defined. The Company
may  contribute an amount to the 401(k) which amount is  determined  annually at
the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The 401(k)  contribution  expense for
the years ended June 30, 1995,  1994,  and 1993 amounted to $255,000,  $146,400,
and $152,200, respectively.

     Under the  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Program,  the  Company  may,  at the
discretion  of the  Board  of  Directors,  contribute  its own  stock or cash to
purchase  its own stock.  Such  stock's  fair market  value shall not exceed the
maximum amount of employee stock  ownership  credit as determined  under Section
416 of the Internal  Revenue Code.  There were no purchases and no contributions
made under this program for the years ended June 30, 1995, 1994, and 1993.


(6) Stockholders' Agreements

In November  1993,  Canon Inc.,  Wesleyan  University,  Paul F. Forman,  Carl A.
Zanoni,  and Sol F. Laufer,  and the Company  terminated an agreement  which had
been effective since December 1983 when the Company's registration statement for
the initial public  offering of its Common Stock was declared  effective.  Under
that agreement, they had agreed among other things, to vote their shares for the
election to the Company's Board of Directors of two directors designated by each
of Canon Inc., Wesleyan University,  and Paul F. Forman, Carl A. Zanoni, and Sol
F. Laufer, as a group.  During the period that the agreement was in effect,  the
voting requirements  thereof effectively  determined the outcome of the election
of all members of the Company's Board of Directors.

     At  the  time  of  the  termination  of  the  Stockholders'   Agreement,  a
Registration   Rights  Agreement  was  entered  into  by  Canon  Inc.,  Wesleyan
University,  Paul F. Forman,  Carl A. Zanoni, Sol F. Laufer, and the Company. In
general,  the Registration Rights Agreement grants to each of these stockholders
the right,  until  November 30, 1998,  to have his or its shares of Common Stock
included in any registered public offering of the Company's securities.


(7) Stockholders' Equity

On July 20, 1995,  the Board of Directors  declared a 3-for-2 split  effected in
the form of a 50% stock dividend  payable on August 21, 1995, to shareholders of
record  on  August  1,  1995.  This  transaction  resulted  in the  issuance  of
approximately 1,309,000 additional shares of Common Stock.  Stockholders' Equity
has been  adjusted to recognize  the effect of the stock split by  reclassifying
from retained earnings to paid-in capital the par value of the additional shares
arising from the split. In addition,  all references in the financial statements
to numbers of shares, per share amounts, stock option data, and market prices of
the Company's Common Stock have been restated to give retroactive recognition to
the stock split.  On July 20, 1995, the Board of Directors  approved an increase
in the  authorized  shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock from  10,000,000  to
15,000,000 subject to shareholder approval.


(8) Stock Options and Stock Ownership Plans

On  September  3, 1987,  the Board of Directors  adopted a  non-qualified  stock
option plan (the  "Non-Qualified  Plan") providing for non-qualified  options to
purchase Common Stock of the Company and reserved 300,000 shares of Common Stock
for issuance upon the exercise of options under the  Non-Qualified  Plan. During
fiscal year 1990, the amount of shares reserved under the Non-Qualified Plan was
increased  to 600,000.  On August 26, 1992,  the Board of Directors  amended and
restated the  Non-Qualified  Plan and increased the amount of shares reserved to
975,000.  On November 19, 1992,  the Amended and  Restated  Non-Qualified  Stock


                                       18

<PAGE>

Option Plan (the "Amended and Restated  Non-Qualified Plan") was approved by the
Company's stockholders.  At June 30, 1995, options to purchase 688,838 shares of
Common Stock, at prices of $2.50 to $13.83 per share, were outstanding under the
Amended and Restated  Non-Qualified  Plan of which  options to purchase  264,525
shares were exercisable at prices of $2.50 to $5.17 per share. Options exercised
during  fiscal  1995,  1994,  and 1993 were 38,250  shares at $2.50 to $4.00 per
share;  2,588 shares at $2.83 to $3.83 per share;  and 71,121 shares at $2.20 to
$3.50 per share, respectively. At June 30, 1995, there were 45,170 Common Shares
reserved  for future  issuance of stock  options  under the Amended and Restated
Non-Qualified  Plan.  On August  24,  1995 the Board of  Directors  approved  an
increase  in the number of shares  authorized  under  this plan from  975,000 to
1,425,000, subject to shareholder approval.

     On August 25, 1994, the Board of Directors adopted a Non-Employee  Director
Stock Option Plan providing for  non-qualified  options to purchase Common Stock
of the Company and reserved 300,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance upon the
exercise of options under the  Non-Employee  Director Stock Option Plan. At June
30, 1995,  options to purchase  187,500  shares of Common  Stock,  at a price of
$4.00 per share, were outstanding  under the Non-Employee  Director Stock Option
Plan, none of which were then exercisable.

(9) Income Taxes

The components of income tax expense (benefit) for each year are as follows:

     During fiscal 1994, the Internal  Revenue Service  completed an examination
of the Company's fiscal 1991 U.S. federal income tax return.  Adjustments to the
fiscal 1991 income tax return generated  deferred tax benefits which the Company
has received or expects to receive in subsequent years.

     Income taxes paid amounted to $793,100 (including cash payments net of cash
refunds of $565,600  and $227,500 of prior year  overpayments  applied to fiscal
1995),  $1,185,000  (including  additional  taxes  owed for  fiscal  1991),  and
$309,000 in fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

     The total income tax expense  differs from the amount  computed by applying
the applicable  U.S.  federal  income tax rate of 34% to earnings  before income
taxes for the following reasons:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
June 30, 1995, 1994, and 1993


     The net  current  deferred  tax  assets  and net  noncurrent  deferred  tax
liabilities  as recorded on the balance sheet as of June 30, 1995 and 1994,  are
as follows:

                                               June 30,      June 30,
(Thousands of dollars)                           1995         1994
                                                ------        -----  
Net current deferred tax asset .............    $1,043        $ 825
Net noncurrent deferred tax liability ......      (668)        (655)
                                                ------        -----  
Net deferred tax asset .....................    $  375        $ 170
                                                ======        =====  


     A valuation  allowance has not been recorded  because the Company  believes
that the  deferred  tax assets  will,  more likely than not, be  realized.  This
determination is based largely upon the Company's  historical  earnings trend as
well as its ability to  carryback  reversing  items within three years to offset
taxes paid.  In  addition,  the Company has the ability to offset  deferred  tax
assets  against   deferred  tax  liabilities   associated  with  such  items  as
depreciation and amortization.

jointly owned by Paul F. Forman, Sol F. Laufer, and Carl A. Zanoni,  founders of
the Company, will facilitate expansion of the Company's buildings and/or parking
facilities  in the future.  The purchase is expected to occur during the quarter

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Zygo Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zygo Corporation
and  consolidated  subsidiary  as of June 30,  1995   and 1994,  and the related
consolidated  statements  of earnings,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for
each  of the  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  June  30,  1995.  These
consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of Zygo
Corporation  and  consolidated  subsidiary as of June 30, 1995 and 1994, and the
