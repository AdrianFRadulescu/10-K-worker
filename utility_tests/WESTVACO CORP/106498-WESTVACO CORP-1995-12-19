                                  PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL
Westvaco Corporation is one of the major producers of paper and
paperboard in the United States.  It converts paper and paperboard
into a variety of end-products, manufactures a variety of
specialty chemicals, produces lumber, sells timber from its
timberlands and is engaged in land development.  In Brazil, it is
a major producer of paperboard and corrugated packaging for the
markets of that country.   It also exports products from both the
United States and Brazil to other countries throughout the world.
The term "Westvaco" or "the company" includes Westvaco Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise noted.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The company's principal business segments are the manufacture of
bleached paper, paperboard and packaging products, unbleached
paper, paperboard and packaging products and specialty chemicals.
Financial information about the company's business segments is
contained in Note N to the consolidated financial statements,
included in the 1995 Westvaco Annual Report on pages 30 to 31, and
is incorporated herein by reference.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
The principal markets for Westvaco's products are in the United
States.  Sales to customers outside the United States made up
approximately 21% of Westvaco's total sales in 1995 (1994-19%,
1993-18%).  Substantially all products are sold through the
company's own sales force.  Westvaco maintains 28 sales offices
located throughout the United States and 25 in foreign countries.

TIMBERLANDS
The principal raw material used in the manufacture of paper,
paperboard and pulp is wood.  Westvaco owns 1,453,000 acres of
timberland in the United States and Brazil.  Westvaco's
Cooperative Forest Management Program provides an additional
source of wood fiber for its mills from the 1,394,000 acres
covered by the program.  All acreage is located within economic
reach of the company's mills.

Westvaco timberlands are well stocked, mainly with vigorous pine
plantations and natural hardwoods.  Most pine stands harvested are
plantations and are regenerated by establishing new pine
plantations.  Most hardwood stands harvested are re-established by
planned natural regeneration, but Westvaco also operates hardwood
plantation programs involving several species.  Westvaco's
intensive program of planting, fertilizing, control of competing
vegetation and improvement through tree breeding has substantially
increased wood fiber yield per acre from plantations.  While
Westvaco's lands have the potential to supply considerably more
timber resources than the amount currently being harvested from
them, the location of its mills and composition of surrounding
land ownership make it possible to rely on other growers for
substantial quantities of wood.  The quantity of wood harvested by
Westvaco from its lands in any year is primarily controlled by
long-range forest management programs.

During 1995, Westvaco's timberlands harvested the equivalent of
approximately 37% (1994-36%, 1993-36%) of the wood requirements of
its mills.  In 1995, the company purchased 8% (1994-9%, 1993-9%)
of its wood requirements from non-industrial private owners of
timberlands participating in its Cooperative Forest Management
Program.  The remainder of its mill needs was purchased from other
independent wood, chip and sawmill waste suppliers.  Each mill is
supported by a wood procurement organization.  Approximately 31
pulpwood concentration and processing yards are strategically
located and have facilities for storing and shipping wood to the
mills.

The supply of wood available to Westvaco from its lands and from
other sources has been adequate for its production requirements.
Westvaco anticipates that there will continue to be an adequate
supply of

                               I-1
2
<PAGE>

wood fiber available from its own lands and from other
sources to satisfy its requirements.  The company continues to
invest in forest research and practice its intensive forest
management techniques, both of which increase the ability to
provide fiber to its mills in the future.  Westvaco's sole source
of fiber for its domestic operations is from the United States.
The company's Brazilian subsidiary uses only Brazilian fiber
sources. It has a high degree of fiber self-sufficiency from pine
plantations on its own timberlands base, located in the temperate
area of southern Brazil over 1,000 miles south of the Amazon
basin.

PATENTS
Westvaco has obtained a number of patents as a result of its
research and product development efforts, and such patents and any
licenses granted thereunder can be regarded as measures of its
accomplishments.  Westvaco is the owner of many registered
trademarks for its products.  Westvaco is not materially dependent
on trademarks, patents or licenses under patents held by others.

DEPENDENCE UPON A SINGLE CUSTOMER
In fiscal year 1995, approximately 15% of the company's bleached
segment sales were made to the domestic tobacco industry, which
consists of a limited number of major companies.  However, a
significant portion of this paper and board is used for products
which are exported.  Excluding this portion, approximately 8.5% of
bleached segment sales were made to the domestic tobacco industry
for sale in the United States.  The current legal and regulatory
pressures on that industry could have an adverse effect on future
bleached segment sales and profitability.  The company would
expect to offset unit volume declines, if any, in U. S. tobacco
sales by continuing growth in sales to the liquid, dry and frozen
food, personal care, foreign tobacco and other consumer product
markets of the world.

COMPETITION
Westvaco's strategy is to compete by developing distinctive and
innovative products and services for our customers in the United
States and world markets.  There are many large, well established
and highly competitive sellers competing in these markets as well.

RESEARCH
Westvaco operates major research facilities at Laurel, MD,
Charleston, SC, and Covington, VA, and a forest science laboratory
at Summerville, SC.  Forest research centers at Wickliffe, KY,
Rupert, WV, and Tres Barras, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, are
working on research relating to growing and sustaining the
production of timber and fiber, such as genetics, tree nutrition,
regeneration, stand management, environmental protection and
forest measurements.  The company's larger divisions and
subsidiaries also have product development staffs which work on
product-related projects directed toward specific opportunities of
the individual units.

The company incurred $31.4 million (1994-$30.6 million, 1993-$30.5
million) of research and development costs.  Substantially all of
the research projects are company sponsored.  Approximately 190
scientists were employed in research and development activities.
                                     
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Westvaco is subject to federal and state pollution control laws
and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it has operating
facilities.  Compliance with these requirements involves the
diversion of capital from productive facilities and increases
operating costs.  In the opinion of Westvaco's management,
environmental protection requirements will not adversely affect
the company's competitive industry position since other domestic
companies are subject to similar requirements.  Capital
expenditures for pollution control facilities are expected to
approximate $150 and $120 million in 1996 and 1997, respectively,
which includes the investment for the removal of elemental
chlorine as noted below.

The company operates in an industry subject to extensive environmental
regulations.  Future capital expenditures for pollution control
facilities are expected to increase substantially as a result of
proposed EPA air and water quality regulations for the U. S. paper
industry.  In 1995, the company authorized the final step in a long-
term program initiated in 1989 which will result in the removal of
elemental chlorine from all of

                                   I-2
3
<PAGE>

our pulp bleaching processes.  To
accomplish this, Westvaco authorized an expenditure of $140 million in
the spring of 1995, and we expect the program to be complete in 1997.
This is an initial step in addressing the anticipated regulations.
Total required expenditures related to EPA's proposals could fall in
the range of $175 to $400 million.  Additional operating costs,
including depreciation, for these new facilities could fall in the
range of $25 to $50 million pretax annually.  Currently, the company
does not expect final rules until sometime in 1996 with implementation
required over several years thereafter.  It will be difficult to
develop more precise estimates until the proposed rules become final.

EMPLOYEES
At November 30, 1995, Westvaco employed approximately 13,030
persons, of whom 6,275 domestic employees are represented by
various labor unions under collective bargaining agreements.
Approximately 1,990 employees of Rigesa, Ltda. ("Rigesa"),
Westvaco's Brazilian subsidiary, are represented under collective
bargaining arrangements.  Westvaco believes its labor relations
are good.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
In Brazil, Rigesa operates a paperboard mill and a corrugated box
plant in Valinhos, State of Sao Paulo; a paperboard mill in Tres
Barras, State of Santa Catarina; and corrugated box plants in
Blumenau, State of Santa Catarina; Manaus, State of Amazonia; and
Fortaleza, State of Ceara.  Rigesa is one of the few paper
companies in Brazil which is integrated from the forests to the
markets.  This fact, combined with technology drawn from
Westvaco's U.S. experience, has provided Rigesa with a history of
high-quality products and strong historic growth.  Operating
results at Rigesa continue to be subject to the uncertain economic
and political conditions in Brazil.

Westvaco's Czech Republic subsidiary, Westvaco Svitavy, spol. s
r.o.("Svitavy"), began operating a paper converting plant in that
country during the 1995 fiscal fourth quarter.  Svitavy supplies
consumer packaging to the markets of Eastern, Central and Western
Europe.  The packaging is made primarily from distinctive paper
and paperboard produced by Westvaco in the United States.

Export sales from Westvaco's U.S. operations made up approximately
14% of Westvaco's 1995 sales (1994-13%, 1993-12%).  Rigesa's
sales, including exports, were 7% of Westvaco's total sales (1994-
6%, 1993-6%).  For information concerning the income of Westvaco's
foreign subsidiaries for the three years ended October 31, 1995
and the assets for the two-year period then ended, see Note J to
the consolidated financial statements, incorporated by reference
in Part II of this report.  While there are risks inherent in
foreign investments, Westvaco does not believe at this time that
such risks are material to its overall business prospects.

CAPACITY AND PRODUCTION
Capacity is based on the expected operations and product mix of
each of the locations.  Whether capacity can in practice be
attained or exceeded is dependent upon a variety of factors such
as actual product mix, quantity and timing of production runs,
required maintenance time and labor conditions.

                              I-4
5
<PAGE>

The annual productive capacity is approximately 3,142,000 tons for
the paper and paperboard mills and 1,168,000 tons for the
converting plants.  The 1995 production from these facilities was
3,105,000 and 926,000 tons, respectively.  The mills supplied 74%
of the paper and paperboard needs of the converting plants.  The
annual productive capacity for the chemical plants is 495,000
tons.  In 1995, 452,000 tons of specialty chemicals were produced.

LEASES
See Note H to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated
by reference in Part II of this report, for financial data on
leases.  Substantially all of the leases of production facilities
contain options to purchase or renew for future periods.

TIMBERLANDS
Westvaco owns 1,453,000 acres of timberlands.  There are 1,103,000
acres in the South and Middle Atlantic United States, 235,000
acres in the Central United States and 115,000 acres in Brazil.
Minor sales and purchases are continuous to improve management and
transportation efficiency.

OTHER INFORMATION
Certain of the facilities at the Wickliffe mill, the Indianapolis
envelope plant and minor components of other plants, owned by
municipal or other public authorities pursuant to standard
industrial revenue bond financing arrangements, are accounted for
as property owned by Westvaco.  Westvaco holds options under which
it may purchase each of these facilities from such authorities by
paying a nominal purchase price and assuming the indebtedness
owing on the industrial revenue bonds at the time of the purchase.

The company owns in fee all of the mills, plants and timberlands
listed in Item 2, except leased facilities and those described
above.

Westvaco's mills and plants and related machinery and equipment
are considered by the company to be well maintained and in good
operating condition.
                                     
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The company is involved in contractual disputes, administrative
and legal proceedings and investigations of various types,
generally incidental to its business.  In addition, the company is
currently named as a potentially responsible party with respect to
the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA) and similar state laws.  While joint and several
liability is authorized under CERCLA, as a practical matter,
remediation costs will be allocated among the waste generators and
others involved.  The company has, as of October 31, 1995, accrued
approximately $5 million for estimated potential cleanup costs
based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past
experience with these matters.  The company periodically reviews
the status of the hazardous waste sites and adjusts its accrual as
appropriate.  While any litigation, proceeding or investigation
has an element of uncertainty, the company and its General Counsel
do not believe that the outcome of any proceeding, lawsuit or
claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders,
through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the
fourth quarter ended October 31, 1995.

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and
  results of operations

Liquidity and capital resources

At October 31, 1995, the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was 1.8 compared to 1.7 in both 1994 and 1993.  The
twelve-month average collection period for trade receivables was
32 days in 1995, the same as in 1994 and compared with 31 days in
1993.  Cash and marketable securities increased $77 million
reflecting strong operating cash flows partially offset by cash
used for investing and financing activities.  Cash flows from
operations were $523 million for 1995, compared to $326 million in
1994 and $240 million in 1993. Inventories increased from October
1994 levels but remained historically low relative to sales.
Receivables increased 15.5% reflecting the increased sales in
1995.
  New investment in plant and timberlands of $309 million for 1995
included $290 million in cash expenditures, compared to capital
expenditures of $207 million in 1994 and $442 million in 1993
which included cash expenditures of $215 million and $433 million,
respectively.  At October 31, 1995, the amounts committed to
complete all authorized capital projects were $730 million.
Capital expenditures for 1996 are expected to range from $500
million to $550 million.  The company may from time to time use
outside sources to supplement its internal cash flows in order to
support future levels of capital investments, as it has in the
past.
  Cash flows from financing activities for 1995 reflected the
issuance and repayment of commercial paper and the repayment of
$82.5 million of sinking fund debentures, including $64 million of
high interest rate debentures retired during the third quarter.
At October 31, 1995, the company had no outstanding commercial
paper but may continue to utilize commercial paper as it has in
the past.  The company maintains a $400 million revolving credit
agreement and has access to an additional $75 million of unsecured
bank credit lines.  There were no borrowings during the year under
any of these arrangements.  The ratio of debt to total capital
employed was 30% at October 31, 1995, compared to 34% in 1994 and
35% in 1993.
  On August 22, 1995, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-
two common stock split in the form of a 50% stock dividend payable
October 2, 1995, to shareholders of record on September 1, 1995.
The board also voted to increase the quarterly dividend by 20% to
$.22 per quarter after the split (see notes to the financial
statements).

Environmental matters: The company operates in an industry subject to
extensive environmental regulations.  Future capital expenditures for
pollution control facilities are expected to increase substantially as
a result of proposed EPA air and water quality regulations for the
United States paper industry.  In 1995, the company authorized the
final step in a long-term program initiated in 1989 which will result
in the removal of elemental chlorine from all of our pulp bleaching
processes.  To accomplish this, Westvaco authorized an expenditure of
$140 million in the spring of 1995, and we expect the program to be
complete in 1997.  This is an initial step in addressing the
anticipated regulations.  Total required expenditures related to EPA's
proposals could fall in the range of $175 to $400 million.  Additional
operating costs, including depreciation, for these new facilities
could fall in the range of $25 to $50 million pretax annually.
Currently, the company does not expect final rules until sometime in
1996 with implementation required over several years thereafter.  It
will be difficult to develop more precise estimates until the proposed
rules become final.
  The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party
with respect to the cleanup of a number of hazardous waste sites under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA) and similar state laws.  While joint and several
liability is authorized under CERCLA, as a practical matter,
remediation costs will be allocated among the waste generators and
others involved.  The company has accrued approximately $5 million for
estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of
ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters.

Analysis of operations

Record sales for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995 reflect
the very strong business conditions during most of the year.
However, in the near term we expect to experience a quieter
period of market demand as the rate of growth in the United
States economy slows and some of our customers reduce inventory
levels.  Sales of $3.3 billion for the fiscal year were up 25.5%
from 1994, primarily due to a 19.2% increase in price and product
mix and a 6.3% increase in the volume of shipments.  Export sales
increased 30% from 1994 and accounted for nearly 14% of the
company's 1995 consolidated sales.  Total sales outside of the
United States, including Rigesa, Ltda., our Brazilian subsidiary,
accounted

                             14
16
<PAGE>

for more than 21% of consolidated sales.  The growth in
exports and international sales reflects a strong demand for the
company's distinctive and differentiated products outside of the
United States.  The company is continuing to vigorously support
efforts to cultivate opportunities in international markets.
Gross profit margin for the year was 24%, compared with 18% in
1994.  Cost of products sold increased 18% in 1995, due to volume
increases and increases in the costs for direct materials.
Bleached segment: Bleached segment sales were up 24.6% from 1994,
reflecting a 15.6% increase in price and product mix and a 9%
increase in volume.  Bleached segment sales increases during 1995
reflect the improved pricing and demand in both domestic and
export markets.  Operating profit for the bleached segment
increased to $394.6 million from $242.1 million as a result of
the strong market conditions.  For the year, approximately 15% of
bleached segment sales were made to the domestic tobacco
industry, which consists of a limited number of major companies.
However, a significant portion of this paper and board is used
for products which are exported.  Excluding this portion,
approximately 8.5% of bleached segment sales were made to the
domestic tobacco industry for sale in the United States.  The
current legal and regulatory pressures on that industry could
have an adverse effect on future bleached segment sales and
profitability.  We would expect to offset any unit volume
declines in United States tobacco sales by continuing growth in
our sales to the liquid, dry and frozen food, personal care,
foreign tobacco and other consumer product markets of the world.
Unbleached segment: Sales for the unbleached segment increased
32.4% for the year as a result of a 31.5% increase in price and
product mix and a .9% increase in volume.  Operating profit for
the unbleached segment increased to $221.2 million from $51.8
million in 1994, as a result of improvements in all major
business units of the segment, including Rigesa.  Rigesa
accounted for approximately 27% and 40% of unbleached segment
sales and operating profit, respectively.  During the second half
of our 1994 fiscal year, the Brazilian government adopted a new
economic plan that has significantly reduced inflation.  The
impact on 1995 sales and earnings has been positive, but the
company cannot predict the continued success of the plan.  The
company has signed a contract to sell its domestic corrugated box
business.  The sale is expected to take place during the first
fiscal quarter of 1996 and not have a material impact on the
company's operating results.
Chemicals segment: Sales for the chemicals segment increased 15%
from 1994, reflecting a price and product mix improvement of
11.5% and a volume increase of 3.5%.  Operating profit decreased
to $43.9 million, compared to $48.4 million in 1994.  The 1995
operating results for the chemicals segment reflect the impact of
our active new product efforts which have temporarily affected
earnings.
  Other income (expense) increased $24.6 million in 1995 due
principally to foreign currency translation gains as compared to
losses in 1994 and higher interest income, partially offset by
the lower level of gains on property transactions in 1995.  The
16.6% increase in selling, research and administrative expenses
included increases in costs related to stock appreciation rights
and payroll and benefit costs.  Interest expense decreased 8.1%
for the year, reflecting the early extinguishment and scheduled
repayment of sinking fund debt and a decrease in the interest
paid on commercial paper.
  Record net income for the year of $280.8 million, or $2.78 per
share, surpassed last year's net income of $103.6 million, or
$1.03 per share, by a considerable margin.  Earnings for 1995
included an extraordinary charge of $2.6 million, or $.02 per
share, from the extinguishment of high interest rate debt.
Earnings for 1994 included a net gain of $.06 per share from the
sale of property and the sale of an operating lease.  The
effective tax rate  increased to 39.7% for the 1995 fiscal year
compared to 36% in 1994, due mainly to increased foreign source
income, taxed at higher rates.

Fiscal year 1994
Results for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1994 reflected the
accelerating demand for our products through the year.  Sales of
$2.6 billion for the fiscal year set a record and were up 11.2%
from 1993, primarily due to an 11.9% increase in the volume of
shipments.  Export sales increased almost 24% from 1993.  In
1994, exports accounted for nearly 14% of the company's
consolidated sales, up from 12% in 1993.  Gross profit margin for
1994 was 18%, compared with 19% in 1993.  Cost of products sold
increased 12.4% in 1994, due mainly to the increase in the volume
of shipments.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the
fiscal

                               15
17
<PAGE>

year increased 12.5%, following the commencement of
operations of the company's new bleached board machine in late
1993.
  Bleached segment sales were up 11.3% from 1993, reflecting a
13.7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2.4% decline due
to changes in price and product mix.  Bleached segment unit
volume increases during 1994 were primarily due to increases in
bleached board shipments following the completion of our bleached
board expansion project.  Operating profit for the bleached
segment increased to $242.1 million from $220.1 million, due
mainly to the inclusion of a portion of the special charge in
1993 (see notes to the financial statements).  During the 1994
fiscal year, approximately 24% of bleached segment sales were
made to the tobacco industry, which consisted of a limited number
of major companies.  However, a significant portion of this paper
and board was exported or used to produce products for export.
Excluding that portion, approximately 10% of bleached segment
sales were made to the domestic tobacco industry for sale in the
United States.
  Sales for the unbleached segment increased 11.3% in 1994 as a
result of a 10.3% increase in volume and a 1% increase in price
and product mix.  Shipments from our United States operations and
from Rigesa were strong during the year.  Operating profit for
the unbleached segment increased to $51.8 million from $1.6
million in 1993, due mainly to the increase in the volume of
unbleached paper shipments and Rigesa's results which showed
significant improvement.  The Brazilian government's economic
plan to control inflation had a positive impact on Rigesa's sales
and earnings in 1994.
  Sales for the chemicals segment increased 10.1% from 1993,
reflecting a price and product mix improvement of 6.3% and a
volume increase of 3.8%.  Operating margins for the segment
remained strong, with operating profit at $48.4 million, compared
to $42.6 million in 1993.
  Other income (expense) increased $20.5 million in 1994 due to
gains on property transactions and decreased foreign currency
translation losses related to Rigesa.  Interest expense increased
31.9% for the year, reflecting a decrease in interest capitalized
in connection with our bleached board expansion project, which
was completed in late 1993.
  Net income for fiscal 1994 of $103.6 million, or $1.03 per
share, decreased from 1993 net income of $104.3 million, or $1.04
per share.  Earnings for 1994 included a combined pretax gain of
$10.1 million, or $.06 per share, from property transactions
which was included in other income.  Earnings for 1993 were
favorably impacted by $55.2 million, or $.55 per share, for the
cumulative effect of the adoption of three new accounting
standards.  Earnings for 1993 were adversely impacted by $.46 per
share, due to a special pretax charge of $43.4 million, or $.26
per share, in connection with a restructuring program designed to
improve productivity and permanently reduce costs (see
notes to the financial statements); a provision of $12.9 million,
or $.13 per share, for the impact of an increase in the federal
income tax rate; and an extraordinary charge of $7.4 million, or
$.07 per share, from the extinguishment of debt.  Although the
savings from these initiatives reached planned levels during
1994, the effect on net income of the savings, primarily related
to the planned reduction in salaried employees, was more than
offset by the intensely competitive conditions existing during
the first three quarters of 1994 and by increased interest
expense and depreciation.  The effective tax rate decreased to
36% for the 1994 fiscal year from 39% in 1993, reflecting the
adjustment of the deferred tax reserves in 1993 primarily due to
the effect of the increase in the federal income tax rate.

Fiscal year 1993
Results for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1993 reflected the
slow growth in the United States economy and soft economies in
major foreign markets. Sales of $2.3 billion for the fiscal year
were up .4% from 1992, reflecting a 2.3% increase in the volume
of shipments offset by a 1.9% decrease in price and product mix.
Gross profit margin for the year was 19%, compared with 21% in
1992. Cost of products sold increased 2.4% in 1993, due mainly to
the increase in the volume of shipments. Sales for the bleached
segment were down .7% from 1992, reflecting a 2.3% decline in
price and product mix, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in
volume. Coated and uncoated paper shipments increased over 1992,
although prices remained under pressure due to industry capacity
additions. Bleached board export volume was up almost 18%; this
increase was more than offset by a decline in domestic volume.
Operating profit for the bleached segment decreased 18%, due to
the impact of the 1993 special charge and competitive conditions
in bleached board markets. Sales for the unbleached segment
increased 3.2% for the year as a result of increased volume at
Rigesa. Operating profit for the

<PAGE>

unbleached segment declined to
$1.6 million from $43.5 million in 1992, reflecting weak volume
in our domestic operations, higher materials costs and the impact
of the special charge. Operating results at Rigesa remained
subject to the uncertain economic and political conditions in
Brazil. Sales for the chemicals segment increased 1.2% from 1992,
reflecting a 7% improvement in the volume of shipments, offset by
declines in price and product mix for certain chemical products.
  Other income (expense) decreased $11.5 million in 1993 due to
higher currency translation losses in 1993 and the inclusion in
1992 of gains from two significant land sales. Depreciation and
amortization expense for the fiscal year increased 6.5% as
capital projects were completed. Selling, research and
administrative expenses increased 5.5% in 1993 in connection with
budgeted increases in worldwide marketing and distribution
capabilities and higher payroll costs at Rigesa. Interest expense
increased 4.7% in 1993, reflecting interest costs associated with
the issuance of $300 million of debentures in 1993.
  Net income for the year of $104.3 million, or $1.04 per share,
declined from last year's net income of $135.9 million, or $1.37
per share. Earnings for the year included a special pretax charge
of $43.4 million, or $.26 per share, in connection with the
restructuring plan announced in August 1993 (see notes to the
financial statements). Earnings for 1993 were also affected by a
provision of $12.9 million, or $.13 per share, for the impact of
an increase in the federal income tax rate and an extraordinary
charge of $7.4 million, or $.07 per share, from the
extinguishment of debt, both recorded in the fourth quarter (see
notes to the financial statements). Earnings for 1993 also
included $55.2 million, or $.55 per share, for the cumulative
effect of the adoption of three new accounting standards. The
effective tax rate was 39% for the 1993 fiscal year compared to
34% for 1992, due to the increase in the federal income tax rate,
partially offset by the favorable resolution of prior years' tax
issues and the favorable impact of Rigesa's lower effective tax
rate. Each of these items had greater impact in 1993 due to lower
consolidated pretax income.

Fourth quarter results
Sales were $871 million for the fourth quarter of 1995, compared to
sales of $762 million for the fourth quarter of 1994. In the fourth
quarter of 1995, the company recorded net income of $88.9 million, or
$.88 per share, compared to net income of $51.3 million, or $.51 per
share, for the prior year period.

Dividend reinvestment plan
At year end, 14,910 shareholders, including members of the company's
savings and investment plans for salaried and hourly employees,
representing 13,801,790 shares of Westvaco common stock, were
participants in the company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

Number of shareholders
At year end, the number of individuals and institutions owning
Westvaco common shares was about 20,490.  This number includes 11,890
members of the company's salaried and hourly savings and investment
plans. The plans, established in 1968 and 1995, respectively, hold
12,344,965 shares of Westvaco common stock for the accounts of
participants.  This represents 12% of the 101,551,211 shares of
common stock outstanding at year end.

Payroll and benefit costs
The total cost of payroll and benefits was $694 million, compared
with $632 million in 1994. This includes $47.7 million in Social
Security taxes in 1995 and $44 million in 1994. Payroll and benefit
costs were 21% of sales in 1995 and 24% of sales in 1994. Sales per
employee have increased 43% in the last five years.  In 1990, they
stood at $160,289, rising to $228,842 in 1995.

Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of all subsidiaries more than 50% owned.

Accounting changes:  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the
company adopted, retroactive to November 1, 1992, Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)  106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions; SFAS 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes; and SFAS 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits.  The 1993 first quarter was restated to include the
cumulative effect on prior years.

Translation of foreign currencies:  The functional currency for the
company's Brazilian operations is the U.S. dollar, due to the
hyperinflationary economy which has existed in that country.  Foreign
currency asset and liability accounts are remeasured into U.S.
dollars at fiscal year-end rates except for inventories, properties
and accumulated depreciation, which are translated at historical
rates; revenues and expenses (other than those relating to assets
translated at historical rates) are translated at average rates
prevailing during the year.  Translation gains and losses are
included in other income (expense).

Marketable securities:  For financial statement purposes, marketable
securities purchased three months or less from maturity are
considered to be cash equivalents.

Inventories:  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for raw
materials, finished goods and certain production materials, where
allowed for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Cost of all other
inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or
average cost method.

Plant and timberlands:  Owned assets are recorded at cost.  Also
included in the cost of these assets is interest on funds borrowed
during the construction period.  When assets are sold, retired or
disposed of, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in other income (expense).  Costs of renewals and
betterments of properties are capitalized; costs of maintenance and
repairs are charged to income.  Costs of reforestation of timberlands
are capitalized.

Depreciation and amortization:  The cost of plant and equipment is
depreciated over the estimated useful lives generally by the straight-
line method.  For certain major projects, the units-of-production
method is used until a commercial level of production is reasonably
sustained.  The cost of standing timber is amortized as timber is
cut, at rates determined annually based on the relationship of
unamortized timber costs to the estimated volume of recoverable
timber.

Revenue recognition:  The company recognizes revenues at the point of
passage of title, which is generally at the time of shipment.

Income taxes:  Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary
differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
basis of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflect the enacted tax rates in effect for the years the differences
are expected to reverse.

Preoperating costs:  Preoperating costs relating to major facilities
are deferred and all others are charged to income as incurred.
Deferred preoperating costs are amortized over a sixty-month period
following commencement of commercial operations of the facility.

Income per share:  Net income per common share is based on the
weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents
outstanding during the year.

Special charge:  During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company
established a special charge of $43,406,000, or $.26 per share, in
connection with a restructuring program designed to improve
productivity and permanently reduce costs.  Under the program, which
is now complete, the company eliminated over 450 salaried positions,
closed certain specialized facilities and consolidated certain product
lines.  At October 31, 1995, there wasno balance remaining in the
reserve.

Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act enacted in the company's
1993 fourth quarter, the federal income tax rate was increased to 35%
retroactive to January 1, 1993.  The provision for income taxes for
the 1993 fourth quarter included $11.7 million, or $.12 per share,
for the impact of the higher tax rate on the deferred tax liability
balance, and $1.2 million, or $.01 per share, for the impact on 1993
results.

The net deferred income tax liability at October 31, 1995 and 1994
includes the following components:

In fiscal year 1993, the company adopted SFAS 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes.  The cumulative effect of adoption as of November 1,
1992 was a reduction of $70.5 million in the deferred tax liability,
resulting in an increase in 1993 earnings per share of $.71.

The differences (expressed as a percentage of pretax income) between
the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income
tax rate as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of
income are:

                                        1995       1994       1993

At October 31, 1995, for tax purposes, the company had available
$141 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, which
do not expire under current laws.

Provision has not been made for income taxes which would become
payable upon remittance of $178 million of the October 31, 1995
undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries representing
that portion of such earnings which the company considers to have
been indefinitely reinvested in the subsidiaries, principally in
Brazil.  Computation of the potential deferred tax liability
associated with these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

D.  Current assets
Marketable securities of $90,080,000 (1994-$45,546,000) are valued at
cost, which approximates market value.  Receivables include
$9,055,000 from sources other than trade (1994-$4,522,000) and have
been reduced by allowances for discounts and doubtful accounts of
$15,550,000 (1994-$14,381,000).  Inventories at October 31 are
composed of:

If inventories had been valued at current cost, they would have been
$415,431,000 in 1995 (1994-$342,848,000).

E.  Accounts payable and accrued expenses
Accounts payable and accrued expenses at October 31 consist of:

F.  Interest capitalization

In 1995, $107,501,000 of interest cost was incurred (1994-
$114,947,000, 1993-$115,494,000) of which $7,296,000 was
capitalized (1994-$5,878,000, 1993-$32,798,000).

H.  Leasing activities and other commitments
The company leases a variety of assets for use in its operations.
Leases for administrative offices, converting plants and storage
facilities generally contain options which allow the company to
extend lease terms for periods up to 25 years, or to purchase the
properties.  Certain leases provide for escalation
of the lease payments as maintenance costs and taxes increase.

The company has no significant capital lease liabilities.  Minimum
rental payments under operating leases that have noncancellable lease
terms in excess of 12 months, are as follows:

Outstanding noncurrent obligations maturing in the four years after
1996 are (in millions):  1997-$29.4; 1998-$26.7; 1999-$14.6; 2000-$25.9.

Westvaco is a party to a revolving credit agreement for $400 million.
Borrowings under the agreement may be in unsecured domestic or
Eurodollar notes and may be at rates approximating prime or the
London Interbank Offered Rate, at the company's option.  There is a
nominal commitment fee on the unused funds.  The company also has
available $75 million of additional unsecured domestic lines of
credit at interest rates approximating the prime rate.  There were no
borrowings under any of these facilities during 1995 or 1994.

During the 1995 third quarter, the company retired, at a premium,
$63,750,000 of 12.3% debentures due in 2015. The transaction
resulted in an extraordinary charge of $2,590,000, net of an income
tax benefit of $1,690,000.  During the 1993 fourth quarter, the
company irrevocably set aside funds for the early payment of
principal, premium and interest of long-term debt which was
subsequently retired.  The transaction resulted in an extraordinary
charge to 1993 net income of $7,351,000, net of an income tax
benefit of $4,765,000.

At October 31, 1995, the book value of financial instruments
included in notes payable and long-term obligations was
$1,129,849,000 (1994-$1,220,384,000), and the fair value was
estimated to be $1,226,188,000 (1994-$1,221,227,000).  The company
has estimated the fair value of financial instruments based upon
quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
current interest rates available to the company for debt of similar
terms and maturities.

J.  Foreign subsidiaries
Income of foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated net income
amounted to
$58,282,000 in 1995 (1994-$22,001,000, 1993-$16,361,000).

Results of operations for Rigesa, Ltda., our Brazilian operating
subsidiary, were as follows:

Dividends received from foreign subsidiaries amounted to $25,349,000 in
1995 (1994-$8,275,000, 1993-$12,630,000).  Assets of these
subsidiaries, principally Rigesa, included in the consolidated balance
sheet are $290,230,000 (1994-$186,127,000).

K.  Shareholders' equity
On August 22, 1995, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two
split of the common stock in the form of a 50% stock dividend to
holders of record on September 1, 1995.  As a result, $170,481,000
($5 for each share issued pursuant to the stock split) has been
transferred from retained earnings to the common stock account.  All
per share data and number of shares for all periods included in the
financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the
split.

Treasury shares are sold at market prices to the company's savings
and investment and dividend reinvestment plans with the excess of
market value over cost credited to the common stock account.  There
were no purchases in 1993, 1994 or 1995 under the stock repurchase
program authorized in 1987 by the Board of Directors.

At October 31, 1995, there were 44,170 shares of nonvoting $100 par
value cumulative preferred stock authorized and 10 million shares of
preferred stock without par value authorized and available for issue.

Pursuant to its Shareholder Rights Plan, the company in 1987 declared
a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of
common stock.  The rights expire in December 1997.  Initially, the
rights will not be exercisable, certificates will not be sent to
shareholders, and will automatically trade with the common stock.

The plan provides that each right when exercisable entitles the
registered holder to purchase from the company a unit consisting of
one one-hundredth share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock at an exercise price of $150 per unit.  The rights will become
exercisable and separate certificates representing the rights will be
distributed 15 business days (or such later date as may be determined
by the company's Board of Directors) after a person or group either
acquires 20% or more of the company's outstanding common shares or
announces an offer the consummation of which would result in
ownership by a person or group of 30% or more of the company's
outstanding common shares.  In general, if a person or group exceeds
20% ownership other than pursuant to certain offers for all the
company's shares, if after someone acquires 20% or more of the
outstanding shares the company merges with any party and its shares
are exchanged, or 50% or more of the company's earning power or
assets are sold, then the holder of each right other than in certain
instances a holder of 20% or more of the outstanding common shares
may purchase common shares, or the equivalent, worth twice the
exercise price of $150.  In lieu of the right to purchase stock, the
Board of Directors in its sole discretion, following the acquisition
by a person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding shares and
before any person acquires 50% or more of the outstanding shares, may
cause each outstanding right, other than those held by the 20% or
more holder, to be exchanged automatically for one share of common
stock or a fraction of a share of preferred stock which is the
economic equivalent of one share of common stock.  The company
generally may redeem each right for $.05 until 15 days after someone
acquires 20% or more of the outstanding common shares.  The plan may
be amended by the Board of Directors in most respects prior to the
date the rights become exercisable.

L.  Stock option plans
The company has stock option plans that provide for the granting of
stock options and stock appreciation rights to key employees and
nonmanagement directors.  Stock options may be granted with or
without appreciation rights and are granted at market value.  They
are exercisable after a period of six months to one year and expire
not later than ten years from the date of grant.  The company also
may grant, to employees, options with limited stock appreciation
rights, which are exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events
related to changes in corporate control.

                                27

In February 1995, the shareholders approved a new Salaried Employee
Stock Incentive Plan which provides for the granting of stock options
and stock appreciation rights for an additional 4,837,500 shares of
common stock.  At the February 1995 meeting, the shareholders also
approved a new Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan for the
granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights up to 112,500
shares.  These 1995 plans are substantially the same as the existing
plans.

The following table summarizes activity in the plans for 1994 and
1995.  At October 31, 1995, 3,165,351 outstanding options have
related stock appreciation rights, including 2,870,167 with limited
stock appreciation rights.  At October 31, 1995, 3,675,245 options
were exercisable.  At October 31, 1994 and 1993, all outstanding
options were exercisable.

October 31, 1995 (1994-393,173, 1993-1,151,535).

M.  Employee retirement, postretirement and postemployment
    benefits

Pension and retirement plans
The company provides retirement benefits for substantially all
domestic employees under several noncontributory trusteed plans and
also provides benefits to employees whose retirement benefits exceed
maximum amounts permitted by current tax law under an unfunded
benefit plan.  Benefits are based on a final average pay formula for
the salaried plans and a unit benefit formula for the hourly-paid
plans.  Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the average remaining service period for active employees.
Contributions are made to the funded plans in accordance with ERISA
requirements.

The 1995 net pension credit relating to employee pension and
retirement benefits was $33,926,000 (1994-$42,089,000, 1993-
$40,984,000).  The net pension credits reflect cumulative favorable
investment returns on plan assets.  The 1995 credit also reflects
changes in certain economic assumptions.  The components of the net
pension credit for 1995, 1994 and 1993 are as follows:

   Net prepaid pension cost included in
     consolidated balance sheet                    $  280,357     $  245,710


The discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation levels
used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected
benefit obligation were
7.75% and 5.5% in 1995 (7.75% and 5.5% in 1994 and 7.5% and 5.5% in
1993).  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in
determining net pension cost was 9.75% for 1995, 10.5% for 1994,
11.5% for 1993 and will be 9.75% for 1996.  The net prepaid pension
cost, from the previous table, is included in other assets except for
an obligation of $15.5 million for an unfunded excess benefit plan
which is recorded as a long-term liability.


Postretirement benefits
The company provides life insurance for substantially all retirees and
medical benefits to certain retirees in the form of cost subsidies
until medicare eligibility is reached and to certain other retirees,
medical benefits up to a maximum lifetime amount.  None of these
benefits is funded.  Effective November 1, 1992, the company adopted
SFAS 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions.  This standard requires recognition of the cost of
postretirement benefits during the employee's period of service to the
company.

The adoption of this standard resulted in a charge of $14.1 million
(net of a tax benefit of $8.9 million), or $.14 per share, for the
cumulative effect on prior periods, which is reflected in restated 1993
first quarter earnings.  The increase in expense under this accounting
standard did not have a material effect on 1993 net income.

The components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost for the
fiscal years ended October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are as follows:

In thousands                                 1995     1994      1993

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of July 31, the
valuation date, was as follows:

In thousands                                      1995               1994

Retirees                                       $13,800            $20,400
Fully eligible active employees                  4,600              4,400
Other active participants                        5,000              5,400
                                                23,400             30,200
Unrecognized net gain                            5,900                800
Accrued postretirement benefits cost included
  in consolidated balance sheet                $29,300            $31,000

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit
obligation was 7.75% for 1995 and 1994.  The annual rate of increase in
health care costs was assumed at 12% for 1994, 11% for 1995 and
decreasing ratably to a 5.5% annual rate in 2001 and remaining at that
level thereafter.  The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed health
care cost trend rate would increase the July 31, 1995 accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $300,000 and the net
postretirement benefits cost for 1995 by $100,000.

Postemployment benefits
The company provides limited postemployment benefits to former or
inactive employees including short-term disability, workers'
compensation and severance.  Effective November 1, 1992, the company
adopted SFAS 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,
which requires the recognition of these costs on an accrual basis.  The
adoption of this standard resulted in an after-tax charge of $1.2
million, or $.01 per share, against first quarter 1993 income.

N.  Business segment information
The company's operations are classified in the following business
segments:

  Bleached paper, paperboard and packaging products:  The company
manufactures bleached products at four domestic mills and markets
those products as pulp, printing grade papers and board, envelopes,
food containers, folding cartons and cartons for liquid products.
Company woodlands provide significant volumes of wood fiber to these
mills.  Sales of printing grade papers and board accounted for
41% of consolidated sales for 1995 (1994 and 1993-40%).  Sales of
envelopes accounted for 10% of consolidated sales in 1995 (1994 and
1993-11%).

  Unbleached paper, paperboard and packaging products:  The company
manufactures unbleached products at four mills, including two in
Brazil, and markets those products as kraft paper and board and
corrugated shipping containers.  Company woodlands provide
significant volumes of wood fiber to these mills.  Sales of
corrugated shipping containers accounted for 16% of consolidated
sales for 1995 (1994 and 1993-14%).  Sales of kraft paper and board
accounted for 10% of consolidated sales for 1995 (1994-10%, 1993-9%).

  Chemicals:  The company manufactures specialty chemical products at
four domestic locations.  Major product groups are:  activated carbon
products and services; printing ink resins and lignin-based
surfactants; tall oil fatty acid, rosin and derivative products.

   The company's land development activities have been included in
corporate items.

  Segment sales include intersegment sales valued at market prices.

  Segment operating profit is revenue less allocable operating
expenses.  General net corporate expense includes nonoperating
overhead, research and development expenditures, interest expense and
interest and other income (expense).

  Segment identifiable assets are those which are directly used in
segment operations.  Corporate assets are principally marketable
securities, certain nontrade receivables, prepaid items and other
assets.

  Export sales from the United States amounted to $448,361,000 in
1995 (1994-$344,394,000, 1993-$280,082,000).  Total export sales,
including exports from our Brazilian subsidiary, were $454,237,000 in
1995 (1994-$353,974,000, 1993-$286,567,000).

Responsibility for financial statements

Management is responsible for the information and representations in the
consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear on pages 18
through 31 as well as all other financial information contained in this
report.  These financial statements were prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and by necessity include some
amounts determined using informed estimates and judgments.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of
internal control.  The company's accounting systems include internal
controls which management believes provide reasonable assurance of the
reliability of its financial records and the proper safeguarding and use of
its assets.  In establishing the basis for reasonable assurance, management
balances the cost of the internal controls with the benefits they provide.
Additionally, it has long been the policy of the company to work to conduct
its business affairs in accordance with high ethical standards, as set forth
in the Westvaco Memorandum on Business Conduct.

The company's independent accountants, Price Waterhouse LLP, were engaged to
audit the consolidated financial statements and were responsible for
conducting their audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  The appointment of Price Waterhouse LLP as the company's
independent accountants by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of
the Audit Committee, has been ratified each year by the shareholders.  Their
report immediately follows this statement.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of
nonmanagement directors, meets several times each year.  The committee meets
with the company's management, the internal audit manager and the
independent accountants, to discuss accounting and financial reporting
matters and the nature, scope and results of audits.  The Audit Committee
meets with the independent accountants both with and without the presence of
management.  The committee also meets with the company's general counsel to
review litigation issues.  The independent accountants and the internal
audit manager have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

Report of independent accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Westvaco Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements appearing on
pages 18 through 31 of this report present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Westvaco Corporation and its
subsidiaries at October 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended October 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.
