subsidiaries (Subsidiaries), Monongahela Power Company
(Monongahela), The Potomac Edison Company (Potomac Edison),
West Penn Power Company (West Penn), and Allegheny
Generating Company (AGC).  The properties of the
Subsidiaries are located in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and West Virginia, are interconnected, and are
operated as a single integrated electric utility system
(System), which is interconnected with all neighboring

northern West Virginia and an adjacent portion of Ohio.  It
also owns generating capacity in Pennsylvania.  Monongahela
serves about 340,700 customers in a service area of about
11,900 square miles with a population of about 710,000.  The
seven largest communities served have populations ranging
from 10,900 to 33,900.  On December 31, 1993, Monongahela

waterways and substantial deposits of bituminous coal, glass
sand, natural gas, rock salt, and other natural resources. 
Its service area's principal industries produce coal,
chemicals, iron and steel, fabricated products, wood
products, and glass.  There are two municipal electric
distribution systems and two rural electric cooperative
associations in its service area.  Except for one of the
cooperatives, they purchase all of their power from
Monongahela.

          Potomac Edison, incorporated in Maryland in 1923 and
in Virginia in 1974, operates in portions of Maryland,
Virginia, and West Virginia.  It also owns generating
capacity in Pennsylvania.  Potomac Edison serves about
354,300 customers in a service area of about 7,300 square
miles with a population of about 782,000.  The six largest
communities served have populations ranging from 11,900 to
40,100.  On December 31, 1993, Potomac Edison had 1,152
employees.  Its service area is generally rural.  Its
service area's principal industries produce aluminum,
cement, fabricated products, rubber products, sand, stone,
and gravel.  There are four municipal electric distribution
systems in its service area, all of which purchase power
from Potomac Edison, and six rural electric cooperatives,
one of which purchases power from Potomac Edison.  There are
also several large federal government installations served
by Potomac Edison.

          West Penn, incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1916,
operates in southwestern and north and south central
Pennsylvania.  It also owns generating capacity in West
Virginia.  West Penn serves about 646,700 customers in a
service area of about 9,900 square miles with a population
of about 1,399,000.  The 10 largest communities served have
populations ranging from 11,200 to 38,900.  On December 31,
1993, West Penn had 2,043 employees.  Its service area has
navigable waterways and substantial deposits of bituminous
coal, limestone, and other natural resources.  Its service
area's principal industries produce steel, coal, fabricated
products, and glass.  There are two municipal electric
distribution systems in its service area, which purchase
their power requirements from West Penn, and five rural
electric cooperative associations, located partly within the
area, which purchase virtually all of their power through a
pool supplied by West Penn and other nonaffiliated
utilities.

          AGC, organized in 1981 under the laws of Virginia, is
jointly owned by the Operating Subsidiaries as follows:
Monongahela, 27%; Potomac Edison, 28%; and West Penn, 45%. 
AGC has no employees, and its only operating assets are a
40% undivided interest in the Bath County (Virginia) pumped-
storage hydroelectric station, which was placed in
commercial operation in December 1985, and its connecting
transmission facilities.  AGC's 840-megawatt (MW) share of
capacity of the station is sold to its three parents.  The
remaining 60% interest in the Bath County Station is owned
by Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power).

          APS has no employees.  Its officers are employed by
Allegheny Power Service Corporation (APSC), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of APS.  On December 31, 1993, the Subsidiaries
and APSC had 6,025 employees.

          The Subsidiaries in the past have experienced and in
the future may experience some of the more significant
problems common to electric utilities in general.  These
include increases in operating and other expenses,
difficulties in obtaining adequate and timely rate relief,
restrictions on construction and operation of facilities due
to regulatory requirements and environmental and health
considerations, including the requirements of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), which among other things,
require a substantial annual reduction in utility emissions
of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides.

          Additional concerns include proposals to restructure
and, to some extent, deregulate portions of the industry and
increase competition, particularly as a result of the
National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT).  EPACT may
increase competition by allowing the formation of Exempt
Wholesale Generators (EWGs), with the approval of the FERC,
and providing mandatory access to the interconnected
electric grid for wholesale transactions.  It further
provides for expansion of the grid where constraints are
determined to exist - at the expense of the requestor of
such transmission service and provided necessary authority
to construct such facilities can be obtained.  EPACT permits
utility generation facilities to qualify as EWGs and allows
sales to nonaffiliated and to affiliated utilities provided
state commissions approve such transactions. (See ITEM 1.
SALES, ELECTRIC FACILITIES and REGULATION for a further
discussion of the impact of EPACT.)  
<PAGE>
                             - 3 -

          In an effort to meet the challenges of the new
competitive environment in the industry, APS is considering
forming a new nonutility subsidiary, subject to regulatory
approval, to pursue new business opportunities which have a
meaningful relationship to the core utility business.  APS
would also consider establishing or acquiring its own EWGs,
if that is feasible, particularly in view of the possible
constraints imposed by regulations under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) on nonexempt public
utility holding companies such as APS and its Subsidiaries.

          Further concerns of the industry include possible
restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions, uncertainties in
demand due to economic conditions, energy conservation,
market competition, weather, and interruptions in fuel
supply because of weather and strikes.  (See ITEM 1.
CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING, RATE MATTERS, and ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS for information concerning the effect on the
Subsidiaries of the CAAA.)

                                                 SALES


          In 1993, consolidated kilowatthour (kWh) sales to the
Operating Subsidiaries' retail customers increased  3.3%
from those of 1992, as a result of increases of 6.5%, 5.2%
and 0.3% in residential, commercial and industrial sales,
respectively.  The increased Kwh sales in 1993 reflect both
growth in number of customers and higher use.  Consolidated
revenues from residential, commercial, and industrial sales
increased 11.4%, 9.8%, and 5.6%, respectively, primarily
because of several rate increases effective in 1993 as
described in ITEM 1. RATE MATTERS, increases in fuel and
energy cost adjustment clause revenues, and increased kWh
sales.  Consolidated kWh sales to and revenues from
nonaffiliated utilities decreased 30.2% and 25.5%,
respectively, due to increased native load, decreased
demand, and price competition.

          The System's all-time peak load of 7,153 MW occurred
on January 18, 1994.  The peak loads in 1993 and 1992 were
6,678 MW and 6,530 MW, respectively.  The increased 1994
peak was due in part to record cold temperatures throughout
the Operating Subsidiaries' service areas and would have
been higher except for voluntary curtailments.  The average
System load (Yearly Net Power Supply divided by number of
hours in the year) was 4,674 megawatthours (MWh) and 4,526
MWh in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  More information
concerning sales may be found in the statistical sections
and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

          Consolidated electric operating revenues for 1993 were
derived as follows: Pennsylvania, 44.8%; West Virginia,
28.4%; Maryland, 20.2%; Virginia, 5.0%; Ohio, 1.6%
(residential, 35.1%; commercial, 18.4%; industrial, 28.9%;
nonaffiliated utilities,  14.9%; and other, 2.7%).  The
following percentages of such revenues were derived from
these industries: iron and steel, 6.0%; chemicals, 3.3%;
fabricated products, 3.3%; aluminum and other nonferrous
metals, 3.2%; coal mines, 3.1%; cement, 1.8%; and all other
industries, 8.2%.  The coal mine percentage decreased in
1993 principally due to the coal strike.  More information
concerning the coal strike may be found in ITEM 1. FUEL
SUPPLY.  Revenues from each of 16 industrial customers
exceeded $5 million, including one coal customer of both
Monongahela and West Penn with total revenues exceeding $15
million, three steel customers with revenues exceeding $26
million each, and one aluminum customer with revenues
exceeding $63 million.                             
<PAGE>

                             - 4 - 

          During 1993, Monongahela's kWh sales to retail
customers increased 0.3% as a result of increases of 6.4%
and 4.7% in residential and commercial sales, respectively,
and a decrease of 4.4% in industrial sales, primarily due to
the coal strike and lower sales to one iron and steel
customer because of increased use of its own generation. 
Revenues from such customers increased 9.2%, 7.8% and 0.7%,
respectively, and revenues from kWh sales to affiliated and
nonaffiliated utilities decreased 7.8%.  Monongahela's all-
time peak load of 1,667 MW occurred on December 21, 1989. 
(For a discussion of the coal strike, See ITEM 1. FUEL
SUPPLY.)

          Monongahela's electric operating revenues were derived
as follows: West Virginia, 94.0% and Ohio, 6.0%
(residential, 28.8%; commercial, 17.3%; industrial, 29.2%;
nonaffiliated utilities,  13.4 %; and other, 11.3%). 
Revenues from each of five industrial customers exceeded $8
million, including one coal customer with revenues exceeding
$13 million and one steel customer with revenues exceeding
$26 million.  The decreases in the revenues of these
customers from 1992 levels were primarily due to the coal
strike.

          During 1993, Potomac Edison's kWh sales to retail
customers increased 6.3% as a result of increases of 8.4%,
7.1%, and 4.3% in residential, commercial, and industrial
sales, respectively. Revenues from such customers increased
12.7%, 11.8%, and 11.8%, respectively, and revenues from kWh
sales to affiliated and nonaffiliated utilities decreased
23.1%.  Potomac Edison's all-time peak load of 2,595 MW
occurred on January 19, 1994.                

          Potomac Edison's electric operating revenues were
derived as follows: Maryland, 66.6%; West Virginia, 16.8%;
and Virginia 16.6% (residential, 38.5%; commercial, 17.5%;
industrial, 24.7%; nonaffiliated utilities, 15.2%; and
other, 4.1%).  Revenues from one industrial customer, the
Eastalco aluminum reduction plant near Frederick, Maryland,
amounted to $63.4 million (8.9% of total electric operating
revenues).  Minimum annual charges to Eastalco under an
electric service agreement which continues through March 31,
2000, with automatic extensions thereafter unless terminated
on notice by either party, were $19.3 million in 1993.  Said
agreement may be canceled before the year 2000 upon 90 days
notice of a governmental decision resulting in a material
modification of the agreement.

          During 1993, West Penn's kWh sales to retail customers
increased 3.1% as a result of increases of 5.2%, 4.4% and
0.8% in residential, commercial, and industrial sales,
respectively.  Revenues from residential, commercial, and
industrial customers increased 11.5%, 9.6%, and 5.4%,
respectively, and revenues from kWh sales to affiliated and
nonaffiliated utilities decreased 24.3%.  West Penn's all-
time peak load of 3,068 MW occurred on January 18, 1994.
<PAGE>

                             - 5 -

          West Penn's electric operating revenues were derived
as follows: Pennsylvania, 100% (residential, 33.1%;
commercial, 18.0%; industrial, 28.5%; nonaffiliated
utilities, 14.1%; and other, 6.3%).  Revenues from each of
three steel customers exceeded $10 million, including two
with revenues exceeding $31 million each.

          On average, the Operating Subsidiaries are the lowest
or among the lowest cost producers of electricity in their
regions and therefore the Operating Subsidiaries' delivered
power prices should compete favorably with those of
potential alternate suppliers who use cost-based pricing. 
However, the Operating Subsidiaries are experiencing cost
increases due to compliance with the CAAA and purchases from
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA)
projects.  (See page 7 for a discussion of PURPA projects,
and ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS for a description of
litigation and regulatory proceedings concerning PURPA
capacity.) 

          In 1993, the Operating Subsidiaries provided
approximately 13.3 billion kWh of energy to nonaffiliated
utility companies, of which 1.5 billion kWh were generated
by the Subsidiaries and the rest were transmitted from
electric systems located primarily to the west.  These sales
included a long-term transaction under which the Operating
Subsidiaries purchased 450 MW of firm capacity and its
associated energy from Ohio Edison Company for resale to
Potomac Electric Power Company, both nonaffiliated
utilities.  The transaction began in mid-1987 and will
continue through 2005, unless terminated earlier.

          Sales to nonaffiliated utility companies vary with the
needs of those companies for imported power; the
availability of System generating facilities, fuel, and
regional transmission facilities; and the availability and
price of competitive sources of power.  System sales
decreased in 1993 relative to 1992 primarily because of
continued decreased demand, increased Operating
Subsidiaries' native load, coal conservation because of the
coal strike, and increased willingness of other suppliers to
make sales at lower prices.  Further decreases in kWh sales
to nonaffiliated utilities are expected in 1994 and beyond. 
Substantially all of the revenues from kWh sales to
nonaffiliated utilities are passed on to retail customers
and as a result have little effect on net income.

          The Operating Subsidiaries reactivated a peak
diversity exchange arrangement with Virginia Power effective
June 1993 which continues indefinitely.  The Operating
Subsidiaries will annually supply Virginia Power with 200 MW
during each June, July, and August, in return for which
Virginia Power will supply the Operating Subsidiaries with
200 MW during each December, January, and February, at least
through February 1997.  Thereafter, specific amounts of
annual diversity exchanges beyond those currently
established are to be mutually determined no less than 34
months prior to each year for which an exchange is to take
place.  The total number of MWh to be delivered by each to
the other over the term of the arrangement is expected to be
equal.         
<PAGE>

                            - 6 -

          The Operating Subsidiaries and Duquesne Light Company
(Duquesne Light) in 1991 entered into an exchange
arrangement under which the Operating Subsidiaries will
supply Duquesne Light with up to 200 MW for a specified
number of weeks, generally during each March, April, May,
September, October, and November.  In return, Duquesne Light
will supply the Operating Subsidiaries with up to 100 MW,
generally during each December, January, and February.  The
total number of MWh delivered by each utility to the other
over the term of the arrangement is expected to be the same.

          West Penn supplies power to the Borough of Tarentum
(Tarentum) using in part leased distribution facilities from
Tarentum under a 30 year lease agreement terminating in
1996.  In June 1993, Tarentum, which in that year had a load
of 6.5 MW and revenues of $1.8 million, notified West Penn
of its intention to exercise its option to end the lease
agreement.  The termination of the lease agreement and
resulting transfer and sale of electric facilities will
result in Tarentum becoming a municipal customer which will
purchase electricity on a wholesale basis from West Penn or
another supplier.  The sale of electric facilities will
require Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval.

          The System provides wholesale transmission services to
applicants under its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) approved Standard Transmission Service tariff.  The
tariff provides that such service is subordinate in priority
to native load and reliability requirements of
interconnected systems to avoid adverse effects on regional
reliability in general and on the reliability of the
Operating Subsidiaries' service to their retail and full-
requirements wholesale customers in particular.  (See ITEM
1. ELECTRIC FACILITIES for a discussion of stress on the
System's transmission system.)  Transmission services
requiring special arrangements or long-term commitments have
been and continue to be negotiated through mutually
acceptable bilateral agreements.  Substantially all of the
revenues from transmission service sales are passed on to
retail customers and as a result have little effect on net
income.

          EPACT permits wholesale generators, utility-owned and
otherwise, and wholesale consumers to request from System
and other owners of bulk power transmission facilities a
commitment to supply transmission services.  Generators
include nonaffiliated utilities and nonutility generators
(NUG) of electricity (including classifications of
generators known as Independent Power Producers (IPP) and
EWGs).  Consumers of wholesale power include qualifying
nonaffiliated utilities or groups of utilities including the
many small electric systems owned by municipalities and
rural electric cooperative associations in the service areas
of the Operating Subsidiaries.  Many of these small systems
currently purchase substantially all of their power from the
Operating Subsidiaries.  Under EPACT, these small systems
may now seek an order from the FERC to force the Operating
Subsidiaries to wheel power over the System to them from
sources outside the System service area.  All of the small
electric wholesale customers in the Operating Subsidiaries'
service areas which might avail themselves of this
opportunity produced $42 million of total revenues in 1993.
<PAGE>

                            - 7 -

          Under PURPA, certain municipalities and private
developers have installed, are installing or are proposing
to install hydroelectric and other generating facilities at
various locations in or near the Operating Subsidiaries'
service areas with the intent of selling some or all of the
electric capacity and energy to the Operating Subsidiaries
at rates provided under PURPA and approved by appropriate
state commissions.  The System's total generation capacity
includes 292 MW of on-line PURPA capacity.  Payments for
PURPA capacity and energy in 1993 totaled approximately $105
million at an average cost to the System of 5.04 cents per
kWh.  The System projects an additional 180 MW of PURPA
capacity to come on-line in future years.  In addition,
lapsed purchase agreements totaling 203 MW and other PURPA
complaints totaling 520 MW (none of which are included in
the System's integrated resource plan as of August 20,
1993), are the subject of pending litigation.  (See ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS for a description of litigation and
regulatory proceedings in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West
Virginia affecting PURPA capacity.)  In the future, ratings
of the Operating Subsidiaries' first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock may be affected by increased concern of
rating agencies that purchased power contracts are a risk
factor deserving consideration in assessing the credit-
worthiness of electric utilities. 

                                                ELECTRIC FACILITIES


          The following table shows the System's December 31, 1993,
generating capacity, based on the maximum monthly normal seasonal
operating capacity of each unit.  The System-owned capacity totaled
7,991 MW, of which 7,089 MW (88.7%) are coal-fired, 840 MW (10.5%)
are pumped-storage, and 62 MW (0.8%) are hydroelectric.  The term
"pumped-storage" refers to the Bath County station which stores
energy for use principally during peak load hours by pumping water
from a lower to an upper reservoir, using the most economic
available electricity, generally during off-peak hours.  During the
generating cycle, power is produced by water falling from the upper
to the lower reservoir through turbine generators.

          The average age of the System-owned coal-fired stations shown
below, based on generating capacity at December 31, 1993, was about
23.6 years.  In 1993, their average heat rate was 10,020 Btu's/kWh,
and their availability factor was 87.0%.

                                               SYSTEM MAP


     The Allegheny Power System Map (System Map), which has been
omitted, provides a broad illustration of the names and
approximate locations of the System's major generation and
transmission facilities, both existing and under construction,
in a five state region which includes portions of
Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia. 
Additionally, Extra High Voltage substations are displayed. 
By use of shading, the System Map also provides a general
representation of the service areas of Monongahela (portions
of West Virginia and Ohio), Potomac Edison (portions of
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia), and West Penn (portions
of Pennsylvania).

     Power Stations shown on the System Map which appear within
the Monongahela service area are Willow Island, Pleasants,
Harrison, Rivesville, Albright, and Fort Martin.  The single
Power Station appearing within the Potomac Edison service area
is R. Paul Smith.  The Bath County Power Station appears on
the map just south of the westernmost portion of Potomac
Edison's service area formed by the borders of Virginia and
West Virginia.  Power Stations appearing within the West Penn
service area are Armstrong, Mitchell, Hatfield's Ferry,
Springdale and Lake Lynn.    

     The System Map also depicts transmission facilities which
are (i) owned solely by the Operating Subsidiaries; (ii) owned
by the Operating Subsidiaries in conjunction with other
utilities; or (iii) owned solely by other utilities.  The
transmission facilities portrayed range in capacity from 138kV
to 765kV.  Additionally, interconnections with other utilities
are displayed.

(a)  The System has a total of 5,203 miles of underground distribution lines.

(b)  The substations have an aggregate transformer capacity of 37,512,771
     kilovoltamperes.

(c)  Total Bath County transmission lines, of which AGC owns an undivided 40% 
     interest and Virginia Power owns the remainder.


                The System has 11 extra-high-voltage (345 kV and
above) (EHV) and 29 lower-voltage interconnections with
neighboring utility systems.  The interregional EHV
transmission system, including System facilities, continues to
experience periods of heavy loading in a west-to-east
direction.  Increases in customer load, power transfers by the
Subsidiaries and by nonaffiliated entities, and parallel flows
caused by transactions to which the Operating Subsidiaries are
not a party, all contribute to the heavy west-to-east power
flows.  In late 1992 and early 1993, a substantial amount of
reactive power sources (shunt capacitors) were added to
neighboring eastern utilities' EHV systems.  These capacitors
complement the capacitors added in 1991 and 1992 on the System
and together they serve to increase transfer capability by
improving voltage on the transmission system during heavy
loading periods.

                While the additional capacitors installed by the
Subsidiaries' eastern neighbors have enhanced transfer
capability, the interregional transmission facilities are
still expected periodically to operate up to their reliability
limits; therefore, restrictions on transfers may still be
necessary at times as was the case in recent years.

                Under certain provisions of EPACT, wholesale
generators, utility-owned or otherwise, may seek from System
and other owners of bulk power transmission facilities a
commitment to supply power transmission services, so long as
the FERC finds reliability and native load and existing
contractual customers are not adversely affected (See
discussion under ITEM 1. SALES and REGULATION).  Such demand
on the System for transmission service may add periodically to
heavy power flows on the System's facilities.
<PAGE>

                            - 12 -

                The Operating Subsidiaries have, to date, provided
managed contractual access to the System's transmission
facilities via the provisions of their Standard Transmission
Service tariff, or the terms and conditions of bilateral
contracts with purchasers of transmission service.

                As a result of EPACT, the FERC is investigating the
continued desirability of traditional methods of pricing and
providing transmission service.  The FERC may choose to
maintain existing methods, implement new methodologies which
the Operating Subsidiaries and their ratepayers may or may not
find to be beneficial, or a combination thereof.  The
Operating Subsidiaries are participating fully in the FERC
proceedings with the principal intent of safeguarding the
reliability of the System's transmission facilities, and the
rights and interests of its native load customers.  The
outcome of those deliberations cannot be predicted.

                                         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

                
                The Operating Subsidiaries spent $4.6 million, $2.7
million, and $2.8 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively, for research programs.  Of these amounts, $3.2
million and $0.6 million were for Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) dues in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The
Operating Subsidiaries plan to spend approximately $7.5
million for research in 1994, with EPRI dues representing $5.9
million of that total.

                The Operating Subsidiaries joined EPRI, an industry-
sponsored research and development institution, effective
October 1, 1992, contingent upon the approval by state
commissions of recovery of the dues in rates, which approval
was subsequently received in all jurisdictions except Ohio and
West Virginia, where the matter is pending.  Ongoing
participation in EPRI depends upon continued approval by state
commissions of recovery of dues in rates.  Dues are based on a
three-year, new-member ramping formula.

                Independent research conducted by the Operating
Subsidiaries in 1993, which will be completed or continued in
1994, concentrated on environmental protection, generating
unit performance, future generating technologies, delivery
systems, and customer-related research.  

                Two U.S. Department of Energy Clean Coal Technology
nitrogen oxide control projects, which the Operating
Subsidiaries cofounded, have recently been completed.  Based
upon the results of one of the projects, retrofitting of low
nitrogen oxide cell burners at the Hatfield's Ferry Power
Station units has been undertaken at much lower costs than
would otherwise have been required.
<PAGE>

                            - 13 -

                Research is also being directed to help address major
issues facing the Operating Subsidiaries including electric
and magnetic field (EMF) risk, waste disposal, greenhouse gas,
client-server information system prospects, renewable
resources, fuel cells, new combustion turbines and other
cogeneration technologies.  In addition, evaluation of
technical proposals for business opportunities is also
ongoing.

                EMF research includes monitoring work done by EPRI,
Department of Energy (DOE), the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and other government researchers.  It also
includes monitoring literature, law and litigation, and
standards as developed.  This research enables the Operating
Subsidiaries to evaluate any potential health risks to
employees and customers which may exist.

                Research activities related to alleged global climate
change include monitoring government activity, studying
possible joint implementation activities in connection with
the Clinton Climate Change Action Plan, and studying demand-
side management, electro- technologies and possible joint
implementation plans.

                The Operating Subsidiaries also made research grants
to regional colleges and universities to encourage the
development of technical resources related to current and
future utility problems.

                                        CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING


               Construction expenditures by the Subsidiaries in 1993
amounted to $574 million and for 1994 and 1995 are expected to
aggregate $500 million and $400 million, respectively.  In
1993, these expenditures included $240 million for compliance
with the CAAA.  The 1994 and 1995 estimated expenditures
include $161    million and $53 million, respectively, to
cover the costs of compliance with the CAAA. (See ITEM 1.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.) Allowance for funds used during
construction (AFUDC) (shown below) has been reduced for
carrying charges on CAAA expenditures that are being collected
through currently approved surcharges or in base rates.

* Includes allowance for funds used during construction for 1993, 1994 and 1995
  of: Monongahela $5.8, $4.1 and $1.9; Potomac Edison $7.1, $5.7 and
  $2.7; and West Penn $8.6, $12.7 and $6.2.


           These construction expenditures include major
capital projects at existing generating stations,
including the construction of flue-gas desulfurization
equipment (scrubbers) at the Harrison Power Station,
upgrading distribution lines and substations, and the
strengthening of the transmission and subtransmission
systems.  It is anticipated that the Harrison scrubber
project will be completed on schedule and that the
final costs will be approximately 24% below the
original budget.  Primary factors contributing to the
reduced cost are: a) the absence of any major
construction problems to date; b) financing and
material and equipment costs lower than expected; and
c) favorable rulings of state commissions allowing the
inclusion of carrying costs of construction in rates in
lieu of AFUDC.  In order to avoid unnecessary and
uneconomic additional outages, power station
construction and long-range maintenance schedules and
the expenditures associated therewith will have to be
coordinated over the next several years with outages to
meet the in-service dates of the new emission control
facilities.
<PAGE>

                             - 15 -

           On a System basis, total expenditures for 1993,
1994, and 1995 include $270 million, $191 million, and
$93 million, respectively, for construction of
environmental control technology.

           The Operating Subsidiaries continue to study ways
to reduce or meet future increases in customer demand,
including aggressive demand- side management programs,
new and efficient electric technologies, construction
of various types and sizes of generating units and
increasing the efficiency and availability of System
generating facilities, reducing company electrical use
and transmission and distribution losses, and where
feasible and economical, acquisition of reliable long-
term capacity from other electric systems and from
nonutility developers.

           The Operating Subsidiaries are implementing
demand-side management activities.  Potomac Edison and
West Penn are engaged in state commission supported or
ordered evaluations of demand-side management programs
(See ITEM 1. REGULATION for a further discussion of
these programs).  Several jurisdictions have adopted
mechanisms which provide for recovery of the costs of
such activities, some return on the related investment,
the associated revenue reductions and a performance
incentive, either on a current basis or through
deferral to a base rate case.

           Current forecasts, which reflect demand-side
management efforts and other considerations and assume
normal weather conditions, project average annual
winter and summer peak load growth rates of 1.47% and
1.28%, respectively, in the period 1994-2004.  After
giving effect to the reactivation of West Penn capacity
in cold reserve (see page 9), peak diversity exchange
arrangements described in ITEM 1. SALES above, demand-
side management and conservation programs, and the
capacity of an anticipated new PURPA plant, the
System's integrated resource plan indicates that new
System-owned generating capacity will not be required
until the year 2000 or beyond.  If future customer
demand materially exceeds that forecast or anticipated
supply-side resources do not become available or
demand-side management efforts do not succeed, or under
extremely adverse weather conditions, the Operating
Subsidiaries may be unable at times to meet all of
their customers' requirements for electric service.

           In connection with their construction and demand-
side management programs, the Operating Subsidiaries
must make estimates of the availability and cost of
capital as well as the future demands of their
customers that are necessarily subject to regional,
national, and international developments, changing
business conditions, and other factors.  The
construction of facilities and their cost are affected
by laws and regulations, lead times in manufacturing,
availability of labor, materials and supplies,
inflation, interest rates, and licensing, rate,
environmental, and other proceedings before regulatory
authorities.  As a result, future plans of the
Operating Subsidiaries, as well as their projected
ownership of future generating stations, are subject to
continuing review and substantial change.
<PAGE>

                             - 16 -

           The Subsidiaries have financed their construction
programs through internally generated funds, first
mortgage bond, debenture, medium-term note and
preferred stock issues, pollution control and solid
waste disposal notes, instalment loans, long-term lease
arrangements, equity investments by APS (or, in the
case of AGC, by the Operating Subsidiaries), and, where
necessary, interim short-term debt.  Effective January
1994, the Operating Subsidiaries also have available a
$300 million multi-year credit facility.  The future
ability of the Subsidiaries to finance their
construction programs by these means depends on many
factors, including rate levels sufficient to provide
internally generated funds and adequate revenues to
produce a satisfactory return on the common equity
portion of the Subsidiaries' capital structures and to
support their issuance of senior and other securities. 
APS obtains most of the funds for equity investments in
the Operating Subsidiaries through the issuance and
sale of its common stock publicly and through its
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and its
Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan.  

           In May 1993, Monongahela, Potomac Edison, and
West Penn issued $10.68 million, $13.99 million, and
$18.04 million, respectively, in solid waste disposal
notes to Harrison County, West Virginia.  Harrison
County in turn issued $24.67 million of 6-1/4% and
$18.04 million of 6.3% tax-exempt 30-year solid waste
disposal revenue bonds.  The Operating Subsidiaries are
using the proceeds from the issuance to finance certain
solid waste disposal facilities which comprise a
portion of the scrubbers located at the Harrison Power
Station.

           On November 3, 1993, the holders of more than
two-thirds of the shares of APS common stock voted to
split the common stock by amending the charter to
reclassify each share of common stock, par value $2.50,
issued or unissued, into two shares of common stock,
par value $1.25 each.  The stock split became effective
on November 4, 1993.  All references to APS common
stock herein reflect the two-for-one stock split.

           On October 14, 1993, APS issued and sold
2,400,000 shares of its common stock in an underwritten
offering with net proceeds to APS of $64.1 million, and
in 1993 sold 1,364,846 shares of its common stock for
$36.1 million through its Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan and its Employee Stock Ownership
and Savings Plan.

           In October 1993, Potomac Edison and West Penn
issued and sold to APS 2,500,000 and 5,000,000
additional shares of each of their common stock,
respectively, at a price of $20 per share.

           During 1993, the rate for West Penn's 400,000
shares of market auction preferred stock, par value
$100 per share, reset approximately every 90 days at
2.62%, 2.55%, 2.595% and 2.7%.  The rate set at auction
on January 14, 1994, was 2.52%.

           In August 1993, Potomac Edison redeemed the
remaining $404,600 of 4.70% Series B Preferred Stock
outstanding.

           In 1993, the Subsidiaries issued $651.9 million
of securities having interest rates between 4.95% and
7.75%, to refund outstanding debt with rates of 7.0% to
9.75%, with an annual after-tax savings in interest
cost of almost $9 million.  In February 1993, Potomac
Edison issued $45 million of 7-3/4%, 30-year first
mortgage bonds to refund $25 million, 8-5/8% series due
2007 and $15 million, 8-5/8% series due 2003.  In March
1993, West Penn issued $61.5 million of 10-year, 4.95%
Pollution Control Revenue Notes to refund $30 million,
9-3/4% series due 2003 and $31.5 million, 9-1/2% series
due 2003.  In March 1993, AGC issued $50 million of 5-
3/4% medium-term notes due in 1998 to refund $50
million, 8% debentures due in 1997.  In March 1993,
Potomac Edison issued $75 million of 5-7/8% first
mortgage bonds due 2000 to refund $72 million of four
series due 1998-2002 with rates ranging from 7% to 8-
3/8%.  In April 1993, Monongahela, Potomac Edison and
West Penn issued $7.05 million, $8.6 million, and $7.75
million, respectively, in 20-year Pollution Control
Revenue Notes to Monongalia County, West Virginia. 
Monongalia County, in turn issued $23.4 million of
5.95%, 20-year Pollution Control Revenue Bonds to
refund $23.4 million of three series due in 2013 with
rates ranging from 9.375% to 9.5%.  In April 1993,
Monongahela issued $65 million of 5-5/8% first mortgage
bonds due in 2000 to refund $60 million of three series
due 1998-2002 with rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.125%. 
In June 1993, West Penn issued $102 million of 5-1/2%
first mortgage bonds due in 1998 to refund $102 million
of three series due 1997-1999 with rates ranging from
7% to 7-7/8%.  Also in June 1993, West Penn issued $80
million of 6-3/8% first mortgage bonds due 2003 to
refund $75 million of two series due 2001-2002 with
rates of 7-5/8% and 8-1/8%.  In September 1993, AGC
issued $50 million of 5-5/8% debentures due 2003 and
$100 million of 6-7/8% debentures due 2023 to refund
$50 million, 8-3/4% debentures due 2017 and $100
million, 9-1/8% debentures due 2016.

           At December 31, 1993, APS had $67.5 million and
Monongahela had $63.1 million outstanding in short-term
debt, and AGC had $50.87 million outstanding in
commercial paper and notes payable to affiliates, while
Potomac Edison and West Penn had short-term investments
of $4.6 million and $24.9 million, respectively. 

           The Subsidiaries' ratios of earnings to fixed
charges for the year ended December 31, 1993, were as
follows:  Monongahela, 3.49; Potomac Edison, 3.34; West
Penn, 3.49; and AGC, 2.88.

           APS and the Subsidiaries' consolidated
capitalization ratios as of December 31, 1993, were:
common equity, 46.1%; preferred stock, 6.5%; and long-
term debt, 47.4%.  APS and the Subsidiaries' long-term
objective is to maintain the common equity portion
above 45%, reduce the long-term debt portion toward
45%, and maintain the preferred stock ratio for the
balance of the capital structure.

           In January 1994, the Operating Subsidiaries
jointly entered into an aggregate $300 million multi-
year credit agreement with eighteen lenders.  Each
Operating Subsidiary's borrowings under the agreement
are limited to its pro rata share of the stock of AGC,
which stock was pledged to secure the credit agreement. 
The Operating Subsidiaries' percentage ownership of AGC
and resulting borrowing limitations are: Monongahela
27%, $81,000,000; Potomac Edison 28%, $84,000,000; and
West Penn 45%, $135,000,000.  The agreement may be used
as a supplement to or in lieu of public financings and
short-term debt programs.

                            - 18 -

           During 1994, Monongahela, Potomac Edison and West
Penn plan to issue up to $50 million, $75 million, and
$105 million, respectively, of new securities,
consisting of both debt and preferred and common
equity, for general corporate purposes, including their
construction programs.  In addition, the Operating
Subsidiaries may engage in tax-exempt solid waste
disposal financings to the extent funds are available
to Harrison County from the West Virginia cap
allocation.  APS plans to fund Operating Subsidiaries'
sales of common stock to it through the issuance of
short-term debt and the sale of APS' common stock
through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan and Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan.

           The Operating Subsidiaries, if economic and
market conditions make it desirable, may refund during
1994 up to $550 million of first mortgage bonds, up to
$100 million of preferred stock, and up to $78 million
of pollution control revenue notes through tender
offers or optional redemptions.

                                          FUEL SUPPLY


           System-operated stations burned approximately
15.7 million tons of coal in 1993.  Of that amount, 67%
was cleaned (6.7 million tons) or used in stations
equipped with scrubbers (3.9 million tons).  Use of
desulfurization equipment and cleaning and blending of
coal make burning local higher-sulfur coal practical,
and in 1993 about 96% of the coal received at System
stations came from mines in West Virginia,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio.  The Operating
Subsidiaries do not mine or clean any coal.  All raw,
clean or washed coal is purchased from various
suppliers as necessary to meet station requirements.

           Long-term arrangements, subject to price change,
are in effect and will provide for approximately 12
million tons of coal in 1994.  The System depends on
short-term arrangements and spot purchases for its
remaining requirements.  Through the year 1999, the
total coal requirements of present System-operated
stations are expected to be met with coal acquired
under existing contracts or from known suppliers.  

           The Operating Subsidiaries will meet the
requirements of Phase I of the CAAA by installing
scrubbers at Harrison Power Station.  This will allow
the continued use of local, high-sulfur coal there.  A
long-term contract for the supply of lime for use in
the scrubber operation and for fixation of the scrubber
byproduct has been negotiated and is expected to be
signed in early 1994.  It is expected that the use of
lime will increase the costs of operating the station.

           For each of the years 1989 through 1992, the
average cost per ton of coal burned was, respectively,
$34.64, $35.97, $36.74 and $36.31.  For the year 1993,
the cost per ton decreased to $36.19, and in December
1993 the cost per ton was $36.45.

           The labor agreement between the United Mine
Workers of America (UMWA) and the Bituminous Coal
Operators' Association (BCOA) expired on February 1,
1993.  As a result, the UMWA initiated selective
strikes against BCOA member companies on February 2,
1993.  In late May and early June, numerous mines which
serve the Operating Subsidiaries' power stations were
closed down to various degrees.  The UMWA and BCOA
agreed to a new five year contract on December 14,
1993, and mining operations resumed at most mines
during the week of December 20, 1993.  The Operating
Subsidiaries continued to meet customer needs during
this approximately seven-month period through the use
of existing low cost inventories, additional spot and
substitute contract coal purchases, and some
conservation measures, primarily at the Harrison Power
Station.

           The Operating Subsidiaries own coal reserves
estimated to contain about 125 million tons of high-
sulfur coal recoverable by deep mining.  There are no
present plans to mine these reserves and, in view of
economic conditions now prevailing in the coal market,
the Operating Subsidiaries plan to hold the reserves as
a long-term resource. 

                                         RATE MATTERS


           Rate case decisions in Pennsylvania and Maryland
were issued for West Penn and Potomac Edison in May and
February, 1993.

West Penn

           On May 14, 1993, the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission (PUC) issued an order in West Penn's base
rate case effective May 18, 1993, authorizing an
increase in revenues of $61.6 million, of which $26.1
million was for recovery of carrying charges (return on
investment and taxes) associated with West Penn's CAAA
compliance plan through June 30, 1993.  West Penn had
originally filed for a base rate increase designed to
produce $101.4 million.  West Penn received all
maintenance expenses that it had requested, and a
return on equity (ROE) of 11.5%.

           West Penn filed a petition on January 12, 1994
with the PUC requesting authorization to accrue post
in-service carrying charges on the Harrison scrubbers
and to defer related depreciation and operating and
maintenance expenses until they are recognized in
rates.  West Penn cannot predict the outcome of this
proceeding.

           West Penn plans to file an application with the
PUC on or about March 31, 1994, for a base rate
increase to recover the remaining carrying charges on
investment, depreciation and all operating costs
required to comply with Phase I of the CAAA, and other
increasing levels of expense.  It is expected that the
new rates will become effective on or about December
31, 1994.  West Penn cannot predict the precise amount
to be requested or the outcome of this proceeding.

           On February 20, 1992, the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania affirmed the PUC's December 13, 1990,
decision relating to West Penn's challenge to the PUC's
methodology for calculation of ROE.  Three industrial
customers also appealed to the Commonwealth Court that
part of the PUC order which failed to allocate capacity
costs of PURPA projects on a demand basis in West
Penn's Energy Cost Rate.  On June 25, 1992, the
Commonwealth Court reversed the PUC's decision on this
issue and remanded the case to the PUC for further
proceedings.  West Penn and other parties have
negotiated a settlement on capacity costs of PURPA
projects and other demand-related costs in West Penn's
Energy Cost Rate, which settlement does not affect West
Penn's revenues.  The settlement agreement was approved
by the PUC and was implemented in 1993.

Monongahela


           On January 18, 1994, Monongahela filed an
application with the West Virginia Public Service
Commission (West Virginia PSC) for a base rate increase
designed to produce $61.3 million in additional annual
revenues which includes recovery of the remaining
carrying charges on investment, depreciation, and all
operating costs required to comply with Phase I of the
CAAA, and other increasing levels of expense.  It is
expected that a decision will be rendered about
November 15, 1994, with increases to be effective
immediately.  Monongahela cannot predict the outcome of
this proceeding.

           Monongahela filed a petition on January 11, 1994,
with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)
requesting authorization to accrue post-in-service
carrying charges on the Harrison scrubbers until its
investment in such scrubbers is recognized in rates. 
The petition also requested authorization for
Monongahela to defer depreciation, and operating and
maintenance expenses, including property taxes (but not
including fuel costs) with respect to the scrubbers
until the recovery of the deferrals can be addressed in
Monongahela's next base rate case or otherwise, as the
PUCO may deem appropriate.  Monongahela is currently
awaiting a decision on this petition.  If the petition
is approved, Monongahela will file its Ohio base rate
case in early 1995.

Potomac Edison


           The Maryland Public Service Commission (Maryland
PSC) issued a final order in Potomac Edison's base rate
case on February 24, 1993, authorizing an annual
increase of $11.3 million, effective February 25, 1993,
which included CAAA carrying charges through February
28, 1993. The original filing in July of 1992 was
designed to produce approximately $23.0 million in
additional annual revenues.  Subsequent adjustments
reduced this request to $17.6 million.  Potomac Edison
received most of the maintenance expenses that it had
requested and a ROE of 11.9%.

           On April 30, 1993, Potomac Edison filed with the
Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) for a rate
increase designed to produce $10.0 million in
additional annual revenues.  The new rates went into
effect on September 28, 1993, subject to refund. 
Hearings have been held and a final SCC decision is
expected by April 1994.  Potomac Edison cannot predict
the outcome of this proceeding.
<PAGE>

                             - 21 -

           On January 14, 1994, Potomac Edison filed an
application with the West Virginia PSC for a base rate
increase designed to produce $12.2 million in
additional annual revenues which includes recovery of
the remaining carrying charges on investment,
depreciation, and all operating costs required to
comply with Phase I of the CAAA, and other increasing
levels of expense.  It is expected that a decision will
be rendered about November 15, 1994, with increases to
be effective immediately.  Potomac Edison cannot
predict the outcome of this proceeding.

           On or about April 15, 1994, and June 30, 1994,
Potomac Edison plans to file new rate cases in Maryland
and Virginia, respectively.  The amounts of the
requested increases have not yet been determined, but
they will include recovery of the remaining carrying
charges on investment, depreciation, and all operating
costs required to comply with Phase I of the CAAA, and
other increasing levels of expense.  It is expected
that the Maryland decision will be rendered in late
1994, and the Virginia decision in mid-1995.  However,
in both jurisdictions, it is expected that increases
will be effective in late 1994.

Monongahela and Potomac Edison


           Pursuant to its order of December 12, 1991,
approving Monongahela and Potomac Edison's plan for
compliance with Phase I of the CAAA, the West Virginia
PSC authorized recovery by Monongahela and Potomac
Edison of $5.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively,
of carrying charges on Phase I CAAA compliance costs
through March 31, 1993, effective July 1, 1993.  This
brings the annual Phase I CAAA recovery for Monongahela
and Potomac Edison to $8.7 million and $2.2 million,
respectively.  Pursuant to the order, Monongahela and
Potomac Edison will submit requests for recovery of
carrying charges through March 31, 1994, on Phase I
CAAA compliance costs in the annual energy cost review
proceedings with any increase to be effective July 1,
1994.  The annual values of all CAAA revenues
authorized in these proceedings will be removed from
this collection process effective when full Phase I
CAAA costs are included in base rates as a result of
the 1994 rate case filings.

AGC


           Through February 29, 1992, AGC's ROE was adjusted
annually pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by
the FERC.  In December 1991, AGC filed for a
continuation of the existing ROE of 11.53% and other
parties filed to reduce the ROE to 10%.  Hearings were
completed in June 1992, and a recommendation has been
issued by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on December
21, 1993, for an ROE of 10.83%, which the other parties
argue should be further adjusted to reflect changes in
capital market conditions since the hearings. 
Exceptions to this recommendation have been filed by
all parties for consideration by the full Commission. 
On January 28, 1994, the Consumer Advocate Division of
the West Virginia PSC, Maryland People's Counsel, and
Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate filed a joint
complaint with the FERC against AGC claiming that both
the existing ROE of 11.53% and the ROE recommended by
the ALJ of 10.83% are unjust and unreasonable.  This
new complaint requests an ROE of 8.53% with rates
subject to refund beginning April 1, 1994.  AGC cannot
predict the outcome of these proceedings.

FERC


           West Penn, Potomac Edison, and Monongahela
implemented settlement agreements in 1993 covering
wholesale rates in effect for their municipal, co-op,
and borderline agreement customers subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC.  Each included carrying
charges for work in progress on the scrubbers at the
Harrison Power Station, additional expenses for
postretirement benefits other than pensions (see
below), and future automatic rate changes resulting
from changes to taxes or tax rates (federal, state and
local for Monongahela and West Penn, and federal for
Potomac Edison).  The amounts of the increases and the
effective dates for West Penn, Potomac Edison, and
Monongahela were $1.6 million on June 15, 1993; $1.5
million on September 15, 1993; and $0.6 million on
December 1, 1993, respectively.  It is anticipated that
additional filings to include recovery of the remaining
carrying charges on investment, depreciation, as well
as all operating costs required to comply with Phase I
of the CAAA, and other increasing levels of expense for
each Operating Subsidiary will be made in 1994 with
increases to be effective around the end of 1994.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No.
106)


           The Operating Subsidiaries and APSC adopted SFAS
No. 106 as of January 1, 1993.  This requires all
companies to accrue for the cost of postretirement
benefits other than pensions (principally health care
and life insurance) for the employee and covered
dependents during the years that the employee renders
the necessary service to receive such benefits.  Prior
to 1993, medical expenses and life insurance premiums
paid by the Operating Subsidiaries and APSC for retired
employees and their dependents were recovered in rates
on a pay-as-you-go basis.

           Recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs has been
authorized for retail customers in Maryland effective
in February 1993, in Pennsylvania effective in May
1993, and for FERC wholesale customers effective on the
rate case effective date described above under ITEM 1.
RATE MATTERS, FERC.  Regulatory actions have been taken
by the PUCO and Virginia PSC, which indicate that
substantial recovery is probable.  The West Virginia
PSC considers recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs on a case-
by-case basis and therefore Monongahela and Potomac
Edison cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings. 
Recovery has been requested in rate cases filed in
Virginia and West Virginia for which final commission
decisions are expected in 1994.  Recovery of these
costs in Ohio will be requested in the next base rate
case which is expected to be filed in early 1995.  The
Operating Subsidiaries are currently recovering
approximately 85% of SFAS No. 106 expenses in rates. 
This reflects for West Virginia and Ohio only the
recovery of the previously authorized pay-as-you-go
component.  The Operating Subsidiaries have recorded
regulatory assets relating to those regulatory
jurisdictions where full recovery of SFAS No. 106 level
of expenses has not yet been granted recovery in rates. 
The Operating Subsidiaries do not anticipate that SFAS
No. 106 will have a substantial effect on consolidated
net income.

                                   ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS   


           The operations of the Subsidiaries are subject to
regulation as to air and water quality, hazardous and
solid waste disposal, and other environmental matters
by various federal, state, and local authorities.

           Meeting known environmental standards is
estimated to cost the Subsidiaries about $361 million
in capital expenditures over the next three years,
including $254 million for compliance with Phase I of
the CAAA, described below, and initial cost for
anticipated compliance with Phase II.  The full costs
of compliance with Phase II cannot be estimated at this
time, but may be substantial.  Additional legislation
or regulatory control requirements, if enacted, may
well require modifying, supplementing, or replacing
equipment at existing stations at substantial
additional cost. 

                                         Air Standards


           The Operating Subsidiaries meet applicable
standards as to particulates and opacity at major
stations with high-efficiency electrostatic
precipitators, cleaned coal, flue-gas conditioning,
and, at times, reduction of output.  From time to time
minor excursions of opacity normal to fossil fuel
operations are experienced and are accommodated by the
regulatory process.  In February 1994, three notices of
violation were received by the Operating Subsidiaries
from the West Virginia Division of Environmental
Protection (WVDEP) regarding opacity excursions for
three power stations in West Virginia.  The Operating
Subsidiaries are working with the WVDEP to resolve the
alleged violations.  It is not anticipated that the
alleged violations will result in substantial
penalties.  At the major stations (other than Mitchell
Unit No. 3 and Pleasants, which have scrubbers), the
Operating Subsidiaries meet current emission standards
as to sulfur dioxide by using low-sulfur coal, by
purchasing cleaned coal to lower the sulfur content, or
by blending low-sulfur with higher sulfur coal.  

           The CAAA, among other things, require an annual
reduction in total utility emissions within the United
States of 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide and two
million tons of nitrogen oxides from 1980 emission
levels, to be completed in two phases, Phase I and
Phase II.  Five coal-fired System plants are affected
in Phase I and the remaining five coal-fired plants and
any coal-fired plants or units reactivated in the
future will be affected in Phase II.  Installation of
scrubbers at the Harrison Power Station is the strategy
undertaken by the Operating Subsidiaries to meet the
required sulfur dioxide emission reductions for Phase I
(1995).  Continuing studies will determine the
compliance strategy for Phase II (2000).  It is
expected that burner modifications at all power
stations will satisfy the nitrogen oxide emission
reduction requirements for the acid rain (Title IV)
provisions of the CAAA.  Additional post-combustion
controls may be mandated in Maryland and Pennsylvania
for ozone nonattainment (Title I) reasons.  Continuous
emission monitoring equipment has been installed on all
Phase I units and is being installed on Phase II units. 
Studies to evaluate cost effective options to comply
with Phase II of the CAAA, including those which may be
available from the use of Operating Subsidiaries'
banked emission allowances and from the emission
allowance trading market, are continuing.
<PAGE>

                             - 24 -

           In an effort to introduce market forces into
pollution control, the CAAA created sulfur dioxide
emission allowances.  An allowance is defined as an
authorization for an owner to emit one ton of sulfur
dioxide into the atmosphere during or following a
specified calendar year.  Subject to regulatory
limitations, allowances (including bonus and extension
allowances) not used by an owner for its own compliance
may be sold or "banked" for future use or sale. 
Through an industry allowance pooling agreement, the
Operating Subsidiaries will receive a total of
approximately 570,000 bonus and extension allowances
during Phase I.  These allowances are in addition to
the Table A allowances of approximately 356,000 per
year.

           As a result of EPA's 1993 auctioning of a number
of Table A allowances retained from each utility's
annual allotment, approximately 16,000 allowances were
sold for the Operating Subsidiaries.  Such auctions
will be held every year for the foreseeable future and
allowances sold thereby will result in a prorational
allocation of revenues back to the Operating
Subsidiaries.  If some allowances offered at auction
remain unsold, the balance will also be prorationally
rebated to the utilities which contributed them.  The
proceeds from these auctions are expected to be
relatively minimal and the Operating Subsidiaries plan
to credit these proceeds against the capital cost of
emission compliance activities, subject to regulatory
approval.  Other allowance trading activities may be
undertaken by the Operating Subsidiaries once certain
tax questions are answered and once studies to
determine Phase II compliance strategy are completed.

           In 1989, the West Virginia Air Pollution Control
Commission approved the construction of a cogeneration
facility in the vicinity of Rivesville, West Virginia. 
Emissions impact modeling for that facility raised
concerns about the compliance status of Monongahela's
Rivesville Station with the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sulfur dioxide.  Pursuant
to a consent order, Monongahela agreed to collect on-
site meteorological data and conduct additional
dispersion modeling in order to demonstrate compliance. 
The modeling study and a compliance strategy
recommending construction of a new "good engineering
practices" (GEP) stack was submitted to the WVDEP in
June 1993.  Costs associated with the GEP stack are
approximately $7 million.  Monongahela is awaiting
action by the WVDEP.

           Under an EPA-approved consent order with
Pennsylvania, West Penn completed construction of a GEP
stack at the Armstrong Station in 1982 at a cost of
over $13 million with the expectation that EPA's
reclassification of Armstrong County to "attainment
status" under NAAQS for sulfur dioxide would follow. 
As a result of the 1985 revision of its stack height
rules, EPA refused to reclassify the area to attainment
status.  West Penn appealed the EPA's decision.  In
1988, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
dismissed West Penn's appeal for lack of jurisdiction,
stating that West Penn's request for reconsideration
before EPA made EPA's denial a non-final agency action. 
West Penn's request for reconsideration before EPA
remains pending.  West Penn cannot predict the outcome
of this proceeding.


                                        Water Standards


           Under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permitting procedures,
permits for all System-owned stations are in place. 
However, in proposed NPDES renewal permits for some
stations which are currently being sought, some
conditions are being appealed through the regulatory
process since the Operating Subsidiaries believe the
effluent limitations being applied are overly
stringent.  The Operating Subsidiaries continue to work
with the appropriate state agencies to resolve these
issues.  In the meantime, the existing permits remain
in effect during the appeal process.

           The EPA and states are now implementing
stormwater runoff regulations for controlling
discharges from industrial and municipal sources as
well as construction sites.  Stormwater discharges have
been identified and included in NPDES renewals, but
controls have not yet been required.  Since the current
round of permit renewals began in 1993, monitoring
requirements have been imposed, with pollution
reduction plans and additional control of some
discharges anticipated.

           Pursuant to the National Groundwater Protection
Strategy, which supplements existing West Virginia
groundwater protection policy, West Virginia has
adopted a Groundwater Protection Act.  This law
establishes a statewide antidegradation policy which
could require the Operating Subsidiaries to undertake
reconstruction of existing landfills and surface
impoundments as well as groundwater remediation, and
may affect herbicide use for right-of-way maintenance
in West Virginia.  Groundwater protection standards
were approved and implemented in 1993 (based on EPA
drinking water criteria) which established compliance
limits which cannot be exceeded.  The Operating
Subsidiaries anticipate that some facilities will not
be able to meet the new compliance limits.  Variance
requests and requests for stays of implementation have
been made for all affected facilities.  However,
variance rules have not yet been promulgated and action
on the requests has not been taken.  Therefore, it is
not possible to predict the difficulty and costs
associated with obtaining variances.  If variances are
not granted, costs may be incurred by the Operating
Subsidiaries for groundwater remediation.  Such costs,
if any, cannot be predicted at this time.

                            - 26 -

           The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources (PADER) developed a Groundwater Quality
Protection Strategy which established a goal of
nondegradation of groundwater quality.  However, the
strategy recognizes that there are technical and
economic limitations to immediately achieving the goal
and further recognizes that some groundwaters need
greater protection than others.  The PADER is beginning
to implement the strategy by promulgating changes to
the existing rules that heretofore did not consider the
nondegradation goal.  The full extent of the impact of
the strategy on the Operating Subsidiaries cannot be
anticipated at this time.

           In 1993, two notices of violation were received
by the Operating Subsidiaries from the WVDEP regarding
excursions above limits contained in NPDES permits for
discharge of leachate from fly ash landfills in West
Virginia.  One violation notice was withdrawn by the
state agency and the other was resolved without payment
of substantial penalty.  On January 27, 1994 and
February 9, 1994, the Operating Subsidiaries received
two separate notices of violation from PADER regarding
excursions above limits contained in the NPDES permit
for discharge of leachate from Hatfield's Ferry Power
Station fly ash landfill.  One violation notice was
resolved without payment of substantial penalty.  The
Operating Subsidiaries are working with the PADER to
resolve the other alleged violation.  It is not
anticipated that the alleged violation will result in
substantial penalties.

                                  Hazardous and Solid Wastes


           Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Management Amendments of 1984 (RCRA), EPA regulates the
disposal of hazardous and solid waste materials. 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, and
Virginia have also enacted hazardous and solid waste
management legislation.

           With the installation of the scrubbers at the
Harrison Power Station, approximately 2.8 million tons
per year of scrubber sludge, consisting principally of
limestone and ash, will be generated and disposed of in
a disposal facility owned and operated by the Operating
Subsidiaries.  The expected capacity of the site is 30
years.  Pleasants Power Station processes its scrubber
sludge using a wet-fixation and slurry system, with the
treated sludge disposed of in a properly permitted
sludge pond.  Mitchell and Harrison Power Stations
process their scrubber sludge by a dry-fixation process
with the stabilized sludge disposed of in a properly
permitted landfill.  Coal combustion byproducts from
all other facilities are either sold for beneficial
reuse or landfilled in properly permitted and currently
adequate disposal facilities owned and operated by the
Operating Subsidiaries.  The Operating Subsidiaries are
in the process of permitting additional capacity to
meet future disposal needs.
<PAGE>

                             - 27 -

           Costs are being incurred as the Operating
Subsidiaries progress with implementation of both West
Virginia's and Pennsylvania's 1992 solid waste
regulatory changes.  A predominant portion of the costs
are attributable to two major factors:  1) liner
systems for new disposal sites and the expansion
portion of existing disposal sites, and 2) the
assessment of groundwater impacts via monitoring wells. 
Because past operating practices, while in compliance
with then existing regulations, may not meet the
current criteria, as measured by new standards, it is
possible that groundwater remediation may be required
at some of the Operating Subsidiaries' facilities.  In
addition, under West Virginia's Solid Waste Rules, it
is possible that certain active disposal sites may have
to be retrofitted with liner systems to address
potential groundwater degradation.  The draft permit
renewal from WVDEP for the currently active disposal
site at Albright Power Station requires, on a portion
of the site, retrofitting with a new liner system with
possible removal of already placed coal combustion
byproducts.  The Operating Subsidiaries are working to
have this proposed permit condition removed; however if
it is not, it is anticipated that this condition will
be appealed.

           EPA regulations on the burning of hazardous waste
in utility boilers are expected to be amended in 1994
making the practice cost prohibitive for the Operating
Subsidiaries.  Until such time as the regulations are
amended, the Operating Subsidiaries will continue to
minimize their hazardous waste and to burn small
quantities of hazardous waste generated in accordance
with EPA boiler and industrial furnace disposal rules. 
Once such regulations are amended, the low volume
wastes will be disposed of in incinerators or landfills
which are owned by third parties.  None of the
Operating Subsidiaries are required to obtain hazardous
waste treatment, storage or disposal permits under
RCRA.  With a continued effort to reduce hazardous
waste, disposal costs and potential environmental
liability should be minimized.

           Potomac Edison has received a notice from the
Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) regarding
a remediation ordered under Maryland law at a facility
previously owned by Potomac Edison.  The MDE has
identified Potomac Edison as a potentially responsible
party under Maryland law.  Remediation is currently
being implemented by the current owner of the facility
in Frederick, Maryland.  It is not anticipated that
Potomac Edison's share of remediation costs, if any,
will be substantial.

                                 Emerging Environmental Issues


           Title I of the CAAA establishes an ozone
transport region consisting of 11 northeast states
including Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Sources within
the region will be required to reduce nitrogen oxide
emissions, a precursor of ozone, to a level conducive
to attainment of the ambient ozone standard.  The first
step for Title I compliance will result in the
installation of low nitrogen oxide burners and
potentially overfire air at all Pennsylvania and
Maryland stations by 1995.  This is compatible with
Title IV nitrogen oxide reduction requirements. 
Modeling studies being conducted by the states will
determine if a second step of reductions will be
necessary which could require installation of post-
combustion control technologies.
<PAGE>

                             - 28 -

           Title III of the CAAA requires EPA to conduct
studies of toxic air pollutants from utility plants to
determine if emission controls are necessary.  EPA's
reports are expected to be submitted to Congress in
late 1995.

           The impact of Titles I and III on the Operating
Subsidiaries is unknown at this time.

           Both the CWA and the RCRA are expected to be
reauthorized in 1994.  It is anticipated that coal
combustion byproducts will continue to be regulated as
nonhazardous waste, minimizing the Operating
Subsidiaries' disposal costs.

           An additional issue which could impact the
Operating Subsidiaries and which is undergoing intense
study, is the effect, if any, of electric and magnetic
fields.  The financial impact of this issue on the
Operating Subsidiaries, if any, cannot be assessed at
this time.

           In connection with President Clinton's Climate
Change Action Plan concerning greenhouse gases, the
Operating Subsidiaries expressed by letter to the DOE
in August 1993, their willingness to work with the DOE
on implementing voluntary, cost-effective courses of
action that reduce or avoid emission of greenhouse
gases.  Such courses of action must take into account
the unique circumstances of each participating company,
such as growth requirements, fuel mix and other
circumstances.  Furthermore, they must be consistent
with the Operating Subsidiaries' integrated resource
planning process and must not have an adverse effect on
competitive position in terms of costs and rates or be
unacceptable to their regulators.  Some 63 other
utility systems submitted similar letters.

                                          REGULATION


           APS and the Subsidiaries are subject to the broad
jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 (PUHCA).  APS is also subject to the jurisdiction
of the Maryland PSC as to certain of its activities. 
The Subsidiaries are regulated as to substantially all
of their operations by regulatory commissions in the
states in which they operate and also by the DOE and
the FERC.  In addition, they are subject to numerous
other city, county, state, and federal laws,
regulations, and rules.

           EPACT became law on October 24, 1992.  This broad
legislation, among other things, amends PUHCA to permit
utilities subject to PUHCA to compete in the wholesale
generation business with other wholesale generators
which it exempts from PUHCA; to ease restrictions on
financing for that purpose; and to permit investment in
foreign utilities.  EPACT also amends the Federal Power
Act to permit the FERC to order, under specified
circumstances, access to transmission systems
(including those of the System) so long as it would not
unreasonably impair reliability nor adversely affect
its existing wholesale, retail and transmission
customers.  It also amends PURPA to encourage states to
study and regulate various matters, including the
capital structures of EWGs, integrated resource
planning, and the amount of purchased power that
electric utilities should have in their generation mix. 
EPACT also sets forth waste disposal standards, new
nuclear licensing procedures, and contains provisions
promoting alternate transportation fuels, research on
environmental issues, and increased energy from
renewables (See discussion of EPACT in ITEM 1.
BUSINESS, SALES and ELECTRIC FACILITIES).

                             - 29 -

           Pursuant to the requirements of Section 712 of
EPACT, the Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
West Virginia commissions issued orders regarding four
broad economic and regulatory policy issues related to
the purchase of wholesale power.  All of the
commissions decided to evaluate these issues on a case-
by-case basis or within their existing regulatory
framework, instead of establishing generic standards.

           On January 24, 1994, the Maryland PSC issued an
order which instituted a proceeding for the purpose of
determining whether to implement standards which, under
EPACT, a state commission must consider in order to
encourage integrated resource planning and investments
in conservation and energy efficiency by electric
utilities.  The order provides for the filing of
initial and reply comments and for a hearing on May 3,
1994.  Potomac Edison intervened and will be submitting
comments in this proceeding. 

           Under EPACT, the FERC has initiated several
proceedings, one of the most significant being the
request for comments on transmission pricing, including
pricing as it may apply to parallel power flows.  The
Operating Subsidiaries have developed and submitted a
pricing philosophy intended to meet certain goals,
including reliable operation of the transmission system
and protection of native load customers, while
promoting accurate price signals and offering third-
party transmission service at the lowest reasonable
rates. Other FERC initiatives included the issuance of
guidelines governing open access transmission requests
and rules governing the establishment of Regional
Transmission Groups.

           The Operating Subsidiaries founded and continue
to participate in, along with other utilities, an
organization whose primary purpose is to develop a
mutually acceptable method of resolving the inequities
imposed on transmission network owners by parallel
power flows.  

           The SEC has also issued regulations and proposed
regulations to implement EPACT, including the
integration of EPACT with PUCHA and the effect of EPACT
on nonexempt PUCHA companies such as APS and its
Subsidiaries.

           In July 1993, the PUC directed the Bureau of
Conservation, Economics and Energy Planning to develop
competitive bidding regulations to replace, at least in
part, the existing state PURPA regulations.  In
November 1993, West Penn filed a petition with the PUC
requesting an Order that, pending the revision and
replacement of the existing state PURPA regulations,
any proceedings or orders regarding purchase by West
Penn of capacity from a qualifying facility under PURPA
shall be based on competitive bidding.  The Office of
Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business
Advocate, the West Penn Power Industrial Intervenors,
and West Penn's two largest industrial customers have
intervened in support of West Penn's position.  Several
PURPA developers and a group purporting to represent
PURPA interests have filed in opposition to certain
parts of the petition.  West Penn cannot predict the
outcome of this proceeding.
<PAGE>

                             - 30 -

           On October 8, 1993, the West Virginia PSC issued
proposed regulations concerning bidding procedures for
capacity additions for electric utilities and invited
comment by December 7, 1993.  A number of interested
parties, including Monongahela and Potomac Edison,
filed comments.  The West Virginia PSC has taken no
further action since the filing of comments.

           On December 17, 1992, the PUCO issued proposed
rules concerning competitive bidding for supply-side
resources, transmission access for winning bidders and
incentives for the recovery of the cost of purchased
power.  The PUCO invited comments by March 3, 1993 and
reply comments by March 24, 1993.  A number of
interested parties, including Monongahela, submitted
comments.  The PUCO has taken no further action
following the filing of comments.

           Maryland and Virginia have not mandated
compulsory competitive bidding at this date.

           The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
increased the marginal corporate income tax rate from
34% to 35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993.  As a
result, the Operating Subsidiaries' income tax expense
for 1993 increased by about $3 million.

           On June 13, 1990, the Maryland PSC began an
investigation to determine whether Potomac Edison's
methodology for calculating avoided costs under PURPA
is appropriate.  On October 11, 1991, the Maryland PSC
incorporated this review of avoided costs into a
collaborative process already formed between its Staff,
the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Potomac
Edison, Eastalco Aluminum, the Maryland Energy
Administration, and the Office of People's Counsel. 
Although the group's primary mission was to avoid
litigation by working cooperatively to develop demand-
side management programs, the issue of avoided costs
was addressed because avoided costs are needed for
determining the cost-effectiveness of programs.  These
negotiations culminated in a Settlement Agreement which
was signed by the six parties and filed with the
Maryland PSC on October 14, 1993.  The Hearing Examiner
issued a proposed order accepting the Settlement
Agreement on November 17, 1993.  The proposed order
became final on December 17, 1993, thereby concluding
this proceeding.

           In October 1990, the PUC ordered Pennsylvania's
major electric utilities, including West Penn, to file
programs for demand-side management designed to reduce
customer demand for electricity and to reduce the need
for additional generating capacity.  The PUC's order
proposed that the affected utilities receive full
recovery of the costs of approved programs, as well as
financial incentives for implementing such programs,
including recovery of lost revenues.  West Penn filed
its proposed programs with the PUC.  On December 13,
1993, the PUC entered an order which provides for the
recovery of program costs either through a surcharge or
deferral to a base rate case; the recovery of revenues
lost due to the implementation of demand-side
management programs through a base rate case; and the
award of incentives  for good program performance or
the assessment of penalties for poor performance.  Two
parties to this proceeding have petitioned the PUC for
reconsideration and clarification and the Pennsylvania
Industrial Energy Coalition has filed an appeal with
the Commonwealth  Court of Pennsylvania.  West Penn
cannot predict the final outcome of this proceeding.

                             - 31 -

           During 1993, Potomac Edison continued its
participation in the Collaborative Process for demand-
side management in Maryland with the Maryland PSC
Staff, Office of People's Counsel, the Department of
Natural Resources, Maryland Energy Administration, and
Potomac Edison's largest industrial customer.  Potomac
Edison received the Maryland PSC's approval to
implement a Commercial and Industrial Lighting Rebate
Program as of July 1, 1993.  Through December 31, 1993
Potomac Edison had received applications for $7.5
million in rebates related to the commercial lighting
program.  Program costs, including rebates and lost
revenues, are deferred and are to be recovered through
an energy conservation surcharge over a five-year
period.


ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES


           Substantially all of the properties of the
Operating Subsidiaries are held subject to the lien
securing each company's first mortgage bonds and, in
many cases, subject to certain reservations, minor
encumbrances, and title defects which do not materially
interfere with their use.  Some properties are also
subject to a second lien securing certain solid waste
disposal and pollution control notes.  The indenture
under which AGC's unsecured debentures and medium-term
notes are issued, prohibits AGC, with certain limited
exceptions, from incurring or permitting liens to exist
on any of its properties or assets unless the
debentures and medium-term notes are contemporaneously
secured equally and ratably with all other indebtedness
secured by such lien.  Transmission and distribution
lines, in substantial part, some substations and
switching stations, and some ancillary facilities at
power stations are on lands of others, in some cases by
sufferance, but in most instances pursuant to leases,
easements, permits or other arrangements, many of which
have not been recorded and some of which are not
evidenced by formal grants.  In some cases no
examination of titles has been made as to lands on
which transmission and distribution lines and
substations are located.  Each of the Operating
Subsidiaries possesses the power of eminent domain with
respect to its public utility operations.  (See also
ITEM 1. BUSINESS and SYSTEM MAP.)

                             - 32 -


ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


           In 1979, National Steel Corporation (National
Steel) filed suit against certain Subsidiaries in the
Circuit Court of Hancock County, West Virginia,
alleging damages of approximately $7.9 million as a
result of an order issued by the West Virginia PSC
requiring curtailment of the plaintiff's use of
electric power during the United Mine Workers' strike
of 1977-8.  A jury verdict in favor of the defendants
was rendered in June 1991.  National Steel has filed a
motion for a new trial, which is still pending before
the Circuit Court of Hancock County.  The Subsidiaries
believe the motion is without merit; however, they
cannot predict the outcome of this case.

           In 1987, West Penn entered into separate
agreements with developers of four PURPA projects: 
Milesburg (43 MW), Burgettstown  (80 MW), Shannopin (80
MW) and Point Marion (2 MW).  The agreements provided
for the purchase of each project's power over 30 years
or more at rates generally approximating West Penn's
avoided costs at the time the agreements were
negotiated, as defined by PURPA.  Yearly capacity
payments under the four agreements would total in
excess of $50 million.  Each agreement was subject to
prior PUC approval of the pass-through to West Penn's
customers of the total cost incurred under each
agreement, on a current basis.  In 1987 and 1988, West
Penn filed a separate petition with the PUC for each
agreement requesting an appropriate PUC order, and
various parties intervened.  Since that time, all four
agreements have been, in varying degrees, the subject
of complex and continuing regulatory and judicial
proceedings.  During 1993, West Penn entered into a
settlement agreement with Point Marion and that project
has been terminated.

           On November 24, 1993, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court issued a per curiam opinion regarding the
Milesburg project which upheld the decision of the
Commonwealth Court concerning the time frame for the
calculation of avoided cost and upheld the decision
that the PUC had the authority under PURPA to revise
and reinstate a lapsed power purchase contract.  West
Penn is considering its options as a result of this
ruling, including a petition for certiorari to the
United States Supreme Court.

           On December 30, 1993, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court issued a per curiam opinion regarding the
Shannopin project which upheld the decision of the
Commonwealth Court affirming the PUC's authority under
PURPA to revise voluntarily negotiated power purchase
contracts.  West Penn is considering its options as a
result of this ruling, including a petition for
certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.  As of
December 31, 1993, petitions for allowance of an appeal
of the decision of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court
on the Burgettstown project were pending before the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  West Penn cannot predict
the outcome of these proceedings.

           On October 28, 1993, South River Power Partners,
L.P. ("South River") filed a complaint against West
Penn with the PUC.  The complaint seeks to require West
Penn to purchase 240 MW from a proposed coal-fired
PURPA project which South River proposes to build in
Fayette County, Pennsylvania.  South River's proposed
initial price for this power would be over $0.09 per
kWh.  West Penn is opposing this complaint as the power
is not needed and the price is in excess of avoided
cost.  The Pennsylvania Consumer Advocate, the Small
Business Advocate, the PUC Trial Staff and various
industrial customers have also intervened in opposition
to the complaint.  West Penn cannot predict the outcome
of this proceeding.
<PAGE>

                             - 33 -

           Two previously reported complaints had been filed
with the West Virginia PSC by developers of
cogeneration projects in Marshall and Barbour Counties,
West Virginia to require Monongahela and Potomac Edison
to purchase capacity from the projects.  These two
cases were consolidated.  The West Virginia PSC on
March 5, 1993, found that: Monongahela had no need for
additional capacity; Potomac Edison will need new
combustion turbine generating capacity beginning in
1996; and Potomac Edison's avoided cost estimate, which
is substantially below the costs sought by the
developers of the projects, is reasonable.  The
developers have asked the West Virginia PSC to consider
issues not resolved in the March 5, 1993 order.  On
June 25, 1993 the West Virginia PSC found that Potomac
Edison had a PURPA obligation to purchase power from
qualifying facilities properly interconnected to the
System in Monongahela's service territory and ordered
negotiations by Monongahela and Potomac Edison with the
two PURPA developers.  On August 9, 1993, the West
Virginia PSC deconsolidated the two cases.  Following
the West Virginia Supreme Court's denial of a petition
for review of this order, both developers requested the
start of negotiations.  Monongahela and Potomac Edison
cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

           On November 16, 1992, Potomac Edison and the
developer of a proposed cogeneration project located in
Cumberland, Maryland, requested that the Maryland PSC
approve an amendment to a previously approved agreement
for the sale of 180 MW of capacity and associated
energy from the project to Potomac Edison.  The
amendment provides for the relocation of the proposed
project within the Cumberland area; a delay of one year
in the project's earliest in-service date to October 1,
1996, without increase in the initial capacity rate
(which otherwise escalates annually at one-half the
rate of actual inflation); and other changes consistent
with the site and in-service date modifications.  The
Maryland PSC commenced an investigation of the
amendment in December 1992.  After hearings, the
parties reached a settlement which was approved by the
Maryland PSC on March 17, 1993.  The settlement
agreement resulted in a further delay of the project's
in-service date to October 1, 1999, modified the
initial capacity rate with only a slight escalation,
and provided that Potomac Edison would pay, and recover
from customers by a surcharge, a portion of the
project's costs resulting from the delay.  On December
22, 1993, the Maryland PSC approved the surcharge and
these costs are being recovered from customers
effective January 1, 1994.

           As previously reported, effective March 1, 1989,
West Virginia enacted a new method for calculating the
Business and Occupation Tax  (B & O Tax) on electricity
generated in that state, which disproportionately
increased the B & O Tax on shipments of electricity to
other states.  In 1989, West Penn, the Pennsylvania
Consumer Advocate, and several West Penn industrial
customers filed a joint complaint in the Circuit Court
of Kanawha County, West Virginia seeking to have the B
& O Tax declared illegal and unconstitutional on the
grounds that it violates the Interstate Commerce Clause
and the Equal Protection Clause of the federal
Constitution and certain provisions of federal law that
bar the states from imposing or assessing taxes on the
generation or transmission of electricity that
discriminate against out-of-state entities.  In 1991,
West Penn amended the complaint to include a 1990
increase in the rate of the B & O Tax.  The trial was
held in July 1993 and briefs have been filed.  West
Penn cannot predict the outcome of this litigation.

                             - 34 -

           As of January 1994, Monongahela has been named as
a defendant along with multiple other defendants in
1,429 pending asbestos cases involving multiple
plaintiffs and Monongahela, Potomac Edison and West
Penn have been named as defendants along with multiple
defendants in an additional 626 cases by multiple
plaintiffs.  Because these cases are filed by "shot-
gun" complaints naming many plaintiffs and many
defendants, it is presently impossible to determine the
actual number of claims against the Operating
Subsidiaries.  However, based on past experience and
data available to date, it is estimated that less than
600 cases actually involve claims against any or all of
the Operating Subsidiaries.  All complaints allege that
the plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting
from claimed exposure to asbestos in various generating
plants and other industrial facilities operated by the
various defendants, although all plaintiffs do not
claim exposure at facilities operated by all
defendants.  All plaintiffs claiming exposure at
Subsidiary-operated stations were employed by third-
party contractors, with the exception of three who
claim to have been employees of Monongahela.  Each
plaintiff generally seeks compensatory and punitive
damages against all defendants in amounts of up to $1
million and $3 million, respectively; in those cases
that include a spousal claim for loss of consortium,
damages are generally sought against all defendants in
an amount of up to $1 million for the loss of
consortium claim.  Therefore, because of the multiple
defendants, the Operating Subsidiaries believe
potential liability of the Operating Subsidiaries is a
very small percentage of the total amount of the
damages sought.  A total of 94 cases have been
previously settled by Monongahela for an amount
substantially less than the anticipated cost of
defense.  While the Operating Subsidiaries believe that
all of these cases are without merit, they cannot
predict the outcome of these cases or whether other
cases will be filed.

           On March 4, 1994, the Operating Subsidiaries
received notice that the EPA had identified them as
potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), with
respect to the Jack's Creek/Sitkin Smelting Superfund
Site ("Site").  The Operating Subsidiaries are among
some 880 PRPs that have been identified at the Site.
EPA is planning to issue a Proposed Plan and Record of
Decision in September 1994 delineating the remedy
selected for the Site.  At this time it is not possible
to determine what liability, if any, the Operating
Subsidiaries may have regarding the Site.

           In 1970, the Operating Subsidiaries filed with
the Federal Power Commission (FPC) an application for a
license to build a 1,000-MW energy-storage facility
near Davis, West Virginia.  In 1977, FPC issued a
license for the project, but various parties, including
the State of West Virginia and the U.S. Department of
Interior, filed appeals, which are now pending before
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) denied a
dredge and fill permit for the project, which decision
was appealed.  The U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia decided that the Corps had no jurisdiction
in the matter.  The Corps filed an appeal with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  In
1987, the appellate Court decided that the Corps did
have jurisdiction and remanded the case to the U.S.
District Court for further consideration of the Corps'
denial of the permit.  The U. S. Supreme Court refused
to review that decision.  In 1988, the U.S. District
Court reversed the Corps' denial of the dredge and fill
permit.  The District Court's decision, which has now
been appealed, found, among other things, that the
Operating Subsidiaries were denied an opportunity to
review and comment upon written materials and other
communications used by the Corps in making its
decision, and as a result the Court remanded the matter
to the Corps for further proceedings.  Negotiations are
ongoing to settle this matter.  The Operating
Subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of these
proceedings.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS 


           The holders of 46,537,924 shares of common stock of APS voted
at a special meeting held on November 3, 1993 to amend APS' charter
to reclassify each share of common stock, par value $2.50 per
share, issued or unissued, into two shares of common stock, par
value $1.25 each.  The holder of 259,451 shares voted against the
proposal and the holders of 296,598 shares abstained.  The charter
amendment became effective at the close of business on November 4,
1993.   The amount of APS' stated capital was not changed as a
result of the amendment.

           The holder of the common stock of Monongahela on December 13,
1993, waived the holding of a meeting and consented in writing to
the amendment of its Charter to reflect the redemption of 50,000
shares of $9.64 series cumulative preferred stock.

           No other company submitted matters to a vote of shareholders
during the fourth quarter.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME
Earnings per share were $1.88 in 1993 and were $1.83 and $1.80 in 1992
and 1991. Consolidated net income was $215.8 million, $203.5 million,
and $194.0 million. The increase in consolidated net income in 1993
resulted primarily from kWh sales and retail rate increases. The
increase in 1992 resulted primarily from retail rate increases. These
revenue increases, in both years, were offset in part by higher
expenses. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the
November 4, 1993, two-for-one stock split (See Note F to the
consolidated financial statements).


SALES AND REVENUES
KWh sales to and revenues from residential, commercial, and industrial
customers are shown on page D-2. Such kWh sales increased 3.3% and 1.5%
in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The increases in revenues from sales to
residential, commercial, and industrial customers resulted from the
following:

(a) Changes in revenues from fuel and energy cost adjustment clauses
have little effect on consolidated net income.
(b) See ITEM 1. RATE MATTERS for further information on rate
changes.

 The increased kWh sales to residential and commercial customers in 1993
reflect both growth in number of customers and higher use. While 1993
heating degree days showed only a slight increase over 1992, and were
approximately normal, cooling degree days increased 69% over 1992 and
were 25% over normal, contributing to the 1993 kWh sales increases. The
subsidiaries experienced a mild winter in the first quarter of 1992
followed by a much cooler than normal summer and early fall. As a
result, weather had a negative impact on 1992 sales to retail customers.

                             M -2

KWh sales to industrial customers increased .3% in 1993 and 2.9% in
1992. The relatively flat industrial sales growth in 1993 followed
record industrial sales in 1992 which occurred in almost all industrial
groups. One particular group, coal mines staffed by union personnel,
recorded reduced usage because of selective work stoppages by the United
Mine Workers of America (UMWA) for most of the year prior to the
settling of the dispute in December 1993.

KWh sales to and revenues from nonaffiliated utilities are comprised of
the following items:
                                            1993      1992      1991
KWh sales (in billions):
  From subsidiaries' generation              1.2       3.2       5.8
  From purchased power                      11.2      14.6      12.4
                                            12.4      17.8      18.2
Revenues (in millions):
  From subsidiaries' generation           $ 28.5    $ 91.7    $158.5
  From sales of purchased power            318.2     373.8     366.5
                                          $346.7    $465.5    $525.0

Decreased sales to nonaffiliated utilities resulted primarily from
decreased demand and continuing price competition. Sales supplied by
subsidiaries' generation in 1993 decreased to less than 15% of 1988
levels because of continuing growth of kWh sales to retail customers,
which reduces the amount available for sale, and because other suppliers
were willing or able to make the sales at lower prices. A significant
factor affecting the subsidiaries' ability to compete in the market for
sales to nonaffiliated utilities has been the approximate 290% increase
(from about 67 cents per MWh to $2.60 per MWh) in taxes on generation in West
Virginia since March 1989--a significant cost not experienced by
utilities not generating in West Virginia. Further decreases in these
sales are anticipated in 1994 before leveling off. About 95% of the
aggregate benefits from sales to nonaffiliated utilities is passed on to
retail customers and has little effect on consolidated net income.

The decrease in other revenues in 1993 resulted from an agreement with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to record in 1993 about $14
million of revenues as sales to nonaffiliated utilities. Similar
transactions were recorded as other revenues in prior years.

                            M -3
OPERATING EXPENSES
Fuel expenses decreased 4% in 1993 and 6% in 1992. Both decreases were
primarily due to decreases in kWh generated. The 1992 decrease also
included a 1% decrease in average coal prices. Fuel expenses are
primarily subject to deferred power cost accounting procedures, as
described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, with the
result that changes in fuel expenses have little effect on consolidated
net income.

"Purchased power and exchanges, net" represents power purchases from and
exchanges with other utilities and qualified facilities under the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and is comprised of the
following items:
                                         1993       1992       1991
                                           (Millions of Dollars)       
Purchased power:
  For resale to other utilities        $280.9     $344.0     $332.7 
  From PURPA generation                 105.2       94.0       68.9 
  Other                                  33.8       12.7       29.0 
    Total power purchased               419.9      450.7      430.6 
Power exchanges, net                     (2.5)        .7       (1.4)
                                       $417.4     $451.4     $429.2 

The amount of power purchased from other utilities for use by
subsidiaries and for resale to other utilities depends upon the
availability of the subsidiaries' generating equipment, transmission
capacity, and fuel, and their cost of generation and the cost of
operations of other utilities from which such purchases are made. The
primary reason for the fluctuations in purchases for resale to other
utilities is described under SALES AND REVENUES above. The cost of power
purchased for use by the subsidiaries, including power from PURPA
generation, is mostly recovered from customers currently through the
regular fuel and energy cost recovery procedures followed by the
subsidiaries' regulatory commissions and is primarily subject to
deferred power cost procedures with the result that changes in such
costs have little effect on consolidated net income. The increases in
purchases from PURPA generation reflect additional generation from new
PURPA projects. The 1993 increase in other purchased power reflects
efforts to conserve coal during the UMWA dispute.

The increase in other operation expense for 1993 and 1992 resulted
primarily from increases in employee benefit costs and  salaries and
wages. The Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) standard, SFAS
No. 106, increased 1993 postretirement benefit expense by approximately
$5 million. The subsidiaries are currently recovering approximately 85%
of SFAS No. 106 expenses in rates and will be requesting recovery of
substantially all of the remainder in 1994 rate cases.  During 1992, the
subsidiaries implemented significant changes to their benefits plans,
including cost caps, in an effort to both control and reduce employee
benefits costs.  The cost caps provide for future postretirement
medical benefit costs to be capped at two times 1993 levels. Because
1993 medical costs were more than actuarially projected, SFAS No. 106
costs for 1994 are expected to be approximately 20% greater than 1993
amounts.

                            M-4

Another FASB standard, SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits", effective in 1994, requires companies to
accrue for other postemployment benefits such as disability benefits,
health care benefits for disabled employees, severance pay, and workers'
compensation claims.  The subsidiaries currently accrue for workers'
compensation claims and the estimated liability for the other benefits
is not expected to be material.

Maintenance expenses represent costs incurred to maintain the power
stations, the transmission and distribution (T&D) system, and general
plant, and reflect routine maintenance of equipment and rights-of-way as
well as planned major repairs and unplanned expenditures, primarily from
forced outages at the power stations and periodic storm damage on the
T&D system. Maintenance expense in 1993 includes the effects of an ice
storm and blizzard in March 1993. The subsidiaries are also
experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, increased
expenditures due to the aging of their power stations. Variations in
maintenance expense result primarily from unplanned events and planned
major projects, which vary in timing and magnitude depending upon the
length of time equipment has been in service without a major overhaul,
the amount of work found necessary when the equipment is dismantled, and
outage requirements to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAAA).

Depreciation expense increases resulted primarily from additions to
electric plant. Because of the increased levels of capital expenditures
as a result of the CAAA (see Note I to the consolidated financial
statements) and the replacement of aging equipment at the subsidiaries'
power stations, depreciation expense is expected to increase
significantly over the next few years.

Taxes other than income increased $4 million in 1993 primarily due to
increases in gross receipts taxes resulting from higher revenues from
retail customers ($5 million) and increased property taxes ($2 million).
These increases were offset by decreased West Virginia Business and
Occupation taxes (B&O taxes) due to decreased generation in that state.
The 1992 increase resulted from increased property taxes ($4 million),
increases in gross receipts taxes ($3 million), and increased capital
stock taxes ($2 million), offset by decreased B&O taxes ($2 million).

The net increase of $13 million in federal and state income taxes in
1993 resulted primarily from an increase in income before taxes ($9
million), and an increase in the tax rate due to the Revenue
Reconciliation Act of 1993 ($3 million).  The net decrease in 1992 of $4
million resulted primarily from plant removal and certain bond
refinancing cost tax deductions for which deferred taxes were not
provided. Note B to the consolidated financial statements provides a
further analysis of income tax expenses. 

                             M-5
 
The combined increase of $4 million in allowances for funds used during
construction (AFUDC) in 1993 reflects increased construction
expenditures including those associated with the CAAA, net of CAAA
amounts included in rate base and earning a cash return. Future levels
of AFUDC can be expected to increase slightly with increasing levels of
CAAA expenditures until late 1994 upon substantial completion of Phase I
of the CAAA compliance program. Fluctuations in other income, net, were
individually insignificant. Other interest expense reflects changes in
the levels of short-term debt maintained by the companies.

The decrease in dividends on preferred stock of subsidiaries reflects
the 1992 redemption of three series totaling $25 million with dividend
rates of 9.4% to 9.64% and the 1993 redemption of an additional $2
million of 4.7% to $7.16 series, offset by the 1992 sale of $40 million
of market auction preferred stock with an average dividend rate of 2.6%.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SEC regulations define "liquidity" as "the ability of an enterprise to
generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the enterprise's need for
cash". System companies need cash for operating expenses, the payment of
interest and dividends, retirement of debt and certain preferred stocks,
and for their construction programs. To meet these needs, the companies
have used internally generated funds and external financings, such as
the sale of common and preferred stock, debt instruments, instalment
loans, and lease arrangements. The timing and amount of external
financings depend primarily upon economic and financial market
conditions, the companies' cash needs, and capitalization ratio
objectives. The availability and cost of external financing depend upon
the financial health of the companies seeking those funds.


CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Construction expenditures for 1993 were $574 million and for 1994 and
1995 are estimated at $500 million and $400 million, respectively. 
These estimates include $161 million and $53 million, respectively, for
substantial completion of the program of complying with Phase I of the
CAAA discussed under ITEM 1. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  It is anticipated
that the Harrison Scrubber Project will be completed on schedule (late
1994) and that the final cost will be approximately 24% below the
original budget.  Primary factors contributing to the reduced cost
include: 1) the absence of any major construction problems to date; 2)
financing and material and equipment costs lower than expected; and 3)
favorable rulings of state commissions allowing the inclusion of
carrying costs of construction in rates in lieu of AFUDC.  Construction
expenditures through the year 2000 may include substantial amounts for

                             M-6

compliance with both Phase I and Phase II of the CAAA.  The subsidiaries
are estimating amounts of approximately $1.4 billion, which includes
$482 million expended through 1993, depending upon the strategy
eventually selected for complying with Phase II.  The mere possibility
of new legislation which restricts or discourages carbon dioxide
emissions, either through taxation or caps, further complicates the CAAA
Phase II planning process.  The remaining amount of this CAAA
construction estimate, together with normal construction activity
assures that continuing external financings will be required.  In
addition, the subsidiaries have additional capital requirements of an
annual preferred stock sinking fund ($1.2 million) and debt maturities
(see Note G to the consolidated financial statements).


INTERNAL CASH FLOWS

Internal generation of cash, consisting of cash flows from  operations
reduced by dividends, increased to $270 million in 1993. Regulatory
commission orders received in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West
Virginia provide for current cash recovery of the carrying costs of CAAA
expenditures in rates, albeit with various amounts of lag. Based upon
the authorizations received and requested and new rate cases planned in
1994, internal generation of cash can be expected to increase.

The increase in other investments reflects the 1993 cash surrender
values for secured benefit plans and a related prepayment. Materials and
supplies, primarily fuel, constituted a significant source of cash in
1993 ($54 million). The five-year National Bituminous Coal Wage
Agreement terminated on February 1, 1993. Coal inventories (fuel) as of
December 31, 1992, were increased over 1991 amounts to provide an
increased coal supply in the event of a strike. The union chose a
strategy of selective shutdowns including mines that accounted for
approximately 60% of the subsidiaries' regular coal supply. The union
signed a new five-year contract in December 1993. System coal inventory,
which declined during the dispute, and which is somewhat lower than the
seasonal norm, is considered adequate.


FINANCINGS

In October 1993, the Company issued 2,400,000 shares of its common stock
for $64.1 million. Also during 1993, the Company issued 1,364,846 shares
of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
(DRISP), and Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan (ESOP) for $36.1
million. During 1993 the subsidiaries issued $43 million of 6.25% to
6.3% tax-exempt solid waste disposal notes to Harrison County, West
Virginia, and refunded an aggregate of $634 million of debt securities
having interest rates of 7% to 9.75% through the issuance of $652
million of securities having interest rates of 4.95% to 7.75%. The costs

                             M-7

associated with the debt redemptions are being amortized over the life
of the new bonds. Due to the significant number of refinancings which
have occurred over the past two years, this balance is now about $44
million. Reduced future interest expense will more than offset these
expenses.

Short-term debt is used to meet temporary cash needs until the timing is
considered appropriate to issue long-term securities. Short-term debt
increased from $11.2 million in 1992 to $130.6 million in 1993. The
subsidiaries canceled or postponed approximately $152 million of debt
and equity financings in 1993 due to favorable short-term alternatives.
In 1992, the Company and its subsidiaries established an internal money
pool whereby surplus funds of the Company and certain subsidiaries may
be borrowed on a short-term basis by the Company's subsidiaries. This
has contributed to the decrease in the 1993 temporary cash investment
amounts. Allegheny Generating Company in 1992 replaced its $65.7 million
of commercial paper with $50.9 million of money pool borrowings and $2.4
million of four-year, 6.05%-6.10% medium-term notes. Allegheny
Generating Company has available an established program to replace money
pool borrowings with medium-term notes or commercial paper.

At December 31, 1993, unused lines of credit with banks were $149
million. In addition, a multi-year credit program was established in
January 1994, which provides that the subsidiaries may borrow on a
standby revolving credit basis up to $300 million. After the initial
three-year term, the program agreement provides that the maturity date
may be extended in one-year increments. The borrowings have the support
of a long-term credit facility. During 1994, the subsidiaries plan to
issue about $230 million of new securities, consisting of both debt and
equity issues and, if economic and market conditions make it desirable,
may refinance up to $728 million of first mortgage bonds, preferred
stock, and pollution control revenue notes. The subsidiaries may also
engage in additional Harrison County tax-exempt solid waste disposal
financings to the extent that funds are available. The Company plans to
fund the subsidiaries' sale of common stock through the issuance of
short-term debt and DRISP/ESOP common stock sales.

The subsidiaries anticipate that they will be able to meet their future
cash needs through internal cash generation and external financings as
they have in the past and possibly through alternative financing
procedures.


                            M-8

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the subsidiaries are subject to
various contingencies and uncertainties relating to their operations and
construction programs, including cost recovery in the regulatory
process, laws, regulations and uncertainties related to environmental
matters, and legal actions. Contingencies and uncertainties related to
the CAAA are discussed above and under Note I to the consolidated
financial statements. 

All of the state jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate have
enacted hazardous and solid waste management legislation. While the
subsidiaries do not have significant hazardous waste concerns, solid
wastes, such as fly ash and other coal by-products generated from power
stations, must be disposed in accordance with the state requirements.
The subsidiaries are incurring various costs, which are recoverable in
rates, to comply with these and other environmental matters. The level
of future expenditures for environmental matters is impossible to
determine with any degree of certainty. It is management's opinion that
the ultimate costs will not have a material effect on the financial
position of the subsidiaries.

As of January 1994, Monongahela has been named as a defendant along with
multiple other defendants in 1,429 pending asbestos cases involving
multiple plaintiffs and Monongahela, Potomac Edison, and West Penn have
been named as defendants along with multiple defendants in an additional
626 cases by multiple plaintiffs.  Because these cases are filed by
"shotgun" complaints naming many plaintiffs and many defendants, it is
presently impossible to determine the actual number of claims against
the subsidiaries.  However, based on past experience and data available
to date, it is estimated that less than 600 cases actually involve
claims against any or all of the subsidiaries.  All complaints allege
that the plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting from
claimed exposure to asbestos in various generating plants and other
industrial facilities operated by the various defendants, although all
plaintiffs do not claim exposure at facilities operated by all
defendants.  All plaintiffs claiming exposure at subsidiary-operated
stations were employed by third-party contractors, with the exception of
three who claim to have been employees of Monongahela.  Each plaintiff
generally seeks compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants
in amounts of up to $1 million and $3 million, respectively; in those
cases that include a spousal claim for loss of consortium, damages are
generally sought against all defendants in an amount of up to $1 million
for the loss of consortium claim.  Therefore, because of the multiple
defendants, the subsidiaries believe potential liability of the
subsidiaries is a very small percentage of the total amount of the
damages sought.  A total of 94 cases have been previously settled by
Monongahela for an amount substantially less than the anticipated cost
of defense.  While the subsidiaries believe that all of these cases are
without merit, they cannot predict the outcome of these cases or whether
other cases will be filed.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Income
 Net income was $61.7 million, $58.3 million, and $54.1
million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. The increase
in net income in 1993 resulted primarily from kWh sales
and retail rate increases. The increase in 1992 resulted
primarily from retail rate increases. These revenue
increases, in both years, were offset in part by
higher expenses.


Sales and Revenues
 KWh sales to and revenues from residential, commercial,
and industrial customers are shown on pages D-3 and D-4
Such kWh sales increased .3% in 1993 and decreased 1.0%
in 1992. The increases in revenues from sales to residential,
commercial, and industrial customers resulted from the
following:

                                          Increase (Decrease)

                                            $24.8    $19.4


(a)  Changes in revenues from fuel and energy cost adjustment
  clauses have little effect on net income.

(b)  Reflects a surcharge in West Virginia for recovery of carrying
  charges on expenditures to comply with the Clean Air Act
  Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), designed to produce $3.1 million on
  an annual basis effective on July 1, 1992, which was increased to
  $8.7 million on an annual basis effective on July 1, 1993, and a rate
  increase in Ohio, designed to produce $3.3 million on an annual
  basis, which became effective on July 21, 1992.


 The increased kWh sales to residential and commercial
customers in 1993 reflect both growth in number of
customers and higher use. While 1993 heating degree days
showed only a slight increase over 1992, and were only 6%
above normal, cooling degree days increased 54% over
1992, contributing to the 1993 kWh sales increases. The
Company experienced a mild winter in the first quarter of
1992 followed by a much cooler than normal summer and
early fall. As a result, weather had a negative impact on
1992 sales to retail customers.

                             M-10


 KWh sales to industrial customers decreased 4.4% in
1993 and .7% in 1992. The 1993 decrease was primarily
due to continuing declines in sales to coal and primary
metals customers. Coal mines staffed by union personnel,
recorded reduced usage because of selective work
stoppages by the United Mine Workers of America
(UMWA) for most of the year prior to the settling of the
dispute in December 1993. Lower sales to primary metals
customers was due in part to one iron and steel customer's
increased use of its own generation.

 KWh sales to and revenues from nonaffiliated utilities
are comprised of the following items:

                                            1993    1992    1991
KWh sales (in billions):
 From Company generation                      .3     1.0     1.8
 From purchased power                        2.8     3.6     3.1
                                             3.1     4.6     4.9

Revenues (in millions):
 From Company generation                     $ 8.4  $ 26.7   $ 48.5
 From sales of purchased power                77.6    92.9     91.5
                                             $86.0  $119.6   $140.0

  Decreased sales to nonaffiliated utilities resulted
primarily from decreased demand and continuing price
competition. Sales supplied by the Company's generation
in 1993 decreased to less than 15% of 1988 levels because
of growth of kWh sales to retail customers, which reduces
the amount available for sale, and because other suppliers
were willing or able to make the sales at lower prices. A
significant factor affecting the Company's ability to
compete in the market for sales to nonaffiliated utilities
has been the approximate 290% increase (from about 67 cents
per MWh to $2.60 per MWH) in taxes on generation in
West Virginia since March 1989 - a significant cost not
experienced by utilities  not generating in West Virginia.
Further decreases in these sales are anticipated in 1994
before leveling off.

 The increase in other revenues in 1993 and 1992
resulted from continued increases in sales of capacity,
energy, and spinning reserve to other affiliated companies
because of additional capacity and energy available from
new PURPA projects in both years. This increase was
offset in part in 1993 by an agreement with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to record in 1993 about
$3 million of revenues as sales to nonaffiliated utilities.
Similar transactions were recorded as other revenues in
prior years. About 90% of the aggregate benefits from
sales to affiliated and nonaffiliated utilities is passed on to
retail customers and has little effect on net income.

                             M-11

Operating Expenses

  Fuel expenses decreased 3% in 1993 and 9% in 1992.
Both decreases were primarily due to decreases in kWh
generated. Fuel expenses are primarily subject to deferred
power cost accounting procedures, as described in Note A
to the financial statements, with the result that changes in
fuel expenses have little effect on net income.

  "Purchased power and exchanges, net" represents
power purchases from and exchanges with nonaffiliated
utilities and qualified facilities under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), capacity
charges paid to AGC, and other transactions with
affiliates made pursuant to a power supply agreement
whereby each company uses the most economical
generation available in the System at any given time, and
is comprised of the following items:

                                       1993     1992       1991

  The amount of power purchased from nonaffiliated
utilities for use by the Company and for resale to
nonaffiliated utilities depends upon the availability of the
Company's generating equipment, transmission capacity,
and fuel, and its cost of generation and the cost of
operations of nonaffiliated utilities from which such
purchases are made. The primary reason for the
fluctuations in purchases for resale to nonaffiliated
utilities is described under Sales and Revenues above. The
cost of power and capacity purchased for use by the
Company, including power from PURPA generation and
affiliated transactions, is mostly recovered from
customers currently through the regular fuel and energy
cost recovery procedures followed by the Company's
regulatory commissions and is primarily subject to
deferred power cost procedures with the result that
changes in such costs have little effect on net income. The
increases in purchases from PURPA generation reflects
additional generation from new PURPA projects. The
1993 increase in other purchased power reflects efforts to
conserve coal during the UMWA dispute. Energy and
spinning reserve charges decreased in 1993 and 1992
primarily because of additional generation available from
new PURPA projects.

                            M-12

 The increase in other operation expense for 1993 and
1992 resulted primarily from increases in salaries and
wages and employee benefit costs. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) standard, SFAS
No. 106, will increase future employee benefit costs for
postretirement benefit expenses. The Company is
currently recovering approximately 50% of SFAS No.
106 expenses in rates and will be requesting recovery of
the remainder in 1994 and early 1995 rate cases. This
reflects for West Virginia and Ohio only the recovery of
the previously authorized pay-as-you-go component.
During 1992, the Company implemented significant
changes to its benefits plans, including cost caps, in an
effort to both control and reduce employee benefits costs.
The cost caps provide for future postretirement medical
benefit costs to be capped at two times 1993 levels.
Because 1993 medical costs were more than actuarially
projected, SFAS No. 106 costs for 1994 are expected to be
approximately 25% greater than 1993 amounts.

 Another FASB standard, SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", effective in
1994, requires companies to accrue for other post-
employment benefits such as disability benefits, health
care benefits for disabled employees, severance pay, and
workers' compensation claims. The Company currently
accrues for workers' compensation claims and the
estimated liability for the other benefits is not expected to
be material.

 Maintenance expenses represent costs incurred to
maintain the power stations, the transmission and
distribution (T&D) system, and general plant, and reflect
routine maintenance of equipment and rights-of-way as
well as planned major repairs and unplanned expenditures,
primarily from forced outages at the power stations and
periodic storm damage on the T&D system. The Company
is also experiencing, and expects to continue to
experience, increased expenditures due to the aging of its
power stations. Variations in maintenance expense result
primarily from unplanned events and planned major
projects, which vary in timing and magnitude depending
upon the length of time equipment has been in service
without a major overhaul, the amount of work found
necessary when the equipment is dismantled, and outage
requirements to comply with the CAAA.

                             M-13

  Depreciation expense increases resulted primarily from
additions to electric plant. Because of the increased levels
of capital expenditures as a result of the CAAA (see Note
J to the financial statements) and the replacement of
aging equipment at the Company's power stations,
depreciation expense is expected to increase significantly
over the next few years.

 Taxes other than income increased $1 million in 1993
primarily due to increases in gross receipts taxes resulting
from higher revenues from retail customers ($1 million)
and increased property taxes ($1 million), offset by
decreased West Virginia Business and Occupation taxes
(B&O taxes) ($1 million) due to decreased generation in
that state. The 1992 decrease resulted from decreased
B&O taxes ($2 million) and prior period B&O tax
adjustments ($2 million), offset somewhat by increases in
gross receipts and property taxes ($2 million).

 The net increase of $6 million in federal and state
income taxes in 1993 resulted primarily from an increase
in income before taxes ($4 million), and an increase in the
tax rate due to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993
($1 million). The net decrease in 1992 of $3 million
resulted primarily from plant removal and certain bond
refinancing cost tax deductions for which deferred taxes
were not provided. Note B to the financial statements
provides a further analysis of income tax expenses.

 The combined increase of $2 million in allowances for
funds used during construction (AFUDC) in 1993 reflects
increased construction expenditures primarily associated
with the CAAA, net of CAAA amounts included in rate
base and earning a cash return. Future levels of AFUDC
can be expected to decrease as the Company completes its
Phase I compliance program. The decrease in other
income, net, in 1993 resulted primarily from the
Company's share of decreases in the earnings of AGC (see
Note D to the financial statements). Other fluctuations in
other income, net, were individually insignificant. Other
interest expense reflects changes in the level of short-term
debt maintained by the Company.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
 SEC regulations define "liquidity" as "the ability of an
enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet
the enterprise's need for cash". The Company needs cash
for operating expenses, the payment of interest and
dividends, retirement of debt, and for its construction
program. To meet these needs, the Company has used

                            M-14

internally generated funds and external financings, such
as the sale of common and preferred stock, debt instruments,
instalment loans, and lease arrangements. The timing and
amount of external financings depend primarily upon
economic and financial market conditions, the Company's
cash needs, and capitalization ratio objectives. The
availability and cost of external financing depend upon
the financial health of the companies seeking those funds.


Capital Requirements
 Construction expenditures for 1993 were $141 million
and for 1994 and 1995 are estimated at $103 million and
$83 million, respectively. These estimates include $39
million and $10 million, respectively, for substantial
completion of the program of complying with Phase I of
the CAAA. It is anticipated that the Harrison Scrubber
Project will be completed on schedule (late 1994) and that
the final cost will be approximately 24% below the
original budget. Primary factors contributing to the
reduced cost include: 1) the absence of any major
construction problems to date; 2) financing and material
and equipment costs lower than expected; and 3) favorable
rulings of state commissions allowing the inclusion of
carrying costs of construction in rates in lieu of AFUDC.
Construction expenditures through the year 2000 may
include substantial amounts for compliance with both
Phase I and Phase II of the CAAA. The Company is
estimating amounts of approximately $400 million, which
includes $122 million expended through 1993, depending
upon the strategy eventually selected for complying with
Phase II. The mere possibility of new legislation which
restricts or discourages carbon dioxide emissions, either
through taxation or caps, further complicates the CAAA
Phase II planning process. The remaining amount of this
CAAA construction estimate, together with normal
construction activity assures that continuing external
financings will be required. In addition, the Company has
additional capital requirements of debt maturities (see
Note H to the financial statements).


Internal Cash Flows
 Internal generation of cash, consisting of cash flows
from operations reduced by dividends, was about $69
million for 1993. A regulatory commission order has been
received in West Virginia authorizing procedures to
provide for current cash recovery of the carrying costs of
CAAA expenditures in rates, albeit with a certain amount
of lag. Based upon the authorization received and new
rate cases planned in 1994 and early 1995, internal
generation of cash can be expected to increase.

                            M-15

  Materials and supplies, primarily fuel, constituted a
significant source of cash in 1993 ($13 million). The five-
year National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement
terminated on February 1, 1993. Coal inventories (fuel) as
of December 31, 1992, were increased over 1991 amounts
to provide an increased coal supply in the event of a strike.
The union chose a strategy of selective shutdowns
including mines that accounted for approximately 60% of
the System's regular coal supply. The union signed a new
five-year contract in December 1993. System coal
inventory, which declined during the dispute, and which
is somewhat lower than the seasonal norm, is considered
adequate.

Financings
 During 1993 the Company issued $10.68 million of
6.25% tax-exempt solid waste disposal notes to Harrison
County, West Virginia, and refunded an aggregate of $67
million of debt securities having interest rates of 7.5% to
9.5% through the issuance of $72 million of securities
having interest rates of 5.625% to 5.95%. The costs
associated with the debt redemptions are being amortized
over the life of the new bonds. Due to the significant
number of refinancings which have occurred over the past
two years, this balance is now about $12 million. Reduced
future interest expense will more than offset these
expenses.

 Short-term debt is used to meet temporary cash needs
until the timing is considered appropriate to issue long-
term securities. Short-term debt, including notes payable
to affiliates under the money pool, increased from $8.0
million in 1992 to $63.1 million in 1993. The Company
canceled or postponed approximately $69 million of debt
and equity financings in 1993 due to favorable short-term
alternatives. In 1992, the Company and its affiliates
established an internal money pool as a facility to
accommodate intercompany short-term borrowing
needs, to the extent that certain of the companies have
funds available.

 At December 31, 1993, the Company had SEC
authorization to issue up to $100 million of short-term
debt. In addition, a multi-year credit program was
established in January 1994, which provides that the
Company may borrow on a standby revolving credit basis
up to $81 million. After the initial three-year term, the
program agreement provides that the maturity date may
be extended in one-year increments. The borrowings have
the support of a long-term credit facility. During 1994, the
Company plans to issue about $50 million of new equity
securities and, if economic and market conditions make it
desirable, may refinance up to $285 million of first

                            M-16

mortgage bonds, preferred stock, and pollution control
revenue notes. The Company may also engage in
additional Harrison County tax-exempt solid waste
disposal financings to the extent that funds are available.

 The Company anticipates that it will be able to meet its
future cash needs through internal cash generation and
external financings as it has in the past and possibly
through alternative financing procedures.


Environmental Matters and
Other Contingencies
 In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to various contingencies and uncertainties
relating to its operations and construction programs,
including cost recovery in the regulatory process, laws,
regulations and uncertainties related to environmental
matters, and legal actions. Contingencies and
uncertainties related to the CAAA are discussed above
and under Note J to the financial statements.

 All of the state jurisdictions in which the Company
operates have enacted hazardous and solid waste
management legislation. While the Company does not
have significant hazardous waste concerns, solid wastes,
such as fly ash and other coal by-products generated from
power stations, must be disposed in accordance with the
state requirements. The Company is incurring various
costs, which are recoverable in rates, to comply with these
and other environmental matters. The level of future
expenditures for environmental matters is impossible to
determine with any degree of certainty. It is management's
opinion that the ultimate costs will not have a material
effect on the financial position of the Company.

 As of January 1994, the Company has been named as a
defendant along with multiple other defendants in 1,429
pending asbestos cases involving multiple plaintiffs and
the Company and its affiliates have been named as
defendants along with multiple defendants in an
additional 626 cases by multiple plaintiffs. Because these
cases are filed by "shotgun" complaints naming many
plaintiffs and many defendants, it is presently impossible
to determine the actual number of claims against the
Company and its affiliates. However, based on past
experience and data available to date, it is estimated that
less than 600 cases actually involve claims against the

                            M-17

Company or its affiliates. All complaints allege that the
plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting from
claimed exposure to asbestos in various generating plants
and other industrial facilities operated by the various
defendants, although all plaintiffs do not claim exposure
at facilities operated by all defendants. All plaintiffs
claiming exposure at System-operated stations were
employed by third-party contractors, with the exception
of three who claim to have been employees of the
Company. Each plaintiff generally seeks compensatory
and punitive damages against all defendants in amounts
of up to $1 million and $3 million, respectively; in those
cases that include a spousal claim for loss of consortium,
damages are generally sought against all defendants in an
amount of up to $1 million for the loss of consortium
claim. Therefore, because of the multiple defendants, the
Company believes its potential liability is a very small
percentage of the total amount of the damages sought. A
total of 94 cases have been previously settled by the
Company for an amount substantially less than the
anticipated cost of defense. While the Company believes
that all of these cases are without merit, it cannot predict
the outcome of these cases or whether other cases will
be filed.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Net Income

 Net income was $73.5 million, $67.5 million, and $58.2
million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. The increase
in net income in 1993 resulted primarily from kWh sales
and retail rate increases. The increase in 1992 resulted
primarily from retail rate increases. These revenue
increases, in both years, were offset in part by higher
expenses.

Sales and Revenues

 KWh sales to and revenues from residential,
commercial, and industrial customers are shown on pages
D-5 and D-6. Such kWh sales increased 6.3% and 2.0% in
1993 and 1992, respectively. The increases in revenues
from sales to residential, commercial, and industrial
customers resulted from the following:

                                            Increase from Prior Year
                                                  1993    1992
                                             (Millions of Dollars)
Increased kWh sales                              $24.4   $ 7.7
Fuel and energy cost
 adjustment clauses (a)                           19.1    10.4
Rate increases (b):
 Maryland                                         12.7    11.7
 Virginia                                          2.5     1.8
 West Virginia                                     1.1      .3
                                                  16.3    13.8
Other                                              2.9      .2
                                                 $62.7   $32.1

(a)  Changes in revenues from fuel and energy cost adjustment
  clauses have little effect on net income.

(b)  Reflects a rate increase in Maryland, designed to produce $11.3
  million on an annual basis, which became effective on
  February 25, 1993, and a rate increase in Virginia, designed to
  produce $10.0 million on an annual basis, which became
  effective on September 28, 1993, subject to refund. The
  Maryland surcharge for recovery of carrying charges on Clean
  Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) compliance investment 
  of $1.7 million effective on June 4, 1992, which was increased
  to $3.9 million effective on December 3, 1992, was rolled into base
  rates effective with the February 1993 increase. Rate increases
  also include a CAAA surcharge in West Virginia designed to
  produce $.8 million on an annual basis effective July 1, 1992,
  which was increased to $2.2 million on an annual basis effective
  July 1, 1993.


 The increased kWh sales to residential and commercial
customers in 1993 reflect both higher use and growth in
number of customers. While 1993 heating degree days
showed only a slight increase over 1992, and were only 7%

                               M-19

above normal, cooling degree days increased 82% over
1992 and were 12% over normal, contributing to the 1993
kWh sales increases. The Company experienced a normal
winter in the first quarter of 1992 followed by a much
cooler than normal summer and early fall. As a result,
weather had a negative impact on 1992 sales to retail
customers.

 KWh sales to industrial customers increased 4.3% in
1993 and 2.0% in 1992. The increase in both years
occurred in almost all industrial groups, the most
significant of which in 1993 was from sales to cement
customers.

 KWh sales to and revenues from nonaffiliated utilities
are comprised of the following items:

                                          1993    1992    1991
KWh sales (in billions):
 From Company generation                    .4     1.0     1.8
 From purchased power                      3.5     4.4     3.8
                                           3.9     5.4     5.6
Revenues (in millions):
 From Company generation                  $8.6   $27.5   $47.4
 From sales of purchased power            99.5   113.6   114.3
                                        $108.1  $141.1  $161.7


 Decreased sales to nonaffiliated utilities resulted
primarily from decreased demand and continuing price
competition. Sales supplied by the Company's generation
in 1993 decreased to less than 15% of 1988 levels because
of continuing growth of kWh sales to retail customers,
which reduces the amount available for sale, and because
other suppliers were willing or able to make the sales at
lower prices. A significant factor affecting the Company's
ability to compete in the market for sales to nonaffiliated
utilities has been the approximate 290% increase (from
about 67cents per MWh to $2.60 per MWh) in taxes on
generation in West Virginia since March 1989 - a
significant cost not experienced by utilities not generating
in West Virginia. Further decreases in these sales are
anticipated in 1994 before leveling off. About 95% of the
aggregate benefits from sales to nonaffiliated utilities is
passed on to retail customers and has little effect on net
income.

 The decrease in other revenues in 1993 resulted from
an agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to record in 1993 about $4 million of
revenues as sales to nonaffiliated utilities. Similar
transactions were recorded as other revenues in prior
years.

                            M-20

Operating Expenses
 Fuel expenses decreased 4% in 1993 and 6% in 1992.
Both decreases were primarily due to decreases in kWh
generated. The 1992 decrease also included a 1%
decrease in average coal prices. Fuel expenses are
primarily subject to deferred power cost accounting
procedures, as described in Note A to the financial
statements, with the result that changes in fuel expenses
have little effect on net income.

 "Purchased power and exchanges, net" represents
power purchases from and exchanges with nonaffiliated
utilities, capacity charges paid to AGC, and other
transactions with affiliates made pursuant to a power
supply agreement whereby each company uses the most
economical generation available in the System at any
given time, and is comprised of the following items:



                                          1993     1992      1991
                                           (Millions of Dollars)
Nonaffiliated transactions:
 Purchased power:
  For resale to other utilities           $87.9    $104.6    $103.7
  Other                                    10.5       3.7       8.9
 Power exchanges, net                       (.8)       .2       (.4)
Affiliated transactions:
 AGC capacity charges                      28.0      29.6      31.3
 Other affiliated capacity charges         28.4      21.9      23.4
 Energy and spinning
  reserve charges                          51.1      41.2      37.6
                                         $205.1    $201.2    $204.5

 The amount of power purchased from nonaffiliated
utilities for use by the Company and for resale to
nonaffiliated utilities depends upon the availability of the
Company's generating equipment, transmission capacity,
and fuel, and its cost of generation and the cost of
operations of nonaffiliated utilities from which such
purchases are made. The primary reason for the
fluctuations in purchases for resale to nonaffiliated
utilities is described under Sales and Revenues above. The
cost of power purchased from nonaffiliates for use by the
Company and affiliated energy and spinning reserve
charges are mostly recovered from customers currently
through the regular fuel and energy cost recovery
procedures followed by the Company's regulatory
commissions and is primarily subject to deferred power
cost procedures with the result that changes in such costs
have little effect on net income. The 1993 increase in other
purchased power reflects efforts to conserve coal because
of selective work stoppages by the United Mine Workers
of America for most of the year.

                            M-21

 While the Company does not currently purchase
generation from qualified facilities under the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), several
projects have been proposed, and an agreement has been
reached with one facility to commence purchasing
generation in 1999. This project and others may
significantly increase the cost of power purchases passed
on to customers. The increase in affiliated capacity and
energy and spinning reserve charges in 1993 was due to
growth of kWh sales to retail customers and an increase in
affiliated energy available because of energy purchased by
an affiliate from new PURPA projects in 1992 and 1993.

 The increase in other operation expense for 1993 and
1992 resulted primarily from increases in employee
benefit costs and salaries and wages. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) standard, SFAS
No. 106, increased 1993 postretirement benefit expense
by approximately $1.5 million. The Company is currently
recovering approximately 90% of SFAS No. 106 expenses
in rates and will be requesting recovery of the remainder
in 1994 rate cases. During 1992, the Company
implemented significant changes to its benefits plans,
including cost caps, in an effort to both control and
reduce employee benefits costs. The cost caps provide for
future postretirement medical benefit costs to be capped
at two times 1993 levels. Because 1993 medical costs were
more than actuarially projected, SFAS No. 106 costs for
1994 are expected to be approximately 25% greater than
1993 amounts.

 Another FASB standard, SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", effective in
1994, requires companies to accrue for other post-
employment benefits such as disability benefits, health
care benefits for disabled employees, severance pay, and
workers' compensation claims. The Company currently
accrues for workers' compensation claims and the
estimated liability for the other benefits is not expected to
be material.

 Maintenance expenses represent costs incurred to
maintain the power stations, the transmission and
distribution (T&D) system, and general plant, and reflect
routine maintenance of equipment and rights-of-way as
well as planned major repairs and unplanned
expenditures, primarily from forced outages at the power
stations and periodic storm damage on the T&D system.

                            M-22

The Company is also experiencing, and expects to
continue to experience, increased expenditures due to the
aging of its power stations. Variations in maintenance
expense result primarily from unplanned events and
planned major projects, which vary in timing and
magnitude depending upon the length of time equipment
has been in service without a major overhaul, the amount
of work found necessary when the equipment is
dismantled, and outage requirements to comply with
the CAAA.

 Depreciation expense increases resulted primarily from
additions to electric plant. Because of the increased levels
of capital expenditures as a result of the CAAA (see Note
J to the financial statements) and the replacement of
aging equipment at the Company's power stations,
depreciation expense is expected to increase significantly
over the next few years.

 Taxes other than income increased $1 million in 1993
due to increases in gross receipts taxes resulting from
higher revenues from retail customers ($1 million) and
increased property taxes ($1 million), offset by decreased
West Virginia Business and Occupation taxes due to
decreased generation in that state ($1 million). The 1992
increase was due to increased property ($1 million) and
gross receipts ($1 million) taxes.

 The net increase of $2 million in federal and state
income taxes in 1993 resulted primarily from an increase
in income before taxes ($3 million) and an increase in the
tax rate due to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993
($1 million), offset by plant removal tax deductions for
which deferred taxes were not provided ($1 million). The
net increase in 1992 was primarily due to an increase in
income before taxes. Note B to the financial statements
provides a further analysis of income tax expenses.

 The combined increase of $2 million in allowances for
funds used during construction (AFUDC) in 1993 reflects
increased construction expenditures including those
associated with the CAAA, net of CAAA amounts
included in rate base and earning a cash return. Future
levels of AFUDC can be expected to increase slightly with
increasing levels of CAAA expenditures until late 1994
upon substantial completion of Phase I of the CAAA
compliance program. The decrease in other income, net in
1993 resulted primarily from the Company's share of
decreases in the earnings of AGC (see Note D to the
financial statements). Other fluctuations in other income,
net, were individually insignificant. Other interest expense
reflects changes in the level of short-term debt maintained
by the Company.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
 SEC regulations define "liquidity" as "the ability of an
enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet
the enterprise's need for cash". The Company needs cash
for operating expenses, the payment of interest and
dividends, retirement of debt and certain preferred stock,

                             M-23

and for its construction program. To meet these needs,
the Company has used internally generated funds and
external financings, such as the sale of common and
preferred stock, debt instruments, instalment loans, and
lease arrangements. The timing and amount of external
financings depend primarily upon economic and financial
market conditions, the Company's cash needs, and
capitalization ratio objectives. The availability and cost
of external financing depend upon the financial health of
the companies seeking those funds.

 During 1993, the Company continued its participation
in the Collaborative Process for Demand-Side
Management in Maryland with the Maryland PSC Staff,
Office of People's Counsel, the Department of Natural
Resources, Maryland Energy Administration, and the
Company's largest industrial customer. The Company
received the Maryland PSC's approval to implement a
Commercial and Industrial Lighting Rebate Program as
of July 1, 1993. Through December 31, 1993, the
Company had received applications for $7.5 million in
rebates related to the commercial lighting program.
Program costs, including rebates and lost revenues, are
deferred and are to be recovered through an energy
conservation surcharge over a five-year period.


Capital Requirements
 Construction expenditures for 1993 were $179 million
and for 1994 and 1995 are estimated at $136 million and
$106 million, respectively. These estimates include $40
million and $10 million, respectively, for substantial
completion of the program of complying with Phase I of
the CAAA. It is anticipated that the Harrison Scrubber
Project will be completed on schedule (late 1994) and that
the final cost will be approximately 24% below the
original budget. Primary factors contributing to the
reduced cost include: 1) the absence of any major
construction problems to date; 2) financing and material
and equipment costs lower than expected; and 3) favorable
rulings of state commissions allowing the inclusion of
carrying costs of construction in rates in lieu of AFUDC.
Construction expenditures through the year 2000 may
include substantial amounts for compliance with both
Phase I and Phase II of the CAAA. The Company is
estimating amounts of approximately $350 million, which
includes $153 million expended through 1993, depending
upon the strategy eventually selected for complying with
Phase II. The mere possibility of new legislation which
restricts or discourages carbon dioxide emissions, either
through taxation or caps, further complicates the CAAA
Phase II planning process. The remaining amount of this
CAAA construction estimate, together with normal
construction activity assures that continuing external
financings will be required. In addition, the Company has

                            M-24

additional annual capital requirements of an annual
preferred stock sinking fund ($1.2 million) and debt
maturities (see Note H to the financial statements).

Internal Cash Flows
 Internal generation of cash, consisting of cash flows
from operations reduced by dividends, increased to $75
million in 1993. Regulatory commission orders received
in all of the state jurisdictions and the FERC provide for
current cash recovery of the carrying costs of CAAA
expenditures in rates, albeit with various amounts of lag.
Based upon the authorizations received and new rate
cases planned in 1994, internal generation of cash can be
expected to increase.

 Materials and supplies, primarily fuel, constituted a
significant source of cash in 1993 ($14 million). The
five-year National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement
terminated on February 1, 1993. Coal inventories (fuel) as
of December 31, 1992, were increased over 1991 amounts
to provide an increased coal supply in the event of a strike.
The union chose a strategy of selective shutdowns
including mines that accounted for approximately 60% of
the System's regular coal supply. The union signed a new
five-year contract in December 1993. System coal
inventory, which declined during the dispute, and which
is somewhat lower than the seasonal norm, is considered
adequate.


Financings
 During 1993 the Company issued $13.99 million of
6.25% tax-exempt solid waste disposal notes to Harrison
County, West Virginia, and refunded an aggregate of
$121 million of debt securities having interest rates of 7%
to 9.5% through the issuance of $129 million of securities
having interest rates of 5.875% to 7.75%. The costs
associated with the debt redemptions are being amortized
over the life of the new bonds. Due to the significant
number of refinancings which have occurred over the past
two years, this balance is now about $9 million. Reduced
future interest expense will more than offset these
expenses.

 Short-term debt is used to meet temporary cash needs
until the timing is considered appropriate to issue long-
term securities. The Company canceled or postponed
approximately $36 million of debt financings in 1993 due
to favorable short-term alternatives. In 1992, the
Company and its affiliates established an internal money
pool as a facility to accommodate intercompany short-
term borrowing needs, to the extent that certain of the
companies have funds available.


                         M-25

 At December 31, 1993, the Company had SEC
authorization to issue up to $115 million of short-term
debt. In addition, a multi-year credit program was
established in January 1994, which provides that the
Company may borrow on a standby revolving credit basis
up to $84 million. After the initial three-year term, the
program agreement provides that the maturity date may
be extended in one-year increments. The borrowings have
the support of a long-term credit facility. During 1994, the
Company plans to issue about $75 million of new debt
securities and, if economic and market conditions make it
desirable, may refinance up to $231 million of first
mortgage bonds, preferred stock, and pollution control
revenue notes. The Company may also engage in
additional Harrison County tax-exempt solid waste
disposal financings to the extent that funds are available.

 The Company anticipates that it will be able to meet its
future cash needs through internal cash generation and
external financings as it has in the past and possibly
through alternative financing procedures.



Environmental Matters and
Other Contingencies
 In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to various contingencies and uncertainties relating
to its operations and construction programs, including
cost recovery in the regulatory process, laws, regulations
and uncertainties related to environmental matters, and
legal actions. Contingencies and uncertainties related to
the CAAA are discussed above and under Note J to the
financial statements.

 All of the state jurisdictions in which the Company
operates have enacted hazardous and solid waste
management legislation. While the Company does not
have significant hazardous waste concerns, solid wastes,
such as fly ash and other coal by-products generated from
power stations, must be disposed in accordance with the
state requirements. The Company is incurring various
costs, which are recoverable in rates, to comply with these
and other environmental matters. The level of future
expenditures for environmental matters is impossible to
determine with any degree of certainty. It is management's
opinion that the ultimate costs will not have a material
effect on the financial position of the Company.


                            M-26

 As of January 1994, Monongahela Power Company
(MP), an affiliated company, has been named as a
defendant along with multiple other defendants in 1,429
pending asbestos cases involving multiple plaintiffs and
the Company and its affiliates have been named as
defendants along with multiple defendants in an
additional 626 cases by multiple plaintiffs. Because these
cases are filed by "shotgun" complaints naming many
plaintiffs and many defendants, it is presently impossible
to determine the actual number of claims against the
Company and its affiliates. However, based on past
experience and data available to date, it is estimated that
less than 600 cases actually involve claims against the
Company or its affiliates. All complaints allege that the
plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting from
claimed exposure to asbestos in various generating plants
and other industrial facilities operated by the various
defendants, although all plaintiffs do not claim exposure
at facilities operated by all defendants. All plaintiffs
claiming exposure at System-operated stations were
employed by third-party contractors, with the exception
of three who claim to have been employees of MP. The
Company is joint owner with MP in five generating
plants, including four operated by MP in West Virginia.
Each plaintiff generally seeks compensatory and punitive
damages against all defendants in amounts of up to $1
million and $3 million, respectively; in those cases that
include a spousal claim for loss of consortium, damages
are generally sought against all defendants in an amount
of up to $1 million for the loss of consortium claim.
Therefore, because of the multiple defendants, the
Company believes its potential liability is a very small
percentage of the total amount of the damages sought. A
total of 94 cases have been previously settled by MP for an
amount substantially less than the anticipated cost of
defense. While the Company believes that all of these
cases are without merit, it cannot predict the outcome of
these cases or whether other cases will be filed.



                                                              M-27

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Net Income

 Consolidated net income was $102.1 million, $98.2
million, and $101.2 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively. The increase in consolidated net income in
1993 resulted primarily from kWh sales and retail rate
increases, offset in part by higher expenses. Higher retail
revenues in 1992 from a surcharge to recover increases in
various state taxes and greater kWh sales were more than
offset by higher expenses.


Sales and Revenues

 KWh sales to and revenues from residential, commercial,
and industrial customers are shown on pages D-7 and D-8.
Such kWh sales increased 3.1% and 2.7% in 1993 and
1992, respectively. The increases in revenues from sales to
residential, commercial, and industrial customers resulted
from the following:

                                                    Increase
                                                 from Prior Year

                                                 1993       1992
                                              (Millions of Dollars)

Increased kWh sales                              $15.5     $ 6.7
Fuel and energy cost
 adjustment clauses (a)                           26.2      15.2
Rate increases (b)                                25.2       5.8
Other                                              3.1       1.3

                                                 $70.0     $29.0

(a)  Changes in revenues from fuel and energy cost adjustment clauses
have little effect on consolidated net income.

(b)  Reflects a base rate increase on an annual basis of about $61.6
million in Pennsylvania effective May 18, 1993, including $26.1
million for recovery of carrying charges on Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) compliance costs, and in 1992 also
reflects a surcharge effective August 24, 1991, to recover
Pennsylvania tax increases.

 The increased kWh sales to residential and commercial
customers in 1993 reflect both growth in number of
customers and higher use. While 1993 heating degree days
remained about the same as 1992, and were only 6%
below normal, cooling degree days increased 70% over
1992 and were 46% over normal, contributing to the 1993
kWh sales increases. The Company experienced a mild
winter in the first quarter of 1992 followed by a much
cooler than normal summer and early fall. As a result,
weather had a negative impact on 1992 sales to retail
customers.


                          M-28

 KWh sales to industrial customers increased .8% in
1993 and 6.3% in 1992. The relatively flat industrial sales
growth in 1993 followed increases in industrial sales in
1992 which occurred in almost all industrial groups. One
particular group, coal mines staffed by union personnel,
recorded reduced usage  because of selective work
stoppages by the United Mine Workers of America
(UMWA) for most of the year prior to the settling of the
dispute in December 1993.

 KWh sales to and revenues from nonaffiliated utilities
are comprised of the following items:

                                            1993     1992    1991
KWh sales (in billions):
 From Company generation                      .4      1.3      2.3
 From purchased power                        5.0      6.5      5.4

                                             5.4      7.8      7.7

Revenues (in millions):
 From Company generation                   $11.5    $37.5    $62.5
 From sales of
  purchased power                          141.0    167.2    160.7

                                          $152.5    $204.7  $223.2


 Decreased sales to nonaffiliated utilities resulted
primarily from decreased demand and continuing price
competition. Sales supplied by the Company's generation
in 1993 decreased to less than 15% of 1988 levels because
of continuing growth of kWh sales to retail customers,
which reduces the amount available for sale, and because
other suppliers were willing or able to make the sales at
lower prices. A significant factor affecting the Company's
ability to compete in the market for sales to nonaffiliated
utilities has been the approximate 290% increase (from
about 67 cents per MWh to $2.60 per MWh) in taxes on
generation in West Virginia since March 1989 - a
significant cost not experienced by utilities not generating
in West Virginia. Further decreases in these sales are
anticipated in 1994 before leveling off.

 The decrease in other revenues in 1993 and 1992
resulted from continued decreases in sales of energy and
spinning reserve to an affiliated company because of
additional energy available to it from new PURPA
projects commencing in both years. The 1993 decrease
was also due in part to an agreement with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to record in 1993 about
$6 million of revenues as sales to nonaffiliated utilities.
Similar transactions were recorded as other revenues in
prior years. Most of the aggregate benefits from sales to
affiliated and nonaffiliated utilities is passed on to retail
customers and has little effect on consolidated net
income.

                           M-29
Operating Expenses

 Fuel expenses decreased 4% in each of the years of 1993
and 1992 primarily due to decreases in kWh generated.
Fuel expenses are primarily subject to deferred power
cost accounting procedures, as described in Note A to the
consolidated financial statements, with the result that
changes in fuel expenses have little effect on consolidated
net income.

 "Purchased power and exchanges, net" represents
power purchases from and exchanges with nonaffiliated
utilities and qualified facilities under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), capacity
charges paid to AGC, and other transactions with
affiliates made pursuant to a power supply agreement
whereby each company uses the most economical
generation available in the System at any given time, and
is comprised of the following items:

                                                  1993      1992     1991
                                                 (Millions of Dollars)
Nonaffiliated transactions:
 Purchased power:
  For resale to other
   utilities                                      $124.5    $153.9    $146.0

Affiliated transactions:

  reserve charges                                    4.7       3.5       3.8
 Other affiliated
  capacity charges                                    .7        .6        .6

                                                  $235.8    $264.2    $262.5

 The amount of power purchased from nonaffiliated
utilities for use by the Company and for resale to
nonaffiliated utilities depends upon the availability of the
Company's generating equipment, transmission capacity,
and fuel, and its cost of generation and the cost of
operations of nonaffiliated utilities from which such
purchases are made. The primary reason for the
fluctuations in purchases for resale to nonaffiliated
utilities is described under Sales and Revenues above. The
cost of power and capacity purchased for use by the
Company, including power from PURPA generation and
affiliated transactions, is mostly recovered from
customers currently through the regular fuel and energy
cost recovery procedures followed by the Company's
regulatory commissions and is primarily subject to
deferred power cost procedures with the result that
changes in such costs have little effect on consolidated net

                        M-30

income. The decrease in purchases from PURPA
generation in 1993 was due to a planned generating
outage at one PURPA project. The 1993 increase in other
purchased power reflects efforts to conserve coal during
the UMWA dispute.

 The increase in other operation expense for 1993 and
1992 resulted primarily from increases in salaries and
wages and in 1993 also from employee benefit costs. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB)
standard, SFAS No. 106, increased 1993 postretirement
benefit expense by approximately $3.1 million. The
Company is currently recovering all of SFAS No. 106
expenses in rates. During 1992, the Company
implemented significant changes to its benefits plans,
including cost caps, in an effort to both control and
reduce employee benefits costs. The cost caps provide for
future postretirement medical benefit costs to be capped
at two times 1993 levels. Because 1993 medical costs were
more than actuarially projected, SFAS No. 106 costs for
1994 are expected to be approximately 5% greater than
1993 amounts.

 Another FASB standard, SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", effective in
1994, requires companies to accrue for other post-
employment benefits such as disability benefits, health
care benefits for disabled employees, severance pay, and
workers' compensation claims. The Company currently
accrues for workers' compensation claims and the
estimated liability for the other benefits is not expected to
be material.

 Maintenance expenses represent costs incurred to maintain
the power stations, the transmission and distribution
(T&D) system, and general plant, and reflect routine
maintenance of equipment and rights-of-way as well as
planned major repairs and unplanned expenditures,
primarily from forced outages at the power stations and
periodic storm damage on the T&D system.  Maintenance
expense in 1993 includes the effects of an ice storm and
blizzard in March 1993. The Company is also
experiencing, and expects to continue to experience,
increased expenditures due to the aging of its power
stations. Variations in maintenance expense result
primarily from unplanned events and planned major
projects, which vary in timing and magnitude depending
upon the length of time equipment has been in service
without a major overhaul, the amount of work found
necessary when the equipment is dismantled, and outage
requirements to comply with the CAAA.

                           M-31

 Depreciation expense increases resulted primarily from
additions to electric plant and in 1993 also from a change
in depreciation rates and net salvage amortization as a
result of the May 1993 rate order. Because of the
increased levels of capital expenditures as a result of the
CAAA (see Note J to the consolidated financial
statements) and the replacement of aging equipment at
the Company's power stations, depreciation expense is
expected to increase significantly over the next few years.

 Taxes other than income increased $2 million in 1993
primarily due to increases in gross receipts taxes resulting
from higher revenues from retail customers ($3 million)
offset in part by decreased West Virginia Business and
Occupation taxes (B&O taxes) ($2 million) due to
decreased generation in that state. The 1992 increase
resulted from increased property and capital stock taxes
($4 million), increased B&O taxes ($1 million), and
increases in gross receipts taxes ($1 million).

 The net increase of $7 million in federal and state
income taxes in 1993 resulted primarily from an increase
in income before taxes ($6 million), and an increase in the
tax rate due to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993
($1 million). The net decrease in 1992 of $4 million
resulted primarily from a decrease in income before taxes.
Note B to the consolidated financial statements provides
a further analysis of income tax expenses.

 The combined increase of $.3 million in allowances for
funds used during construction (AFUDC) in 1993 reflects
increased construction expenditures including those
associated with the CAAA, net of CAAA amounts
included in rate base and earning a cash return. Future
levels of AFUDC can be expected to increase slightly with
increasing levels of CAAA expenditures until late 1994
upon substantial completion of Phase I of the CAAA
compliance program. The decrease in other income, net,
in 1993 resulted primarily from the Company's share of
decreases in the earnings of AGC (see Note D to the
consolidated financial statements). Other fluctuations in
other income, net, were individually insignificant. Other
interest expense reflects changes in the level of short-term
debt maintained by the Company.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
 SEC regulations define "liquidity" as "the ability of an
enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet
the enterprise's need for cash". The Company needs cash
for operating expenses, the payment of interest and
dividends, retirement of debt, and for its construction
program. To meet these needs, the Company has used
internally generated funds and external financings, such

                             M-32

as the sale of common and preferred stock, debt
instruments, instalment loans, and lease arrangements.
The timing and amount of external financings depend
primarily upon economic and financial market conditions,
the Company's cash needs, and capitalization ratio
objectives. The availability and cost of external financing
depend upon the financial health of the companies
seeking those funds.


Capital Requirements
 Construction expenditures for 1993 were $251 million
and for 1994 and 1995 are estimated at $258 million and
$208 million, respectively. These estimates include $82
million and $33 million, respectively, for substantial
completion of the program of complying with Phase I of
the CAAA. It is anticipated that the Harrison Scrubber
Project will be completed on schedule (late 1994) and that
the final cost will be approximately 24% below the
original budget. Primary factors contributing to the
reduced cost include: 1) the absence of any major
construction problems to date; 2) financing and material
and equipment costs lower than expected; and 3) favorable
ruling of the Pennsylvania PUC allowing the inclusion of
carrying costs of construction in rates in lieu of AFUDC.
Construction expenditures through the year 2000 may
include substantial amounts for compliance with both
Phase I and Phase II of the CAAA. The Company is
estimating amounts of approximately $700 million, which
includes $207 million expended through 1993, depending
upon the strategy eventually selected for complying with
Phase II. The mere possibility of new legislation which
restricts or discourages carbon dioxide emissions, either
through taxation or caps, further complicates the CAAA
Phase II planning process. The remaining amount of this
CAAA construction estimate, together with normal
construction activity assures that continuing external
financings will be required. In addition, the Company has
additional capital requirements of debt maturities (see
Note H to the consolidated financial statements).


Internal Cash Flows
 Internal generation of cash, consisting of cash flows
from operations reduced by dividends, increased to $119
million in 1993. A regulatory commission order has been
received from the PUC which provides for current cash
recovery of the carrying costs of CAAA expenditures
in rates, albeit with a certain amount of lag. Based
upon the authorization received and a new rate case
planned in 1994, internal generation of cash can be
expected to increase.

                         M-33

 Materials and supplies, primarily fuel, constituted a
significant source of cash in 1993 ($27 million). The
five-year National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement
terminated on February 1, 1993. Coal inventories (fuel) as
of December 31, 1992, were increased over 1991 amounts
to provide an increased coal supply in the event of a strike.
The union chose a strategy of selective shutdowns
including mines that accounted for approximately 60% of
the System's regular coal supply. The union signed a new
five-year contract in December 1993. System coal
inventory, which declined during the dispute, and which
is somewhat lower than the seasonal norm, is considered
adequate.


Financings
 During 1993 the Company issued $18.04 million of
6.30% tax-exempt solid waste disposal notes to Harrison
County, West Virginia, and refunded an aggregate of
$246 million of debt securities having interest rates of 7%
to 9.75% through the issuance of $251 million of securities
having interest rates of 4.95% to 6.375%. The costs
associated with the debt redemptions are being amortized
over the life of the new bonds. Due to the significant
number of refinancings which have occurred over the past
two years, this balance is now about $12 million. Reduced
future interest expense will more than offset these
expenses.

 Short-term debt is used to meet temporary cash needs
until the timing is considered appropriate to issue long-
term securities. The Company canceled or postponed
approximately $47 million of debt financings in 1993 due
to favorable short-term alternatives. In 1992, the Company
and its affiliates established an internal money pool as a
facility to accommodate intercompany short-term
borrowing needs, to the extent that certain of the
companies have funds available.

 At December 31, 1993, the Company had SEC
authorization to issue up to $170 million of short-term
debt. In addition, a multi-year credit program was
established in January 1994, which provides that the
Company may borrow on a standby revolving credit basis
up to $135 million. After the initial three-year term, the
program agreement provides that the maturity date may
be extended in one-year increments. The borrowings have
the support of a long-term credit facility. During 1994, the
Company plans to issue about $105 million of new
securities, consisting of both debt and equity issues and, if
economic and market conditions make it desirable, may
refinance up to $212 million of first mortgage bonds,
preferred stock, and pollution control revenue notes. The
Company may also engage in additional Harrison County
tax-exempt solid waste disposal financings to the extent
that funds are available.

 The Company anticipates that it will be able to meet its
future cash needs through internal cash generation and
external financings as it has in the past and possibly
through alternative financing procedures.


Environmental Matters and
Other Contingencies
 In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to various contingencies and uncertainties relating
to its operations and construction program, including
cost recovery in the regulatory process, laws, regulations
and uncertainties related to environmental matters, and
legal actions. Contingencies and uncertainties related to
the CAAA are discussed above and under Note J to the
consolidated financial statements.

 Pennsylvania has enacted hazardous and solid waste
management legislation. While the Company does not
have significant hazardous waste concerns, solid wastes,
such as fly ash and other coal by-products generated from
power stations, must be disposed in accordance with the
state requirements. The Company is incurring various
costs, which are recoverable in rates, to comply with these
and other environmental matters. The level of future
expenditures for environmental matters is impossible to
determine with any degree of certainty. It is management's
opinion that the ultimate costs will not have a material
effect on the financial position of the Company.

                             M-35

 As of January 1994, Monongahela Power Company
(MP), an affiliated company, has been named as a
defendant along with multiple other defendants in 1,429
pending asbestos cases involving multiple plaintiffs and
the Company and its affiliates have been named as
defendants along with multiple defendants in an additional
626 cases by multiple plaintiffs. Because these cases are
filed by "shotgun" complaints naming many plaintiffs
and many defendants, it is presently impossible to
determine the actual number of claims against the
Company and its affiliates. However, based on past
experience and data available to date, it is estimated that
less than 600 cases actually involve claims against the
Company or its affiliates. All complaints allege that the
plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting from
claimed exposure to
asbestos in various generating plants and other industrial
facilities operated by the various defendants, although all
plaintiffs do not claim exposure at facilities operated by
all defendants. All plaintiffs claiming exposure at System-
operated stations were employed by third-party
contractors, with the exception of three who claim to have
been employees of MP. The Company is joint owner with
MP in four generating plants, including three operated by
MP in West Virginia. Each plaintiff generally seeks
compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants
in amounts of up to $1 million and $3 million, respectively;
in those cases that include a spousal claim for loss of
consortium, damages are generally sought against all
defendants in an amount of up to $1 million for the loss of
consortium claim. Therefore, because of the multiple
defendants, the Company believes its potential liability is
a very small percentage of the total amount of the
damages sought. A total of 94 cases have been previously
settled by MP for an amount substantially less than the
anticipated cost of defense. While the Company believes
that all of these cases are without merit, it cannot predict
the outcome of these cases or whether other cases will
be filed.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS


Results of Operations

 As described under Liquidity and Capital Resources,
revenues are determined under a cost of service formula
rate schedule. Therefore, if all other factors remain equal,
revenues are expected to decrease each year due to a
normal continuing reduction in the Company's net
investment in the Bath County station and its connecting
transmission facilities upon which the return on
investment is determined. Revenues for 1993 and 1992
decreased due to a reduction in interest charges and net
investment, and reduced operating expenses which are
described below. Additionally, revenues for 1993 and
1992 were reduced by the recording of estimated liabilities
for possible refunds pending final Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) decisions in rate case
proceedings (see Liquidity and Capital Resources).

 The net investment (primarily net plant less deferred
income taxes) decreases to the extent that provisions for
depreciation and deferred income taxes exceed net plant
additions. The decrease in operating expenses in 1993
resulted from a decrease in federal income taxes due to a
decrease in income before taxes ($1.9 million) offset by an
increase in the tax rate due to the Revenue Reconciliation
Act of 1993 ($.5 million), partially offset by an increase in
operation and maintenance expense. The decrease in
operating expenses in 1992 resulted primarily from
reduced federal income taxes because of a decrease in
income before taxes, partially offset by increases in taxes
other than income.

 The increase in taxes other than income in 1992 was due
to increased property taxes.

 The decreases in interest on long-term debt in 1993 and
1992 were the combined result of decreases in the average
amount of and interest rates on long-term debt
outstanding.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

 SEC regulations define "liquidity" as "the ability of an
enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet
the enterprise's need for cash". The Company's only
operating assets are an undivided 40% interest in the Bath
County (Virginia) pumped-storage hydroelectric station
and its connecting transmission facilities. The Company
has no present plans for construction of any other major
facilities.

                         M-37

 Pursuant to an agreement, the Parents buy all of the
Company's capacity in the station priced under a "cost of
service formula" wholesale rate schedule approved by the
FERC. Under this arrangement, the Company recovers
in revenues all of its operation and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, taxes, and a return on its investment.

 Through February 29, 1992, the Company's return on
equity (ROE) was adjusted annually pursuant to a
settlement agreement approved by the FERC. On March
1, 1990, the ROE decreased from 12% to 11.25%, and on
March 1, 1991, it was increased to 11.53%. In December
1991, the Company filed for a continuation of the existing
ROE of 11.53% and other parties (the Consumer
Advocate Division of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia, Maryland People's Counsel, and
Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate, collectively
referred to as the joint consumer advocates or JCA) filed
to reduce the ROE, with any resultant rate decreases
subject to refund from March 1, 1992 through May 31,
1993. Hearings were completed in June 1992, and a
recommendation was issued by an Administrative Law
Judge (ALJ) on December 21, 1993, for an ROE of
10.83%, which the JCA argues should be further adjusted
to reflect changes in capital market conditions since the
hearings. Exceptions to this recommendation have been
filed by all parties for consideration by the full
Commission. On January 28, 1994, the JCA filed a joint
complaint claiming that both the existing ROE of 11.53%
and the ALJ's recommended ROE of 10.83% are unjust
and unreasonable. This new complaint requests an ROE
of 8.53%, with rates subject to refund beginning
April 1, 1994.

 In 1993, the Company issued $50 million of 5.75%
medium-term notes due 1998, $50 million of 5.625%
debentures due 2003, and $100 million of 6.875%
debentures due 2023 to refund $50 million 8% debentures
due 1997, $50 million 8.75% debentures due 2017, and
$100 million 9.125% debentures due 2016. The Company
and its affiliates in 1992 established an internal money
pool as a facility to accommodate intercompany short-
term borrowing needs, to the extent that certain of the
companies have funds available.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors of
Allegheny Power System, Inc.


              In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Allegheny Power System, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

              As discussed in Notes A, B and E to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and
postretirement benefits other than pensions in 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(These notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial
statements.)

NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
  The Company and its subsidiaries (companies) are subject to regulation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subsidiaries are subject
to regulation by various state bodies having jurisdiction and by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Significant accounting
policies of the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below.
CONSOLIDATION:
  The Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of its
subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and all subsidiary companies after elimination of
intercompany transactions.
REVENUES:
  Customers are billed on a cycle basis, and revenues, including amounts
resulting from the application of fuel and energy cost adjustment
clauses, are generally recorded when billed. In accordance with
ratemaking procedures followed by Monongahela Power Company in West
Virginia, revenues include service rendered but unbilled at year end.
Certain increases in rates being collected by subsidiaries are subject
to final commission approvals, and possible refunds, for which estimated
liabilities have been recorded.
DEFERRED POWER COSTS, NET:
  The costs of fuel, purchased power, and certain other costs, and
revenues from sales and transmission services to other utilities, are
deferred until they are either recovered from or credited to customers
under fuel and energy cost recovery procedures.
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT:
  Property, plant, and equipment are stated at original cost, less
contributions in aid of construction, except for capital leases which
are recorded at present value. Cost includes direct labor and material,
allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) on property for
which construction work in progress is not included in rate base, and
such indirect costs as administration, maintenance, and depreciation of
transportation and construction equipment, and pensions, taxes, and
other fringe benefits related to employees engaged in construction.
  The cost of depreciable property units retired, plus removal costs less
salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation.
ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION:
  AFUDC, an item that does not represent current cash income, is defined
in applicable regulatory systems of accounts as including "the net cost
for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction
purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used". AFUDC is
recognized as a cost of property, plant, and equipment with offsetting
credits to other income and interest charges. Rates used by the
subsidiaries for computing AFUDC in 1993, 1992, and 1991 averaged 9.37%,
9.19%, and 8.84%, respectively.

                              F-8

DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE:
  Provisions for depreciation are determined generally on a straight-line
method based on estimated service lives of depreciable properties and
amounted to approximately 3.4% of average depreciable property in 1993
and 3.3% in each of the years 1992 and 1991.  The cost of maintenance
and of certain replacements of property, plant, and equipment is charged
principally to operating expenses.
INVESTMENTS:
  The investment in subsidiaries consolidated represents the excess of
acquisition cost over book equity (goodwill) prior to 1966.  Goodwill is
not being amortized because, in management's opinion, there has been no
reduction in its value.
  Other investments primarily represent the cash surrender values and
prepayments of purchased life insurance contracts on certain qualifying
management employees under an executive life insurance plan and a
supplemental executive retirement plan (Secured Benefit Plan).  Payment
of future premiums will fully fund these benefits.
INCOME TAXES:
  Financial accounting income before income taxes differs from taxable
income principally because certain income and deductions for tax
purposes are recorded in the financial income statement in another
period. Differences between income tax that would be paid if taxes were
computed on the basis of financial accounting income instead of taxable
income are accounted for substantially in accordance with the accounting
procedures followed for ratemaking purposes.
  Provisions for federal income tax were reduced in previous years by
investment credits, and amounts equivalent to such credits were charged
to income with concurrent credits to a deferred account, balances in
which are being amortized over estimated service lives of the related
properties.

                             F-9

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:
  The subsidiaries have a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan
covering substantially all employees, including officers. Benefits are
based on the employee's years of service and compensation. The funding
policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount required
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and not more than can
be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
  The subsidiaries also provide partially contributory medical and life
insurance plans for eligible retirees and dependents.  Medical benefits,
which comprise the largest component of the plans, are based upon an age
and years-of-service vesting schedule and other plan provisions. The
funding plan for these costs is to contribute to Voluntary Employee
Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust funds an amount equal to the annual
cost as determined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 106 (described below). Medical benefits are self-insured; the life
insurance plan is paid through insurance premiums.
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has prescribed the
determination of annual pension and other postretirement benefits
expenses in SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", and SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions", respectively.  Pursuant to SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation", regulatory deferrals of these
benefit expenses are recorded for those jurisdictions which reflect as
net expense the funding of pensions and cash payment of other benefits
in the ratemaking process. 
TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS:
  For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, temporary cash
investments with original maturities of three months or less, generally
in the form of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and repurchase
agreements, are considered to be the equivalent of cash. The carrying
amount of temporary cash investments approximates the fair value because
of the short-term maturity of those instruments.
ACCOUNTING CHANGES:
  Effective January 1, 1993, the subsidiaries adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". 
This statement requires the costs of providing postretirement benefits,
such as medical and life insurance, to be accrued over the applicable
employees' service periods.  Prior to 1993, medical expenses and life
insurance premiums paid for retired employees and their dependents were
recorded as expense in the period they were paid. Also effective January
1, 1993, the subsidiaries adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes".  This standard mandated a change from the previous income-based
deferral approach to a balance sheet-based liability approach for
computing deferred income taxes as further described in Note B.

 Federal income tax returns through 1989 have been examined and
substantially settled.
 In adopting SFAS No. 109, the subsidiaries recognized a significant
increase in both deferred tax assets and liabilities.  At December 31,
1993, the deferred tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the
following:    
                                                         (Thousands 
                                                         of Dollars)
Deferred tax assets:
  Unamortized investment tax credit                      $  105 289 
  Unbilled revenue                                           38 363 
  Tax interest capitalized                                   22 236 
  Contributions in aid of construction                       17 176

                                                            219 282 
Deferred tax liabilities:
  Book vs. tax plant basis differences, net               1 051 500

Total net deferred tax liabilities                          874 340 
Less portion above included in current liabilities              645 
Total long-term net deferred tax liabilities             $  873 695 

 It is expected that regulatory commissions will allow recovery of the
deferred tax liabilities in future years as they are paid, and
accordingly, the subsidiaries have recorded regulatory assets for an
amount equal to the $562 million increase in deferred tax liabilities. 
Regulatory liabilities were recorded in an amount equal to the $108
million increase in deferred tax assets to reflect the subsidiaries'
obligation to pass such tax benefits on to their customers as the
benefits are realized in cash in future years.  Based on the provisions
in the standard for recording these regulatory assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet, there was no effect on consolidated net income
resulting from adoption of the standard.

NOTE C--DIVIDEND RESTRICTION:
 Supplemental indentures relating to most outstanding bonds of
subsidiaries contain dividend restrictions under the most restrictive of
which $461,539,000 of consolidated retained earnings at December 31,
1993, is not available for cash dividends on their common stocks, except
that a portion thereof may be paid as cash dividends where concurrently
an equivalent amount of cash is received by a subsidiary as a capital
contribution or as the proceeds of the issue and sale of shares of such
subsidiary's common stock.

NOTE E--POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS:
 The subsidiaries adopted SFAS No. 106 as of January 1, 1993,  which
requires accrual of postretirement benefits other than pensions
(principally health care and life insurance) for the employee and
covered dependents during the years the employee renders the necessary
service to receive such benefits.  Prior to 1993, medical expenses and
life insurance premiums paid by the subsidiaries for retired employees
and their dependents were recorded in expense in the period in which
they were paid and were $6,553,000 and $5,691,000 in 1992 and 1991,
respectively.
 SFAS No. 106 postretirement cost in 1993, a portion of which (about 30%)
was charged to plant construction, included the following components:
                                                         (Thousands

using a measurement date of September 30 were as follows:
                                                         (Thousands

Postretirement benefit liability at September 30, 1993       10 113 
Fourth quarter 1993 contributions and benefit payments        4 549 
Postretirement benefit liability at December 31, 1993      $  5 564 

 The unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) at
January 1, 1993, of $145,500,000 (transition obligation) is being
amortized prospectively over 20 years as permitted by the standard.
 In determining the APBO at January 1 and December 31, 1993, the discount
rates used were 8% and 7.25%, the rates of increase in future
compensation levels were 5.5% and 4.75%, respectively. For measurement
purposes, a health care trend rate of 14% for 1993, declining 1% each
year thereafter to 7% in the year 2000 and beyond, and plan provisions
which limit future medical and life insurance benefits were assumed. 
Increasing the assumed health care trend rate by 1% in each year would
increase the APBO at December 31, 1993, by $13.4 million and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by $1.0 million.
 Recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs has been authorized for retail customers
in Maryland effective in February 1993, in Pennsylvania effective in May
1993, and for the FERC wholesale customers effective in mid-to-late
1993.  Regulatory actions have been taken by the Virginia and Ohio
regulatory commissions which provide support that substantial recovery
is probable.  Recovery has been requested in rate cases filed in
Virginia and West Virginia for which final commission decisions are
expected in 1994.  The subsidiaries have recorded regulatory assets at
December 31, 1993, of $4.8 million relating to those regulatory
jurisdictions where full recovery of SFAS No. 106 level of expenses has
not yet been granted recovery in rates, with the result that adoption of
SFAS No. 106 has had no effect on consolidated net income.

                            F-15

NOTE F--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:
COMMON STOCK:
 In November 1993, the common shareholders approved a two-for-one split
of the Company's common stock which was effective November 4, 1993.  The
stock split reduced the par value of the common stock from $2.50 per
share to $1.25 per share and increased the number of authorized shares
of common stock from 130,000,000 to 260,000,000.  The number of common
stock shares outstanding and per share information for all periods
reflect the two-for-one split.
PREFERRED STOCK:
 All of the preferred stock is entitled on voluntary liquidation to its
then current call price and on involuntary liquidation to $100 a share. 
The holders of West Penn Power Company's auction preferred stock are
entitled to dividends at a rate determined by an auction held the
business day preceding each quarterly dividend payment date.
MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK:
 The Potomac Edison Company's $7.16 preferred stock is entitled to a
cumulative sinking fund sufficient to retire 12,000 shares each year,
commencing in 1992, at $100 a share plus accrued dividends.  That
subsidiary has the noncumulative option in each year to retire up to an
additional 12,000 shares at the same price. The estimated fair value of
this series of preferred stock at December 31, 1993 and 1992, was
$28,566,000 and $28,944,000, respectively, based on quoted market
prices.  The call price declines in future years.  In August 1993, The
Potomac Edison Company redeemed the remaining 4,046 outstanding shares
of Series B, 4.70% preferred stock.

                             F-16

NOTE G--LONG-TERM DEBT:
 Maturities for long-term debt for the next five years are: 1994,
$26,000,000; 1995, $28,000,000; 1996, $43,575,000; 1997, $48,262,000;
and 1998, $185,400,000. Substantially all of the properties of the
subsidiaries are held subject to the lien securing each subsidiary's
first mortgage bonds. Some properties are also subject to a second lien
securing certain pollution control and solid waste disposal notes.
 Commercial paper borrowings issuable by Allegheny Generating Company are
backed by a revolving credit agreement with a group of seven banks which
provides for loans of up to $75 million at any one time outstanding
through 1997. Each bank has the option to discontinue its loans after
1997 upon three years' prior written notice. Without such notice, the
loans are automatically extended for one year. However, to the extent
that funds are available from the companies, Allegheny Generating
Company borrowings are made through an internal money pool as described
in Note H.
 The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 and
1992, was $2,129,923,000 and $2,033,103,000, respectively, based on
actual market prices or market prices of similar issues.

NOTE H--SHORT-TERM DEBT:
 To provide interim financing and support for outstanding commercial
paper, lines of credit have been established with several banks. The
companies have fee arrangements on all of their lines of credit and no
compensating balance requirements.  At December 31, 1993, unused lines
of credit with banks were $149,175,000.  In addition to bank lines of
credit, in 1992 the companies established an internal money pool as a
facility to accommodate intercompany short-term borrowing needs, to the
extent that certain of the companies have funds available.  In January
1994, a multi-year credit program was established which provides that
the subsidiaries may borrow up to $300 million on a standby revolving
credit basis. Short-term debt outstanding at the end of 1993 consisted
of notes payable to banks ($75,825,000) and commercial paper
($54,811,000) and at the end of 1992 consisted of a note payable to a
bank ($11,205,000). The carrying amount of short-term debt approximates
the fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments.

NOTE I--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM:
 The subsidiaries have entered into commitments for their construction
programs, for which expenditures are estimated to be $500 million for
1994 and $400 million for 1995. These estimates include expenditures for
the program of complying with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAAA) as discussed below.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
 The companies are subject to laws, regulations, and uncertainties as to
environmental matters discussed under ITEM 1.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.
Compliance may require them to incur substantial additional costs
to modify or replace existing and proposed equipment and facilities and
may affect adversely the lead time, size, and siting of future
generating stations, increase the complexity and cost of pollution
control equipment, and otherwise add to the cost of future operations.
Construction expenditures through the year 2000 will include substantial
amounts for compliance with Phase I and Phase II of the CAAA.
The subsidiaries are estimating expenditures of
approximately $1.4 billion, which includes $482 million expended through
1993, depending on the strategy eventually selected for complying with
Phase II.  Construction estimates for 1994 and 1995 include $161 million
and $53 million, respectively, for the program of complying with the
CAAA.
 In complying with the CAAA, the subsidiaries will face uncertainties,
including regulatory administrative interpretations and contingencies,
such as potential cost overruns, equipment performance, and cost
recovery in rates.
LITIGATION:
In the normal course of business, the companies become involved in
various legal proceedings. The companies do not believe that the
ultimate outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on
their financial position.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors of
Monongahela Power Company


              In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Monongahela Power Company (a subsidiary of Allegheny Power System,
Inc.) at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

              As discussed in Notes A, B and F to the financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits other than pensions in 1993.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(These notes are an integral part of the financial statements.)

Note A - Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies:
 The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Allegheny Power System, Inc. and is a part of the
Allegheny Power integrated electric utility system
(the System).

 The Company is subject to regulation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), by various state
bodies having jurisdiction, and by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). Significant accounting
policies of the Company are summarized below.

REVENUES:
 Customers are billed on a cycle basis, and revenues,
including amounts resulting from the application of fuel
and energy cost adjustment clauses, are generally recorded
when billed. In accordance with ratemaking procedures
in West Virginia, revenues include service rendered but
unbilled at year end.

DEFERRED POWER COSTS, NET:
 The costs of fuel, purchased power, and certain other
costs, and revenues from sales and transmission services
to other utilities, are deferred until they are either
recovered from or credited to customers under fuel and
energy cost recovery procedures.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT:
 Property, plant, and equipment, including facilities
owned with affiliates in the System, are stated at original
cost, less contributions in aid of construction, except for
capital leases which are recorded at present value.
Cost includes direct labor and material, allowance for
funds used during construction (AFUDC) on property
for which construction work in progress is not included
in rate base, and such indirect costs as administration,
maintenance, and depreciation of transportation and
construction equipment, and pensions, taxes, and other
fringe benefits related to employees engaged in
construction.

 The cost of depreciable property units retired, plus
removal costs less salvage, are charged to accumulated
depreciation.
                           F-25
 
ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING
CONSTRUCTION:
 AFUDC, an item that does not represent current cash
income, is defined in applicable regulatory systems of
accounts as including "the net cost for the period of
construction of borrowed funds used for construction
purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so
used". AFUDC is recognized as a cost of property, plant,
and equipment with offsetting credits to other income and
interest charges. Rates used for computing AFUDC in
1993, 1992, and 1991 were 8.69%, 8.23%, and 6.17%,
respectively. In accordance with FERC guidelines, the 1991
rate was based solely on borrowed funds because the Company's
average outstanding short-term debt was greater than the
average construction work in progress balance.

DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE:
 Provisions for depreciation are determined generally
on a straight-line method based on estimated service lives
of depreciable properties and amounted to approximately
3.8% of average depreciable property in each of the years
1993, 1992, and 1991. The cost of maintenance and of
certain replacements of property, plant, and equipment
is charged principally to operating expenses.

INCOME TAXES:
 The Company joins with its parent and affiliates in
filing a consolidated federal income tax return. The
consolidated tax liability is allocated among the
participants generally in proportion to the taxable income
of each participant, except that no subsidiary pays tax in
excess of its separate return tax liability.

 Financial accounting income before income taxes
differs from taxable income principally because certain
income and deductions for tax purposes are recorded in
the financial income statement in another period.
Differences between income tax that would be paid if
taxes were computed on the basis of financial accounting
income instead of taxable income are accounted for
substantially in accordance with the accounting
procedures followed for ratemaking purposes.

 Provisions for federal income tax were reduced in
previous years by investment credits, and amounts
equivalent to such credits were charged to income with
concurrent credits to a deferred account, balances in
which are being amortized over estimated service lives of
the related properties.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:
 The Company participates with affiliated companies in
the System in a noncontributory, defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all employees, including
officers. Benefits  are based on the employee's years of
service and compensation. The funding policy is to
contribute annually at least the minimum amount
required under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act and not more than can be deducted for federal income
tax purposes.
 
                             F-26

 The Company also provides partially contributory
medical and life insurance plans for eligible retirees and
dependents. Medical benefits, which comprise the largest
component of the plans, are based upon an age and
years-of-service vesting schedule and other plan
provisions. The funding plan for these costs is to
contribute to Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association (VEBA) trust funds an amount equal to the
annual cost as determined by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106 (described below).
Medical benefits are self-insured; the life insurance plan is
paid through insurance premiums.

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
has prescribed the determination of annual pension and
other postretirement benefits expenses in SFAS No. 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions", and SFAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions", respectively. Pursuant to SFAS
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation", regulatory deferrals of these benefit
expenses are recorded for those jurisdictions which reflect
as net expense the funding of pensions and cash payment
of other benefits in the ratemaking process.



TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS:
 For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows,
temporary cash investments with original maturities
of three months or less, generally in the form of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and repurchase
agreements, are considered to be the equivalent of cash.


ACCOUNTING CHANGES:
 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Post-
retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". This statement
requires the costs of providing postretirement benefits,
such as medical and life insurance, to be accrued over the
applicable employees' service periods. Prior to 1993,
medical expenses and life insurance premiums paid for
retired employees and their dependents were recorded as
expense in the period they were paid. Also effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes". This standard mandated
a change from the previous income-based deferral
approach to a balance sheet-based liability approach for
computing deferred income taxes as further described in
Note B.

 Federal income tax returns through 1989 have been
examined and substantially settled.

                             F-28

 In adopting SFAS No. 109, the Company recognized a
significant increase in both deferred tax assets and
liabilities. At December 31, 1993, the deferred tax assets
and liabilities were comprised of the following:

                                                   (Thousands of Dollars)

Deferred tax assets:
 Unamortized investment tax credit                        $18 043
 Unbilled revenue                                           4 181
 Tax interest capitalized                                   2 430
 Contributions in aid of construction                       2 058
 Vacation pay                                               1 958
 Advances for construction                                  1 601
 Other                                                      4 455
                                                           34 726

Deferred tax liabilities:
 Book vs. tax plant basis differences, net                205 829
 Other                                                     23 411
                                                          229 240

Total net deferred tax liabilities                        194 514
Less portion above included in current liabilities          2 048

Total long-term net deferred tax liabilities             $192 466


 It is expected that regulatory commissions will allow
recovery of the deferred tax liabilities in future years as
they are paid, and accordingly, the Company has recorded
regulatory assets for an amount equal to the $158 million
increase in deferred tax liabilities. Regulatory liabilities
were recorded in an amount equal to the $19 million
increase in deferred tax assets to reflect the Company's obligation
to pass such tax benefits on to its customers as the benefits
are realized in cash in future years. Based on the
provisions in the standard for recording these
regulatory assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, there
was no effect on net income resulting from adoption of
the standard.

Note C - Dividend Restriction:

 Supplemental indentures relating to most outstanding
bonds of the Company contain dividend restrictions
under the most restrictive of which $103,482,000 of
retained earnings at December 31, 1993, is not available
for cash dividends on common stock, except that a
portion thereof may be paid as cash dividends where
concurrently an equivalent amount of cash is received by
the Company as a capital contribution or as the proceeds
of the issue and sale of shares of its common stock.


Note D - Allegheny Generating Company:

 The Company owns 27% of the common stock of
Allegheny Generating Company (AGC), and affiliates of
the Company own the remainder. AGC owns an
undivided 40% interest, 840 MW, in the 2,100-MW
pumped-storage hydroelectric station in Bath County,
Virginia operated by the 60% owner, Virginia Power
Company, an unaffiliated utility.

                         F-29

 AGC recovers from the Company and its affiliates all
of its operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation,
taxes, and a return on its investment under a wholesale
rate schedule approved by the FERC. Through February
29, 1992, AGC's return on equity (ROE) was adjusted
annually pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by
the FERC. In December 1991, AGC filed for a
continuation of the existing ROE of 11.53% and other
parties (the Consumer Advocate Division of the West
Virginia PSC, Maryland People's Counsel, and
Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate, collectively
referred to as the joint consumer advocates or JCA) filed
to reduce the ROE, with any resultant rate decreases
subject to refund from March 1, 1992 through May 31,
1993. Hearings were completed in June 1992, and a
recommendation was issued by an Administrative Law
Judge (ALJ) on December 21, 1993, for an ROE of
10.83%, which the JCA argues should be further adjusted
to reflect changes in capital market conditions since the
hearings. Exceptions to this recommendation have been
filed by all parties for consideration by the full
Commission. On January 28, 1994, the JCA filed a joint
complaint claiming that both the existing ROE of 11.53%
and the ALJ's recommended ROE of 10.83% are unjust
and unreasonable. This new complaint requests an ROE
of 8.53%, with rates subject to refund beginning
April 1, 1994.

 Following is a summary of financial information
for AGC:

benefit obligation at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991,
the discount rates used were 7.25%, 7.75%, and 8%, and
the rates of increase in future compensation levels were
4.75%, 5.25%, and 5.5%, respectively. The expected
long-term rate of return on assets was 9% in each of the
years 1993, 1992, and 1991.

                            F-31

Note F - Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions:
 The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 as of January 1,
1993, which requires accrual of postretirement benefits
other than pensions (principally health care and life
insurance) for the employee and covered dependents
during the years the employee renders the necessary
service to receive such benefits. Prior to 1993, medical
expenses and life insurance premiums paid by the
Company for retired employees and their dependents
were recorded in expense in the period in which they were
paid and were $2,390,000 and $2,029,000 in 1992 and
1991, respectively.

 SFAS No. 106 postretirement cost in 1993, a portion of
which (about 30%) was charged to plant construction,
included the following components:

                                                    (Thousands of Dollars)

Service cost - benefits earned                               $   478

 The benefits earned to date and funded status of the
Company's share of the System plan at December 31,
1993, using a measurement date of September 30 were
as follows:

Postretirement benefit liability at

                              F-32

 The unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) at January 1, 1993, of $35,800,000
(transition obligation), is being amortized prospectively
over 20 years as permitted by the standard.

 In determining the APBO at January 1 and December
31, 1993, the discount rates used were 8% and 7.25%, and
the rates of increase in future compensation levels were
5.5% and 4.75%, respectively. For measurement purposes,
a health care trend rate of 14% for 1993, declining 1% each
year thereafter to 7% in the year 2000 and beyond, and
plan provisions which limit future medical and life
insurance benefits were assumed. Increasing the assumed
health care trend rate by 1% in each year would increase
the APBO at December 31, 1993, by $3.5 million and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by
$.2 million.

 Recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs has been authorized
for FERC wholesale customers effective in December
1993. Recovery has been requested in a rate case filed in
West Virginia for which a final commission decision is
expected in 1994. Regulatory action has been taken by the
Ohio regulatory commission which provides support that
substantial recovery is probable. The Company has
recorded regulatory assets at December 31, 1993, of $2.0
million for West Virginia and Ohio where full recovery of
SFAS No. 106 level of expenses has not yet been granted
recovery in rates, with the result that adoption of SFAS
No. 106 has had no effect on net income.


Note G - Stockholders' Equity:
COMMON STOCK AND OTHER PAID-IN CAPITAL:
 In September 1992, the Company issued and sold to
its parent, 800,000 shares of its common stock at $50 per
share. Other paid-in capital decreased $4,000 in 1992 as a
result of a preferred stock redemption.

PREFERRED STOCK:
 All of the preferred stock is entitled on voluntary
liquidation to its then current call price and on involuntary
liquidation to $100 a share.


                          F-33
 
Note H - Long-Term Debt:

 Maturities for long-term debt for the next five years
are: 1994 and 1995, none; 1996, $18,500,000; 1997,
$15,500,000; and 1998, $20,100,000. Substantially all of
the properties of the Company are held subject to the lien
securing its first mortgage bonds. Some properties are
also subject to a second lien securing certain pollution
control and solid waste disposal notes. Certain first
mortgage bond series are not redeemable by certain
refunding until dates established in the respective
supplemental indentures.

 In 1993, the Company sold $65 million of 5-5/8%
7-year first mortgage bonds to refund a $10 million
8-1/8% issue due in 1999, a $30 million 7-7/8% issue due
in 2002, and a $20 million 7-1/2% issue due in 1998. The
Company also issued $7.05 million of 5.95% 20-year
Pollution Control Revenue Notes to Monongalia County,
West Virginia to refund a $7.05 million 9.5% issue due
in 2013.

 The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December
31, 1993 and 1992, was $485,713,000 and $461,663,000,
respectively, based on actual market prices or market
prices of similar issues.

Note I - Short-Term Debt:
 To provide interim financing and support for
outstanding commercial paper, the System companies
have established lines of credit with several banks. The
Company has SEC authorization for total short-term
borrowings of $100 million including money pool
borrowings described below. The Company has fee
arrangements on all of its lines of credit and no
compensating balance requirements. In addition to bank
lines of credit, in 1992 the Company and its affiliates
established an internal money pool as a facility to
accommodate intercompany short-term borrowing needs,
to the extent that certain of the companies have funds
available. In January 1994, the Company and its affiliates
jointly established an aggregate $300 million multi-year
credit program which provides that the Company may
borrow up to $81 million on a standby revolving credit
basis. Short-term debt outstanding at the end of 1993
consisted of $63.1 million of notes payable to banks and
at the end of 1992 consisted of money pool borrowings
from affiliates of $8.03 million. The carrying amount of
short-term debt approximates the fair value because of
the short-term maturity of those instruments.

                            F-34

Note J - Commitments and Contingencies:
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM:
 The Company has entered into commitments for its
construction program, for which expenditures are
estimated to be $103 million for 1994 and $83 million for
1995. These estimates include expenditures for the
program of complying with the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) as discussed below.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
 System companies are subject to laws, regulations, and
uncertainties with respect to air and water quality, land
use, and other environmental matters. Compliance may
require them to incur substantial additional costs to
modify or replace existing and proposed equipment and
facilities and may affect adversely the lead time, size, and
siting of future generating stations, increase the
complexity and cost of pollution control equipment, and
otherwise add to the cost of future operations.

 Construction expenditures through the year 2000 will
include substantial amounts for compliance with Phase I
and Phase II of the CAAA. The Company is estimating
expenditures of approximately $400 million, which
includes $122 million expended through 1993, depending
on the strategy eventually selected for complying with
Phase II. Construction estimates for 1994 and 1995
include $39 million and $10 million, respectively, for the
program of complying with the CAAA.

 In complying with the CAAA, the Company will face
uncertainties, including regulatory administrative
interpretations and contingencies, such as potential cost
overruns, equipment performance, and cost recovery in
rates.

LITIGATION AND OTHER:
 In the normal course of business, the Company
becomes involved in various legal proceedings. The
Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings will have a material effect on its
financial position.

 The Company is guarantor as to 27% of a $75 million
revolving credit agreement of AGC, which in 1993 was
used by AGC solely as support for its indebtedness for
commercial paper outstanding.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors of
The Potomac Edison Company


              In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of The Potomac Edison Company (a subsidiary of Allegheny Power
System, Inc.) at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

              As discussed in Notes A, B and F to the financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits other than pensions in 1993.

 The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Allegheny Power System, Inc. and is a part of the
Allegheny Power integrated electric utility system (the
System).

 The Company is subject to regulation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), by various state
bodies having jurisdiction, and by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). Significant accounting
policies of the Company are summarized below.

REVENUES:
 Customers are billed on a cycle basis, and revenues,
including amounts resulting from the application of fuel
and energy cost adjustment clauses, are recorded when
billed. Revenues of $63.4 million from one industrial
customer, Eastalco Aluminum Company, were 8.9% of
total electric operating revenues in 1993. Certain increases
in rates being collected by the Company in Virginia are
subject to final commission approval, and possible
refunds, for which estimated liabilities have been
recorded.

DEFERRED POWER COSTS, NET:
 The costs of fuel, purchased power, and certain other
costs, and revenues from sales and transmission services
to other utilities, are deferred until they are either
recovered from or credited to customers under fuel and
energy cost recovery procedures.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT:
 Property, plant, and equipment, including facilities
owned with affiliates in the System, are stated at original
cost, less contributions in aid of construction. Cost
includes direct labor and material, allowance for funds
used during construction (AFUDC) on property for
which construction work in progress is not included in
rate base, and such indirect costs as administration,
maintenance, and depreciation of transportation and
construction equipment, and pensions, taxes, and other
fringe benefits related to employees engaged in
construction.

 The cost of depreciable property units retired, plus
removal costs less salvage, are charged to accumulated
depreciation.

                          F-42

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING
CONSTRUCTION:
 AFUDC, an item that does not represent current cash
income, is defined in applicable regulatory systems of
accounts as including "the net cost for the period of
construction of borrowed funds used for construction
purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so
used". AFUDC is recognized as a cost of property, plant,
and equipment with offsetting credits to other income and
interest charges. Rates used for computing AFUDC in
1993, 1992, and 1991 were 9.97%, 9.92%, and 9.93%,
respectively. AFUDC is not recorded for construction
applicable to the state of Virginia, where construction
work in progress is included in rate base.


DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE:
 Provisions for depreciation are determined generally
on a straight-line method based on estimated service lives
of depreciable properties and amounted to approximately
3.6% of average depreciable property in each of the years
1993, 1992, and 1991. The cost of maintenance and of
certain replacements of property, plant, and equipment is
charged principally to operating expenses.

INCOME TAXES:
 The Company joins with its parent and affiliates in
filing a consolidated federal income tax return. The
consolidated tax liability is allocated among the
participants generally in proportion to the taxable income
of each participant, except that no subsidiary pays tax in
excess of its separate return tax liability.

 Financial accounting income before income taxes
differs from taxable income principally because certain
income and deductions for tax purposes are recorded in
the financial income statement in another period.
Differences between income tax that would be paid if
taxes were computed on the basis of financial accounting
income instead of taxable income are accounted for
substantially in accordance with the accounting
procedures followed for ratemaking purposes.

 Provisions for federal income tax were reduced in
previous years by investment credits, and amounts
equivalent to such credits were charged to income with
concurrent credits to a deferred account, balances in
which are being amortized over estimated service lives of
the related properties.

                           F-43


POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:
 The Company participates with affiliated companies in
the System in a noncontributory, defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all employees, including
officers. Benefits are based on the employee's years of
service and compensation. The funding policy is to
contribute annually at least the minimum amount
required under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act and not more than can be deducted for federal income
tax purposes.

 The Company also provides partially contributory
medical and life insurance plans for eligible retirees and
dependents. Medical benefits, which comprise the largest
component of the plans, are based upon an age and
years-of-service vesting schedule and other plan
provisions. The funding plan for these costs is to
contribute to Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association (VEBA) trust funds an amount equal to the
annual cost as determined by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106 (described below).
Medical benefits are self-insured; the life insurance plan is
paid through insurance premiums.

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
has prescribed the determination of annual pension and
other postretirement benefits expenses in SFAS No. 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions", and SFAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions", respectively. Pursuant to SFAS
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation", regulatory deferrals of these benefit
expenses are recorded for those jurisdictions which reflect
as net expense the funding of pensions and cash payment
of other benefits in the ratemaking process.

TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS:
 For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows,
temporary cash investments with original maturities of
three months or less, generally in the form of commercial
paper, certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements,
are considered to be the equivalent of cash.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES:
 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". This
statement requires the costs of providing postretirement
benefits, such as medical and life insurance, to be accrued
over the applicable employees' service periods. Prior to
1993, medical expenses and life insurance premiums paid
for retired employees and their dependents were recorded
as expense in the period they were paid. Also effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes". This standard mandated
a change from the previous income-based deferral
approach to a balance sheet-based liability approach for
computing deferred income taxes as further described in
Note B.

 In adopting SFAS No. 109, the Company recognized a
significant increase in both deferred tax assets and
liabilities. At December 31, 1993, the deferred tax assets
and liabilities were comprised of the following:

                                             (Thousands of Dollars)
Deferred tax assets:
 Unamortized investment tax credit                 $17 922
 Unbilled revenue                                   12 556
 Contributions in aid of construction               10 530
 Tax interest capitalized                            9 056
 State tax loss carryback/carryforward               5 770
 Advances for construction                           1 303
 Other                                               3 279

                                                    60 416
Deferred tax liabilities:
 Book vs. tax plant basis differences, net         183 892
 Other                                              10 122

                                                   194 014

Total net deferred tax liabilities                 133 598
Less portion above included in current liabilities     571

Total long-term net deferred tax liabilities      $133 027

 It is expected that regulatory commissions will allow
recovery of the deferred tax liabilities in future years as
they are paid, and accordingly, the Company has recorded
regulatory assets for an amount equal to the $74 million
increase in deferred tax liabilities. Regulatory liabilities
were recorded in an amount equal to the $19 million
increase in deferred tax assets to reflect the Company's
obligation to pass such tax benefits on to its customers as
the benefits are realized in cash in future years. Based on
the provisions in the standard for recording these
regulatory assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, there
was no effect on net income resulting from adoption of
the standard.

Note C - Dividend Restriction:
 Supplemental indentures relating to most outstanding
bonds of the Company contain dividend restrictions
under the most restrictive of which $103,730,000 of
retained earnings at December 31, 1993, is not available
for cash dividends on common stock, except that a
portion thereof may be paid as cash dividends where
concurrently an equivalent amount of cash is received by
the Company as a capital contribution or as the proceeds
of the issue and sale of shares of its common stock.

Note D - Allegheny Generating Company:
 The Company owns 28% of the common stock of
Allegheny Generating Company (AGC), and affiliates of
the Company own the remainder. AGC owns an undivided
40% interest, 840 MW, in the 2,100-MW pumped-storage
hydroelectric station in Bath County, Virginia operated
by the 60% owner, Virginia Power Company, an
unaffiliated utility.

 AGC recovers from the Company and its affiliates all
of its operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation,
taxes, and a return on its investment under a wholesale
rate schedule approved by the FERC. Through February
 
                            F-46

29, 1992, AGC's return on equity (ROE) was adjusted
annually pursuant to a settlement agreement approved
by the FERC. In December 1991, AGC filed for a
continuation of the existing ROE of 11.53% and other
parties (the Consumer Advocate Division of the West
Virginia PSC, Maryland People's Counsel, and
Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate, collectively
referred to as the joint consumer advocates or JCA) filed
to reduce the ROE, with any resultant rate decreases
subject to refund from March 1, 1992 through May 31,
1993. Hearings were completed in June 1992, and a
recommendation was issued by an Administrative Law
Judge (ALJ) on December 21, 1993, for an ROE of
10.83%, which the JCA argues should be further adjusted
to reflect changes in capital market conditions since the
hearings. Exceptions to this recommendation have been
filed by all parties for consideration by the full
Commission. On January 28, 1994, the JCA filed a joint
complaint claiming that both the existing ROE of 11.53%
and the ALJ's recommended ROE of 10.83% are unjust
and unreasonable. This new complaint requests an ROE
of 8.53%, with rates subject to refund beginning
April 1, 1994.

 Following is a summary of financial information
for AGC:

 The foregoing includes the Company's portion of
amounts applicable to employees at power stations which
are owned jointly with affiliates.

 In determining the actuarial present value of the projected
benefit obligation at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991,
the discount rates used were 7.25%, 7.75%, and 8%, and
the rates of increase in future compensation levels were
4.75%, 5.25%, and 5.5%, respectively. The expected long-
term rate of return on assets was 9% in each of the years
1993, 1992, and 1991.

                           F-48

Note F - Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions:
 The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 as of January 1,
1993, which requires accrual of postretirement benefits
other than pensions (principally health care and life
insurance) for the employee and covered dependents
during the years the employee renders the necessary
service to receive such benefits. Prior to 1993, medical
expenses and life insurance premiums paid by the
Company for retired employees and their dependents
were recorded in expense in the period in which they were
paid and were $1,790,000 and $1,564,000 in 1992 and
1991, respectively.

 SFAS No. 106 postretirement cost in 1993, a portion of
which (about 35%) was charged to plant construction,
included the following components:


                                             (Thousands of Dollars)
Service cost - benefits earned                       $  383

Company's share of the System plan at December 31,
1993, using a measurement date of September 30 were
as follows:

                             F-49

 The unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) at January 1, 1993, of $40,000,000
(transition obligation) is  being amortized prospectively
over 20 years as permitted by the standard.

 In determining the APBO at January 1 and December
31, 1993, the discount rates used were 8% and 7.25%, the
rates of increase in future compensation levels were 5.5%
and 4.75%, respectively. For measurement purposes, a
health care trend rate of 14% for 1993, declining 1% each
year thereafter to 7% in the year 2000 and beyond, and
plan provisions which limit future medical and life
insurance benefits were assumed. Increasing the assumed
health care trend rate by 1% in each year would increase
the APBO at December 31, 1993, by $4.0 million and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components
of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by
$.3 million.

 Recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs has been authorized
for retail customers in Maryland effective in February
1993 and for the FERC wholesale customers effective in
September 1993. Regulatory action has been taken by the
Virginia regulatory commission which provides support
that substantial recovery is probable. Recovery has been
requested in rate cases filed in Virginia and West Virginia
for which final commission decisions are expected in
1994. The Company has recorded regulatory assets at
December 31, 1993, of $.8 million relating to those
regulatory jurisdictions where full recovery of SFAS No.
106 level of expenses has not yet been granted recovery in
rates, with the result that adoption of SFAS No. 106 has
had no effect on net income.

Note G - Stockholders' Equity:
COMMON STOCK AND OTHER PAID-IN CAPITAL
 The Company issued and sold common stock to its
parent, at $20 per share, 2,500,000 shares in October 1993,
4,000,000 shares in September 1992, and 1,250,000 shares
in September 1991. Other paid-in capital decreased
$2,000 in 1992 as a result of preferred stock transactions.

PREFERRED STOCK:
 All of the preferred stock is entitled on voluntary
liquidation to its then current call price and on involuntary
liquidation to $100 a share.

                            F-50

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
STOCK:
 The Company's $7.16 preferred stock is entitled to a
cumulative sinking fund sufficient to retire 12,000 shares
each year, commencing in 1992, at $100 a share plus
accrued dividends. The Company has the noncumulative
option in each year to retire up to an additional 12,000
shares at the same price. The estimated fair value of this
series of preferred stock at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
was $28,566,000 and $28,944,000, respectively, based on
quoted market prices. The call price declines in future
years. In August 1993, the Company redeemed the
remaining 4,046 outstanding shares of Series B, 4.70%
preferred stock.

Note H - Long-Term Debt:
 Maturities for long-term debt for the next five years
are: 1994, $16,000,000; 1995, none; 1996, $18,700,000;
1997, $800,000; and 1998, $1,800,000. Substantially all of
the properties of the Company are held subject to the lien
securing its first mortgage bonds. Some properties are
also subject to a second lien securing certain pollution
control and solid waste disposal notes. Certain first
mortgage bond series are not redeemable by certain
refunding until dates established in the respective
supplemental indentures.

 In 1993, the Company sold $45 million of 7-3/4%
30-year first mortgage bonds and $75 million of 5-7/8%
7-year first mortgage bonds to refund a $25 million
8-5/8% issue due in 2007, a $15 million 8-5/8% issue due
in 2003, a $20 million 8-3/8% issue due in 2001, a $15
million 7-5/8% issue due in 1999, a $12 million 7-1/2%
issue due in 2002, and a $25 million 7% issue due in 1998.
The Company also issued $8.6 million of 5.95% 20-year
Pollution Control Revenue Notes to Monongalia County,
West Virginia to refund an $8.6 million 9.5% issue due
in 2013.

 The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December
31, 1993 and 1992, was $566,070,000 and $538,211,000,
respectively, based on actual market prices or market
prices of similar issues.



Note I - Short-Term Financing:
 To provide interim financing and support for
outstanding commercial paper, the System companies
have established lines of credit with several banks. The
Company has SEC authorization for total short-term
borrowings of $115 million, including money pool
borrowings described below. The Company has fee
arrangements on all of its lines of credit and no
compensating balance requirements. In addition to bank
lines of credit, in 1992 the Company and its affiliates
established an internal money pool as a facility to
accommodate intercompany short-term borrowing needs,
to the extent that certain of the companies have funds

                         F-51

available. In January 1994, the Company and its affiliates
jointly established an aggregate $300 million multi-year
credit program which provides that the Company may
borrow up to $84 million on a standby revolving credit
basis. There was no short-term debt outstanding at the
end of 1993 or 1992. The Company had outstanding at the
end of 1993 and 1992, $4.6 million and $38 million,
respectively, of notes receivable from affiliates in the
money pool.

Note J - Commitments and Contingencies:
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM:
 The Company has entered into commitments for its
construction program, for which expenditures are
estimated to be $136 million for 1994 and $106 million for
1995. These estimates include expenditures for the
program of complying with the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) as discussed below.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
 System companies are subject to laws, regulations, and
uncertainties with respect to air and water quality, land
use, and other environmental matters. Compliance may
require them to incur substantial additional costs to
modify or replace existing and proposed equipment and
facilities and may affect adversely the lead time, size, and
siting of future generating stations, increase the
complexity and cost of pollution control equipment, and
otherwise add to the cost of future operations.

 Construction expenditures through the year 2000 will
include substantial amounts for compliance with Phase I
and Phase II of the CAAA. The Company is estimating
expenditures of approximately $350 million, which includes
$153 million expended through 1993, depending on the
strategy eventually selected for complying with Phase II.
Construction estimates for 1994 and 1995 include $40
million and $10 million, respectively, for the program of
complying with the CAAA.

 In complying with the CAAA, the Company will face
uncertainties, including regulatory administrative
interpretations and contingencies, such as potential
cost overruns, equipment performance, and cost recovery
in rates.


LITIGATION AND OTHER:
 In the normal course of business, the Company becomes
involved in various legal proceedings. The Company does
not believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings
will have a material effect on its financial position.

 The Company is guarantor as to 28% of a $75 million
revolving credit agreement of AGC, which in 1993 was
used by AGC solely as support for its indebtedness for
commercial paper outstanding.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors of
West Penn Power Company


              In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of West Penn Power Company (a subsidiary of Allegheny Power System,
Inc.) at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

              As discussed in Notes A, B and F to the financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits other than pensions in 1993.

used during construction (AFUDC) on property for
which construction work in progress is not included in
rate base, and such indirect costs as administration,
maintenance, and depreciation of transportation and
construction equipment, and pensions, taxes, and other
fringe benefits related to employees engaged in
construction.

 The cost of depreciable property units retired, plus
removal costs less salvage, are charged to accumulated
depreciation.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING
CONSTRUCTION:
 AFUDC, an item that does not represent current cash
income, is defined in applicable regulatory systems of
accounts as including "the net cost for the period of
construction of borrowed funds used for construction
purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so

                            F-59

used". AFUDC is recognized as a cost of property,
plant, and equipment with offsetting credits to other
income and interest charges. Rates used for computing
AFUDC in 1993, 1992, and 1991 were 9.40%, 9.25%, and
9.46%, respectively.

DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE:
 Provisions for depreciation are determined generally
on a straight-line method based on estimated service lives
of depreciable properties and amounted to approximately
3.4%, 3.3%, and 3.2% of average depreciable property in
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. The cost of
maintenance and of certain replacements of property,
plant, and equipment is charged principally to
operating expenses.

INCOME TAXES:
 The companies join with the parent and affiliates in
filing a consolidated federal income tax return. The
consolidated tax liability is allocated among the
participants generally in proportion to the taxable income
of each participant, except that no subsidiary pays tax in
excess of its separate return tax liability.

 Financial accounting income before income taxes
differs from taxable income principally because certain
income and deductions for tax purposes are recorded in
the financial income statement in another period.
Differences between income tax that would be paid if
taxes were computed on the basis of financial accounting
income instead of taxable income are accounted for
substantially in accordance with the accounting
procedures followed for ratemaking purposes.

 Provisions for federal income tax were reduced in
previous years by investment credits, and amounts
equivalent to such credits were charged to income with
concurrent credits to a deferred account, balances in
which are being amortized over estimated service lives of
the related properties.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:
 The Company participates with affiliated companies in
the System in a noncontributory, defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all employees, including
officers. Benefits are based on the employee's years of
service and compensation. The funding policy is to
contribute annually at least the minimum amount
required under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act and not more than can be deducted for federal income
tax purposes.

                           F-60

 The Company also provides partially contributory
medical and life insurance plans for eligible retirees and
dependents. Medical benefits, which comprise the largest
component of the plans, are based upon an age and
years-of-service vesting schedule and other plan
provisions. The funding plan for these costs is to
contribute to Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association (VEBA) trust funds an amount equal to the
annual cost as determined by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106 (described below).
Medical benefits are self-insured; the life insurance plan is
paid through insurance premiums.

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
has prescribed the determination of annual pension and
other postretirement benefits expenses in SFAS No. 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions", and SFAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions", respectively. Pursuant to SFAS
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation", regulatory deferrals of these benefit
expenses are recorded for those jurisdictions which reflect
as net expense the funding of pensions and cash payment
of other benefits in the ratemaking process.


TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS:
 For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, temporary cash investments with original
maturities of three months or less, generally in the form of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and repurchase
agreements, are considered to be the equivalent of cash.
The carrying amount of temporary cash investments
approximates the fair value because of the short-term
maturity of those instruments.


ACCOUNTING CHANGES:
 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Post-
retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". This statement
requires the costs of providing postretirement benefits,
such as medical and life insurance, to be accrued over the
applicable employees' service periods. Prior to 1993,
medical expenses and life insurance premiums paid for
retired employees and their dependents were recorded as
expense in the period they were paid. Also effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes". This standard mandated
a change from the previous income-based deferral
approach to a balance sheet-based liability approach for
computing deferred income taxes as further described in
Note B.

 Federal income tax returns through 1989 have been
examined and substantially settled.

                            F-62
 
 In adopting SFAS No. 109, the Company recognized a
significant increase in both deferred tax assets and
liabilities. At December 31, 1993, the deferred tax assets
and liabilities were comprised of the following:


                                             (Thousands of Dollars)
Deferred tax assets:
 Unamortized investment tax credit                  $40 455
 Unbilled revenue                                    21 626
 Tax interest capitalized                            10 750
 State tax loss carryback/carryforward                8 790
 Contributions in aid of construction                 4 588
 Other                                                7 416

                                                     93 625

Deferred tax liabilities:
 Book vs. tax plant basis differences, net          507 214
 Other                                                8 437

                                                    515 651

Total net deferred tax liabilities                  422 026
Add portion above included in current assets          1 974

Total long-term net deferred tax liabilities       $424 000


 It is expected that regulatory commissions will allow
recovery of the deferred tax liabilities in future years as
they are paid, and accordingly, the Company has recorded
regulatory assets for an amount equal to the $326 million
increase in deferred tax liabilities. Regulatory liabilities
were recorded in an amount equal to the $41 million
increase in deferred tax assets to reflect the Company's
obligation to pass such tax benefits on to its customers as
the benefits are realized in cash in future years. Based on
the provisions in the standard for recording these
regulatory assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, there
was no effect on consolidated net income resulting from
adoption of the standard.

Note C - Dividend Restriction:
 Supplemental indentures relating to most outstanding
bonds of the Company contain dividend restrictions
under the most restrictive of which $285,914,000 of
consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 1993, is
not available for cash dividends on common stock, except
that a portion thereof may be paid as cash dividends
where concurrently an equivalent amount of cash is
received by the Company as a capital contribution or as
the proceeds of the issue and sale of shares of its
common stock.

Note D - Allegheny Generating Company:
 The Company owns 45% of the common stock of
Allegheny Generating Company (AGC), and affiliates of
the Company own the remainder. AGC owns an undivided
40% interest, 840 MW, in the 2,100-MW pumped-storage
hydroelectric station in Bath County, Virginia operated
by the 60% owner, Virginia Power Company, an
unaffiliated utility.

 AGC recovers from the Company and its affiliates all
of its operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation,
taxes, and a return on its investment under a wholesale
rate schedule approved by the FERC. Through February

                           F-63
 
29, 1992, AGC's return on equity (ROE) was adjusted
annually pursuant to a settlement agreement approved
by the FERC. In December 1991, AGC filed for a
continuation of the existing ROE of 11.53% and other
parties (the Consumer Advocate Division of the Public
Service Commission of West Virginia, Maryland People's
Counsel, and Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate,
collectively referred to as the joint consumer advocates or
JCA) filed to reduce the ROE, with any resultant rate
decreases subject to refund from March 1, 1992 through
May 31, 1993. Hearings were completed in June 1992, and
a recommendation was issued by an Administrative Law
Judge (ALJ) on December 21, 1993, for an ROE of
10.83%, which the JCA argues should be further adjusted
to reflect changes in capital market conditions since the
hearings. Exceptions to this recommendation have been
filed by all parties for consideration by the full
Commission. On January 28, 1994, the JCA filed a joint
complaint claiming that both the existing ROE of 11.53%
and the ALJ's recommended ROE of 10.83% are unjust
and unreasonable. This new complaint requests an ROE
of 8.53%, with rates subject to refund beginning
April 1, 1994.

 Following is a summary of financial information
for AGC:

and 1991, the discount rates used were 7.25%, 7.75%, and
8%, and the rates of increase in future compensation
levels were 4.75%, 5.25%, and 5.5%, respectively. The
expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9% in each
of the years 1993, 1992, and 1991.

                             F-65

Note F - Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions:

 The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 as of January 1,
1993, which requires accrual of postretirement benefits
other than pensions (principally health care and life
insurance) for the employee and covered dependents
during the years the employee renders the necessary
service to receive such benefits. Prior to 1993, medical
expenses and life insurance premiums paid by the
Company for retired employees and their dependents
were recorded in expense in the period in which they were
paid and were $1,907,000 and $1,721,000 in 1992 and
1991, respectively.

 SFAS No. 106 postretirement cost in 1993, a portion of
which (about 25%) was charged to plant construction,
included the following components:

                                                 (Thousands of Dollars)
Service cost - benefits earned                          $   939
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement
 benefit obligation                                       4 389
Actual return on plan assets                                 (9)
Amortization of unrecognized transition obligation        2 817
Other net amortization and deferral                           9

SFAS No. 106 postretirement cost                          8 145
Regulatory deferral                                      (1 963)

Net postretirement cost                                  $6 182


 The benefits earned to date and funded status of the
Company's share of the System plan at December 31,
1993, using a measurement date of September 30 were
as follows:

                                                (Thousands of Dollars)

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:
 Retirees                                               $35 748
 Fully eligible employees                                 9 030
 Other employees                                         18 378

  Total obligation                                       63 156
Plan assets at market value in short-term
 investment fund                                          1 510

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
 in excess of plan assets                                61 646
Less:
 Unrecognized cumulative net loss from past
  experience different from that assumed                  3 362
 Unrecognized transition obligation, being amortized
  over 20 years beginning January 1, 1993                53 746

Postretirement benefit liability at
 September 30, 1993                                       4 538
Fourth quarter 1993 contributions and
 benefit payments                                         1 960

Postretirement benefit liability at
 December 31, 1993                                       $2 578

                         F-66

 The unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) at January 1, 1993, of $56,600,000
(transition obligation) is being amortized prospectively
over 20 years as permitted by the standard.

 In determining the APBO at January 1 and December
31, 1993, the discount rates used were 8% and 7.25%, and
the rates of increase in future compensation levels were
5.5% and 4.75%, respectively. For measurement purposes,
a health care trend rate of 14% for 1993, declining 1% each
year thereafter to 7% in the year 2000 and beyond, and
plan provisions which limit future medical and life
insurance benefits were assumed. Increasing the assumed
health care trend rate by 1% in each year would increase
the APBO at December 31, 1993, by $4.3 million and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by
$.4 million.

 Recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs has been authorized
for retail customers in Pennsylvania effective in May 1993
and for the FERC wholesale customers effective in June
1993. The Company has recorded regulatory assets at
December 31, 1993, of $2.0 million relating to SFAS No.
106 costs in Pennsylvania incurred prior to the May rate
order, with the result that adoption of SFAS No. 106 has
had no effect on consolidated net income. The Company
will seek to recover these costs in its next base rate case.



Note G - Stockholders' Equity:
COMMON STOCK AND OTHER PAID-IN CAPITAL:
 The Company issued and sold common stock to its
parent, at $20 per share, 5,000,000 shares in October 1993,
and 1,750,000 shares in December 1991. Other paid-in
capital decreased $145,000 in 1993 and $550,000 in 1992
as a result of the underwriting fees and commissions and
miscellaneous expenses associated with the Company's
sale of $40 million of preferred stock in 1992.

PREFERRED STOCK:
 All of the preferred stock is entitled on voluntary
liquidation to its then current call price and on involuntary
liquidation to $100 per share. The holders of the
Company's market auction preferred stock are entitled to
dividends at a rate determined by an auction held the
business day preceding each quarterly dividend payment
date.

                          F-67

Note H - Long-Term Debt:
 Maturities for long-term debt for the next five years
are: 1994, none; 1995, $27,000,000; 1996 and 1997, none;
and 1998, $103,500,000. Substantially all of the properties
of the Company are held subject to the lien securing its
first mortgage bonds. Some properties are also subject to
a second lien securing certain pollution control and solid
waste disposal notes. Certain first mortgage bond series
are not redeemable by certain refunding until dates
established in the respective supplemental indentures.

 In 1993, the Company sold $102 million of 5-1/2%
5-year first mortgage bonds to refund a $25 million 7%
issue due in 1997, a $25 million 7-7/8% issue due in 1999,
and a $52 million 7-1/8% issue due in 1998, and sold $80
million of 6-3/8% 10-year first mortgage bonds to refund
a $35 million 7-5/8% issue due in 2002 and a $40 million
8-1/8% issue due in 2001. The Company also issued $7.75
million of 5.95% 20-year Pollution Control Revenue
Notes to refund a $7.75 million 9-3/8% issue due in 2013,
and issued $61.5 million of 10-year 4.95% Pollution
Control Revenue Notes to refund a $30 million 9-3/4%
series and a $31.5 million 9-1/2% series due in 2003.

 The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December
31, 1993 and 1992, was $823,333,000 and $783,379,000,
respectively, based on actual market prices or market
prices of similar issues.


Note I - Short-Term Financing:
 To provide interim financing and support for
outstanding commercial paper, the System companies
have established lines of credit with several banks. The
Company has SEC authorization for total short-term
borrowings of $170 million, including money pool
borrowings described below. The Company has fee
arrangements on all of its lines of credit and no
compensating balance requirements. In addition to bank
lines of credit, in 1992 the Company and its affiliates
established an internal money pool as a facility to
accommodate intercompany short-term borrowing needs,
to the extent that certain of the companies have funds
available. In January 1994, the Company and its affiliates
jointly established an aggregate $300 million multi-year
credit program which provides that the Company may
borrow up to $135 million on a standby revolving credit
basis. There was no short-term debt outstanding at the
end of 1993 or 1992. The Company had outstanding at the
end of 1993 and 1992, $24.9 million and $20.9 million,
respectively, of notes receivable from affiliates in the
money pool.

                            F-68

Note J - Commitments and Contingencies:
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM:
 The Company has entered into commitments for its
construction program, for which expenditures are
estimated to be $258 million for 1994 and $208 million for
1995. These estimates include expenditures for the
program of complying with the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) as discussed below.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
 System companies are subject to laws, regulations, and
uncertainties with respect to air and water quality, land
use, and other environmental matters. Compliance may
require them to incur substantial additional costs to
modify or replace existing and proposed equipment and
facilities and may affect adversely the lead time, size, and
siting of future generating stations, increase the
complexity and cost of pollution control equipment, and
otherwise add to the cost of future operations.

 Construction expenditures through the year 2000 will
include substantial amounts for compliance with Phase I
and Phase II of the CAAA. The Company is estimating
expenditures of approximately $700 million, which
includes $207 million expended through 1993, depending
on the strategy eventually selected for complying with
Phase II. Construction estimates for 1994 and 1995
include $82 million and $33 million, respectively, for the
program of complying with the CAAA.

 In complying with the CAAA, the Company will face
uncertainties, including regulatory administrative
interpretations and contingencies, such as potential cost
overruns, equipment performance, and cost recovery
in rates.


LITIGATION AND OTHER:
 In the normal course of business, the Company becomes
involved in various legal proceedings. The Company does
not believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings
will have a material effect on its financial position.

 The Company is guarantor as to 45% of a $75 million
revolving credit agreement of AGC, which in 1993 was
used by AGC solely as support for its indebtedness for
commercial paper outstanding.

31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(These notes are an integral part of the financial statements.)

Note A - Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies:
 The Company was incorporated in Virginia in 1981. Its
common stock is owned by Monongahela Power
Company - 27%, The Potomac Edison Company - 28%,
and West Penn Power Company - 45% (the Parents). The
Parents are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Allegheny
Power System, Inc. and are a part of the Allegheny Power
integrated electric utility system. The Company is subject
to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) and by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). Significant accounting policies of the Company
are summarized below.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT:
 Property, plant, and equipment are stated at original
cost, and consist of a 40% undivided interest in the Bath
County pumped-storage hydroelectric station and its
connecting transmission facilities. The cost of depreciable
property units retired plus removal costs less salvage are
charged to accumulated depreciation.

DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE:
 Provisions for depreciation are determined on a
straight-line method based on estimated service lives of
depreciable properties and amounted to approximately
2.1% of average depreciable property in each of the years
1993, 1992, and 1991. The cost of maintenance and of
certain replacements of property, plant, and equipment is
charged to operating expenses.

INCOME TAXES:
 The Company joins with its parents and affiliates in
filing a consolidated federal income tax return. The
consolidated tax liability is allocated among the
participants generally in proportion to the taxable income
of each participant, except that no subsidiary pays tax in
excess of its separate return tax liability.

 Financial accounting income before income taxes
differs from taxable income principally because certain
income and deductions for tax purposes are recorded in
the financial income statement in another period.
Differences between income tax that would be paid if
taxes were computed on the basis of financial accounting
income instead of taxable income are deferred.

 Prior to 1987, provisions for federal income tax were
reduced by investment credits, and amounts equivalent to
such credits were charged to income with concurrent
credits to a deferred account, balances in which are being
amortized over estimated service lives of the related
properties.

                            F-75

ACCOUNTING CHANGE:
 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". This standard
mandated a change from the previous income-based
deferral approach to a balance sheet-based liability
approach for computing deferred income taxes.

Note B - Income Taxes:
 Details of federal income tax provisions are:

</TABLE>

 In 1993, the total provision for income taxes
($13,262,000) was less than the amount produced by
applying the federal income tax statutory rate to financial
accounting income before income taxes ($14,155,000),
due primarily to amortization of deferred investment
credit ($1,316,000).

 Federal income tax returns through 1989 have been
examined and substantially settled.

 The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 as of January 1,
1993, and in doing so recognized a significant increase in
both deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31,
1993, the deferred tax assets and liabilities were comprised
of the following:
                                         (Thousands of Dollars)
Deferred tax assets
 Unamortized investment tax credit              $ 28 869

 Other                                               152
                                                 154 717

Total net deferred tax liabilities              $125 848

                            F-76

 It is expected the FERC will allow recovery of the
deferred tax liabilities in future years as they are paid, and
accordingly, the Company has recorded regulatory assets
for an amount equal to the $4 million increase in deferred
tax liabilities. Regulatory liabilities were recorded in an
amount equal to the $29 million increase in deferred tax
assets to reflect the Company's obligation to pass such tax
benefits on to its customers as the benefits are realized in
cash in future years. Based on the provisions in the
standard for recording these regulatory assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet, there was no effect on net
income resulting from adoption of the standard.

Note C - Long-Term Debt:
 The Company had long-term debt outstanding
as follows:

</TABLE>

                               F-77

 The Company has a revolving credit agreement with a
group of seven banks which provides for loans of up to
$75 million at any one time outstanding through 1997.
Each bank has the option to discontinue its loans after
1997 upon three years' prior written notice. Without such
notice, the loans are automatically extended for one year.
Amounts borrowed are guaranteed by the Parents in
proportion to their equity interest. Interest rates are
determined at the time of each borrowing. The revolving
credit agreement serves as support for the Company's
commercial paper. In addition to bank lines of credit, the
Company and its affiliates in 1992 established an internal
money pool as a facility to accommodate intercompany
short-term borrowing needs, to the extent that certain of
the companies have funds available. At the end of 1993,
the Company had outstanding $29,500,000 of money
pool borrowings from affiliates.


 Maturities for long-term debt for the next five years
are: 1994, 10,000,000; 1995, $1,000,000; 1996, $6,375,000;
1997, $61,462,000; and 1998, $60,000,000.

 The estimated fair value of debentures and medium-
term notes at December 31, 1993 and 1992, was
$233,445,000 and $249,850,000 respectively, based on
actual market prices or market prices of similar issues.
The carrying amount of commercial paper and notes
payable to affiliates approximates their fair value because
of the short maturity of those instruments.

(a) APS has no paid employees.  All salaries and bonuses are paid by APSC.

(b) Bonus amounts are determined and paid in April of the year in which the 
    figure appears and are based upon performance in the prior year.

(c) Amounts constituting less than 10% of the total annual salary and bonus are
    not disclosed.  All officers did receive miscellaneous other items 
    amounting to less than 10% of total annual salary and bonus.

(d) Effective January 1, 1992, the basic group life insurance provided 
employees was reduced from two times salary during employment, which reduced
to one times salary after 5 years in retirement, to a new plan which
provides one times salary until retirement and $25,000 thereafter. Executive
officers and other senior managers remain under the prior plan.  In order to
pay for this insurance for these executives, during 1992 insurance was
purchased on the lives of each of them.  Effective January 1, 1993, APS
started to provide funds to pay for the future benefits due under the
supplemental retirement plan (Secured Benefit Plan)
as described in note (a) on p. 53.  To do this, APS purchased, during 1993, life
insurance on the lives of the covered executives.  The premium costs of both the
1992 and 1993 policies plus a factor for the use of the money are returned to 
APS at the earlier of (a) death of the insured or (b) the later of age 65 or 10 
years from the date of the policy's inception.  The figures in this column 
include the present value of the executives' cash value at retirement 
attributable to the current year's premium payment for both the Executive
Life Insurance and Secured Benefit Plans (based upon the premium, future valued
to retirement, using the policy internal rate of return minus the 
corporation's premium payment), as well as the premium paid for the basic
Group Life Insurance program plan and the contribution for the 401(k) plan.  For
1993, the figure shown includes amounts representing (a) the aggregate of life
insurance premiums and dollar value of the benefit to the executive officer of
the remainder of the premium paid on the Group Life Insurance program and the
Executive Life Insurance and Secured Benefit Plans and (b) 401(k)
contributions as follows:  Mr. Bergman $42,392 and $4,497;
Mr. Garnett $19,509 and $4,497; Mr. Skrgic $14,181 and $4,497; Ms. Gormley
$11,152 and $4,294; and Mr. Jones $8,382 and $4,497, respectively.

(e) These amounts as previously reported did not include the following amounts
    representing the dollar value of the benefit to the executive officer of the
    remainder of the premium paid on the Executive Life Insurance Plan: Mr. 
    Bergman $786; Mr. Garnett $210; Mr. Skrgic $218; Ms. Gormley $232; and
    Mr. Jones $519.

(f) See Executive Officers of the Registrants for other positions held.

(g) Although less than 10% of total annual salary and bonus, Mr. Skrgic received
    a $15,000 housing allowance in 1993, 1992 and 1991.

(h) The incentive plan was not in effect for these officers in 1991.

(i) Includes $15,000 housing allowance for both 1993 and 1992 and miscellaneous
    other items totaling $2,423 and $2,457 for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(a)        Bonus amounts are determined and paid in April of the year in which the figure
           appears and are based upon performance in the prior year.

(b)        Effective January 1, 1992, the basic group life insurance provided employees was
           reduced from two times salary during employment, which reduced to one times
           salary after 5 years in retirement, to a new plan which provides one times salary
           until retirement and $25,000 thereafter.  Executive officers and other senior
           managers remain under the prior plan.  In order to pay for this insurance for
           these executives, during 1992 insurance was purchased on the lives of each of
           them.  Effective January 1, 1993, APS started to provide funds to pay for the
           future benefits due under the supplemental retirement plan (Secured Benefit Plan)
           as described in note (a) on p. 53.  To do this, APS purchased, during 1993, life
           insurance on the lives of the covered executives.  The premium costs of both the
           1992 and 1993 policies plus a factor for the use of the money are returned to APS
           at the earlier of (a) death of the insured or (b) the later of age 65 or 10 years
           from the date of the policy's inception.  The figures in this column include the
           present value of the executives' cash value at retirement attributable to the
           current year's premium payment for both the Executive Life Insurance and Secured
           Benefit Plans (based upon the premium, future valued to retirement, using the
           policy internal rate of return minus the corporation's premium payment), as well
           as the premium paid for the basic Group Life Insurance program plan and the
           contribution for the 401(k) plan.  For 1993, the figure shown includes amounts
           representing (a) the aggregate of life insurance premiums and dollar value of the
           benefit to the executive officer of the remainder of the premium paid on the
           Group Life Insurance program and the Executive Life Insurance and Secured Benefit
           Plans and (b) 401(k) contributions as follows:  Mr. Noia $15,610 and $4,497; Mr.
           Murdock $9,081 and $3,855; Mr. Latimer $9,371 and $3,600; and Mr. Kloc $7,829 and
           $3,375, respectively.

(c)        The total compensation Messrs. Bergman, Garnett, Skrgic, Jones and Ms. Gormley
           received for services in all capacities to APS, APSC and the Subsidiaries is set
           forth in the Summary Compensation Table for APS.

(d)        These amounts as previously reported did not include the following amounts
           representing the dollar value of the benefit to the executive officer of the
           remainder of the premium paid on the Executive Life Insurance Plan: Mr. Noia
           $186; Mr. Murdock $310; Mr. Latimer $211; and Mr. Kloc $99.

(e)        The incentive plan was not in effect for these officers in 1991.

(a) Assumes present insured benefit plan and salary continue and retirement at 
    age 65 with single life annuity.  Under plan provisions, the annual 
    rate of benefits payable at the normal retirement age of 65 are computed 
    by adding (i) 1% of final average pay up to covered compensation times years
    of service up to 35 years, plus (ii) 1.5% of final average pay in excess
    of covered compensation times years of service up to 35 years, plus (iii) 
    1.3% of final average pay times years of
    service in excess of 35 years.  Covered compensation is the average of the
    maximum taxable Social Security wage bases during the 35 years preceding the
    member's retirement, except that years before 1959 are not taken 
    into account for purposes of this average.  The final average pay benefit 
    is based on the member's average total earnings during the 
    highest-paid 60 consecutive calendar months or,
    if smaller, the member's highest rate of pay as of any July 1st. 
    Effective July 1, 1993 the maximum amount of any employee's compensation
    that may be used in these computations is $235,840.  The maximum
    amount will be reduced to $150,000 effective July 1, 1994 as a result of 
    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.  Benefits for employees 
    retiring between 55 and 62 differ from the foregoing. 

    Pursuant to a supplemental plan (Secured Benefit Plan), senior executives of
    Allegheny Power System companies who retire at age 60 or over with 40 
    or more years of service are entitled to a supplemental retirement 
    benefit in an amount that, together with the benefits under the 
    basic plan and from other employment, will equal 60% of the executive's
    highest average monthly earnings for any 36 consecutive months.  The
    supplemental benefit is reduced for less than 40 years service and for
 retirement age from 60 to 55.  It is included in the amounts
 shown where applicable.  In order to provide funds to pay such benefits,
 effective January 1, 1993 the Company purchased insurance on the lives of the
 plan participants.  The Secured Benefit Plan has been designed that if the
 assumptions made as to mortality experience, policy dividends, and other 
 factors are realized, the Company will recover all premium payments, plus a 
 factor for
 the use of the Company's money.  All executive officers are participants in the
 Secured Benefit Plan.  This does not include benefits from an Employee Stock
 Ownership and Savings Plan (ESOSP) established as a non-contributory stock
 ownership plan for all eligible employees effective January 1, 1976, and 
 amended in 1984 to include a savings program.  Under the ESOSP for 1993, all 
 eligible employees may elect to have from 2% to 7% of their compensation 
 contributed to the Plan as pre-tax contributions and an additional 1% to 6% as 
 post-tax
 contributions.  Employees direct the investment of these contributions into one
 or more of five available funds.  Each System company matches 50% of the 
 pre-tax  contributions up to 6% of compensation with common stock of Allegheny
 Power System, Inc.  Effective January 1, 1993 the maximum amount of any 
 employee's
 compensation that may be used in these computations is $235,840.  Effective
 January 1, 1994, the amount was reduced to $150,000 as a result of The Omnibus
 Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.  Employees' interests in the ESOSP vest
 immediately.  Their pre-tax contributions may be withdrawn only upon meeting
 certain financial hardship requirements or upon termination of employment.

(b)        APS has no paid employees.  These executives are employees of APSC.

(c)        See Executive Officers of the Registrants for other positions held.

(d) The total estimated annual benefits on retirement payable to Mr. Bergman for
 services in all capacities to APS, APSC and the Subsidiaries is set forth in 
 the table for APS.


                                   Compensation of Directors


           In 1993, APS directors who were not officers or
employees of System companies received for all services
to System companies (a) $16,000 in retainer fees, (b)
$800 for each committee meeting attended, except
Executive Committee meetings which are $200, and (c)
$250 for each Board meeting of each company attended. 
Under an unfunded deferred compensation plan, a
director may elect to defer receipt of all or part of
his or her director's fees for succeeding calendar
years to be payable with accumulated interest when the
director ceases to be such, in equal annual
installments, or, upon authorization by the Board of
Directors, in a lump sum.

         of Directors finds that the System's financial
         performance is satisfactory from the perspective of its
         stockholders

         -- 100% of a target incentive award will be paid to a
         participant only if System, Responsibility Unit, and 
         Individual target performance measures are fully
         achieved

         Performance Schedules

         -- The Performance Schedule describes ratings and
         weightings for each performance measure at all levels
         of performance  

         -- As soon as practicable each year, Participant
         Performance Schedules for that year will be issued 
         
         Performance Ratings 

         -- Target performance represents the full and complete
         attainment of expectations in the performance area; it
         is rated 1.0

         -- Performance that is acceptable but does not fully
         meet expectations can earn a rating but, of course,
         less than  1.0

         -- Exceeding expectations can result in a performance
         rating as high as  1.25

         -- Unacceptable individual performance will result in
         no award regardless of System or Unit Performance.

         Weightings

         -- Weightings will be established each year for System,
         Unit and Individual performance measures.

         Calculation of Award

         -- A participant's award, if any, will be determined by 
         multiplying the participant's assigned incentive  
         percentage times his/her rounded total performance      
         rating times his/her salary at the close of the year    
         prior to the year for which the award is to be made.

         The Management Review Committee or the Board of
         Directors,at its discretion, may supplement or decrease
         any partici-pant's calculated award to reflect
         extraordinary circumstances provided that it records
         its reason for doing so.

VII.     FORM AND TIMING OF PAYOUT                          

         Calculation of awards will be made as soon as
         practicable after the close of books for the year
         measured, but no award will be paid until it has been
         approved by the Management Review Committee or the
         Board of Directors, as appropriate.

         Payment will be in current cash unless the Management
         Review Committee or the Board at its discretion
         provides for deferral.

VIII.         TERMINATION AND TRANSFER PROVISIONS

              Termination Provisions

         -- Awards may at the discretion of the Management
         Review Committee or the Board be calculated on the
         basis of a full year's performance and prorated to the
         number of whole months actually served, except in the
         case of voluntary termination (other than retirement
         after the second quarter of the year) or termination by
         the company (with or without cause), in which case no
         award is made for year of termination.

         Designation of "Unit" in cases of transfer among
         Operating Companies, Central Services, Bulk Power
         Supply, and New York                               
         
         -- Weighting will be based on the number of months
         participant was in each unit.

IX.      PLAN ADMINISTRATION

         Administration of the plan is the responsibility of the
         Management Review Committee of the Board of Directors.

         --   The Committee is responsible for review and
         administration of all Systemwide goals and has final
         approval over these and other matters involving the
         plan, including eligibility.

                 The Employee will purchase and own a certain
                 policy of life insurance on his own life, being
                 Policy No.                                issued
                 by Security Life of Denver Insurance Company. 
                 Said policy is hereinafter called "the Policy" and
                 said life insurance company is hereinafter called
                 "the Insurer".  The Employee's ownership of the
                 Policy shall be subject to all the terms and
                 conditions set forth in this Agreement.

                 The Employer shall pay the entire annual premium
                 for the Policy directly to the Insurer.

             C.           Collateral Assignment and
                          Possession of Policy

                 Employer provided for in Section B, above, Part II
                 of this Agreement includes an assignment of the
                 policy or the Employee's interest therein
                 (hereinafter called "Collateral Assignment") and
                 provides for the transfer of possession of the
                 Policy to the Employer during the term specified
                 in Part II of this Agreement.  Except as provided
                 in or as otherwise consistent with the provisions
                 of this Agreement, the Employer covenants that it

                 the Insurer in order to make any change desired by
                 the Employee as to the designation of beneficiary
                 or the selection of a settlement option, subject,
                 however, to the Collateral Assignment provisions
                 hereof.

                 from the Policy equal to one (1) times his base
                 salary, excluding bonuses, until his retirement. 
                 At retirement, his death benefit shall increase to
                 two (2) times salary for the next 12 months, then
                 shall decrease by 20% of final salary each year
                 until the earlier of the fifth anniversary of
                 retirement or age 70, at which time it will be one
                 (1) times salary.

                 The Employee shall have the right to name the
                 Policy beneficiary.  However, in the event of the
                 Employee's death, the Employer shall have an
                 interest in the Policy proceeds equal to the total
                 Policy proceeds in excess of the amount due to the
                 Employee pursuant to this Section above.



             E.           Procedure at Employee's Death
                 Upon the death of the Employee while the policy
                 and this Agreement are in force and subject to the
                 provisions of Parts I and II hereof, the Employer
                 shall promptly take all necessary steps, including
                 rendering of such assistance as may reasonably be
                 required by the Employee's beneficiary, to obtain
                 payment from the Insurer of the amounts payable
                 under the Policy to the respective parties, as
                 provided under Section D, above.



             F.           Termination of Agreement
                 Part I of this Agreement shall terminate when the
                 first of any of the following events occur:
                 1.       Termination of the Employee's employment with
                          the Employer prior to retirement;
                 2.       The later of the Employee's actual retirement
                          or ten years from the date of issuance of the
                          Policy;
                 3.       Performance of the Agreement's terms
                          following the death of the Employee;
                 4.       Failure by the Employer, for any reason, to
                          make the premium contributions required under
                          Section B of this Agreement;

             G.           Disposition of Policy Upon Termination of
                          Agreement
                 Upon the termination of Part I of this Agreement
                 for any reason other than Section F3 above, the
                 Employee shall have a thirty (30) day option to
                 satisfy the Collateral Assignment regarding the
                 policy held by the Employer in accordance with the
                 terms of this Paragraph G.  The amount necessary
                 to satisfy such Collateral Assignment shall be an
                 amount equal to the total premium payments made,
                 from time to time, greater than the amount of cash
                 value under the Policy and, at the option of the
                 Employee, either shall be paid directly by the
                 Employee or through the Employer's collection from
                 the cash value under the policy.

                 If the Policy shall then be encumbered by
                 assignment, policy loan, or other means which have
                 been the result of the Employer's actions, the
                 Employer shall either remove such encumbrance, or
                 reduce the amount necessary to satisfy the
                 Collateral Assignment by the total amount of
                 indebtedness outstanding against the Policy.  If
                 the Employee exercises his option to satisfy the
                 Collateral Assignment, the Employer shall execute
                 all necessary documents required by the Insurer to
                 remove and satisfy the Collateral Assignment
                 outstanding on the Policy.  If the Employee does
                 not exercise his option to satisfy the Collateral
                 Assignment outstanding on the Policy, the Employee
                 shall execute all documents necessary to transfer
                 ownership of the Policy to the Employer.  Such
                 Transfer shall constitute satisfaction of any
                 obligation the Employee has to the Employer with
                 respect to this Agreement.  The Employer shall
                 then pay to the Employee the amount, if any, by
                 which the cash surrender value of the Policy
                 exceeds the amount necessary to satisfy the
                 Collateral Assignment.

             H.           Employee's Right to Assign His/Her Interest
                 The Employee shall have the right to transfer
                 his/her entire interest in the Policy (other than
                 rights assigned to the Employer pursuant to this
                 Agreement and subject to the obligations of any
                 outstanding Collateral Assignment).  If the
                 Employee makes such a transfer, all his/her rights
                 shall be vested in the Transferee and the Employee
                 shall have no further interest in the Policy and
                 Agreement.  Any assignee shall be subject to all
                 obligations of the Employee under both Parts I and
                 II of this Agreement.

             I.           Insurer's Obligations
                 The Insurer is not party to this Agreement.  It is
                 understood by the parties hereto that in issuing
                 such Policy of insurance, the Insurer shall have
                 no liability except as set forth in the Policy and
                 except as set forth in any assignment of the
                 Policy filed at its Home Office and in Section J
                 of this Agreement.  Except as set forth in Section
                 J, the Insurer shall not be bound to inquire into,
                 or take notice of, any of the covenants herein
                 contained as to the Policy of insurance or as to
                 application of proceeds of such Policy.  Upon the
                 death of the Insured and payment of the proceeds
                 in accordance with Section J of this Agreement,
                 the insurer shall be discharged of all liability.

             J.           Claims Procedure
                 The following claims procedure shall apply to the
                 Policy and the Executive Life Insurance Program:

                 1.       Filing of a claim for benefits.  The Employee
                          or the beneficiary of the Policy shall make a
                          claim for the benefits provided under the
                          Policy in the manner provided in the Policy.
                 2.       Claim denial.  With respect to a claim for
                          benefits under said Policy, the Insurer shall
                          be the entity which reviews and makes
                          decisions on claim denials according to the
                          terms of the Policy.
                 3.       Notification to claimant of decision.  If a
                          claim is wholly or partially denied, notice
                          of the decision, meeting the requirements of
                          Section J4, following shall be furnished to
                          the claimant within a reasonable period of
                          time after a claim has been filed.
                 4.       Content of notice.  The Insurer shall
                          provide, to any claimant who is denied a
                          claim for benefits, written notice setting
                          forth in a manner calculated to be understood
                          by the claimant, the following:
                          a.      The specific reason or reasons for the
                                  denial;
                          b.      Specific reference to pertinent Policy
                                  provisions or provisions of this
                                  Agreement on which the denial is based;
                          c.      A description of any additional material
                                  or information necessary for the
                                  claimant to perfect the claim and an
                                  explanation of which such material or
                                  information is necessary; and
                          d.      An explanation of this Agreement's claim
                                  review procedure, as set forth in
                                  Sections J5 and J6.

                 5.       Review procedure.  The purpose of the review
                          procedure set forth in this subsection and
                          subsection 6, following, is to provide a
                          method by which a claimant under the Policy
                          may have a reasonable opportunity to appeal a
                          denial of claim for a full and fair review. 
                          To accomplish that purpose, the claimant or
                          his/her duly authorized representative:
                          a.      May request a review upon written
                                  application to the Insurer;
                          b.      May review the Policy; and
                          c.      May submit issues and comments in
                                  writing.

                          A claimant, (or his/her duly authorized
                          representative), shall request a review by
                          filing a written application of review at any
                          time within sixty (60) days after receipt by
                          the claimant of written notice of the denial
                          of the claim.

                 6.       Decision on review.  A decision on review of
                          a denial of a claim shall be made in the
                          following matter;
                          a.      The decision on review shall be made by
                                  the Insurer which may, at its
                                  discretion, hold a hearing on the denied
                                  claim.  The Insurer shall make its
                                  decision promptly, unless special
                                  circumstances (such as the need to hold
                                  a hearing) require an extension of time
                                  for processing, in which case a decision
                                  shall be rendered as soon as possible,
                                  but not later than on hundred twenty
                                  (120) days after receipt of the request
                                  for review.
                          b.      The decision on review shall be in
                                  writing and shall include specific
                                  reasons for the decision, written in a
                                  manner calculated to be understood by
                                  the claimant, and specific references to
                                  the pertinent Policy provision or
                                  provision of this Agreement on which the
                                  decision is based.

                 Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or
                 the Policy, no Employee, assignee or beneficiary
                 may commence any action in any court regarding the
                 Policy prior to pursuing all rights of an Employee
                 under this Section J.

PART II - Assignment of Life Insurance Policy as Collateral

A.           For value received and in specific consideration of
             the premium payments made by the Employer as set
             forth in Section B of Part I hereof, the Employee
             hereby assigns, transfers and sets over to the
             Employer (herein in this Part II called the
             "Assignee"), its successors and assigns, the Policy
             issued by the Insurer upon the life of Employee and
             all claims, options, privileges, rights, titles and
             interest therein and thereunder (except as provided
             in Paragraph C hereof), subject to all terms and
             conditions of the Policy and to all superior liens,
             if any, which the Insurer may have against the
             Policy.  The Employee by this instrument agrees and
             the Assignee by the acceptance of this assignment
             agrees to the conditions and provisions herein set
             forth.

B.           It is expressly agreed that, without detracting from
             the generality of the foregoing, the following
             specific rights are included in this Agreement and
             Collateral Assignment and inure to the Assignee by
             virtue hereof:
                 1.       The sole right to collect from the Insurer
                          the net proceeds of the Policy in excess of
                          the proceeds due the Employee under Part I,
                          Section D when it becomes a claim by death or
                          maturity;
                 2.       The sole right to surrender the Policy and
                          receive the surrender value thereof at any
                          time provided by the terms of the Policy and
                          at such other times as the Insurer may allow;
                 3.       The sole right to obtain one or more loans or
                          advances on the policy, either from the
                          Insurer or, at any time, from other persons,
                          and to pledge or assign the Policy as
                          security for such loans or advances;
                 4.       The sole right to collect and receive all
                          distributions or share of surplus, dividend
                          deposits or additions to he Policy now or
                          hereafter made or apportioned thereto, and to
                          exercise any and all options contained in the
                          Policy with respect thereto; provided, that
                          unless and until the Assignee shall notify
                          the Insurer in writing to the contrary, the
                          distributions or share of surplus, dividend
                          deposits and additions shall continue on the
                          Policy in force at the time of this
                          assignment; and
                 5.       The sole right to exercise all nonforfeiture
                          rights permitted by the terms of the Policy
                          or allowed by the Insurer and to receive all
                          benefits and advantages derived therefrom.

C.           It is expressly agreed that the following specific
             rights, so long as the Policy has not been
             surrendered, are reserved and excluded from this
             Agreement and Collateral Assignment and do not pass
             by virtue hereof:
                 1.       The right to designate and change the
                          beneficiary;
                 2.       The right to elect any optional mode of
                          settlement permitted by the Policy or allowed
                          by the Insurer;

                 provided, however, that the reservation of these
                 rights shall in no way impair the right of the
                 Assignee to surrender the Policy completely with
                 all its incidents or impair any other right of the
                 Assignee hereunder, and any designation or change
                 of beneficiary or election of a mode of settlement
                 shall be made subject to this Agreement and
                 Collateral Assignment and to the rights of the
                 Assignee hereunder.

D.           This Collateral Assignment is made and the Policy is
             to be held as collateral security for any and all
             liabilities of the Employee to the Assignee arising
             under this Agreement (all of which liabilities
             secured to or to become secured are herein called
             "Liabilities").  It is expressly agreed that all
             sums received by the Assignee hereunder either in
             event of death of the Insured, the maturity or
             surrender of the Policy, the obtaining of a loan or
             advance on the Policy, or otherwise, shall first be
             applied to the payment of the liability for premiums
             paid by the Assignee on the Policy.

E.           The Assignee covenants and agrees with the Employee
             as follows:
                 1.       That any balance of sums, if any, received
                          hereunder from the Insurer remaining after
                          payment of the existing Liabilities, matured
                          or unmatured, shall be paid by the Assignee
                          to the persons entitled thereto under the
                          terms of the policy had this Collateral
                          Assignment not been executed:
                 2.       That the Assignee will not exercise either
                          the right to surrender the Policy or the
                          right to obtain policy loans from the
                          Insurer, until there has been either default
                          in any of the Liabilities pursuant to this
                          Agreement or termination of Part I of said
                          Agreement as therein provided; and

                 3.       That the Assignee will, upon request, forward
                          without reasonable delay to the Insurer the
                          Policy for endorsement of any designation or
                          change of beneficiary or any election of an
                          optional mode of settlement.

F.           The Employee declares that no proceedings in
             bankruptcy are pending against him/her and that
             his/her property is not subject to any assignment
             for the benefit of creditors.

                                   AND COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is entered into this _____ day of __________, 1992 by
and between Allegheny Power Service Corporation (hereinafter called the
"Employer" in Part I or "Assignee" in Part II), and
___________________________ (hereinafter called the "Employee").

WHEREAS the Employee is currently a valued employee and Executive of
Employer;
WHEREAS the Employer wishes to assist the Employee with his (or her)
personal future financial program and the Employee desires to accept such
assistance; and

WHEREAS in consideration of the Employer agreeing to pay all of the
premiums, the Employee agrees to grant the Employer security for the recovery
of the Employer's premium outlay and the excess, if any, over the amounts due
the Employee under Part I of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for value received, the Employer and the Employee
agree as follows:


                         Part I - Individual Life Insurance Agreement

A.           Description of Policy - Policy Ownership

       In furtherance of the purposes of the Agreement, the Employee will
       purchase and own a certain policy of life insurance on his own life,
       being Policy No. _____, issued by Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
       Said policy is hereinafter called the "Policy" and said life insurance
       company is hereinafter called the "Insurer".  The Employee's
       ownership of the Policy shall be subject to all the terms and
       conditions set forth in this Agreement.

B.           Payment of Premiums
             The Employer shall pay the entire annual premium for the Policy
             directly to the Insurer.

C.        Collateral Assignment and Possession of Policy
          To secure repayment of premiums paid by and amounts due to the
          Employer provided for in Section B, above, and Sections D and E,
          below, Part II of this Agreement includes an assignment of the
          policy or the Employee's interest therein (hereinafter called
          "Collateral Assignment") and provides for the transfer of possession
          of the policy, and the right to receive from the carrier and possess
          billings and policy statements, to the Employer during the term
          specified in Part II of this Agreement.  Except as provided in or as
          otherwise consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the
          Employer covenants that it will not exercise its rights under the
          Collateral Assignment provisions of this Agreement in such a
          manner as to defeat the rights of the Employee or the policy
          beneficiary under this Agreement.  Specifically, the Employer
          covenants that it will not surrender the Policy unless Part I of the
          Agreement has terminated as provided in Section G and there has
          been a default in Employee's obligation under Section H of this Part
          I.  The Employer shall have possession of the Policy during the
          period that the Employer makes premium payments and until all
          amounts due the Employer are repaid.  The Employer shall make the
          Policy available to the Insurer in order to make any change desired
          by the Employee as to the designation of beneficiary or the selection
          of a settlement option, subject, however, to the provisions of this
          Agreement and the Collateral Assignment.

D.        Beneficiary Designation and Payment of Policy Proceeds
          The Employee shall be entitled to a death benefit from the Policy in
          the amount required to provide an annuity equal to (under then
          current annuity settlement rates from the Insurer) the supplemental
          retirement benefit that would be provided under Sections 4A and 4B
          of the Allegheny Power System Supplemental Executive Retirement
          Plan effective July 1, 1990, attached hereto as Appendix I, excluding
          the provision in Section 4A that states, "...provided that, if a
          Participant is discharged from employment for cause or terminates
          employment with the Companies prior to retirement under the
          Allegheny Power System Retirement Plan for any reason
          whatsoever, other than death, such eligibility will terminate and no
          benefit shall be payable to such Participant from this Plan."

          The Employer shall be the sole beneficiary of the policy until such
          time as the Employee has at least 10 years of service and is at least
          55 years old.  After that time and while this Agreement is in force,
          the following shall occur:

             1.  the beneficiary of the Employee's death benefit shall be the
                 employee's spouse;

          2.  in the event of the Employee's death, the Employer shall be
              entitled to Policy proceeds equal to the total Policy proceeds in
              excess of the amount due to the Employee pursuant to this
              Section, above; and

             3.  if the employee is not married, he/she is entitled to no death
                 benefit while this agreement is in force.

E.           Policy Cash Values
             The Employee shall be entitled to cash values of the Policy in
             excess of the premiums paid by the Employer pursuant to Section B,
             Above, but not to exceed the death benefits to which he/she is
             entitled under Section D, above.  If the Employee is not married,
            he/she shall be entitled to cash values determined as if he/she were
             married.

           The Employer shall be entitled to Policy cash values in excess of the
             amount due to the Employee under this Section, above.

F.           Procedure at Employee's Death
             Upon the death of the Employee while the Policy and this
             Agreement are in force and subject to the provisions of Parts I and
             II hereof, the Employer shall promptly take all necessary steps,
             including rendering of such assistance as may reasonably be
             required, to obtain payment from the Insurer of the amounts payable
             under the Policy to the respective parties, as provided under 
             Section D, above.



G.        Termination of Agreement
          Part I of this Agreement shall terminate when the first of any of the
          following events occur:
          1.  Termination of the Employee's employment with the Employer
              prior to retirement;
             2.  The later of the Employee's actual retirement or ten years from
                 the date of issuance of the policy;
             3.  Performance of the Agreement's terms following the death of the
                 Employee;
             4.  Failure by the Employer, for any reason, to make the premium
                 contributions required under Section B of this Agreement.

H.           Disposition of Policy Upon Termination of Agreement
             Upon the termination of Part I of this Agreement for any reason
             other than Section G3 above, the Employee shall have a thirty (30)
            day option to satisfy the Collateral Assignment regarding the policy
             held by the Employer in accordance with the terms of this Paragraph
             H.  The amount necessary to satisfy such Collateral Assignment
             shall be an amount equal to the total premium payments made by
             the Employer, plus any excess amounts as determined in Section E,
            above, but no greater than the amount of cash value under the Policy
            and, at the option of the Employee, either shall be paid directly by
             the Employee or through the Employer's collection from the cash
             value of the Policy.

             If the Policy shall then be encumbered by assignment, policy loan,
             or other means which have been the result of the Employer's
             actions, the Employer shall either remove such encumbrance, or
             reduce the amount necessary to satisfy the Collateral Assignment by
            the total amount of indebtedness outstanding against the Policy.  If
             the Employee exercises his option to satisfy the Collateral
             Assignment, the Employer shall execute all necessary documents
             required by the Insurer to remove and satisfy the Collateral
             Assignment outstanding on the Policy.  If the Employee does not
            exercise his option to satisfy the Collateral Assignment outstanding
             on the Policy, the Employee shall execute all documents necessary
             to transfer ownership of the Policy to the Employer.  Such transfer
             shall constitute satisfaction of any obligation the Employee has to
             the Employer with respect to this Agreement.  The Employer shall
             then pay to the Employee the amount, if any, by which the cash
             surrender value of the Policy exceeds the amount necessary to
             satisfy the Collateral Assignment.


I.           Employee's Right to Assign His/Her Interest
           Employee agrees not to sell, assign, surrender or otherwise terminate
             the policy while this Agreement is in effect without the consent of
             the Employer.

J.       Insurer's Obligations
         The Insurer is not a party to this Agreement.  It is understood by the
         parties hereto that in issuing such Policy of insurance, the Insurer
         shall have no liability except as set forth in the Policy and except as
         set forth in any assignment of the Policy filed at it Home Office and
         in Section K of this Agreement.  Except as set forth in Section K,
         the Insurer shall not be bound to inquire into, or take notice of, any
         of the covenants herein contained as to the Policy of insurance or as
         to application of proceeds of such policy.  Upon the death of the
         Insured and payment of the proceeds in accordance with Section K
         of this Agreement, the Insurer shall be discharged of all liability.

K.           Claims Procedure
             The following claims procedure shall apply to the Policy and the
             Secured Benefit Plan:

          1.  Filing of a claim for benefits.  The Employee or the Beneficiary
              shall make a claim for the benefits provided under the policy in
              the manner provided in the Policy.

          2.  Claim denial.  With respect to a claim for benefits under said
              Policy, the Insurer shall be the entity which reviews and makes
              decisions on claim denials according to the terms of the Policy.

         3.  Notification to claimant of decision.  If a claim is wholly or
             partially denied, notice of the decision, meeting the requirements
             of Section K4, following, shall be furnished to the claimant
              within a reasonable period of time after a claim has been filed.

         4.  Content of notice.  The insurer shall provide, to any claimant
             who is denied a claim for benefits, written notice setting forth in
             a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, the
             following:

                 a.       The specific reason or reasons for the denial;
                 b.       Specific reference to pertinent Policy provisions or
                          provisions of this Agreement on which the denial is
                          based;
                c.       A description of any additional material or information
                          necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
                          explanation of why such material or information is
                          necessary; and
                 d.       An explanation of this Agreement's claim review
                          procedure, as set forth in Sections K5 and K6.

         5.  Review procedure.  The purpose of the review procedure set
             forth in this subsection and subsection 6, following, is to provide
             a method by which a claimant under the Policy may have a
             reasonable opportunity to appeal a denial of claim for a full and
             fair review.  To accomplish that purpose, the claimant or his/her
             duly authorized representative:
                 a.       May request a review upon written application to the
                          Insurer;
                 b.       May review the Policy; and
                 c.       May submit issues and comments in writing.

              A claimant, (or his/her duly authorized representative), shall
              request a review by filing a written application of review at any
              time within sixty (60) days after receipt by the claimant of
              written notice of the denial of the claim.

          6.  Decision on review.  A decision on review of a denial of a claim
              shall be made in the following matter:
             a.       The decision on review shall be made by the Insurer
                      which may, at its discretion, hold a hearing on the denied
                      claim.  The Insurer shall make its decision promptly,
                      unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a
                      hearing) require an extension of time for processing, in
                      which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as
                      possible, but not later than one hundred twenty (120)
                      days after receipt of the request for review.
             b.       The decision on review shall be in writing and shall
                      include specific reasons for the decision, written in a
                      manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and
                      specific references to the pertinent Policy provision or
                      provision of this Agreement on which the decision is
                      based.

             Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or the Policy, no
             Employee, assignee or beneficiary may commence any action in any
             court regarding the Policy prior to pursuing all rights of an
             Employee under this Section K.
                                         END OF PART I

Part II - Assignment of Life Insurance Policy as Collateral

A.           For value received and in specific consideration of the premium
             payments made by the Employer as set forth in Section B of Part I
             hereof, the Employee hereby assigns, transfers and sets over to the
            Employer (herein this Part II called the "Assignee"), its successors
             and assigns, the Policy issued by the Insurer upon the life of
             Employee and all claims, options, privileges, rights, titles and
             interest therein and thereunder (except as provided in Paragraph C
           hereof), subject to all terms and conditions of the Policy and to all
         superior liens, if any, which the Insurer may have against the Policy. 
             The Employee by this instrument agrees and the Assignee by the
             acceptance of this Assignment agrees to the conditions and
             provisions herein set forth.

B.        It is expressly agreed that, without detracting from the generality of
             the foregoing, the following specific rights are included in this
             Agreement and Collateral Assignment and inure to the Assignee by
             virtue hereof:

          1.  The sole right to collect from the Insurer the net proceeds of the
                 Policy in excess of the proceeds due the Employee under Part I,
                 Section D, when it becomes a claim by death or maturity;

          2.  The sole right to surrender the Policy and receive the surrender
                 value thereof at any time provided by the terms of the Policy
                 and at such other times as the Insurer may allow;

             3.  The sole right to obtain one or more loans or advances on the
                 policy, either from the Insurer or, at any time, from other
                persons, and to pledge or assign the Policy as security for such
                 loans or advances;

            4.  The sole right to exercise all nonforfeiture rights permitted by
                the terms of the Policy or allowed by the Insurer and to receive
                 all benefits and advantages derived therefrom;

             5.  The sole right to direct investment of cash values as provided
                 under the insurance contract, and to make changes and transfers
                 in such fund allocations.

C.         It is expressly agreed that the following specific rights, so long as
             the Policy has not been surrendered, are reserved and excluded from
             this Collateral Assignment and do not pass by virtue hereof:

             1.  The right to designate and change the beneficiary;

             2.  The right to elect any optional mode of settlement permitted by
                 the Policy or allowed by the Insurer;

             provided, however, that the reservation of these rights shall in no
             way impair the right of the Assignee to surrender the Policy
             completely with all its incidents or impair any other right of the
             Assignee hereunder, and any designation or change of beneficiary or
             election of a mode of settlement shall be made subject to this
             Agreement and Collateral Assignment and to the rights of the
             Assignee hereunder.

D.           This Collateral Assignment is made, and the Policy is to be held as
         collateral security for, any and all liabilities of the Employee to the
             Assignee arising under this Agreement (all of which liabilities
          secured or to become secured are herein called "Liabilities").  It is
             expressly agreed that all sums received by the Assignee hereunder
          either in the event of death of the Insured, the maturity or surrender
             of the Policy, the obtaining of a loan or advance on the Policy, or
          otherwise, shall first be applied to the payment of the liability for
             premiums paid by the Assignee on the Policy and other amounts due
             to Assignee under Part I of this Agreement.

E.           The Assignee covenants and agrees with the Employee as follows:

             1.  That any balance of sums, if any, received hereunder from the
                 Insurer remaining after payment of the existing Liabilities,
                 matured or unmatured, shall be paid by the Assignee to the
                 persons entitled thereto under the terms of the policy had this
                 Collateral Assignment not be executed;

          2.  That the Assignee will not exercise either the right to surrender
               the Policy or the right to obtain policy loans from the Insurer,
                 until there has been either default in any of the Liabilities
                 pursuant to this Agreement or termination of part I of said
                 Agreement as therein provided; and

             3.  That the Assignee will, upon request, forward without
                 unreasonable delay to the Insurer the Policy for endorsement of
                 any designation or change of beneficiary or any election of an
                 optional mode of settlement.

F.           The Employee declares that no proceedings in bankruptcy are
            pending against, him/her and that his/her property is not subject to
             any assignment for the benefit of creditors.
