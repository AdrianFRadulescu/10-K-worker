Items 1. and 2.    Business and Properties

A.       Introduction and Background

         Wedgestone Financial  ("Wedgestone" or the "Company"),  a Massachusetts
business  trust which was  organized  in 1980,  commenced  operations  as a real
estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
continued  those  operations  through  December  31,  1991.  On August 9,  1991,
Wedgestone  filed a petition  with the United  States  Bankruptcy  Court for the
district of  Massachusetts  Eastern  Division  (the  "Bankruptcy  Court")  under
Chapter 11 of the United States  Bankruptcy  Code,  Case No.  91-16930-WCH  (the
"Bankruptcy  Proceeding").  Wedgestone's plan of reorganization (the "Plan") was
confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on May 5, 1992.

         Under its  current  management,  Wedgestone  operates  in two  business
segments as follows:

                A) Automotive Products for the light duty truck aftermarket; and

                B) Real Estate and Lending activities.

         The business of the Automotive  Products segment is conducted primarily
through  Wedgestone's  wholly  owned  subsidiary,   Wedgestone  Automotive  Corp
("Wedgestone  Automotive"),  which, in turn,  wholly owns the  subsidiaries  Fey
Automotive  Products,  Inc.  ("Fey"),  St. James Automotive Corp ("St.  James"),
Sigma  Plating Co.,  Inc.  ("Sigma")  and  Hercules  Automotive  Products,  Inc.
("Hercules")  which was acquired on January 9, 1995. Fey and Sigma were acquired
on November 18, 1994,  and have been accounted for as a  put-together,  which is
similar to the pooling of  interest  method of  accounting.  As a result of this
accounting  treatment,  the table of Financial  Information Relating to Business
Segments that follows and other financial  statements contained herein have been
restated to include the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows for
Fey and Sigma for all periods presented.

B.        Automotive Products Business Segment

         On November 18, 1994  ,Wedgestone  acquired the  Automotive  Segment of
Standun,  Inc.  ("Standun"),  which  consisted  of Sigma and the Fey  Automotive
Products division.  The assets of the Fey division were merged into Wedgestone's
wholly  owned  subsidiary  Fey  Automotive  Products,  Inc.  On January 9, 1995,
Wedgestone acquired substantially all of the assets of Hercules Bumpers, Inc., a
Georgia  company.  These  acquisitions,  along with  Wedgestone's  wholly  owned
subsidiary  St. James,  were placed under the common  ownership of  Wedgestone's
wholly owned subsidiary,  Wedgestone Automotive.  Collectively,  these companies
comprise the Automotive  Products  business  segment  which,  unless the context
otherwise requires, will be hereinafter referred to as Wedgestone Automotive.

         Wedgestone   Automotive   manufactures   and   distributes   automotive
aftermarket products for the light duty truck market. Principal products include
rear bumpers; tubular products such as grille guards, push bars, and step rails;
and various other related  aftermarket  products.  Additionally,  Sigma provides
contract chrome plating services to other unrelated parties.  Combined sales for
all products were  $46,112,000,  $34,618,000 and $29,472,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Hercules, acquired in 1995, also
manufactures and markets bumpers for the light duty truck aftermarket,  reported
sales of $13,017,000  for its fiscal year ended September 30, 1994, and sales of
$10,993,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995. See Subsequent Events below.

The Company's automotive products are sold in the following markets:

         Traditional Aftermarket: This market includes new car dealerships, body
         shops,  speed  shops,  off-road  specialty  shops  and  van  and  truck
         converters.  Wedgestone  Automotive  reaches these customers through an
         established  network  of  warehouse   distributors,   jobbers,   dealer
         expediters and specialty wholesalers.

         Original  Equipment   Aftermarket:   Utilizing  products   specifically
         approved by truck  manufacturers  such as General Motors,  Chrysler and
         Nissan,  Wedgestone  Automotive ships directly into their  distribution
         channels in order to take advantage of factory  supported  sales of its
         truck accessories through dealer level service parts operations.

         Retail Aftermarket:  Wedgestone  Automotive reaches the retail consumer
         through  local,  regional and national  chains  dedicated to automotive
         products as well as independent  retailers whose stores support a large
         assortment of automotive product lines.

Significant Customers, Competitive Position, Intellectual Property

         There is no single customer whose purchases  exceeded 10% of Wedgestone
Automotive's  sales. The sectors of the automotive  industry in which Wedgestone
competes  are  extremely  competitive  and heavily  influenced  by policies  and
programs implemented by the OE Manufacturers. The companies servicing Wedgestone
Automotive's  markets with competing  products vary in size and capability  with
none dominating the market as a whole.  All such companies  compete on the basis
of product  design,  availability,  lead time,  price and  product  performance.
Wedgestone Automotive has no patents, trademarks,  franchises or concessions. It
markets its products under various  tradenames  including Fey, Tuff Bar,  Westin
and Hercules.

Raw Materials, Distribution, Inventories and Seasonality

         Raw materials are purchased  under  standard  industry  terms through a
number of  vendors  located  within  the  vicinity  of the plant  being  served.
Management   does  not  anticipate   any  shortages  of  materials.   Wedgestone
Automotive's  products are distributed  through the manufacturing  facilities in
California and Minnesota and further through distribution warehouses in Utah and
Texas since March 1996.

         Sales are primarily  serviced out of finished  goods  inventories.  For
this  reason,  inventories  are a material  portion of the  company's  operating
assets.  The  Company  schedules  manufacturing  to maintain  desired  inventory
levels. Order backlogs for Wedgestone Automotive Products totalled $1,500,000 as
of  December  31,  1995  as  compared  to  $500,000  as of  December  31,  1994.
Substantially,  all of this  growth  is due to the  growing  demand  for  Westin
products  manufactured  at St. James.  While the  automotive  aftermarket is not
considered  to be  seasonal,  it is subject  to the annual  effects of new model
introductions  and, as such,  business can increase in the fall after new models
are released and in the spring as dealers seek to move inventory in anticipation
of the next model year.

Subsequent Events

         On March 5, 1996,  Hercules closed its  manufacturing  plant in Pelham,
Georgia.   The  market  for  the  bumpers   produced  in  the  Pelham   facility
significantly  changed during 1995.  Historically,  a significant  percentage of
Hercules business was for sales to dealers of a domestic OE Manufacturer.  A new
program implemented by one of these manufacturers in late 1994 made it extremely
difficult  for  Hercules  to  remain   competitive   in  this  market   segment.
Accordingly,  Hercules  incurred a net loss of  $125,000  in 1995.  As a result,
management determined that closing the Pelham facility was appropriate. Hercules
is working with its senior  lender for an orderly  liquidation  of the assets in
Pelham.  While the final outcome is  uncertain,  the Company does not expect the
closure of the Pelham facility to have a material effect on 1996 operations.

         As  of  March  15,  1996,  the  manufacturing   employees  of  Fey  are
represented by a union whose contract expires in March 1996. Wedgestone believes
that its relations with all of its employees are satisfactory.

         Fey leases 89,000 square feet of manufacturing,  warehousing and office
space  located  in  Irwindale,  California,  approximately  30 miles east of Los
Angeles.  Fey also leases  distribution  warehouses in Salt Lake City,  Utah and
Fort Worth, Texas. The leases expire at various times through 2002.

         St. James leases a 95,000 square foot facility in St. James, Minnesota,
which is approximately 120 miles southwest of Minneapolis.  The lease obligation
extends  through  October 31, 1998. The lease contains a purchase option for the
facility.

         Sigma  owns a  26,000  square  foot  facility  on 3  acres  of  land in
LaPuente, California, approximately 25 miles east of Los Angeles.

         Hercules  owns a 280,000  square  foot  facility on 40 acres of land in
Pelham,  Georgia,  approximately  180 miles southwest of Atlanta.  Operations at
this plant were terminated on March 5, 1996, and decommissioning of the facility
is in process.

Environmental Matters

         St.  James,  Sigma and  Hercules  operate  chrome  plating  facilities.
Hazardous wastes generated by these operations are disposed in the normal course
for this type of  business.  Aqueous  wastes are treated at the facility to meet
applicable  regulatory  standards and then  discharged  to the public  treatment
works. Solid wastes and by-products are transported to a recycler for processing
and  destruction.  All current  activities at the  facilities are believed to be
within the operational  parameters of the required environmental permits and are
monitored both internally by facility  personnel and  periodically by regulatory
agencies.   In  anticipation  of  expanding  the  St.  James  facility  and  its
operations,  St. James  conducted  tests which revealed  possible  environmental
contamination  by a previous  operator/tenant.  St. James notified the principal
shareholder of the prior  operator,  who is also the landlord,  and the relevant
regulatory  authorities  of the test  results.  St.  James  has  been  partially
indemnified  from  costs  relating  to  potential   clean-up  by  the  principal
shareholder of the prior  operator and the landlord.  As a result of the closure
of its plant on March 5, 1996, Hercules is in the process of decommissioning its
plating line in Pelham, Georgia.

C.       Real Estate and Lending Segment

         Although its primary focus has shifted toward its  Automotive  Products
business  segment,  Wedgestone's  Real Estate and Lending  business  segment has
continued since emerging from bankruptcy in 1992.

Real Estate Acquired By Foreclosure

         Wedgestone  owns three  properties  that were acquired by  foreclosure.
They include four commercial condominiums in Peabody, Massachusetts; 59 acres of
undeveloped land in Bristol,  Connecticut; and approximately 21 acres of land in
Queens,  New York,  15 acres of which are below  water.  The Queens  property is
subject to litigation,  which  Wedgestone  originated,  relating to the original
loan.  Wedgestone is required to transfer for the benefit of the  pre-bankruptcy
creditors, 50% of the net proceeds received, if any, from this litigation.

Promissory Notes and Claims

         Wedgestone has an outstanding loan on one property, the aggregate value
of which totals approximately  $84,000 as of December 31, 1995, net of reserves.
Management  believes  that  current  reserves  recorded  against  this  loan are
adequate.

Genesis Plastics, Inc.

         On August 24, 1992,  Wedgestone  entered into a secured loan  agreement
(the "Loan") with Genesis Plastics,  Inc. ("Genesis"),  a plastics recycler. The
Loan, originally for borrowings of up to $1,000,000, was subsequently amended to
provide for  borrowings of up to $2,000,000  and over advances at the discretion
of Wedgestone.  Affiliated  parties of Wedgestone  agreed to purchase a pro rata
participation  in excess of $800,000 of the Loan.  Genesis had previously  filed
for protection  under Chapter 11 of the United States  Bankruptcy Code on August
24,  1994 and had been  unsuccessful  in its  efforts  to secure a buyer for its
Charleroi,  Pennsylvania  recycling facility.  Wedgestone held a senior security
interest in the  inventory,  receivables  and certain  equipment of Genesis.  On
November  29, 1995,  in  accordance  with its rights under the Loan,  Wedgestone
consented to the liquidation of the Genesis'  inventory and equipment of Genesis
through a public  auction.  As a result of this  action,  Wedgestone  recorded a
one-time loss of $697,000 in December 1995.

Environmental Matters

         Under  the  Comprehensive   Environmental   Response  Compensation  and
Liability Act of 1983, as amended  ("CERCLA"),  an owner or operator of property
(including, in certain circumstances, a lender who takes title by foreclosure or
who  participates  in the management of the property) may be liable to reimburse
the  federal  government  or a third  party for the cost of  cleaning  up oil or
hazardous  substances  found on the  property.  Many states in which  Wedgestone
conducts  business,  including  Massachusetts,  have  enacted  similar  statutes
("Superfund  Laws"),  under which an owner or operator of property  (including a
foreclosing  lender or a lender who actively  participates  in the management of
the property)  may be liable to reimburse the state  government or a third party
for clean-up  costs and to compensate the state or any other person for injuries
or damages  caused by oil or  hazardous-substance  contamination.  The liability
created by CERCLA and the state Superfund Laws is joint and several subject,  in
a limited number of cases, to certain defenses.

         A number of states in which  Wedgestone  conducts  business,  including
Massachusetts, also allow the state to impose a lien on the property of a liable
party as security for the payment of clean-up costs. Many of these jurisdictions
provide that this lien, at least as it pertains to the contaminated property, is
senior to all pre-existing liens.

         Accordingly,  if real estate  securing a Wedgestone  loan were found to
contain oil or hazardous substances,  enforcement of a state Superfund Law could
significantly  reduce the value of  Wedgestone's  lien. In the event real estate
owned or controlled by Wedgestone  pursuant to  foreclosure or exercise of other
remedies under its loan documents  were found to contain  hazardous  substances,
enforcement  of a  state  Superfund  Law or  CERCLA  could  potentially  require
expenditure of funds in amounts which may have a significant adverse impact upon
Wedgestone's earnings, capital expenditure requirements and liquidity.

Net Operating Loss

         Wedgestone  has a net operating  loss carry forward for federal  income
tax of approximately $43,000,000.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Bankruptcy Claims


                                       4

<PAGE>

         On October  30,  1992,  a group  calling  itself the  "Equity  Security
Holders Committee of Wedgestone  Financial" (the "Committee")  filed a complaint
(the  "Complaint")  commencing  an  adversary  proceeding  in the United  States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of  Massachusetts.  On May 20, 1993, the Court
dismissed the adversary proceeding.  The Committee appealed the dismissal to the
District Court. The appeal was denied on August 17, 1994. The Committee appealed
to the United  States  Court of Appeals  for the First  Circuit.  The appeal was
denied on March 1, 1995.  The  Committee  requested  a  rehearing  by the United
States  Court  of  Appeals  for the  First  Circuit.  On  March  22,  1995,  the
Committee's request was denied.

Other

         On May 25, 1995, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Massachusetts (the "Court") issued an order establishing  rights and obligations
with  respect to the then one  remaining  outstanding  loan under  which  income
rights had been  granted  to  certain  Special  Income  Shareholders.  The order
released  Wedgestone from all obligations  regarding the loan and authorized the
Company  to  transfer  all  loan  documents  to the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation.  In connection  with this order,  Wedgestone was directed to cancel
the Special  Income Shares subject to certain future  distribution  rights.  The
balance sheet and income statement  presentation  included in this Form 10-K has
been changed to reflect  this  cancellation.  A Mr.  Landers has appealed to the
Court.  On March 19,  1996,  Wedgestone  moved for  dismissal  of the appeal.  A
decision is pending.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 1995 and 1994

Background

         On  November  18,  1994,  Wedgestone  acquired  Fey and Sigma  from the
related party, Standun,  which has been accounted for as a put-together which is
similar to the pooling of interest  method of accounting.  This  transaction has
resulted in a re-statement of Wedgestone's  financial  statements to include the
historical  balance  sheets,  results of  operations  and cash flows for Fey and
Sigma for all  periods  presented.  On  January  9,  1995,  Wedgestone  acquired
substantially  all of the assets of Hercules  Bumpers,  Inc., a Georgia company.
The management  discussion  and analysis of financial  results that follows also
incorporates these companies.

Liquidity  and Capital Resources

         To date,  Wedgestone has financed its business  activities  through the
cash flow from  operations.  Additional  debt has been  incurred  primarily  for
working  capital  and  acquisitions.  See  Notes  7 and 10 to  the  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

         Cash flows from operations  totaling  $2,440,000  were  supplemented by
$617,000 in inventory  reductions in 1995.  Wedgestone  used  $1,016,000 of this
cash flow to reduce other accrued  expenses.  This resulted in $1,836,000 in net
cash  provided  by  operating  activities  in 1995  compared to $66,000 in 1994.
Wedgestone  invested  $926,000 in new  property  and  equipment  and $126,000 in
investment  real  estate  in  1995.  For  1995,  cash  flows  used in  financing
activities  totaled $198,000.  Borrowings under the revolving line of credit and
certain long-term debt totaled $836,000 and repayments of long-term debt totaled
$949,000.

         Wedgestone  has  borrowings  outstanding  from a related party totaling
$729,000  (the  "Rockaway  Loan") as of December 31, 1995,  which mature in July
1996.  Under  this  credit  agreement,  the  borrowings  are  collateralized  by
substantially all of the assets of the Company.

         In  connection  with  the  acquisition  of the  Automotive  Segment  of
Standun, Inc., Wedgestone,  through certain wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  entered
into  a  three-year  $7.5  million   revolving  credit  line  with  a  financial
institution.  The credit line provides for borrowings  (minimum borrowings of $4
million  are  required)   based  on  a  percentage  of  inventory  and  accounts
receivable.  Interest on the outstanding borrowings accrues at prime, plus 2.5%.
The agreement also includes  equipment term loans  approximating $1.4 million at
December 31, 1995. The agreement  contains  certain  covenants which require the
maintenance of minimum working capital and equity.

         In connection  with the  acquisition  of Hercules on January 9, 1995, a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of Wedgestone assumed certain debt currently consisting
of a term loan of $4.0 million,  and an industrial  revenue bond of $285,000 due
March 1, 1999.

         On March 5, 1996, Hercules closed its facility in Pelham, Georgia, as a
result of  unfavorable  market  conditions  for products  produced in the Pelham
facility.  Hercules is working with its senior lender for an orderly liquidation
of the assets in Pelham.  The Company  does not expect the closure of the Pelham
facility to have a material effect on 1996 operations.

         To  the  extent  that  Wedgestone  expands  its  operations  and  makes
additional  acquisitions,  it  will  need  to  obtain  additional  funding  from
institutional  lenders and other sources.  Wedgestone's ability to use equity in
obtaining  funding  may be  limited  by  its  desire  to  preserve  certain  tax
attributes including its net operating loss carry forwards.

Results Of Operations

Current Year Performance 1995 Compared to 1994

         Operating  income grew by 36% or  $726,000 in 1995 over 1994.  Hercules
accounted  for $487,000 or 67% of this  growth.  During the latter part of 1995,
the  performance of Hercules was  significantly  impacted by declining sales and
general market conditions due to direct OEM competition.

         Sales increased over 1994 by 33% or $11,494,000. Hercules accounted for
$10,993,000  of this  increase.  Gross profit  increased by  $3,450,000 in 1995.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was comparable to 1994 at  approximately  31%
of sales.

         Sales and Marketing costs increased  $1,437,000 in 1995,  $1,408,000 or
98% of which was  attributable  to Hercules.  Administrative  costs increased by
$1,287,000 in 1995, $913,000 or 71% of which was attributable to Hercules. Legal
and other acquisition fees related to the acquisition of the Standun  Automotive
Segment which were expensed for an additional $300,000 of this increase.

         Interest expense  increased by $854,000 in 1995,  $553,000 of which was
attributable to Hercules.  Amortization of loan origination fees and interest on
the note  payable  assumed in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the Standun
Automotive Segment accounted for the majority of the remainder of this increase.

         Other  expenses in 1995  include loan losses of $697,000 on the Genesis
Plastics loan.

         Income taxes in 1995  reflect a $1,258,000  benefit due to a $1,300,000
adjustment  to  the  Company's  valuation  reserve.  This  adjustment  is due to
management's expectations of the Company's ability to more fully utilize its net
operating  loss   carryforwards  due  to  the  Company's  more  recent  earnings
performance, excluding Hercules and the Genesis loan loss.

Prior Performance: 1994 Compared to 1993

         The  significant  increase  in  1994  operating  income  over  1993  is
primarily due to the performance of the Automotive  Products segment.  Sales for
this segment were 17.5% higher than in 1993.  This increase is due to the growth
of the  domestic  automotive  industry  and a growing  acceptance  of the Westin
product line  manufactured  at St. James.  The increase in revenues  enabled all
facilities to enhance their  utilization  of plant capacity and obtain a greater
return on fixed costs.  As a result of this and the continuing  efforts to lower
the Automotive  Products segment's overhead  structure,  gross margins increased
from 29% of sales in 1993 to 31% in 1994.

         In 1993,  significant  efforts  were made to  enhance  the  aftermarket
awareness of the Westin line of products manufactured in St. James. The market's
acceptance  of this line of  Grille  Guards,  Push  Bars,  Step  Rails and other
tubular  products in 1994,  was such that the growth of this line  accounted for
70% or $3,605,300 of the Company's $5,146,000 sales increase over 1993.

         Sales and marketing  expenses  increased by $668,000 in 1994 over 1993.
Of this amount,  $516,000 is due to variable  selling costs such as commissions,
packaging and freight which  increased due to the increase in sales from 1993 to
1994. To facilitate this increase in sales,  Wedgestone Automotive increased its
advertising and promotion expenditures in 1994 by $152,000.

         Administrative  expenses increased in 1994 due to $190,000 in legal and
accounting  costs  incurred  as a  result  of the  acquisition  of  the  Standun
Automotive Segment.

Accounting Pronouncements

         In  1995,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. The
principles  established  in the new statement  must be applied by the Company in
1996. Among other provisions, the statement changed current accounting practices
for the  evaluation of impairment of long-lived  assets.  Management has not yet
completed its analysis of the effect of adopting the new statement.

         In 1995, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 1996.
SFAS  No.  123  requires  expanded   disclosures  of  stock-based   compensation
arrangements  with employees and encourages (but does not require)  compensation
cost to be  measured  based on fair  value  of the  equity  instrument  awarded.
Companies are permitted, however, to continue to apply APB Opinion No. 25, which
recognizes  compensation  cost  based  on the  intrinsic  value  of  the  equity
instrument awarded. The Company will continue to apply APB Opinion No. 25 to its
stock based compensation  awards to employees and will disclose the required pro
forma effect on net income and earnings per share.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To  the  Board  of  Trustees  and  Shareholders  of  Wedgestone   Financial  and
Subsidiaries:

We have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of  Wedgestone
Financial  and  Subsidiaries  as of  December  31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
consolidated  statements of operations,  shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 1995.  Our audits also
included the consolidated  financial  statement schedules listed in the index at
Item 14. These financial  statements and financial  statement  schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,   the  financial   position  of  Wedgestone   Financial  and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1995  and  1994,  and the  results  of their
operations, and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.
Also, in our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statement  schedules,  when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the  information  set forth
therein.

                      WEDGESTONE FINANCIAL AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

              For the Years Ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993


NOTE 1.     Background and Basis of Presentation

         Background - Wedgestone  Financial  ("Wedgestone" or the "Company") was
formed in 1980 as a real  estate  investment  trust  ("REIT")  and, on August 9,
1991, filed for bankruptcy.  Wedgestone's  plan of  reorganization  (the "Plan")
became effective on August 3, 1992.

         Under the guidance of its current  management,  Wedgestone  operates in
two  business  segments,   Automotive  Products  and  Real  Estate  and  Lending
activities.  The automotive  segment  manufactures  and  distributes  automotive
aftermarket  products for the light duty truck market.  Its  principal  products
include rear bumpers;  tubular  products such as grille  guards,  push bars, and
step rails;  and various  other  related  aftermarket  products.  The  Company's
automotive  products are marketed in traditional,  original equipment and retail
automotive   aftermarkets.   As  of  March  15,  1996,  the  automotive  segment
manufactures  and sells its products at two locations in California,  and one in
Minnesota. Sales are also made from distribution centers in Texas and Utah.

         Although its primary focus has shifted toward its  Automotive  Products
business  segment,  Wedgestone's  Real Estate and Lending  business  segment has
continued  since  emerging  from  bankruptcy  in  1992.  Wedgestone  owns  three
properties  that were  acquired by  foreclosure.  The  aggregate  value,  net of
reserves,  is approximately  $1,091,000 as of December 31, 1995.  Wedgestone has
outstanding loans on one property,  net of reserves, of approximately $84,000 as
of December 31, 1995.

         Acquisitions   -  Since  May  1992,   Wedgestone   has  acquired  three
manufacturing operations. In June 1992, Wedgestone acquired St. James Automotive
Corp. ("St.  James") in exchange for 6,795,220 shares of beneficial  interest of
Wedgestone  and accounted for this  acquisition  as a purchase.  On November 18,
1994,  Wedgestone acquired the Automotive Segment of Standun,  Inc. ("Standun"),
which  consisted  of the Fey  Automotive  Products  Division  ("Fey")  and Sigma
Plating  Co.,  Inc.  ("Sigma") in exchange for  6,795,223  shares of  beneficial
interest  of  Wedgestone  and the  assumption  of  approximately  $1,104,000  of
outstanding  debt due to related  parties of both  Wedgestone  and Standun,  and
certain  other  liabilities.  The  shareholders  of Standun  owned,  directly or
indirectly,  approximately  48% of Wedgestone prior to the acquisition and, as a
result, this acquisition was accounted for as a "put-together"  which is similar
to the pooling of interest method of accounting. As a result of the acquisition,
Standun  now  owns 31% of the  outstanding  shares  of  beneficial  interest  of
Wedgestone.  On January 9, 1995  Wedgestone  acquired  substantially  all of the
assets of Hercules Bumpers, Inc. ("Hercules"). The purchase price for the assets
acquired was the assumption of certain debt and other liabilities  approximating
$5.1  million.  In  addition,  certain  debt is  being  guaranteed  jointly  and
severally by Charles W. Brady  ("Brady"),  the former  principal  shareholder of
Hercules,   and  Chattahoochee   Leasing  Corporation   ("CLC"),  a  corporation
controlled by Brady. In exchange for this guarantee, Brady received a promissory
note in the amount of $300,000 and 1,200,000  shares of  beneficial  interest of
Wedgestone.  In  consideration  for an agreement to pay a liability of Hercules,
CLC received a promissory  note for $100,000 which was secured by 100,000 shares
of beneficial  interest of Wedgestone.  In June, 1995, the Company exercised its
right under the CLC  Agreement  and acquired the note by issuing these shares to
CLC. See Subsequent Events (Note 14).

         The following  supplemental pro forma  information has been prepared as
though the  acquisition  of  Hercules  had  occurred  at  January  1, 1994:  (In

                                                                Year ended
                                                              December 31, 1994
                                                              ------------------

        Net Income                                               $ 1,188
        Net Income per Share of Beneficial Interest              $   .05


         The pro  forma Net  Sales,  Net  Income,  and Net  Income  per Share of
Beneficial Interest for the year ended December 31, 1995 would not be materially
different than the actual results presented.

         Basis  of   Presentation   and  Principles  of   Consolidation   -  The
accompanying   consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  operations  of
Wedgestone and give  retroactive  effect to the acquisition of Fey and Sigma for
all  periods  presented.  As  a  result,  the  financial  position,  results  of
operations and cash flows are presented as if Wedgestone, Fey and Sigma had been
consolidated for all periods presented.  The consolidated  statements of changes
in Wedgestone's shareholders' equity reflect the Wedgestone shares of beneficial
interest  issued  to  effect  the  Fey and  Sigma  acquisition  as if they  were
outstanding for all periods presented.  The results of operations and cash flows
presented include the results of operations and cash flows of Hercules since its
date of acquisition.

         The  consolidated   financial   statements   include  the  accounts  of
Wedgestone  and its wholly  owned  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


NOTE 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Inventories - Inventories  are stated at the lower of cost or market,  with cost
being determined by the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of accounting.

Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment - Property,  plant and equipment are stated at
cost.  Expenditures that materially  increase the life of the related assets are
capitalized and  maintenance  and repairs are charged to expense.  The costs and
related  accumulated  depreciation  applicable to property,  plant and equipment
which are sold or retired are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is
included in income.

Depreciation  and  Amortization - Wedgestone uses the  straight-line  method for
depreciating  property,  plant and equipment over their estimated  useful lives.
Buildings and  improvements  are depreciated  from 5 to 40 years,  machinery and
equipment  from 3 to 10 years,  furniture  and fixtures  from 3 to 5 years,  and
leasehold  improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective leases or
the life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill - The Company  reviews the  recoverability  of goodwill to determine if
there has been any permanent  impairment.  This assessment is performed based on
the estimated  undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared
with the carrying value of intangible  assets.  If the undiscounted  future cash
flows are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded, measured
by the amount of the  difference.  Accumulated  amortization  was  $106,000  and
$44,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 respectively.

Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  reflect the tax
consequences  in future  years of  differences  between  the income tax bases of
assets and liabilities and the corresponding  bases used for financial reporting
purposes.  The  measurement  of  deferred  tax assets is adjusted by a valuation
reserve,  if necessary,  so that the net tax benefits are recognized only to the
extent that they will more likely than not be realized.

Use of Estimates - The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments -

         Cash,  Accounts  Receivable and Accounts Payable - The carrying amounts
         approximate  fair  value  because  of the  short  maturities  of  these
         instruments.

         Revolving Line of Credit - The carrying amount  approximates fair value
         because the interest rate is based on variable reference rates.

         Long-Term  Debt  (excluding  revolving  line of credit) - The  carrying
amount of long-term debt approximates fair value.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments  which subject the Company
to credit risk consist  primarily of accounts  receivable.  This risk is reduced
due to the number of  customers  and their  geographic  dispersion.  The Company
performs ongoing credit  evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance
for potential credit losses.

Notes  Receivable  - Notes  receivable  are  recorded  at the  lower  of cost or
estimated net realizable value.


                                       17

<PAGE>

Real Estate  Acquired by  Foreclosure - Real estate  acquired by  foreclosure is
recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable  value.  Estimated net
realizable  value is generally  the  estimated  selling price which the property
will bring if placed on the open  market  allowing a  reasonable  time to find a
willing buyer.

Income/Loss  Per  Share  of  Beneficial  Interest  -  Income/loss  per  share of
beneficial interest is calculated based on weighted average outstanding shares.

Accounting  Pronouncements - In 1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board
(FASB)  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of. The principles  established in the new statement must be applied
by the Company in 1996. Among other  provisions,  the statement  changed current
accounting  practices for the  evaluation  of  impairment of long-lived  assets.
Management  has not yet completed its analysis of the effect of adopting the new
statement.

                 In 1995,  the FASB also  issued SFAS No.  123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  which will be  effective  for the Company  beginning
January 1, 1996.  SFAS No. 123  requires  expanded  disclosures  of  stock-based
compensation  arrangements  with employees and encourages (but does not require)
compensation  cost to be measured  based on fair value of the equity  instrument
awarded. Companies are permitted,  however, to continue to apply APB Opinion No.
25,  which  recognizes  compensation  cost based on the  intrinsic  value of the
equity instrument awarded. The Company will continue to apply APB Opinion No. 25
to its stock  based  compensation  awards to  employees  and will  disclose  the
required pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share.

NOTE 3.    Related Parties

         St. James has a five year consulting agreement with PSG Associates,  an
affiliate  of the  former  owners of St.  James  (who are also  affiliated  with
Wedgestone),  to provide  advisory  services  to St.  James with  respect to its
operations, expansion and financing activities at a minimum rate of $125,000 per
year plus  reimbursement of expenses.  St. James paid $125,000 to PSG Associates
for each of the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         In connection with the acquisition of the Automotive Segment of Standun
Inc.,  Resource  Holdings  Associates and PFG Corp.  ("PFG"),  both of which are
controlled by certain Wedgestone  shareholders,  received a fee of $225,000,  in
February 1995.

         In  connection  with  the  Hercules   acquisition,   Resource  Holdings
Associates and PFG received a fee of $220,000 consisting of $160,000 and 200,000
shares of beneficial  interest of  Wedgestone  at a valuation  price of $.30 per
share.

         On January 25, 1995,  Hercules  entered into a five year agreement with
PFG and Wedgestone Partners, an affiliate of the aforementioned shareholders, to
provide advisory services to Hercules with respect to its operations,  expansion
and financing  activities at an aggregate amount of $175,000 per year.  $175,000
was included in the 1995 general and administrative expenses for this agreement.

         On January 12,  1993,  as  amended,  Wedgestone  entered  into a credit
facility with Rockaway 605 Corp.  ("Rockaway")  pursuant to which Wedgestone was
permitted to borrow up to a maximum of $300,000  with  additional  over advances
available at the discretion of the lender to fund  Wedgestone's  working capital
needs  and those of its  subsidiaries.  As a  requirement  of the  financing  to
purchase the Automotive Segment, Wedgestone paid Rockaway $25,000 to release its
lien  on  the   stock  of  St.   James  and   certain   of   Wedgestone's   real
estate.Wedgestone  also  agreed  to  issue  Rockaway  transferable  warrants  to
purchase  225,000 shares of beneficial  interest of Wedgestone at $.25 per share
if the loan was not paid by March 31,  1995.  As of  December  31,  1995,  these
warrants had not yet been issued. As of December 31, 1995, Rockaway had advanced
$429,000 in excess of the funding  agreement.  The Rockaway Loan is secured by a
pledge  of all of the  stock  of  Wedgestone's  direct  subsidiaries  and  notes
receivable. Rockaway is a real estate holding company which is controlled by the
former shareholders of St. James. The loan is due in July 1996.

NOTE 6.    Real Estate and Lending

         On August 24, 1992,  Wedgestone  entered into a secured loan  agreement
(the "Loan") with  Genesis  Plastics,  Inc.  ("Genesis").  The Loan,  as amended
provided for borrowings of up to $2,000,000 with over advances at the discretion
of the lender.  As of December 31, 1992,  the former  shareholders  of St. James
indirectly agreed to purchase a pro rata  participation in the Loan in excess of
$800,000. As of December 31, 1994, $1,619,000 had been advanced to Genesis under
the participation agreement.  Genesis, had previously filed for protection under
Chapter II of the United States  Bankruptcy Code on August 24, 1994 and had been
unsuccessful  in its efforts to secure a buyer for its  Charleroi,  Pennsylvania
recycling facility. Wedgestone held a senior security interest in the inventory,
receivables  and  certain  equipment  of  Genesis.  On  November  29,  1995,  in
accordance  with its rights under the loan  agreement  with Genesis,  Wedgestone
consented to the liquidation of the Genesis'  inventory and equipment  through a
public auction. As a result of this action,  Wedgestone recorded a one time loss
relating to this loan of $697,000 in December 1995.

         The  contractual  payments of principal  on  long-term  debt are due as
follows:  $2,305,000 in 1996, $5,692,000 in 1997, $1,427,000 in 1998, $1,195,000
in 1999, and $107,000 in 2000, and $26,000 thereafter.

         On  November  18,  1994,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the
Automotive  Segment,  Wedgestone,  through  its wholly  owned  subsidiaries  Fey
Automotive  Products,  Inc.,  Sigma Plating Co.,  Inc. and St. James  Automotive
Corp., entered into a three-year,  $7.5 million credit facility,  which provides
for a revolving credit line and term loan with CIT, and which is  collateralized
by substantially all of the assets of these  subsidiaries.  There was a facility
fee of 1% of the maximum credit line  associated  with  procurement of the loan.
The  agreement  provides for  borrowings  based on a percentage of inventory and
receivables and includes an equipment term loan, at the lender's prime rate plus
2.5% (11% at December 31, 1995 and 1994).

         The agreement  contains certain covenants which require  maintenance of
minimum working capital and equity levels. There is a minimum borrowing required
of $4,000,000 under the agreement.

         On January 8, 1995, in connection with the acquisition of substantially
all of the assets of  Hercules  Bumpers,  Inc.,  Wedgestone,  through its wholly
owned subsidiary,  Hercules  Automotive  Products,  Inc. entered into a one year
$4.0 million

                                       20

<PAGE>

revolving credit line with NationsBank of Georgia which is collateralized by the
real property,  receivables,  inventory and certain  equipment at Hercules.  The
agreement  provides  for  borrowings  based on a  percentage  of  inventory  and
receivables.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  in January 1996, the revolving
credit line was  converted to a $4.0  million term loan due in 48 equal  monthly
installments starting February 1996. See Subsequent Events (Note 14).

         Wedgestone  assumed a note associated with the termination of Standun's
management  agreement with Fifth Avenue Partners,  a related party of Wedgestone
and Standun,  in the amount of $1,104,000 in conjunction with the acquisition of
the Automotive Segment (See Note 1).

         Wedgestone   has  included  in  its  short-term   obligations   $70,000
representing a note payment to C. E. Westin which was to have been made in 1992.
St.  James  exercised  its  right  of  indemnification  under  an  environmental
liability letter and withheld part of the payment.

NOTE  8.    Income Taxes

         Wedgestone  previously  operated  as a  real  estate  investment  trust
("REIT") under certain  sections of the Internal  Revenue Code.  Wedgestone lost
its REIT status when it emerged from  bankruptcy  in August  1992,  and as such,
income will be taxed at the  Wedgestone  level.  Wedgestone  currently has a net
operating loss carry forward of approximately $43,000,000 for federal Income tax
purposes. These losses expire in various years from 2004 to 2008.

         The  Automotive  Segment  filed a  consolidated  income tax return with
Standun for the year ended  December 31, 1993 and for the period January 1, 1994
through date of acquisition,  November 18, 1994.  Income tax expense of $385,713
and  $211,384  for the years  ended  December  31,  1994 and 1993  respectively,
represent income taxes on the Automotive  Segment's  taxable income had it filed
on a separate return basis. Had the acquisition  taken place at the beginning of
each of these years,  these taxes would have been absorbed by  Wedgestone's  net
operating loss. For the year ended December 31, 1995,  $42,000  represents state
income taxes  currently due and payable in the states in which the  subsidiaries
do not file consolidated returns with Wedgestone.

         In connection  with the  acquisition of the Automotive  Segment,  a tax
benefit of $440,000 which was  attributable  to the increase in tax basis of the
Automotive Segment's assets was allocated to additional paid-in capital.

         The provision for income taxes consists of the following components:

                                        1995             1994             1993

NOTE 9.    Special Income Shares

          Prior to 1990, in connection with  Wedgestone's  acquisition of all of
the net assets of Wedgestone  Participation Mortgage Trust ("WPMT"),  Wedgestone
issued 593,676 shares of beneficial  interest and 565,406 Special Income Shares.
The Special Income Shares  evidenced a share of all income which was earned from
the contingent-appreciation  and gross-rental-increase  portions of the mortgage
loans  acquired  from WPMT, of which none remained at December 31, 1995 and were
not entitled to share in any other  Wedgestone  income or assets.  There were no
accrued earnings associated with special income shares for 1995, 1994 or 1993.

          On May 25, 1995, the United States  Bankruptcy  Court for the District
of  Massachusetts  issued an order  establishing  rights  and  obligations  with
respect to the then one remaining outstanding loan under which income rights had
been  granted  to  certain  Special  Income  Shareholders.  The  order  released
Wedgestone from all obligations regarding the loan and authorized the Company to
transfer all loan documents to the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation.  In
connection with this order, Wedgestone was directed to cancel the Special Income
Shares  subject to certain  future  distribution  rights.  The balance sheet and
income statement presentation reflect this cancellation.


NOTE 10.    Commitments and Contingencies

         Wedgestone is obligated  under  various  cancelable  and  noncancelable
operating leases for manufacturing  facilities,  machinery and equipment.  These
leases expire  annually  through  August 31, 2002.  Future  minimum annual lease
commitments are:

             1996                                      $   904,000

             1998                                          664,000
             1999                                          396,000

         Total  net  rental  expense  under the terms of  various  building  and
equipment  leases was $980,000,  $1,069,000  and  $1,010,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively.  There is a purchase option in
the  St.  James  manufacturing   facility  lease  in  the  amount  of  $500,000,

concurrently  with the sub-lease on October 31, 1998. St. James owes  consulting
fees to C. E. Westin in the amount of $58,095 as of December 31, 1995.

Note 11.    Stock Option and Profit Sharing Plans

         During 1995,  Wedgestone  created the  Wedgestone  Financial 1995 Stock
Option Plan (the "Option  Plan"),  which became  effective on December 15, 1995.
Officers, other key employees and significant  non-employees who are responsible
for or contribute to the management, growth and/or profitability of the business
of  Wedgestone  are eligible to be granted  stock options under the Option Plan.
The Option Plan replaces and  supersedes a former stock option plan  established
in 1994.

         The optionees  under the Option Plan will be selected from time to time
by the Committee (a group of individuals  appointed by the Trustees).  The stock
options  granted under the Option Plan may be of two types:  (i) Incentive Stock
Options

                                       22

<PAGE>

and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options.  The option price per share of stock under
a stock option will be  determined  by the  Committee at the time of grant.  The
option price with  respect to an  incentive  stock option shall not be less than
100% of the fair market value of the Wedgestone  stock on the date of the option
grant.  The option price with respect to a non-qualified  stock option shall not
be less than 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of the option
grant.  The stock  options can be exercised at such times as  determined  by the
Committee. The stock which is acquired through the exercise of the stock option,
is required to be held for investment and not for resale or other  distribution.
Wedgestone has reserved  1,000,000 shares of its stock to be used for the Option
Plan.  As of December 31, 1995,  995,000  options  were  granted,  and none were
exercised.

Changes  in the  number of shares  subject  to  options  during  the year  ended
December 31, 1995 are summarized as follows:


                                                                      1995
                                                                     -------
              Outstanding at beginning of year                        ---
              Options granted at $ .25 share                         995,000

              Options exercised                                       ---
              Options cancelled or expired                            ---
                                                                     -------
              Outstanding at end of year                             995,000
                                                                     =======



              Two outside directors were each granted 15,000 warrants to acquire
shares of beneficial  interest in  Wedgestone  at an exercise  price of $.25 per
warrant share.  The warrants may be exercised at any time from the date of grant
until October 31, 1997.  The warrants or the warrant  shares may not be disposed
of or encumbered, except in accordance with certain provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933. As of December 31, 1995, none of the warrants were exercised.

              There  were  no  contributions   to  Wedgestone's   former  401(k)
Profit-Sharing  Plan ("Profit  Plan") for the year ended  December 31, 1993. The
Profit Plan was liquidated in July 1993, and the assets were  distributed to the
plan participants.

              In January 1995, the Company established the Wedgestone Automotive
Corp  Retirement  Savings Plan (the  "Retirement  Plan").  The  Retirement  Plan
provides that all eligible employees of the Company who have attained the age of
21, have  completed one year of  employment  and are not subject to a collective
bargaining  agreement  are  permitted to contribute up to 15% of their salary to
the  Retirement  Plan.  The  Company  makes  contributions  on  behalf  of  each
participant of a matching  amount up to an employee  contribution  of 2% of such
employee's  salary.  Employees are fully vested at all times with respect to all
employee contributions to the Retirement Plan.

              The  contributions  to  Wedgestone's  Retirement Plan for the year
ended December 31, 1995 were $8,300.

NOTE 12.    Litigation

Bankruptcy Claims

              On October 30, 1992, a group calling  itself the "Equity  Security
Holders Committee of Wedgestone  Financial (the  "Committee")  filed a complaint
(the  "Complaint")  commencing  an  adversary  proceeding  in the United  States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of  Massachusetts.  On May 20, 1993, the Court
dismissed the proceeding.  The Committee  appealed the dismissal to the District
Courts and it was denied.  The  Committee  appealed to the First  Circuit and on
March 1, 1995, the appeal was denied. The Committee requested a rehearing by the
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  On March 22, 1995, the Court denied the
petition for rehearing.

Other

              On May 25,  1995,  the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Court  for the
District of Massachusetts  issued an order  establishing  rights and obligations
with respect to the one remaining outstanding loan under which income rights had
been  granted  to  certain  Special  Income  Shareholders.  The  order  released
Wedgestone from all obligations regarding the loan and authorized the Company to
transfer all loan documents to the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation.  In
connection with this order, Wedgestone was directed to cancel the Special Income
Shares  subject to certain  future  distribution  rights.  The balance sheet and
income statement  presentation included in this registration has been changed to
reflect this cancellation.

NOTE 14.    Subsequent Events

         On March 5, 1996,  Hercules closed its  manufacturing  plant in Pelham,
Georgia.   The  market  for  the  bumpers   produced  in  the  Pelham   facility
significantly  changed during 1995.  Historically,  a significant  percentage of
Hercules business was for sales to dealers of a domestic OE Manufacturer.  A new
program implemented by one of these manufacturers in late 1994 made it extremely
difficult for Hercules to remain  competitive in this market  segment.  Hercules
incurred a net loss of $125,000 in 1995. As a result, management determined that
closing the Pelham facility was appropriate. Hercules is working with its senior
lender for an  orderly  liquidation  of the  assets in  Pelham.  While the final
outcome is  uncertain,  the  Company  does not expect the  closure of the Pelham
facility to have a material effect on 1996 operations.

 Supplemental Schedule of Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities

         During 1994, Standun  transferred land and buildings of $795,000 to the
Automotive Segment.

         In  connection  with  the  acquisition  of the  Automotive  Segment  in
November 1994,  Wedgestone  assumed a note  associated  with the  termination of
Standun's management agreement with a related party in the amount of $1,104,086.

         On January 9, 1995 Wedgestone acquired  substantially all of the assets
of Hercules Bumpers,  Inc.  ("Hercules") which manufactures and distributes rear
bumpers for both domestic and foreign light duty trucks.  The purchase price for
the assets  acquired was the  assumption  of certain debt and other  liabilities
approximating  $5.1  million.  In  addition,  certain  debt is being  guaranteed
jointly and severally by Charles W. Brady ("Brady"),  the principal  shareholder
of Hercules,  and  Chattahoochee  Leasing  Corporation  ("CLC"),  a  corporation
controlled by Brady. In exchange for this guarantee, Brady received a promissory
note in the amount of $300,000 and 1,200,000  shares of  beneficial  interest of
Wedgestone.  In  consideration  for an agreement to pay a liability of Hercules,
CLC received a promissory  note for $100,000 which was secured by 100,000 shares
of beneficial  interest of Wedgestone.  In June, 1995, the Company exercised its
right under the CLC  Agreement  and acquired the note by issuing these shares to
CLC. See Subsequent Events (Note 14).

         In  connection  with  the  Hercules   acquisition,   Resource  Holdings
Associates and PFG received a fee of $220,000 consisting of $160,000 and 200,000
shares of beneficial  interest of  Wedgestone  at a valuation  price of $.30 per
share.

         In  connection  with the  January  9,  1995  acquisition  of  Hercules,
Wedgestone assumed liabilities to acquire assets as follows:


           Accrued expenses                                          $1,094,021

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

         During Fiscal 1995, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees
of the Company  was  comprised  of John J.  Doran,  Jeffrey A. Oberg and John C.
Shaw.  None of the  members  of the  Compensation  Committee  has  ever  been an
employee  or  officer  of the  Company  or any of  its  subsidiaries,  with  the
exception  of Mr.  Shaw who is the  Chairman  of the Board but does not  receive
compensation for acting in such capacity.  Mr. Shaw,  however,  is a significant
equity holder in PSG Associates,  which provides financial and advisory services
to St. James and  Hercules,  subsidiaries  of the Company.  In Fiscal 1995,  the
Company paid PSG  Associates  $125,000 in  connection  with such services to St.
James.  The Trust will pay PSG  Associates  $125,000 for  financial and advisory
services rendered to St. James for the current fiscal year.  Otherwise,  none of
the  members  of the  Compensation  Committee  has  any  relationship  requiring
disclosure  under any  paragraph of Item 404 or in Item  402(j)(3) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the Commission.

          REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

         The following is the report of the Compensation  Committee of the Trust
(the "Committee") on executive compensation for Fiscal 1995.

         Compensation Philosophy.  The Committee believes that it is in the best
interests of the Shareholders for the Company to attract,  maintain and motivate
top quality management personnel, especially its executive officers, by offering
and maintaining a competitive  compensation package that exhibits an appropriate
relationship  between  executive pay and the creation of stockholder  value. The
general  philosophy  of the  committee  is to integrate  (i) adequate  levels of
annual base  compensation;  (ii) annual cash bonuses and equity  awards based on
achievement of short-term corporate and individual  performance goals, such that
executive compensation levels will be higher in years in which performance goals
are achieved or exceeded; and (iii) equity awards, to ensure that management has
a  continuing  stake in the long term success of the Company and return of value
to its stockholders.

         In November 1994, the Company acquired the assets of the Fey Automotive
division  of Standun,  Inc. In  connection  with this  acquisition,  the Company
formed a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Wedgestone  Automotive  Corp, and hired the
senior management of the Fey Automotive  division (the "Executive  Group").  The
Executive  Group  included Mr. Sharp as Chief  Executive  Officer of  Wedgestone
Automotive  Corp, Mr. Lee as Chief  Financial  Officer of Wedgestone  Automotive
Corp, Mr. Wasielewski as Senior Vice President of Sales of Wedgestone Automotive
Corp,  and Mr.  Westerhoff as Senior Vice  President of Operations of Wedgestone
Automotive Corp. In connection with the  acquisition,  the Company agreed to pay
salary and benefit amounts to the members of the Executive Group consistent with
their prior salary and benefits at Standun, Inc.

         The elements of the Committee's integrated  compensation philosophy and
the  application  of  these  philosophies  during  Fiscal  1995,   including  in
connection with the hiring of the Executive Group, are summarized as follows:

         Base  Compensation   Levels.   Although  the  Committee  believes  that
performance-based  pay  elements  should be a key  element  in the  compensation
packages for its executive officers, the Company must maintain base compensation
levels  commensurate  with other comparable  companies in its industry with whom
the Company competes for management personnel (the "Comparable Companies").

         The Comparable  Companies  selected by the Company are those automotive
supply companies that have production and marketing  strategies similar to those
of the  Company,  which  are  similar  to the  Company  and  which  compete  for
executives in the same markets as the Company.

         Although the process of setting base compensation levels often reflects
subjective factors,  such as leadership,  commitment,  attitude and motivational
effect, the Committee also considers  objective factors,  such as achievement of
performance goals (primarily profitability of the areas over which the executive
has management  responsibility),  level of responsibility  and prior experience.
The  Committee  believes  that the overall  compensation  paid to the  Company's
executive  officers for the last year was competitive with overall  compensation
paid by the Comparable Companies for similar positions.

         Performance-Based Compensation. The Company provides executive officers
with the following performance-based compensation programs:

         o        Cash Bonuses.  Cash bonuses may be earned if certain specified
                  performance goals are achieved.

         o        Stock  Options.   Options  may  be  granted  pursuant  to  the
                  Wedgestone  Financial  1995  Stock  Option  Plan (the  "Option
                  Plan") at an exercise  price equal to or greater than the fair
                  market value of the stock on the date of the grant.  The value
                  of the options is related  directly to the market price of the
                  stock and,  accordingly  to the long-term  performance  of the
                  Company.

         An aggregate of 841,500 options were granted to the Company's executive
officers in 1995 under the Option Plan. The number of options  granted was based
on the executive's length of service and level of responsibility in the Company.

         Compensation  of  Chief  Executive   Officer.   Mr.   Goldstein's  base
compensation  for 1995 was $160,200  and has been set at $175,000 for 1996.  The
Committee  believes that Mr.  Goldstein's  base salary in 1995 was comparable to
that of other chief  executives  in the industry in which the Company  competes.
Mr.  Goldstein  did not  receive  a bonus in 1995,  but was  granted  an  option
exercisable for 85,000 shares at an exercise price of $ .25 per share.

Profit Sharing, Stock Option Plans and Warrants

         During 1995,  Wedgestone  created the  Wedgestone  Financial 1995 Stock
Option Plan (the "Option  Plan").  The Option Plan became  effective on December
15, 1995. The total number of shares of Wedgestone  stock reserved and available
for  distribution  under  the  Option  Plan is  1,000,000.  Officers,  other key
employees and significant non-employees who are responsible for or contribute to
the management,  growth and/or  profitability  of the business of Wedgestone are
eligible to be granted  stock  options  under the Option  Plan.  The Option Plan
replaces and  supersedes a former stock  option plan  established  in 1994.  The
optionees  under  the  Option  Plan  will be  selected  from time to time by the
Committee (a group of not less than three  persons  appointed by the  Trustees).
The  stock  options  granted  under the  Option  Plan may be of two  types:  (i)
Incentive Stock Options and (ii) Non-Qualified  Stock Options.  The option price
per share of stock under a stock option will be  determined  by the Committee at
the time of grant.  The option price with  respect to an incentive  stock option
shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Wedgestone  stock on
the date of the option grant.  The option price with respect to a  non-qualified
stock  option  shall  not be less  than  85% of the  fair  market  value  of the
Wedgestone  stock on the date of the  option  grant.  The stock  options  can be
exercised  at such times as  determined  by the  Committee.  The stock  which is
acquired  through the  exercise  of the stock  option is required to be held for
investment and not for resale or other  distribution.  The options and the stock
are non-transferable. As of March 28, 1996, 995,000 shares have been granted.

         Two outside directors, Mr. John J. Doran and Mr. Jeffrey A. Oberg, were
each  granted  15,000  warrants  to acquire  shares of  beneficial  interest  in
Wedgestone at an exercise price of $.25 per warrant  share.  The warrants may be
exercised  at any time  from  the date of grant  until  October  31,  1997.  The
warrants or the warrant shares may not be disposed of or  encumbered,  except in
accordance  with certain  provisions  of the Security Act. As of March 26, 1996,
none of the warrants have been exercised.

         All former Profit Sharing, Stock Option and 401(k) Profit Sharing Plans
were terminated  pursuant to the bankruptcy plan of  reorganization in 1992. The
401(k)  Profit  Sharing Plan was  liquidated  as of July 21, 1993 and the assets
were  distributed  to the  plan  participants.  In  January  1995,  the  Company
established  the  Wedgestone   Automotive  Corp  Retirement  Savings  Plan  (the
"Retirement  Plan"). The Retirement Plan provides that all eligible employees of
the  Company  who  have  attained  the age of 21,  have  completed  one  year of
employment  and  are  not  subject  to a  collective  bargaining  agreement  are
permitted to contribute up to 15% of their salary to the  Retirement  Plan.  The
Company makes  contributions  on behalf of each participant of a matching amount
up to an employee  contribution of 2% of such employee's  salary.  Employees are
fully  vested at all times with  respect to all  employee  contributions  to the
Retirement Plan.

Item 13.    Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

         The Automotive Segment was purchased from Standun,  which is indirectly
owned  and/or  controlled  by Resource  Holdings  Associates  and PFG Corp.  The
managing  directors of Resource  Holdings Ltd. (the general  partner of Resource
Holdings  Associates) and PFG Corp are former shareholders of St. James. Each of
the  managing  directors  owns  directly  or  indirectly  in excess of 5% of the
outstanding  shares of Wedgestone.  In connection with the acquisition,  Standun
now owns 31.5% of  Wedgestone.  Wedgestone  assumed a note  associated  with the
termination  of Standun's  management  agreement with Fifth Avenue  Partners,  a
related  party of  Wedgestone  and  Standun,  in the  amount  of  $1,104,086  in
conjunction  with the  acquisition.  The note is payable  monthly with  interest
calculated  in arrears at 9% per annum over the five years  ending  December 31,
1999.

         St. James has a Consulting  Agreement with PSG Associates  entered into
on January 10, 1992 ( prior to its acquisition by Wedgestone).  Pursuant to this
Agreement,  PSG Associates has agreed to provide advisory  services to St. James
with respect to its operations,  expansion and financing activities at a minimum
rate of $125,000 per year plus reimbursement of expenses. Mr. Shaw, a trustee of
the Company,  is a  significant  equity  holder in PSG  Associates,  through JCS
Holdings  Corp.  ("JCS") as is each of PFG Corp.,  JMS Holdings  Corp.,  and RAB
Management  Corp.  (the former St. James  shareholders).  During 1995,  1994 and
1993, St. James paid $125,000 per year, to PSG  Associates  under this contract.
For the years 1996 and 1997,  St.  James is  required  to pay to PSG  Associates
$125,000 annually, pursuant to this Agreement.

         On January 12, 1993, as amended, Wedgestone entered into a secured, one
year  credit  facility  due July 1996 with Rockaway pursuant to which Wedgestone
is permitted to borrow up to a maximum to $300,000 with additional over advances
available at the discretion of the lender to fund  Wedgestone's  working capital
needs and those of its  subsidiaries.  The contractual  rate of interest on this
Loan is  fifteen  percent  (15%) per annum  and  there was a  commitment  fee of
$4,500,  payable  upon  initial  funding  and  an  extension  fee of  $5,000  in
connection  with the amendment in 1994. The Rockaway Loan is secured by a pledge
of  substantially  all of the stock of Wedgestone's  subsidiaries,  its personal
assets and notes receivables.  As of December 31, 1995,  Wedgestone had borrowed
$300,000  pursuant to this facility and Rockaway  advanced  amounts in excess of
the agreement of $429,000.  Rockaway is a real estate  holding  company which is
controlled by former St. James

shareholders.  The former St. James  shareholders  are entitled to substantially
all of the economic benefits of Rockaway. Mr. Goldstein,  who is president and a
trustee of Wedgestone, is the president of Rockaway.

         In  connection  with  the  Hercules   acquisition,   Resource  Holdings
Associates and PFG received a fee of $220,000 consisting of $160,000 and 200,000
shares of beneficial  interest of  Wedgestone  at a valuation  price of $.30 per
share.

              In particular, the Committee shall have the authority:

       (a)    to select the  officers,  key  employees  of the  Company  and key
              non-employees  to whom  Stock  Options  from  time to time  may be
              granted hereunder;

       (b)    to determine whether and to what extent Incentive Stock Options or
              Non-Qualified Stock Options or a combination of the two, are to be
              granted hereunder;

       (c)    to determine the number of shares to be covered by each such award
              granted hereunder;

       (d)    to determine the terms and conditions,  not inconsistent  with the
              terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder (including,  but
              not limited to, any  restriction  on any Stock  Option  and/or the
              shares of Stock relating thereto);

       (e)    to determine whether,  to what extent and under what circumstances
              Stock and other  amounts  payable  with  respect to an award under
              this  Plan  shall  be  deferred  either  automatically  or at  the
              election of the participant.

              The Committee shall have the authority to adopt,  alter and repeal
such  administrative  rules,  guidelines and practices  governing the Plan as it
shall, from time to time, deem advisable;  to interpret the terms and provisions
of the Plan and any award  issued  under the Plan (and any  agreements  relating
thereto); and to otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.

              All decisions made by the Committee  pursuant to the provisions of
the Plan shall be final and binding on all  persons,  including  the Company and
Plan participants.

SECTION 3.          Stock Subject to Plan.


                                       45
<PAGE>

              The total  number of shares of Stock  reserved and  available  for
distribution  under the Plan shall be  1,000,000.  Such shares may  consist,  in
whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares.

              If any  shares  that have been  optioned  cease to be  subject  to
Options,  such shares shall again be available  for  distribution  in connection
with future awards under the Plan.

              In  the  event  of  any  merger,  reorganization,   consolidation,
recapitalization,  stock dividend, other change in corporate structure affecting
the Stock,  or spin-off or other  distribution of assets to  shareholders,  such
substitution  or  adjustment  shall be made in the  aggregate  number  of shares
reserved  for  issuance  under the Plan,  and in the number and option  price of
shares  subject  to  outstanding  options  granted  under  the  Plan,  as may be
determined to be appropriate by the Committee, in its sole discretion,  provided
that the number of shares subject to any award shall always be a whole number.

SECTION 4.          Eligibility.

              Officers, other key employees of the Company and other significant
non-employees  who are responsible  for or contribute to the management,  growth
and/or  profitability  of the business of the Company are eligible to be granted
Stock  Options under the Plan.  The  optionees  under the Plan shall be selected
from time to time by the  Committee,  in its sole  discretion,  from among those
eligible, and the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion,  the number
of shares covered by each award.

SECTION 5.          Stock Options.

              Any Stock Option  granted  under the Plan shall be in such form as
the Committee may from time to time approve.

              The Stock Options granted under the Plan may be of two types:  (i)
Incentive Stock Options and (ii) NonQualified Stock Options.  No Incentive Stock
Options shall be granted under the Plan ten (10) years from the date the Plan is
adopted by the Board of Directors.

              The  Committee  shall  have the  authority  to grant any  optionee
Incentive Stock Options,  Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of options.
To the extent that any option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option,  it
shall constitute a separate Non-Qualified Stock Option.

              Anything in the Plan to the contrary  notwithstanding,  no term of
this Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall be  interpreted,  amended or
altered,  nor shall any  discretion  or authority  granted  under the Plan be so
exercised,  so as to disqualify  either the Plan or any  Incentive  Stock Option
under  Section 422 of the Code.  The preceding  sentence  shall not preclude any
modification or amendment to an outstanding  Incentive Stock Option,  whether or
not such modification or amendment results in disqualification of such Option as
an Incentive  Stock  Option,  provided  the optionee  consents in writing to the
modification or amendment.

              Options  granted  under the Plan shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable.

       (a)    Option  Price.  The  option  price per share of Stock  purchasable
              under a Stock Option shall be  determined  by the Committee at the
              time of grant.  In no event  shall the  option  price per share of
              Stock purchasable

                                       46

<PAGE>

              under an  Incentive  Stock  Option  be less  than 100% of the Fair
              Market  Value of the Stock on the date of the grant of the option.
              In no event  shall the option  price per share of a  Non-Qualified
              Stock  Option  be less  than 85% of the Fair  Market  Value of the
              Stock on the date of the grant of the option.  If an employee owns
              or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules applicable
              under  Section 425 (d) or the Code) more than 10% of the  combined
              voting  power  of all  classes  of  stock  of the  Company  and an
              Incentive  Stock  Option is granted to such  employee,  the option
              price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair  Market  Value of the
              Stock on the date the option is granted.  The Fair Market Value of
              the  shares  of Stock of the  Company  means  the  average  of the
              closing  prices  of the  sales  of  the  Stock  on any  securities
              exchange  on which  the stock  may at the time be  listed,  or the
              average of the  representative  bid and asked prices quoted in the
              NASDAQ Small-Cap Market. If at any time the Stock is not listed on
              a Securities  Exchange or quoted on the NASDAQ  Small-Cap  Market,
              the Fair  Market  Value of the Stock  shall be  determined  by the
              Committee.

       (b)    Option  Term.  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the
              Committee, but no Incentive Stock Option shall be exercisable more
              than ten (10) years  after the date the option is  granted.  If an
              employee  owns or is deemed to own (by  reason of the  attribution
              rules of Section 425(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined
              voting  power  of all  classes  of  stock  of the  Company  and an
              Incentive  Stock Option is granted to such  employee,  the term of
              such option  shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of
              grant.

       (c)    Exercisability. Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or
              times as determined by the Committee.  If the Committee  provides,
              in  its  discretion,  that  any  option  is  exercisable  only  in
              installments,  the Committee may waive such  installment  exercise
              provisions at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  unless the
              Stock  Option  Agreement  provides  otherwise,  any  Stock  Option
              granted  under this Plan  shall be  exercisable  in full,  without
              regard  to  any  installment  exercise  provisions,  for a  period
              specified by the Company, but not to exceed sixty (60) days, prior
              to the occurrence of any of the following events:  (i) dissolution
              or  liquidation  of the Company other than in  conjunction  with a
              bankruptcy  of the  Company or any  similar  occurrence,  (ii) any
              merger, consolidation, acquisition, separation, reorganization, or
              similar  occurrence,  where the Company will not be the  surviving
              entity or (iii) the transfer of substantially all of the assets of
              the  Company  or  51% or  more  of the  outstanding  Stock  of the
              Company.

       (d)    Methods  of  Exercise.   Subject  to  any   installment   exercise
              provisions  to  which  they  are  subject,  Stock  Options  may be
              exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period
              by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the
              number of shares to be purchased. Such notice shall be accompanied
              by payment in full of the purchase  price,  either by certified or
              bank  check,  or by any other form of legal  consideration  deemed
              sufficient by the Committee and consistent with the Plan's purpose
              and  applicable  law,  including  promissory  notes or a  properly
              executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to
              a broker  acceptable  to the  Company to  promptly  deliver to the
              Company the amount of sale or loan  proceeds  to pay the  exercise
              price.  As determined by the  Committee,  in its sole  discretion,
              payment  in  full  or in part  may  also  be  made in the  form of
              unrestricted  Stock already owned by the optionee  (based,  on the
              Fair  Market  Value  of  the  Stock  on the  date  the  option  is
              exercised,  as determined by the  Committee),  provided,  however,
              that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option,  the right to make
              a payment in the form of already  owned  shares may be  authorized
              only at the time the option is granted.  If the terms of an option
              so permit,  an optionee may elect to pay all or part of the option
              exercise  price by having the Company  withhold from the shares of
              Stock that would  otherwise be issued upon exercise that number of
              shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value 

                                       47
<PAGE>

              equal to the aggregate  option  exercise price for the shares with
              respect to which such  election is made.  No shares of Stock shall
              be issued  until  full  payment  therefor  has been  made.  Unless
              provided  otherwise  in the Stock  Option  Agreement,  an optionee
              shall  generally have the right to dividends and other rights of a
              shareholder  with  respect to shares  subject to the Stock  Option
              when the optionee has given written  notice of exercise,  has paid
              in full  for  such  shares,  and,  if  requested,  has  given  the
              representation described in Section 8(a).

       (e)    Non-transferability   of  Options.   No  Stock   Option  shall  be
              transferable by the optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws
              of  descent  and  distribution,  and all  Stock  Options  shall be
              exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee.

       (f)    Termination by Death.  If an optionee's  employment by the Company
              terminates by reason of death,  the Stock Option may thereafter be
              immediately exercised,  to the extent then exercisable (or on such
              accelerated basis as the Committee shall determine),  by the legal
              representative  of the estate or by the  legatee  of the  optionee
              under the will of the  optionee,  for a period of three  years (or
              such shorter period as the Committee  shall specify at grant) from
              the date of such death or until the  expiration of the stated term
              of the option, whichever period is shorter.

       (g)    Termination by Reason of Disability.  If an optionee's  employment
              by the  Company  terminates  by  reason of  Disability,  any Stock
              Option held by such optionee may  thereafter be exercised,  to the
              extent  it was  exercisable  at the  time  of  termination  due to
              Disability (or on such  accelerated  basis as the Committee  shall
              determine),  but may not be  exercised  after three years (or such
              shorter  period as the Committee  shall specify at grant) from the
              date of such  termination of employment by reason of Disability or
              the expiration of the stated term of the option,  whichever period
              is the  shorter.  In the event of  termination  of  employment  by
              reason of  Disability,  if an Incentive  Stock Option is exercised
              after  the  expiration  of the  exercise  periods  that  apply for
              purposes of Section 422 of the Code, the option will thereafter be
              treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.

       (h)    Termination by Reason of Retirement.  If an optionee's  employment
              by the  Company  terminates  by  reason of  Retirement,  any Stock
              Option held by such  optionee may  thereafter  be exercised to the
              extent it was  exercisable  at the time of such  Retirement (or on
              such accelerated basis as the Committee shall determine),  but may
              not be  exercised  after  three years (or such  shorter  period as
              Committee   shall   specify  at  grant)  from  the  date  of  such
              termination  of employment or the expiration of the stated term of
              the  option,  whichever  period  is the  shorter.  In the event of
              termination of employment by reason of Retirement, if an Incentive
              Stock Option is  exercised  after the  expiration  of the exercise
              periods  that apply for  purposes  of Section  422 of the Code the
              option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.

       (i)    Other Termination.  Unless otherwise  determined by the Committee,
              if an  optionee's  employment  by the Company  terminates  for any
              reason  other than  death,  Disability  or  Retirement,  the Stock
              Option shall  thereupon  terminate,  except that the option may be
              exercised to the extent it was exercisable at such termination for
              the lesser of three months or the balance of the option's  term if
              the  optionee is  involuntarily  terminated  without  Cause by the
              Company.

       (j)    Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options. The aggregate Fair Market
              Value  (determined  as of the time the Stock Option is granted) of
              the common Stock with  respect to which an 


                                       48

<PAGE>


              Incentive  Stock  Option  under this Plan or any other plan of the
              Company is  exercisable  for the first time by an optionee  during
              any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000.

       (k)    No Equity  Interest.  An optionee shall have no equity interest in
              the Company or any voting, dividend,  liquidation,  or dissolution
              rights with  respect to any Stock of the Company  solely by reason
              of having a Stock Option. Furthermore, prior to the exercise of an
              optionee's Stock Option,  that optionee shall have no interest in,
              or any voting,  dividend,  liquidation or dissolution  rights with
              respect to, the Common Stock relating to that Stock Option.

SECTION 6.          Amendments and Termination.

              The  Board may  amend,  alter,  or  discontinue  the Plan,  but no
amendment,  alteration,  or discontinuation  shall be made (i) which impairs the
rights of an optionee or participant  under a Stock Option granted,  without the
optionee's  consent,  or (ii) which without the approval of the  stockholders of
the  Company  would cause the Plan to no longer  comply with  Section 422 of the
Code or any other regulatory requirements.

              The  Committee  may  amend  the  terms  of  any  award  or  option
theretofore granted,  prospectively or retroactively,  but, subject to Section 3
above,  no such  amendment  shall impair the rights of any holder without his or
her consent.  The Committee may also substitute new Stock Options for previously
granted  options,  including  previously  granted  options  having higher option
prices.

SECTION 7.          Unfunded Status of Plan.

              The  Plan  is  intended  to  constitute  an  "unfunded"  plan  for
incentive  compensation.  With  respect  to  any  payments  not  yet  made  to a
participant or optionee by the Company,  nothing contained herein shall give any
such participant or optionee any rights that are greater than those of a general
creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the
creation of trusts or other  arrangements to meet the obligations  created under
the Plan to  deliver  Stock or  payments  in lieu of or with  respect  to awards
hereunder,  provided,  however,  that  the  existence  of such  trusts  or other
arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.

SECTION 8.          General Provisions.

       (a)    The Committee may require each person  purchasing  shares pursuant
              to a Stock  Option  under the Plan to  represent to and agree with
              the Company in writing that the  optionee is acquiring  the shares
              without a view to distribution  thereof. The certificates for such
              shares  may  include  any  legend   which  the   Committee   deems
              appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.

              All  certificates  for  shares of Stock  delivered  under the Plan
              pursuant  to any  Stock  Option  shall be  subject  to such  stock
              transfer  orders and other  restrictions as the Committee may deem
              advisable under the rules, regulations,  and other requirements of
              the  Securities and Exchange  Commission,  any stock exchange upon
              which the Stock is then  listed,  and any  applicable  Federal  or
              state  securities  laws,  and the  Committee may cause a legend or
              legends  to be put on any such  certificates  to make  appropriate
              reference to such restrictions.

       (b)    Nothing  contained  in this Plan  shall  prevent  the  Board  from
              adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to
              stockholder  approval  if such  approval  is  required;  and  such
              arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only
              in specific cases.  The adoption of the Plan shall not 

                                       49

<PAGE>

              confer upon any  employee  of the  Company any right to  continued
              employment  with the  Company,  as the case may be,  nor  shall it
              interfere  in any way with the right of the  Company to  terminate
              the employment of any of its employees at any time.

       (c)    Each  participant  shall,  no later  than the date as of which any
              part  of  the  value  of an  award  first  becomes  includable  as
              compensation  in the gross income of the  participant  for Federal
              income tax  purposes,  pay to the  Company,  or make  arrangements
              satisfactory to the Committee  regarding  payment of, any Federal,
              state,  or local taxes of any kind  required by law to be withheld
              with respect to the award.  The  obligations  of the Company under
              the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements  and
              the Company shall, to the extent  permitted by law, have the right
              to deduct any such taxes  from any  payment of any kind  otherwise
              due to the participant.  With respect to any award under the Plan,
              if the terms of such award so permit,  a participant  may elect by
              written  notice  to the  Company  to  satisfy  part  or all of the
              withholding  tax  requirements  associated  with the  award by (i)
              authorizing  the  Company  to retain  from the number of shares of
              Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to the  participant,  or
              (ii)  delivering to the Company from shares of Stock already owned
              by the participant, that number of shares having an aggregate Fair
              Market  Value  equal  to  part or all of the  tax  payable  by the
              participant under this Section 8(c). Any such election shall be in
              accordance  with,  and subject to,  applicable  tax and securities
              laws, regulations and rulings.

SECTION 9.          Effective Date of Plan.

              The Plan shall be  effective  on the date it is approved by a vote
of the holders of a majority of the Stock  present and entitled to vote (whether
in person or by proxy) at a meeting of the Company's shareholders.

SECTION 10.         Long-Term Capital Gains.

              Incentive Stock Options granted pursuant to this Plan are intended
to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment available, under the provisions
of Sections  421(a) and 422 of the Code. As of January 1, 1994,  eligibility for
such tax treatment  required that no  disposition  of shares of Stock be made by
the optionee (i) within two (2) years from the date the  Incentive  Stock Option
is  granted,  or (ii) within one (1) year of the date the Stock  underlying  the
Incentive Stock Option is transferred to him.
