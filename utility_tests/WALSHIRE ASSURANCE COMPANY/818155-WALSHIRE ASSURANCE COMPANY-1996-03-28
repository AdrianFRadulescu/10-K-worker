  PART I
  
  ITEM 1:  BUSINESS
  
  General
  
       Walshire Assurance Company ( Company ) is an insurance holding
  company headquartered in York, Pennsylvania.  Through its wholly owned
  subsidiary, Lincoln General Insurance Company ( Lincoln General ), the
  Company primarily provides a specialized line of property and casualty
  insurance principally in Pennsylvania, and to a lesser extent, in
  Missouri, Georgia, Maryland, Alabama and in certain other states located
  in the mid-Atlantic, South, Southeastern and Midwest regions of the
  country. The Company recently organized Comp America Insurance Company
  ( Comp ) as an insurance company in Pennsylvania.  Through 1995, no
  business has been written by Comp.
  
       The Company principally offers commercial automobile physical damage
  and liability coverages for trucks, tractors, trailers, buses and other
  commercial vehicles as well as workers  compensation coverages for
  trucking employees.  To a lesser extent, the Company offers certain
  commercial coverages for cargo in transit and other property, commonly
  called inland marine coverage, as well as personal automobile physical
  damage, surety and fidelity coverages.  The Company also provides
  adjusting services for claims covered by the Company and certain third
  parties, and financing for insurance premiums payable by customers of the
  Company and others.  See  Business Written  and  Claims .
  
       Since 1991, the Company has offered commercial automobile physical 
  damage and commercial automobile liability coverages as well as surety
  bonds.  In 1992, the Company began to offer personal automobile physical
  damage insurance, and in 1994, the Company began to offer workers 
  compensation coverages.  The following table sets forth the direct
  premiums written by the Company for the years ended December 31, 1995,
  1994 and 1993 by line of business.

       For the past several years, the Company s principal strategy has been
  to position itself within its geographical markets as a consistent and
  reliable provider of commercial automobile coverages for the
  transportation industry.  The Company believes that it has been able to 
  operate successfully in the commercial automobile market due to five
  principal factors:  (i) the Company s comprehensive knowledge of the
  transportation industry and the geographical markets in which the Company
  operates, which enables the Company to be more selective of the risks it
  underwrites and to settle claims within reasonable amounts, (ii) the
  Company s nineteen-year record of operations, which evidences the
  Company s willingness and ability to provide a consistent market for 
  
  1
  
  commercial automobile coverages, (iii) the Company s strong agency force,
  which the Company has been able to build through careful selection, (See
   Business-Marketing), (iv) the Company s reputation for service, which the
  Company has been able to build through an agency force that is
  knowledgeable of the trucking industry and a claims department and
  adjusters which settle claims relatively quickly, and (v) the Company s
  degree of automation, which management believes is unusual for a company
  of its size and which permits prompt and efficient service to
  policyholders and agents.
  
       The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in December,
  1976.  The Company s principal executive offices are located at 3350
  Whiteford Road, P. O. Box 3849, York, Pennsylvania 17402-0138, telephone
  (717) 757-0000.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the  Company 
  refers to Walshire Assurance Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
  
  Risk Factors
  
       In analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in the
  Company, investors should consider carefully all the information contained
  or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in
  particular, the following:
  
       Importance of Key Individual.  The continued participation of Kenneth
  R. Taylor, its President and Chief Executive Officer is important to the
  Company s business.  The Company has entered into an employment agreement
  with Mr. Taylor, expiring in 1997, which contains, among other things, a
  covenant not to compete during the term of the agreement and for one year
  thereafter.  Although Mr. Taylor may voluntarily terminate his employment
  under this agreement, he has no present intention to do so.  Mr. Taylor
  devotes such time to the Company as he believes is appropriate, although
  his employment agreement provides that he is not required to devote his
  entire business time to the Company.  The loss of the services of Mr.
  Taylor could adversely affect the Company s business.  The Company does
  not maintain key-man life insurance on Mr. Taylor.  See -  Item 10: 
  Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant  and  Item 11: 
  Executive Compensation .
  
       Importance of Key Agent.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, one of the
  Company s agents accounted for 23%, 24% and 30%, respectively, of the
  total premiums written by the Company.  The loss of this agent could
  adversely affect the Company s business.  See  Item 1:  BUSINESS -
  Marketing . 
  
       Restrictions on Dividends and Other Distributions from Insurance
  Subsidiaries.  One of the Company s sources of cash with which to pay
  dividends on its outstanding securities is dividends from Lincoln General
  and Comp  ( Insurance Subsidiaries ).  The Insurance Subsidiaries are
  subject to state laws which restrict the amount of dividends and other
  distributions they may pay.  As of December 31, 1995, the Insurance
  Subsidiaries had $3,238,000 available for the payment of dividends to the
  Company, without the prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. 
  The Insurance Subsidiaries are also subject to risk-based capital
  requirements which may further restrict their ability to pay dividends. 
  See  Item 1:  BUSINESS - Regulation  and Note 11 of the Notes to
  Consolidated Financial Statements, incorporated by reference.
  
  2
       Regulation.  Insurance companies are subject to the supervision, laws
  and regulations of the states in which they transact business.  These laws
  and regulations cover many aspects of their business, including licensure,
  the payment of dividends, the establishment of premium rates, the
  settlement of claims, the transfer of control and the requirement to
  participate in assigned risk pools.  Certain changes in such laws and
  regulations could have a material adverse effect on the operations of
  insurance companies, including the Company.  Specific regulatory
  developments which could have a material adverse effect on the operations
  of the insurance industry include, but are not limited to, the potential
  repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (which exempts insurance companies
  from a variety of federal regulatory requirements) and possible rate
  rollback legislation.  In addition, the administration of such regulations
  is vested in state agencies which have broad powers and are concerned
  primarily with the protection of policyholders.  Under the Pennsylvania
  Insurance Company Law, subject to certain exceptions, no person may make
  an offer to acquire  control  (as defined by statute) or acquire control
  of the Company without the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance
  Department.  Control is presumed to exist if any person, directly or
  indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies
  representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the Company.  See
   Item 1:  BUSINESS - Regulation .
  
       Competition:  The property and casualty insurance industry is highly
  competitive on the basis of both price and service.  There are numerous
  companies competing for business in the geographic markets in which the
  Company operates, and no single company dominates.  See  Item 1:  BUSINESS
  - Competition .
  
       Reinsurance.  The Company relies upon reinsurance agreements to limit
  its maximum net loss from large single risks or risks in concentrated
  areas, and to increase its capacity to write insurance.  Reinsurance does
  not relieve the primary insurer from liability to its policyholders.  To
  the extent that a reinsurer may be unable to pay losses for which it is
  liable under the terms of a reinsurance agreement, the Company is exposed
  to the risk of continued liability for such losses.  However, the Company
  requires all of its reinsurers to have a Best s rating of  A  (Excellent )
  or better.  Additional premiums incurred under certain reinsurance
  arrangements as a result of catastrophic events could adversely affect the
  profitability of the Company.  See  Item 1: BUSINESS - Reinsurance .
  
  Certain Provisions of the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. 
  The Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, among other
  things, that (i) the Board of Directors may, without further action of the
  shareholders of the Company, issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred
  Stock with such terms as may be determined by the Board of Directors,
  subject to certain limitations; (ii) directors are to be elected to
  staggered three-year terms; (iii) directors may only be removed by a vote
  of shareholders entitled to cast at least 75% of the votes that all
  shareholders are entitled to cast thereon and, in certain cases only for
  cause; (iv) there is no cumulative voting for the election of directors;
  and (v) any proposed amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation
  or Bylaws, which is not approved by the Board of Directors, must be
  approved by the vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least 75% of the
  votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast thereon.  Pursuant to
  these provisions, the Company issued 141,700 
  shares of 6 1/2% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock with certain 
  
  3
  preferred and special rights.  These provisions could adversely affect the
  rights of the holders of 6 1/2% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and
  Common Stock and may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire the
  Company.  In addition, as a result of the super-majority voting provisions
  relating to an amendment of the Company s Articles of Incorporation and
  Bylaws and the percentage of the outstanding shares of the Company s
  Common Stock that certain directors and/or officers of the Company
  beneficially own, such directors and/or officers will be able to defeat
  any amendment to such Articles or Bylaws not approved by them.  No
  dividends may be declared or paid with respect to the Common Stock until
  all accrued dividends on the 6 1/2% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
  have been paid or set apart for payment.  Copies of the Company s Articles
  of Incorporation and Bylaws are on file with the Securities Exchange
  Commission.
  
  Business Written
  
       Insurance underwriting opportunities are evaluated, and the decision
  to write a particular risk is made, by the underwriting department of the
  Company or by the Company s agents, subject in the latter case to final
  approval by the underwriting department.  The decision to write a
  particular risk is based on a number of factors, including the experience
  and past claims of the insured, the value and type of property to be
  insured and the type and location of the operation conducted by the
  insured.
  
       The following table sets forth direct premiums written, net premiums
  earned and the combined ratio of the Company for the last three fiscal
  years.  The combined ratio is a traditional measure of underwriting
  profitability.  The ratio is the sum of (i) the ratio of incurred losses
  and associated expenses to net premiums earned ( loss ratio ) and (ii) the
  ratio of expenses incurred for commissions, premium taxes, administrative
  and other underwriting expenses to net premiums written ( expense ratio ). 
  When the combined ratio is under 100%, underwriting results are generally
  considered profitable.  Conversely, when the combined ratio is over 100%,
  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable.  The combined
  ratio does not reflect investment income, federal income taxes or other
  non-operating income or expenses.

       In February 1995, the Company received its current rating  A+ 
  (Superior) from A. M. Best Company.  Best s ratings are based upon factors
  relevant to policyholders and are not necessarily directed toward the
  protection of investors. 
  
  Marketing
  
       The Company s insurance services are marketed through approximately
  360 independent insurance agents.  The Company selects agents based on 
  _________________________
    (1) Combined ratios have been calculated in accordance with accounting
        principles prescribed or permitted by state regulatory agencies.
  4
  their comprehensive knowledge of the industries to which the Company
  provides insurance coverages and the Company s product markets, 
  including in particular the transportation industry, and of the geographic
  market in which the agents operate.  During 1995, one of the Company s
  agents accounted for 23% of the total premiums written by the Company and
  another agent accounted for 6% of the total premiums written by the
  Company.  See  Item 13:  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions .
  
       The Company continually monitors and evaluates each agent s
  performance in terms of premiums written and loss experience.  The Company
  maintains a contingent commission program for its agents.  Under this
  program, certain agents, who underwrite specific amounts of insurance, are
  entitled to receive additional commissions based upon the profitability to
  the Company of the business placed by the particular agent.  For 1995,
  aggregate contingent commissions represented 7% of all commissions for
  such year.  The Company believes this program helps it to retain quality
  agents and encourages those agents to generate profitable business for the
  Company.
  
  Reinsurance
  
       The Company reinsures a portion of its exposure by paying to
  reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on all policies.  Insurance
  is ceded primarily to reduce the net liability on individual risks and to
  protect against catastrophic losses.  Although reinsurance does not
  legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full
  amount of the coverage, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the
  insurer to the extent of the losses reinsured.
  
       The Company maintains excess catastrophe reinsurance covering
  commercial automobile physical damage and inland marine losses and excess
  loss reinsurance covering commercial automobile physical damage and inland
  marine losses occurring at a terminal.
  
       Pursuant to another reinsurance treaty, the Company maintains excess
  of loss reinsurance covering commercial automobile liability losses. 
  Under this treaty, the Company s maximum loss exposure on any one loss
  occurrence (at a maximum coverage of $1,000,000) is $250,000.  The Company
  also maintains contingency excess of loss reinsurance covering commercial
  automobile liability losses in excess of $1,000,000 (to a maximum of
  $3,000,000).
  
       The Company also maintains excess of loss reinsurance covering non-
  trucking automobile liability losses.  Under this treaty, the Company s 
  maximum loss exposure on any one risk (at a maximum coverage of
  $1,000,000) is $250,000.  Also the Company maintains excess of loss
  reinsurance covering extraordinary medical benefit losses.  Under this
  excess of loss reinsurance treaty, the Company s maximum loss exposure on
  any one risk (at a maximum coverage of $1,000,000) is $250,000.  The
  Company reinsures all loss exposures in excess of the maximum loss
  exposure under each of these liability loss reinsurance treaties.
  
       Pursuant to another reinsurance treaty, the Company maintains excess
  of loss reinsurance covering workers  compensation losses.  Under this
  treaty, the Company retains $250,000 of each occurrence.  Losses in excess
  of $250,000 to a limit of $5,000,000 are reinsured.  Any loss in excess of
  $5,000,000 is the obligation of the Company.
  5
       The Company s policy is to maintain reinsurance only with insurance
  companies with a Best s rating  A  (Excellent) or better.  The Company
  generally has experienced little difficulty in obtaining reinsurance or 
  in receiving timely payment from its reinsurers.  The Company does not
  believe allowances for potentially uncollectible reinsurance are needed.
  
       For further information relating to the Company s reinsurance
  arrangement, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
  
  Rates
  
        The Company develops its rate structure from various sources.  For
  some of the Company s products, rates are derived from rating bureaus such
  as the Insurance Services Office ( ISO ), the National Council on
  Compensation Insurance ( NCCI ), the American Association of Insurance
  Services ( AAIS ) and the Surety Association of America ( SAA ).  When
  developing rates utilizing material provided by these organizations, the
  Company will use the rates promulgated by the bureau or it will apply its
  own expense and profit factors to the specific organization-generated loss
  costs.  For other products, the Company has developed its own rate
  structure independent of any rating bureau.  All necessary rate changes
  requiring approval are submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities
  for review and approval prior to use.
  
  Claims
  
       All claims operations, including review of initial reports of claims
  and the determination of liability amounts, are conducted by the Company s
  claims department.  The Company employs a staff of attorneys and adjusters
  specializing in the transportation industry for the purpose of adjusting
  claims covered by the Company and certain third parties.  The Company
  believes that by using attorneys and adjusters with an expertise in the
  transportation industry, it is able to settle claims within a relatively
  short period of time and within reasonable amounts.  When appropriate, the
  Company also uses outside attorneys and adjusters.
  
  Liabilities for Unpaid Claims and Claim Settlement Expenses
  
       The Company maintains liabilities for future payments of claims and
  claim settlement expenses.  Claim liabilities are estimates of the
  ultimate amount that will be required to be paid for claims and consist 
  of reported claims and incurred but not reported claims.  Claim settlement
  expense liabilities are intended to cover the estimated costs of settling
  all claims, including investigation and litigation costs, and are
  determined on the basis of historical experience.
  
       The amount of claim liabilities for reported claims is based upon an
  evaluation of the type of risk involved, knowledge of the specific
  circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating 
  to the type of claim.  Claim liabilities for incurred but not reported 
  claims are calculated based upon historical experience and current
  conditions.  Liabilities for unpaid claims are closely monitored and are
  recomputed periodically by the Company using updated information on
  reported claims.
  
  6
  
       Prior to 1994, the majority of the insurance written by the Company
  was on property risks.  Property claims tend to be reported quickly and 
  generally are settled within a relatively short period of time compared 
  to other lines of business.  As a result of this  short tail , the Company
  was not required to monitor and recompute liabilities for unpaid claims
  over an extended period of time on these coverages.  Moreover, because of
  the relatively short period of time within which these claims are settled,
  the effect of inflation on loss development was not significant.  In 1992,
  the Company began to write more liability coverages, and in 1994, the
  majority of the business written by the Company was liability coverages. 
  As a result, the Company is required to monitor liabilities for unpaid
  claims over a longer period of time than was the case when the Company
  principally wrote property coverages.  To date, the Company has not had to
  make significant recomputations for unpaid claims and the effect of
  inflation has not been significant.
  
       The following table sets forth the unpaid claims, claim settlement 
  expenses and claims drafts outstanding as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and
  1993, and the age of such claims based upon the date the claim occurred.

  as investment adviser to the Company in connection with its fixed income
  investment portfolio.
  
  Competition
  
       The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
  on the basis of both price and service.  There are numerous companies
  competing for business in the geographic markets in which the Company
  operates, and no single company dominates.  Some of the Company s
  competitors are national in scope and some have substantially greater
  financial resources than those of the Company.  The Company believes it 
  has been able to compete successfully by providing a consistent market for
  commercial automobile coverages and by providing quality service through
  agents and a staff who are knowledgeable of the transportation industry.
  
  Regulation
  
       Insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation in the
  states in which they transact business.  Such supervision and regulation
  relates to numerous aspects of an insurance company s business and
  financial condition.  The primary purpose of such regulation is the
  protection of policyholders.  The extent of such regulation varies, but
  generally derives from state statutes which delegate regulatory,
  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. 
  The authority of state insurance departments includes licensing of
  insurers and agents, approval of policy forms, establishment of standards
  of solvency for insurers, adoption of rules governing investments and
  premium rates for property and casualty insurance, and adoption of rules
  governing provisions for current losses 
  and future liabilities and deposits of securities for the benefit of
  policyholders.  State insurance departments also conduct periodic
  examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing
  of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of
  insurance companies.
       
       The majority of the states in which the Company does business and
  proposes to do business have guaranty fund laws under which insurers 
  
  9
  doing business in such states can be assessed on the basis of premiums
  written by the insurer in those states in order to fund policyholder
  liabilities of insolvent companies.  In general, under these laws, an
  insurer is subject to assessment, depending upon its market share of a
  given line of business, to assist in the payment of certain policyholders 
  claims against insolvent insurers.  The Company has made accruals for its
  portion of assessments related to such insolvencies based upon the most
  current information furnished by the guaranty associations.  During the
  year ended December 31, 1995, the amount of such insolvency assessments
  paid by the Company was not material.
  
       The property and casualty insurance industry continues to receive a
  considerable amount of publicity.  New regulations and legislation are
  being proposed to roll back premium rates, to limit damage awards, to
  control plaintiffs  counsel fees, to bring the industry under regulation
  by the federal government and to control premiums, policy terminations and
  other policy terms.  It is not possible to predict whether, in what form
  or in which jurisdictions these proposals might be adopted or the effect,
  if any, on the Company.
  
       Under Pennsylvania law, the Company, as the insurance holding company
  for the Insurance Subsidiaries, is subject to various registration and
  periodic reporting  requirements.  In addition, the Insurance Subsidiaries
  are subject to various restrictions on the amount of dividends they may
  pay to the Company.  Under Pennsylvania law, the Insurance Subsidiaries
  are permitted to pay, without the prior approval of the Pennsylvania
  Insurance Commissioner, cash or property dividends to the Company within
  any twelve month period in an amount up to the greater of (i) 10% of the
  Insurance Subsidiaries surplus as shown in its most recent annual
  statement on file with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, or (ii) the
  net investment income earned, excluding net realized capital gains or
  losses, shown in such statement.  The Pennsylvania Insurance Company Law
  also provides that the Insurance Subsidiaries may pay dividends to the
  Company only from its profits as determined by statute.
  
       Effective December 31, 1994, the National Association of Insurance 
  Companies (NAIC) required insurance companies to calculate and report
  information under a risk-based capital formula.  Risk-based capital
  requirements are intended to allow insurance regulators to identify
  inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the type and
  mixture of risks inherent in the company s operations.  The formula
  includes components for asset risk, liability risk, and other factors.  
  As of December 31, 1995, the Insurance Subsidiaries are above required
  capital levels.
  
       Under the Pennsylvania Insurance Company Law, without the prior
  approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, subject to certain
  exceptions, no person (other than the Company) may: (i) make a tender 
  offer for or a request or invitation for tenders of, or enter into any
  agreement to exchange securities or seek to acquire or acquire in the open
  market or otherwise, any voting security of the Company if, after the
  consummation thereof, such person would directly or indirectly, or by
  conversion or by exercise of any right to acquire, be in control of the
  Company, or (ii) enter into an agreement to merge with or otherwise to
  acquire control of the Company.   Control  is defined as the possession,
  direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
  management and policies of a person, whether through 
  
  10
  the ownership of voting securities, by contract (other than a commercial
  contract for goods or non-management services) or otherwise, unless the 
  power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held
  by the person.  Control is presumed to exist if any person, directly or
  indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote or holds proxies
  representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the Company.  Such
  presumption may be rebutted upon a showing that control does not exist. 
  The term  voting security  includes any security convertible into or
  evidencing a right to acquire a voting security.  As a condition to
  approval, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department may require that such
  offer remain open a specified minimum length of time, permit certain
  withdrawals of shares deposited in connection with such offer and require
  pro rata acceptance of any shares deposited pursuant to the offer.
  
  Employees
  
       As of December 31, 1995 the Company had approximately 110 employees. 
  None of the employees of the Company is covered by a collective bargaining
  contract.  The Company believes that its employee relations are excellent.

       The Company s headquarters are located in a 25,000 square foot

  ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
  
       The Company currently is a party to certain lawsuits arising in the
  ordinary course of its business.  The Company believes that none of its

  effect on its business or financial condition.

  The Board of Directors and Shareholders
  Walshire Assurance Company:
  
  Under date of February 29, 1996, we reported on the consolidated balance
  sheets of Walshire Assurance Company and subsidiaries as of December 31,
  1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income,
  shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-
  year period ended December 31, 1995, as contained in the 1995 annual
  report to shareholders.  These consolidated financial statements and our
  report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual report on Form
  10-K for the year 1995.  In connection with our audits of the
  aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
  related financial statements schedules as listed at Item 14B.  These
  financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company s
  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
  financial statements schedules based on our audits.
  
  In our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
  relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
  present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
  therein.

  Management
  Report
  The Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy
  of the financial
  information contained in this annual report. Management believes that
  the financial
  statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles
  appropriate in the circumstances and that the other information in this 
  annual report is
  consistent with those statements. In preparing the financial statements,
  management makes
  informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected
  effects of
  pending events and transactions.
  
  The Company maintains a system of internal controls which provides
  reasonable
  assurance that assets are safeguarded and that financial records reflect
  the transactions of the
  Company. Management conducts periodic reviews of this system to assure
  the adequacy of
  the controls in place.
  
  The Company's independent auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, were engaged 
  to
  perform an audit of the consolidated financial statements. Their audit
  provides an objective
  outside review of management's responsibilities to report operating
  results and financial
  condition.
  
  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is comprised of directors 
  who are
  neither officers nor employees of the Company. The Committee meets
  periodically with
  management and the independent auditors to review the adequacy of the
  internal controls
  and financial reporting. The independent auditors have unrestricted
  access to the Committee
  with and without the presence of management.

  Auditors'
  Report
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders
  Walshire Assurance Company:
  
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walshire
  Assurance
  Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
  related consolidated
  statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of
  the years in the
  three-year period ended December 31, 1995. These consolidated financial 
  statements are the
  responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
  express an opinion on
  these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
  
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
  standards.
  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance
  about whether the financial statements are free of material
  misstatement. An audit includes
  examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
  disclosures in the financial
  statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
  used and significant
  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
  financial statement
  presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for 
  our opinion.
  
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
  present fairly, in
  all material respects, the financial position of Walshire Assurance
  Company and subsidiaries
  at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and
  their cash flows for
  each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in
  conformity with
  generally accepted accounting principles.

  Walshire Assurance Company and Subsidiaries
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
  December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
  (1)Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  (a)Organization and Business
  
  The Company was organized as a regional insurance holding company and
  operates in 20 eastern and southern states.
  Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, it provides products primarily to
  the trucking industry in three insurance-related areas: property and
  casualty insurance, Lincoln General Insurance Company (Lincoln) and Comp
  America
  Insurance Company (Comp); insurance premium finance, Agents Budget
  Corporation Consumer Discount Company,
  Inc. (ABCO) and Yorktowne Premium Finance Company (Yorktowne); and
  claims adjustment services, King American
  Ltd. (King). The Company's major lines of business in 1995 and their
  percentages of total net earned premiums were
  Automobile Physical Damage (48%), Automobile Liability (40%), Workers'
  Compensation (6%) and Inland Marine
  (6%). Lincoln and Comp are subject to regulation by insurance
  departments in those states in which they operate and
  undergo periodic examination by these departments. Lincoln and Comp are 
  also subject to competition from other
  insurance carriers in their operating areas.
  
  (b)Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
  
  The consolidated financial statements include Walshire Assurance Company
  (Walshire) and its subsidiaries, ABCO,
  Ashford Reinsurance Intermediaries Corporation (Ashford), Comp, King,
  Lincoln, and Yorktowne, collectively referred
  to herein as the ``Company.'' Significant inter-company balances and
  transactions have been eliminated in
  consolidation.
  
  The accounts of Lincoln and Comp have been included in the accompanying 
  consolidated financial statements on
  the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which
  differ in some respects from the statutory
  accounting practices employed by Lincoln and Comp in the preparation of 
  their financial reports to the Insurance
  Department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. See note 11.
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is
  required to make estimates and assumptions
  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the
  date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses
  for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those
  estimates.
  
  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant
  change in the near term relate to the
  determination of the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim settlement 
  expenses. While management uses available
  information to provide for such liabilities, future additions to these
  liabilities may be necessary based on changes in
  trends in claim frequency and severity. In addition, various insurance
  departments, as an integral part of their examination process,
  periodically review
  the Company's liabilities for unpaid claims and claim settlement
  expenses. Such departments may require the
  Company to recognize additions to the liabilities based on their
  judgments about information available to them at the
  time of their examination. Management believes that such liabilities are
  adequate.
  
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial
  statements to correspond to the current year
  presentation.
  
   (c)Investments
  Fixed maturities, which include bonds and redeemable preferred stocks,
  are purchased to support the investment
  strategies of the Company, which are developed based on many factors
  including rate of return, maturity, credit risk,
  tax considerations and regulatory requirements. Equity securities
  include common stocks and non-redeemable
  preferred stocks.
  
  In 1994, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
  Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain
  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,'' (SFAS 115). SFAS 115
  addresses the accounting and reporting for
  investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair
  values (other than those accounted for under the
  equity method or as investments in consolidated subsidairies) and all
  investments in debt securities. SFAS 115
  provides that a company use its current intent at the time of adoption
  in classifying investments.
  
  These investments are classified into three categories as follows:
  
  Held-to-Maturity Securities -- Debt securities that the company has the 
  positive intent and ability to hold to maturity; reported at amortized
  cost.
  
  Trading Securities -- Debt and equity securities that are bought and
  held principally for the purpose of selling them
  in the near term; reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
  losses included in earnings.
  
  Available-for-Sale Securities -- Debt and equity securities not
  classified as either held-to-maturity securities or
  trading securities; reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
  losses excluded from earnings and reported as a
  separate component of shareholders' equity (net of tax effects).
  
  
  Short term investments, which have an original maturity of one year or
  less, are carried at amortized cost which
  approximates fair value.
  
  Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on
  the basis of the cost of the specific
  investments sold and are credited or charged to income. Unrealized gains
  or losses on investments available for sale,
  net of applicable deferred income tax, are excluded from income and
  credited or charged directly to a separate
  component of shareholders' equity.
  
  (d)Deferred Acquisition Costs
  
  Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions, premium taxes, and certain
  underwriting expenses related to the
  production of property and casualty business, are deferred to the extent
  recoverable and are amortized ratably over
  the period in which the related premiums are earned. Anticipated claims 
  and claim settlement expenses, expenses for
  maintenance of policies in force and anticipated investment income are
  considered in the determination of the
  recoverability of deferred acquisition costs.
  
  (e)Property and Equipment
  Property and equipment are included in the financial statements at cost.
  Depreciation of property has been provided
  by the straight-line method with an estimated useful life of 20 to 40
  years. Depreciation of equipment has been
  provided by the straight-line method with estimated useful lives of
  three to ten years.
  
  (f)Unpaid Claims and Claim Settlement Expenses
  
  Unpaid claims and claim settlement expenses are based on individual case
  estimates for reported claims and estimates,
  based on experience and industry averages, for unreported claims and
  claim settlement expenses. The provision for
  unpaid claims and claim settlement expenses, net of estimated salvage
  recoverable, has been established to cover the
  estimated net cost of insured claims. The amounts are necessarily based 
  on estimates and while they are believed to
  be adequate, the ultimate liability may exceed such estimates. Any
  change in such estimates will be recorded in the
  year the change occurs.
  
  The provision for unpaid claims and claim settlement expenses for surety
  business have been established using
  management's best estimates of the cost of claims. The Company also
  holds funds as collateral which can be used to
  offset claims should a default occur. Because the Company has no
  interest in these funds unless a default occurs,
  these amounts have not been reflected in the financial statements.
  
  The Company has no material exposures to environmental risks.
  
  (g)Fair Values of Financial Instruments
  Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
  ``Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
  Instruments'' (SFAS 107), the Company has used the following methods and
  assumptions in estimating its fair value
  disclosures:
  
  Investments and Cash -- Fair values for fixed maturity securities are
  based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices
  are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of
  comparable instruments or values obtained from independent pricing
  services through a bank trustee. The fair values
  for equity securities are based on quoted market prices. The carrying
  amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash,
  short-term and other investments approximate their fair values.
  
  Notes Payable -- The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for
  these instruments approximate their fair
  values.
  
  (h)Premium Revenue
  
  Premium revenue is recognized as earned on the semi-monthly pro-rata
  basis over the terms of the policies.
  
  (i)einsurance
  In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the loss
  that may arise from catastrophes or other
  events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain
  levels of risk in various areas of exposure
  with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers.
  
  Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
  with the claim liability associated with
  the reinsured policy. The Company reports reinsurance receivables
  (including amounts related to claims incurred but
  not yet reported) and prepaid reinsurance premiums as assets.
  
  (j)Income Taxes
  The Company follows the asset and liability method of SFAS 109,
  ``Accounting for Income Taxes,'' under which
  deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences
  attributable to differences between the financial
  statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their 
  respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
  liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
  taxable income in the years in which those
  temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
  SFAS 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a
  change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes 
  the enactment date.
  
  
  (k)Net Income Per Share
  Net income per share is computed after recognition of preferred stock
  dividend requirements and is based on the
  weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock
  equivalents outstanding. Fully diluted net
  income per share is computed after recognition of preferred stock
  dividend requirements and is based on the
  weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock
  equivalents outstanding for the period and
  assume conversion of the 10%p convertible subordinated debentures into
  common stock. The computation assumes
  the addition to income of the after-tax interest expense applicable to
  such bonds.
  
  (l)Fiduciary Funds
  In its capacity as a reinsurance intermediary, the Company collects
  premiums from reinsured companies and, after
  deducting its commission, remits the premiums to the respective
  reinsuring companies; the Company also collects
  claims or refunds from the reinsuring companies. Until remittance, these
  funds are held in a fiduciary capacity.
  
  Net uncollected premiums due from reinsured companies and payable to
  reinsuring companies amounting to
  $1,719,000 as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, are not included in the
  accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
  
  (2)einsurance
  Lincoln assumes reinsurance from and cedes insurance to other insurers
  and reinsurers under various contracts which
  cover individual risks or entire classes of business. These reinsurance 
  arrangements provide greater diversification of
  business and minimize Lincoln's losses arising from large risks or from 
  hazards of an unusual nature. The ceding of
  insurance does not discharge the original insurer from its primary
  liability to its policyholders.
  
  Lincoln has catastrophic and excess per risk reinsurance contracts for
  which it pays premiums based upon its
  gross earned premiums derived from covered business. The reinsured
  amounts included in developing the liability for
  claims and claim settlement expenses were $7,004,000 and $5,291,000 at
  December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
  
  At December 31, 1995, reinsurance receivables with a carrying value of
  $5,130,000 were associated with a single
  reinsurer.
  
  The effect of reinsurance on premiums written is as follows:

  Years Ended December 31,
  1995 1994 1993
  Direct $52,020$40,104$31,504

  Net premiums earned $36,191$28,848$22,511
  
  (3)elated Party Transactions
  Lincoln pays agency commissions for business placed with it to five
  corporations with which directors of Walshire are
  affiliated.
  
  For these related parties, the following is a summary of their
  transactions and balances after deducting the
  reinsurance portion, where applicable.

  (4)Major Agencies
  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, one of the Company's agents with which a
  director of Walshire is affiliated, accounted
  for 23%, 24% and 30%, respectively, of the total premiums written.
  Agents' balances and installment premiums
  receivable from this agency were $3,116,000 and $1,587,000 as of
  December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. See
  Note 3. Another agent accounted for 6% of the total premiums written
  during 1995, while three agents accounted for
  21% of the total premiums written during 1994 and one agent accounted
  for 6% of the total premiums written
  during 1993. Agents' balances and installment premiums receivable from
  these agents were $321,000 and $3,479,000
  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
  
  (5)Investments

  Deferred income taxes ( 715)833(191)
  Increase (decrease) in net unrealized gains of
  investments available for sale $1,600$(1,655)$ 385
  
  Gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities were $1,260,000
  and $729,000 respectively, as of December
  31, 1995.
  
  During December 1995, as permitted by the Financial Accounting Standards
  Board one-time ``window'', the
  Company transferred $4,131,000 of investments from its held to maturity 
  portfolio to its available for sale portfolio.
  The fair value of such investments was $4,208,000. The transfer of
  securities was made to provide the Company with
  increased flexibility in managing its liquidity position.

  (7)Federal Income Taxes
  Walshire and its wholly-owned subsidiaries file a consolidated tax
  return and are taxed essentially the same as other
  corporations. The provision for income taxes is comprised of the
  following components:

  $1,400  $1,095  $ 799 
  
  In accordance with SFAS 109, the tax effects of temporary differences
  that give rise to significant portions of the
  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:
  
  (in thousands)
  December 31,
  1995 1994
  Deferred tax assets:
  Unearned premiums . $1,838 $1,404
  Unrealized loss on investments available for sale . -- 534
  Unpaid claims and claim settlement expenses . 613 425
  Allowance for doubtful accounts . 57 50
  $2,508 $2,413
  
  Deferred tax liabilities:
  Deferred acquisition costs . $1,643 $1,289
  Unrealized gain on investments available for sale . 181 --
  Other . 15 79
  $1,839 $1,368
  
  Management has determined that it is not required to establish a
  valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset
  since it is likely that the deferred tax asset will be realized through 
  carrybacks, future reversals of existing temporary
  differences, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The net 
  deferred tax asset is a component of other
  liabilities in 1995 and other assets in 1994.
  
  In 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company made cash payments of $1,748,000,
  $938,000 and $1,005,000
  respectively, for income taxes.
  
  (8) Unpaid Claims, Claims Settlement Expenses and Claims Drafts
  Activity in the unpaid claims, claims settlement expenses and claims
  drafts is summarized as follows:

  (9) Bonds and Notes Payable
  Bonds and notes payable consisted of the following:
  
  (in thousands)
  December 31,
  1995 1994
  Note payable (prime interest rate), monthly payments of $40
  plus interest, due December, 1999 . $1,961  $2,401 
  Line of credit (prime interest rate), due July, 1995 . -- 2,955 
  Line of credit (prime interest rate), due on demand . 1,770  --
  3,731  5,356 
  Current portion . ( 2,250) ( 3,435)
  Long-term notes payable . $1,481  $1,921 
  
  The estimated fair value of notes payable approximates the carrying
  value based on the Company's current ability
  to obtain loans at similar rates of interest.
  
  In 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company made cash payments of $298,000,
  $246,000 and $451,000 respectively,
  for interest expense.
  
  Walshire and its subsidiaries have a combined line of credit of
  $5,000,000 at December 31, 1995, $3,230,000 of
  which is available. The line of credit requires Walshire to maintain a
  net worth in excess of $40,000,000 and is
  subject to reaffirmation in November, 1996.
  
  (10) 401(k) Plan
  Walshire and its subsidiaries contribute to a qualified 401(k) Plan. All
  full time employees who meet certain eligibility
  requirements may elect to participate in the Plan. Participants can
  contribute no more than 20% of their base
  compensation. The Company matches 100% of employee contributions, not to
  exceed 5% of an employee's annual
  compensation. The Company expense for 401(k) Plan benefits were
  $109,000, $73,000 and $62,000 in 1995, 1994
  and 1993, respectively.
  
  The Company currently does not provide any post-retirement or post-
  employment benefits.
  
  (11) Shareholders' Equity
  Lincoln and Comp are restricted by law as to the amount of dividends
  they may pay to Walshire without the prior
  approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. These authorities only
  recognize statutory accounting practices for
  determining the ability of an insurer to pay dividends to its
  shareholders. At December 31, 1995, $2,863,000 and
  $375,000 was available for the payment of dividends from Lincoln and
  Comp, respectively, to Walshire without the
  prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities.
  
  Dividends paid by Lincoln to Walshire for the years ended December 31,
  1995 and 1993 were $700,000 and
  $900,000, respectively. No dividends were paid by Lincoln to Walshire in
  1994. Comp has paid no dividends. In
  addition, Walshire declared 10% and 5% stock dividends in 1995 and 1994,
  respectively.
  
  In March of 1994, 141,700 shares of 61/2% Convertible Preferred Stock
  were issued at $50 per share. The
  Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, unless previously redeemed, 
  into shares of the Common Stock of Walshire
  Assurance Company at a conversion price of $12.12 per share, subject to 
  adjustment under certain circumstances.
  During 1995, 4,000 shares were converted into 16,500 shares of common
  stock.
  
  A reconciliation of the insurance subsidiaries statutory net income to
  consolidated GAAP net income is as follows:

  Effective December 31, 1994, the National Association of Insurance
  Companies (NAIC) required insurance
  companies to calculate and report information under a <dhrisk-based
  capital formula. Risk-based capital requirements are
  intended to allow insurance regulators to identify inadequately
  capitalized insurance companies based upon the type
  and mixture of risks inherent in the company's operations. The formula
  includes components for asset risk, liability
  risk, and other factors. As of December 31, 1995 Lincoln and Comp are
  above required capital levels.
  
  (12) Stock Plans
  (a) Employee Stock Purchase Plan
   On June 22, 1987, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders 
  approved, the 1987 Employee Stock
  Purchase Plan (``Stock Purchase Plan''), which is intended to qualify
  under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code
  of 1986, as amended. The Stock Purchase Plan is administered by the
  Compensation Committee, which is authorized
  to grant options to purchase up to 133,402 shares of Common Stock to
  employees of Walshire and any current or
  future parent or subsidiary of Walshire. The Committee has discretion to
  determine the total number of options, if
  any, granted in each year, the rate of exercisability, the price at
  which each option is exercisable and the duration of
  each option.
  
  All options granted under the Stock Purchase Plan will expire five years
  after the date of grant; provided,
  however, that options exercised more than 27 months after the date of
  grant must be exercised at an option price
  equal to at least 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the date
  of exercise. No option may be granted to any
  person who immediately after the grant would own more than 5% of Common 
  Stock and no option may be granted
  which, at the date the option is granted, would permit such person's
  rights to purchase stock under the Stock
  Purchase Plan and all other employee stock purchase plans of Walshire to
  accrue at a rate exceeding $25,000 of the
  fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such option is
  granted) for each year such option is
  outstanding. The option price per share must not be less than the lesser
  of: (a) 85% of the fair market value of the
  stock on the date of grant, or (b) 85% of the fair market value on the
  date of exercise.
  
  Changes in outstanding Common Stock options granted under the 1987
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan are

  (b) 1987 Stock Option Plan
   On June 22, 1987, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders 
  approved, the 1987 Stock Option Plan
  (``1987 Plan''). All officers and key employees of Walshire or any
  current or future parent or subsidiary of Walshire
  are eligible to receive options under the 1987 Plan. The 1987 Plan is
  administered by the Compensation Committee
  which selects the optionees, determines the number of shares subject to 
  each option and prescribes other terms and
  conditions of each option.
  
  Pursuant to the 1987 Plan, options may be granted with respect to an
  aggregate of 606,375 shares of Common
  Stock. Options may be granted as incentive stock options intended to
  qualify under Section 422A of the Internal
  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or as options not intended to so
  qualify. In addition, stock appreciation rights
  may be granted in tandem with non-qualified stock options. In the case
  of incentive stock options, the option price
  must be equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of Walshire's
  Common Stock on the date of grant. The
  exercise price of incentive stock options granted to shareholders
  possessing more than 10% of the total combined
  
  
  voting power of all classes of stock of Walshire must not be less than
  110% of the fair market value on the date of
  grant. In the case of stock options not intended to qualify as incentive
  stock options, the option price must be equal
  to at least 85% of the fair market value of Walshire's Common Stock on
  the date of grant. Payment of the option
  exercise price may be made in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
  combination of cash and Common Stock.
  
  Changes in outstanding Common Stock options granted under the 1987 Stock
  Option Plan are summarized
  below.

  and 314,329 shares, respectively, were
  exercisable.
  
  (c) 1990 Stock Option Plan
   On February 7, 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and on May 8,
  1990, the shareholders approved, the 1990
  Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (``1990 Plan''). Options to
  purchase up to 236,775 shares of Common
  Stock may be granted to Non-Employee Directors of Walshire.
  
  Pursuant to the 1990 Plan, each person who is not an employee of the
  Company or any of the Company's
  subsidiaries on the date of grant of an option under the 1990 Plan and
  who on or after January 1, 1990, is (1) elected
  or reelected as a director of the Company at any annual or special
  meeting of shareholders of the Company, or (2)
  continues as a director of the Company as of the date of the annual or
  special meeting of shareholders of the
  Company at which directors of the Company are elected or reelected
  shall, as of the date of each such annual or
  special meeting of shareholders, automatically be granted an option to
  purchase shares of the Company's Common
  Stock pursuant to the following schedule:
  
  Years of Service
  as a Director Number of Shares
  Less than 2 years . 2,000
  Between 2 and 5 years . 5,000
  Over 5 years . 10,000
  
   All options granted under the 1990 Plan are exercisable in whole or in 
  part and will expire five years after the
  date of grant. The option price for options issued under the 1990 Plan
  is equal to the fair market value of the
  Company's Common Stock on the date of the grant of the option. Payment
  of the option exercise price may be made
  in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common
  Stock.

  (d) Other Stock Options
   On October 6, 1988, the Board of Directors granted options to purchase 
  52,693 shares at $5.44 per share to four
  directors. Such options were exercisable in whole or in part beginning
  October 6, 1989. All previous options issued
  under the Plan were cancelled concurrently. During 1993, options to
  purchase 28,680 shares were exercised at $5.44
  per share. As of December 31, 1995, no options remain outstanding.
  
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, ``Accounting for
  Stock-Based Compensation'' (SFAS 123) was
  issued by the FASB in October of 1995 and will be effective for the
  Company in 1996. Upon adoption of SFAS 123, the
  Company will continue to measure compensation expense for its stock-
  based employee compensation plans using the
  intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, ``Accounting
  for Stock Issued to Employees'' and will provide
  pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the
  fair value-based method prescribed by SFAS 123 had
  been applied in measuring compensation expense. The adoption of SFAS 123
  will not have any effect on the Company's
  financial position or results of operation.

   As of February 29, 1996, there were approximately 1,250 shareholders of
  record and
  beneficial shareholders of the Company's Common Stock. The last sale
  price on February
  29, 1996, as reported on the NASDAQ National Market System, was $17.125 
  per share.
  
  The above amounts for stock prices and cash dividends have been
  adjusted, where
  necessary, to reflect the ten percent and five percent stock dividend
  granted to shareholders
  of record on December 6, 1995 and November 30, 1994, respectively.
  
  While the Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly
  dividends, any
  such payments will depend upon the financial condition, capital
  requirements and earnings
  of the Company, as well as such other factors as the Board of Directors 
  may deem relevant.
  
  One of the Company's sources of cash with which to pay dividends would
  be
  dividends received from Lincoln and Comp. Lincoln and Comp are subject
  to state laws
  which restrict the amount of dividends that they may pay. See Note 11 of
  the Notes to
  Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
  Condition and Results of Operations
  Business Operations
  The profitability of property and casualty insurers is affected by many 
  factors, including competition, the severity
  and frequency of claims, natural disasters, state regulation of premium 
  rates, interest rates, crime rates, general
  business conditions and regulations, and court decisions that define the
  extent of coverage. One of the
  distinguishing features of the property and casualty insurance business 
  is that its product must be priced before the
  costs are known, because premium rates generally are set before losses
  are reported. As a result, property and
  casualty insurers have experienced significant year-to-year fluctuations
  in underwriting results.
  
  The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and
  results of operations of the Company
  should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial 
  statements, including the notes thereto,
  and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report.
  
  Results of Operations
  1995 vs. 1994
  RevenuesRevenues increased from $32.6 million to $39.9 million, or 22%, 
  in 1995, primarily the result of an
  increase in net premiums earned. This increase in net premiums earned
  was a direct result of the increases in all
  major lines of business written by the Company. The increase in business
  written reflects the increase in the
  number of policies issued by the Company.
  
  ExpensesExpenses increased from $27.7 million to $33.0 million, or 19%, 
  in 1995. This increase was primarily
  the result of increased claims and claim settlement expenses and
  underwriting, general and administrative expenses.
  The increase in claims and claim settlement expenses was the result of
  an increase in premiums earned, as the
  statutory loss ratio for both years was 59%. Reinsurance recoveries
  increased to $2.7 million in 1995 from $1.8
  million in 1994. This increase was the result of a greater dollar value 
  of losses incurred that were recoverable from
  reinsurers in 1995 than were recoverable in 1994. The increase in
  underwriting, general and administrative
  expenses was primarily the result of increases in premiums written.
  Policy acquisition costs increased at a lesser
  rate than the increase in premiums earned due to an increase in ceding
  commission income in 1995. The decrease
  in the effective tax rate from 22.4% in 1994 to 20.3% in 1995 was the
  result of a reduction in prior year tax
  provisions and a greater amount of tax exempt interest.
  
  1994 vs. 1993
  RevenuesRevenues increased from $25.9 million to $32.6 million, or 26%, 
  in 1994, primarily the result of an
  increase in net premiums earned. The increase in net premiums earned was
  the direct result of increases in all lines
  of business written by the Company. The increase in business written
  reflects the increase in the number of
  policies issued by the Company.
  
  ExpensesExpenses increased from $22.6 million to $27.7 million, or 23%, 
  in 1994. This increase was primarily
  the result of increased claims and claim settlement expenses and
  amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The
  increase in claims and claim settlement expenses was the result of an
  increase in premiums earned as well as an
  increase in the statutory loss ratio from 55% to 59%. The increase in
  premiums earned resulted in a pro-rata
  increase in claims and claim settlement expenses. The increase in the
  loss ratio reflects the higher percentage of
  casualty business written by the Company, a higher loss ratio on
  property coverages, primarily due to the severe
  weather conditions in early 1994, and an increase in claims settlement
  expenses relating to those coverages. The
  increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was the
  result of increases in net premiums earned. The
  decrease in the effective tax rate from 23.8% in 1993 to 22.4% in 1994
  was the result of a greater amount of tax
  exempt interest.
  
  Selected Ratios
  In 1995, the Company's statutory loss ratio was 59%, the same as 1994,
  while the Company's statutory combined
  ratio decreased to 87% from 89% in 1994. In 1994, the Company's
  statutory loss ratio increased to 59% from
  55% in 1993 and the Company's statutory combined ratio decreased to 89% 
  from 90% in 1993. The increase in
  the loss ratio in 1994 was the result of a higher percentage of casualty
  premiums earned as well as a higher loss
  ratio on physical damage coverages. The decrease in the combined ratio
  in 1995 and 1994 was the result of a
  reduction of underwriting and administrative expenses when compared to
  net premiums written.
  
  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  Historically, the Company has generated funds sufficient to support its 
  operations and has maintained a high degree
  of liquidity in its investment portfolio. The primary source of funds to
  meet the demands of claims and claim
  settlement expenses and operating expenses are written premium and
  investment income. The Company's funds
  generally are invested in securities with maturities intended to provide
  adequate funds to pay claims, claim
  settlement expenses and operating expenses without the forced sale of
  investments. As of December 31, 1995, less
  than 4% of the debt securities in the Company's investment portfolio
  were considered below investment grade,
  primarily because such securities were not rated.
  
  As of December 31, 1995, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had cash 
  and short-term investments
  aggregating approximately $5.3 million and a line of credit of $5.0
  million, $3.2 million of which was available. On
  a parent company only basis, available cash and short-term investments
  aggregated approximately $413,000.
  
  The Company's insurance subsidiaries, Lincoln and Comp, are subject to
  state insurance regulatory laws which
  restrict their ability to pay dividends. They are also subject to risk-
  based capital requirements which may further
  restrict their ability to pay dividends. See Note 11 of Notes to
  Consolidated Financial Statements.
  
  The Company believes that its current cash and short-term investments,
  together with funds generated from
  operations and existing loan commitments, will be sufficient to meet its
  operating and capital requirements for the
  foreseeable future.
  
  Impact of Inflation
  Property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the
  amount of claims and claim settlement
  expenses, or the extent to which inflation may impact such expenses, is 
  known. Consequently, in establishing
  premium rates, the Company attempts to anticipate the potential impact
  of inflation. Generally, the longer the
  period of time required to settle claims, the greater the impact of
  inflation on final settlement costs. In recent
  years, inflation has contributed to increased operating expenses and
  claims. Historically, the majority of all of the
  insurance written by the Company was on property risks, the losses on
  which tend to be reported quickly and
  settled within a relatively short period of time. As a result, the
  effect of inflation on loss development was not
  significant. However, as the Company writes more casualty business, the 
  losses on which tend to be settled over a
  longer period of time, inflation may have more of an impact on loss
  development.
  
  Other
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, ``Accounting for
  the Impairment of Long-Living Assets and
  for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of'' (SFAS 121) was issued by the
  FASB in March of 1995. SFAS 121 provides
  guidance for recognition and measurement of impairment of long-lived
  assets, certain identifiable intangibles and
  goodwill related both to assets to be held and used and assets to be
  disposed of. SFAS 121 will be effective for the
  Company in 1996. Management does not expect that the adoption of SFAS
  121 will have a material impact on its
  financial condition or results of operations.
  
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, ``Accounting for
  Stock-Based Compensation'' (SFAS 123)
  was issued by the FASB in October of 1995 and will be effective for the 
  Company in 1996. Upon adoption of
  SFAS 123, the Company will continue to measure compensation expense for 
  its stock-based employee
  compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB
  Opinion No. 25, ``Accounting for Stock
  Issued to Employees'' and will provide pro forma disclosures of net
  income and earnings per share as if the fair
  value-based method prescribed by SFAS 123 had been applied in measuring 
  compensation expense. The adoption
  of SFAS 123 will not have any effect on the Company's financial position
  or results of operations.
