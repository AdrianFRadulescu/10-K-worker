BUSINESS UNITS
 
     The Company operates exclusively in the commercial finance segment of the
financial services industry. The Company serves its commercial customers though
six business units, each of which is described in detail below.
 
  Business Equipment Financing
 
     Through its Business Equipment Financing unit, the Company finances, under
finance leases, conditional sale agreements, operating leases, and
collateralized loans, the acquisition and use of equipment for business,
professional, industrial, and governmental users throughout the United States.
The types of equipment financed include data processing equipment, office
equipment, office furnishings, telecommunications, transportation,
manufacturing, and other kinds of equipment. This financing is sometimes offered
in conjunction with the manufacturer of the equipment, but in other cases is
provided directly to the end user of the equipment. Financing transactions
generally cover equipment having an aggregate cost between $250,000 and $10
million, with an average transaction size of approximately $900,000. These
financing services are marketed through 29 offices located throughout the United
States.
 
     The Business Equipment Financing unit does not manufacture or sell under
its own label any of the equipment which it leases. It only purchases equipment
which a particular lessee has committed to lease, and does not take order
positions or make purchases in advance of such a binding agreement by a lessee
to lease the equipment. All lessees are obligated to maintain the equipment and
reimburse the Company for any taxes paid thereon. Any casualty losses of
equipment are covered either by insurance carried by the lessee as required
under the lease or by lessee self-insurance when the Company deems the lessee's
credit to be satisfactory. Upon the expiration of leases, the Company either
renews the leases with the lessees, sells the leased equipment to the lessees,
or remarkets the equipment.
 
     The Company also acquires from manufacturers pools of leases and their
underlying equipment. The manufacturers may retain an economic interest in the
successful operation of each pool and, in exchange, the manufacturers maintain
the equipment, remarket it after the expiration of the initial term of the
leases, and manage the relationship with the lessees. In other transactions, the
lessee is obligated to maintain the
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   5
 
equipment and the Company manages the relationship with the lessees, bills and
collects, and remarkets the equipment.
 
     The Company also acquires equipment and related leases originated by other
lessors and, to a lesser extent, by brokers, although the purchase of
broker-originated business has declined significantly over the past few years.
On the majority of such acquired transactions, the Company bills and collects,
manages the relationships with the lessees, and remarkets the equipment.
 
     The following table sets forth certain data with respect to the Business
Equipment Financing unit for the years ended on, and as of, the dates indicated.

  Transportation and Industrial Financing
 
     Through its Transportation and Industrial Financing unit, the Company
principally owns, leases, finances, and remarkets commercial aircraft, and
leases and finances transportation, energy, and industrial equipment and
facilities. Aircraft, other equipment, and facilities are leased and financed
under single-investor finance leases, leveraged leases, operating leases,
collateralized loans, and various partnership structures. Under all leases the
lessee is responsible for all taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The majority of
the assets of this business is acquired through investment bankers and advisors
who have been hired by lessees, and the balance through direct lessee contact.
 
     The Company owns a 23% interest in, and through a wholly-owned subsidiary
is the general partner of, Airlease Ltd., a California limited partnership
("Airlease Ltd."). Airlease Ltd. assets were $103 million at December 31, 1995,
compared with $108 million at December 31, 1994. The limited partnership units
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Airlease Ltd. engages in the
ownership and leasing of commercial aircraft to airlines, a freight carrier, and
a charter carrier.
 
     At December 31, 1995, the Company's aggregate commercial aircraft earning
assets in the T&I unit (including its interest in those aircraft owned by
Airlease Ltd.) were $1,135 million. Of this amount, 64% were leased to or
financed for commercial airlines, with the remainder leased primarily to a
freight carrier and aircraft manufacturers. Approximately 99% of the aggregate
commercial aircraft owned or financed by the Company (measured by their book
value) were in compliance with Stage III noise regulations (the most stringent
level) of the Aviation Safety and Capacity Act of 1990.
 
     This business unit also manages a portfolio of leveraged leases,
single-investor leases, and loans in which Ford Credit holds a beneficial
interest. These managed leases cover commercial aircraft, railcars and
locomotives, electric power generation and other facilities, marine vessels, and
other types of business assets. The business unit also acts as agent for Trust
Company for USL, Inc. ("Trust Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. Trust Company is owner trustee for a portfolio of leveraged leases the
Company arranged for outside institutional investors prior to 1985. As the
remarketing agent for these institutional investors, the Company participates in
the residual proceeds from the disposition of the equipment at the termination
of some of these leases. Trust Company is also an owner trustee for certain
aircraft leases in which Airlease Ltd. holds a beneficial interest.

  Fleet Services
 
     Through its Fleet Services unit, the Company is engaged in the leasing of
automotive, van, and light and heavy-duty truck fleets for commercial purposes.
Fleet Services also provides management services for a substantial portion of
its leased vehicles and for certain of the vehicles owned by its customers.
These leasing and management services are marketed to commercial customers
through 34 offices located throughout the United States. Fleet Services also
provides fleet management services for subsidiaries and affiliates of American
Telephone and Telegraph Company under a service agreement.
 
     At December 31, 1995, Fleet Services had an aggregate of approximately
79,700 vehicles in fleets which it leased and managed or managed only, as
compared with approximately 76,100 vehicles at December 31, 1994. At December
31, 1995, Fleet Services also provided services for approximately 16,400
additional vehicles under the service agreement with American Telephone and
Telegraph Company, as compared with approximately 14,800 additional vehicles at
December 31, 1994.
 
     Certain of Fleet Services' vehicles are leased under "open-end finance"
leases in which the Company bears no risk (other than the lessee's credit) on
the resale price of the vehicles at the expiration of the lease. The majority of
the vehicles are leased under "modified open-end" leases in which the resale
price of the leased vehicle at lease expiration is partially guaranteed by the
lessee. The Company's full recovery of the vehicle's cost under a "modified
open-end" lease thus partially depends on the resale proceeds which, however,
are expected to substantially exceed the portion of the cost not guaranteed by
the lessee for which the Company is at risk. Other vehicles are leased under
"closed-end" leases, in which the Company's full recovery of the vehicle's cost
from rental and resale proceeds is dependent upon the Company's realization of
anticipated residual value. Additionally, certain of the closed-end leases
(covering approximately 3% of all leased vehicles at December 31, 1995) contain
maintenance provisions which require that the Company bear the maintenance
expense for the leased vehicle in consideration of a higher lease rate.

* Assets were securitized through 1995, the balance of which was approximately
  $47 million at December 31, 1995. This amount is not included in total earning
  assets. See Borrowing and Other Sources of Funds on page 12.
 
     Under substantially all leases, the lessee is obligated to provide
insurance against public liability and property damage, to reimburse the Company
for all taxes relating to the vehicles or the lease and, except in leases with a
maintenance provision, to maintain, at the lessee's expense, the vehicles in
good operating condition.
 
     Management services are mechanized and provide monthly analyses of each
vehicle in service, allowing customers' fleet operating costs to be closely
controlled. Programs are tailored to meet special customer needs, and many
options are offered including, for example, guaranteed maintenance programs,
assistance in selection of vehicles, and analysis of insurance coverage.
 
  Municipal and Corporate Financing
 
     Through its Municipal and Corporate Financing unit, the Company arranges
and carries on its books municipal financings of essential-use equipment for
state and local governments. This unit also invests in publicly-traded and
privately-placed preferred stocks, principally of utilities, and senior and
subordinated debt of public and private companies, primarily manufacturing
companies. After due diligence by the Company, these securities are purchased
through investment banks and other intermediaries, either at the initial
offering or on the open market. Approximately 62% of these corporate securities
are currently rated at investment grade.

  Real Estate Financing
 
     Through five regional business development offices in its Real Estate
Financing unit, the Company provides first mortgage financing of
income-producing real estate including apartments, office buildings, shopping
centers, and warehouses. This real estate is geographically diversified
throughout the United States. No financing is provided for motels, hotels, raw
land, or specialty properties. Substantially all transactions are financings of
three to five years, and none is a construction loan. The loans provide funds
for acquisitions or refinancings, or are "bridge" financings between
construction and permanent loans. This unit also manages transactions funded by
and carried on the books of Ford Credit. At December 31, 1995, the Company had
commitments to fund additional first mortgage loans of approximately $16
million. At such date, it also held title to four foreclosed properties with an
aggregate book value of $37 million.

  Rail Services
 
     Through its Rail Services unit, the Company leases to industrial shippers
and railroads approximately 25,900 railcars. Approximately 95% of all of these
cars are owned by the Company or leased to it under long-term leases. Rail
Services manages approximately 1,375 cars for others, principally Ford
affiliates. Of the cars in the Company's fleet at December 31, 1995, 24% were
leased out to the Company's customers for remaining terms of less than one year,
55% for remaining terms of between one and five years, and 21% for remaining
terms of over five years. The Company maintains and repairs approximately 60% of
its owned and leased fleet at its expense. As provided in the rules of the
American Association of Railroads, if a car is damaged or destroyed on the line
of any particular railroad, that railroad is obligated either to repair the car
or, if the car is destroyed, pay the car owner an amount which reflects the
car's type and age. The Rail Services unit also orders new equipment for future
delivery, in advance of leasing such equipment to customers.

FINANCING ARRANGED AND MANAGED FOR FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY
 
     The Company manages certain commercial leasing and financing transactions
carried on the books of Ford Credit. In addition, the Municipal and Corporate
Financing and Transportation and Industrial Financing units arrange a variety of
transactions which are funded by and carried on the books of Ford Credit. Ford
Credit reimburses the Company for the Company's operating costs related to
arranging and managing all transactions funded by Ford Credit.
 
GENERAL
 
  Credit Loss Experience
 
     The management of credit exposure is an important element of the Company's
business. The Company reviews the credit of all prospective customers and
manages concentration exposures by customer, collateral type, and geographic
distribution. It establishes appropriate loss allowances based on the credit
characteristics and the loss experience for each type of business and also
establishes additional reserves for specific transactions if it believes this
action is warranted. Delinquent receivables are reviewed by management monthly
and are generally written down to expected realizable value when, in the opinion
of management, they become uncollectible or when they become more than 180 days
past due. Collection activities continue on accounts written off when management
believes such action is warranted.

</TABLE>
 
     Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts for 1995 decreased by $2
million from 1994 reflecting continued improvement in the Company's portfolio.
 
     Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts for 1994 decreased by $17
million from 1993, primarily as a result of decreased write-offs as well as
management's evaluation of the adequacy of the loss reserve. The decline of
write-offs (deductions) in 1994 of $5 million from 1993, resulted primarily from
improved collection activities in the Business Equipment Financing unit.
 
     Total balances of accounts receivable over 90 days past due at year-end
1995 decreased $14 million over 1994 year end, primarily because of the improved
collections on aged accounts, the restructuring of a $16 million note
collateralized by an aircraft, and the completion of foreclosure on an office
complex, which was collateral for a $9 million note. Both notes were delinquent
at December 31, 1994. These changes were offset in part by delinquencies on a
note in the amount of $10 million collateralized by an office/retail complex in
California, and on a subordinated note in the amount of $10 million. Foreclosure
on the California office complex is expected in the first quarter of 1996.
 
  Residual Policy
 
     The establishment and realization of residual values on finance and
leveraged leases and of salvage values on operating leases are important
elements of the Company's business. In general, finance and leveraged leases are
non-cancelable leases in which the net lease payments over the term amortize the
investment in the leased equipment down to the estimated value of equipment at
lease expiration. Operating leases are usually of a shorter term and the lease
payments by themselves are not sufficient to cover all costs and expenses. Full
recovery of equipment cost is dependent upon selling or re-leasing the
equipment.
 
     Residual values are established upon acquisition of the equipment based
upon the estimated value of the equipment at the time the Company expects to
dispose of the equipment under finance and leveraged leases and at the end of
the equipment's expected useful life under operating leases. Periodically, in
accordance with SFAS 13, the Company reviews its residual values, and if it
determines there has been an other than

lease.

  Competition
 
     In all of its financing programs, the Company competes with other leasing
and finance companies, banks, lease brokers, and investment banking firms who
arrange for the financing and leasing of equipment, and manufacturers and
vendors who sell, finance and, lease their own products to customers.
 
  Borrowing and Other Sources of Funds
 
     The funds required to operate the Company's business are generated
internally from loan and lease payments and equipment sales, and externally from
medium-term debt, commercial paper, securitization, and bank borrowings.
 
     The Company raises short-term debt financing through its established
commercial paper program and raises long-term debt in the public market through
periodic offerings of medium-term notes and underwritten debt offerings. The
Company has committed bank lines of $1.7 billion with 28 banks, consisting of
$1,235 million under five-year credit agreements expiring in 2000 and $465
million under one-year agreements. There were no borrowings outstanding on these
bank lines at December 31, 1995. Neither Ford nor Ford Holdings guarantees the
debt of the Company, although the Company's existing credit lines require that
Ford maintain at least a 75% direct or indirect ownership interest in the
Company. As noted in the discussion below in Item 7 concerning Recent
Developments, Ford is considering the sale of all or part of the Company. At
present, the Company's profitability is not significantly related to the
business outlook for Ford, and this situation is not expected to change in the
future.
 
     In 1991 the Company securitized and sold approximately $212 million of its
vehicle leases by transferring such leases, without recourse to the Company, to
a wholly-owned subsidiary, which, in turn, sold the leases to an unrelated
cooperative corporation. The assets of the wholly-owned subsidiary are available
first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Beginning in June
1994, the Company discontinued securitizing additional leases under this
arrangement to replace the run-off of principal of the leases initially
securitized. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page
25.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
     The Company owns no significant real property and leases all of its
offices. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 31
for information as to rental obligations.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     There are no pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine
litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company is a party or to
which its property is subject, nor are any such proceedings known to be
contemplated by governmental authorities or others.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED
         STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
 
     All outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are owned by Ford
Holdings, and therefore there is no market for such shares. The Company declared
a $100 million and a $40 million dividend, effective December 31, 1994 and 1995,
respectively, which were distributed to Ford Holdings in January 1995 and 1996.
Ford Holdings made a $40 million capital contribution to the Company in 1993.
The Company and Ford Holdings will, from time to time, determine the appropriate
capitalization for the Company, which will, in part, affect any future payment
of dividends to Ford Holdings or capital contributions to the Company.

</TABLE>
 
  Revenues
 
     Revenues increased $83 million, or 14% in 1995 compared with 1994,
primarily as a result of a 14% increase in average earning assets. The increase
also resulted from a $19 million increase in the gain on asset sales, primarily
in the Business Equipment Finance and the Transportation and Industrial
Financing business units.
 
  Expenses
 
     Sales, administrative, and general expenses increased $3 million, or 5%, in
1995, as a result of a new advertising campaign, higher expenses to support the
growing portfolio of earning assets, and normal inflationary increases.
 
     Interest expense increased $56 million, or 25%, in 1995, reflecting an
increase in average borrowings from $3.57 billion in 1994 to $4.08 billion in
1995 to finance earning assets. In addition, there was an increase in borrowing
rates, which averaged 6.7% in 1995 compared with 6.1% in 1994.
 
     Depreciation expense on operating lease equipment decreased $5 million, or
4%, in 1995, although the average investment in the cost of operating lease
equipment increased 9% or $89 million. The reduction in depreciation expense is
the result of the increasingly larger percentage of the operating lease
portfolio in railcars, which have longer useful lives and depreciate more slowly
than other operating lease equipment. In addition, the useful life of certain
railcars was extended at the end of 1994, which reduced depreciation expense in
1995 approximately $3 million.
 
     Other expenses decreased $7 million, or 24%, in 1995, due in part to a
decrease in the provision for losses (see page 9 for discussion of credit loss
experience). In addition, there was a decrease in operating lease expenses of
approximately $5 million, primarily as a result of reduced maintenance expense
incurred by the Rail Services business unit. Special maintenance costs were
incurred in 1994 for mandated inspections.
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   14
 
  Operating Profit
 
     Operating profit improved $36 million, or 23%, compared with 1994. The
improvement in operating results reflects the impact of higher earning assets
and lower operating costs.
 
  Taxes on Income
 
     Income taxes were 31.0% on income before taxes in 1995 compared with 31.8%
in 1994. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 30 for
the principal reasons for differences from the normal statutory rates.
 
  New Accounting Standards
 
     In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." This standard was partially amended by the
issuance, in October 1994, of SFAS 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan--Income Recognition and Disclosures." These standards require that
impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or at the fair value of
the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral based, or based on the
loan's observable market price. The Company adopted these standards effective
January 1, 1995, and the effect was not material.
 
     In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." This standard
requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held
and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
standard also requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. The Company has adopted the standard effective
January 1, 1996, and the effect is not expected to be material.
 
  Recent Developments
 
     As previously reported by Ford, Ford is investigating and considering the
sale of all or part of the Company.
 
     Effective December 31, 1995, Ford Holdings became an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Ford as a result of a cash-out merger involving Ford Holdings
pursuant to which its outstanding voting preferred stock was cancelled.
Effective January 1, 1996, Ford Holdings and the Company have been included in
Ford's consolidated group for federal income tax purposes.

              MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     Management is responsible for the preparation of the Company's financial
statements and the other financial information in this report. This
responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of the
financial records and the presentation of the Company's financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     The Company maintains an internal control structure designed to provide,
among other things, reasonable assurance that its records include the
transactions of its operations in all material respects and to provide
protection against significant misuse or loss of Company assets. The internal
control structure is supported by careful selection and training of financial
management personnel, by written procedures that communicate the details of the
control structure to the Company's activities, by a staff of internal auditors
of Ford Motor Company who employ thorough auditing programs, and by the
Company's staff of operating control specialists who conduct reviews of
adherence to the Company's procedures and policies.
 
     The Company's financial statements have been audited by Coopers & Lybrand
L.L.P., independent certified public accountants. Their audit was conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which include a review of
the Company's internal control structure to the extent deemed necessary for the
purposes of their audit. The Report of Independent Accountants appears on the
following page.
 
     The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management's
fulfillment of its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements
and the financial control of operations. The Company's independent accountants
have full and free access to the Board to discuss their audit work, the
Company's internal controls, and financial reporting matters.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors,
USL Capital Corporation:
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedules of USL Capital Corporation and subsidiaries listed in Part
IV Item 14(a)1. and 2. of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of USL Capital
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
the information required to be included therein.

                    USL CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include USL Capital
Corporation ("Company") and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments
in partnerships and 50%-or-less owned associated companies are accounted for on
the equity method. All material intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1995
presentation.
 
     Nature of Operations -- The Company provides leasing and financing to
commercial and governmental entities, principally in the United States,
including office and business equipment, large-balance transportation equipment,
industrial and energy facilities, and commercial automobile fleets, as well as
mortgage financing of income-producing real estate, full-service leasing to
industrial shippers and railroads, municipal financing of essential-use
equipment, and investment in publicly traded and privately placed preferred
stocks and senior and subordinated debt of public and private companies. The
Company provides financing in the form of finance leases, operating leases,
leveraged leases, notes receivable, and corporate securities.
 
     Basis of Presentation -- The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
     Cash and Cash Equivalents -- Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase. Outstanding checks ($29,073,000 at December 31, 1995, and $25,859,000
at December 31, 1994) are reclassified to Accounts Payable. For Cash and Cash
Equivalents, the carrying amount is stated at fair value.
 
     Finance Leases -- At lease commencement, the Company records the lease
receivable, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and unearned lease
income. Initial direct costs are deferred as part of the investment and
amortized over the lease term. Unearned lease income is recognized as revenue
over the lease term so as to approximate a level rate of return on the net
investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the
estimated amount to be received at lease termination from the disposition of
leased equipment.
 
     Operating Leases -- Lease contracts that do not meet the criteria of
finance leases are accounted for as operating leases. Rental equipment is
recorded at cost and depreciated over its useful life or lease term to an
estimated salvage or residual value (10 to 30 years for railroad cars and 3 to
10 years for other equipment), primarily on a straight-line basis.
 
     Leveraged Leases -- Leveraged lease assets acquired by the Company are
financed primarily through nonrecourse loans from third-party debt participants.
These loans are collateralized by the lessee's rental obligations and the leased
property. Unearned income is recognized over the lease term at a constant
after-tax rate of return on the net investment in the lease in those periods in
which the net investment is positive. Unguaranteed estimated residual values are
principally based on independent appraisals of the estimated values of the
assets remaining at the expiration of the lease.
 
     Investment in Securities -- The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities" effective January 1, 1994. The cumulative effect of
this change in accounting principle was not material. Investments in securities
consist principally of debt securities (preferred stock, corporate and Municipal
bonds) which are reported as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost,
net of a provision for losses that is sufficient to cover estimated
uncollectibles, because the Company has the ability and intent to hold such
securities until maturity. Securities classified as available-for-sale are
recorded net of the unrealized holding gain/loss which
 
                                       24
<PAGE>   25
 
NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

is excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of Shareholder's
Equity, net of related deferred taxes. Equity securities that are bought and
held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as
trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings. Equity securities which do not have readily determinable
fair values, principally investments in low income housing partnerships, are
recorded at cost. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 115, investments in securities
were recorded at amortized cost because the Company had the ability to hold such
securities until maturity and had this intention. See Notes 6 and 15 for
additional information on the fair value of securities.
 
     Goodwill -- Goodwill is principally from the acquisition by Ford, which is
being amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years (1995, $5,643,000;
1994, $5,643,000; 1993, $5,643,000).
 
     Taxes on Income and Tax Credits -- Since the transfer of ownership of the
Company by Ford to Ford Holdings in 1989, the Company has been included in the
consolidated federal income tax return of Ford Holdings and continues to be
included in the combined state income tax returns of Ford, except in those
states where the Company is required to file separate returns. Income taxes,
including the federal alternative minimum tax, if any, are allocated by Ford
Holdings based on the Company's effect on taxes paid by the group. Effective
January 1, 1996, the Company will be included in the Ford consolidated group for
federal income tax purposes. See Item 7 Recent Developments on page 14. Deferred
income tax liabilities give effect to temporary differences between financial
statement and tax return amounts based upon enacted tax rates in effect for the
future periods when such differences are expected to reverse.
 
     Derivatives -- Derivatives consist principally of interest rate swap and
interest rate cap agreements used to manage the Company's interest rate risk.
Interest differentials paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are
recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the agreements.
Premiums paid for interest rate caps are included with long-term debt and are
amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
related agreements.

     Finance lease receivables at December 31, 1995, are due in installments as
follows (in thousands): 1996, $886,343; 1997, $620,935; 1998, $311,287; 1999,
$223,486; 2000, $149,333; and, thereafter, $1,130,434. Receivables of $9.5
million serve as collateral to long-term debt.
 
     Finance leases include open-end transactions in the Fleet Services business
unit in which the lessee pays the Company for any shortfall from a stated
terminal amount for vehicles or receives any amount in excess of the terminal
value. On most of these transactions, Fleet Services retains an exposure to the
lowest dollar amounts of the vehicles' value, of which half is guaranteed by a
third party. Because of the high value of the vehicles underlying these
transactions, full recovery of the value is expected to be covered by the
lessees' guarantees. As such, all amounts are included above in receivable in
installments.
 
     In December 1991, U.S. Fleet Financing, Inc. ("USFF"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, sold a portfolio of finance leases for proceeds of
$211.5 million. During 1992, 1993, and 1994, additional leases were sold for
proceeds of $79.9 million, $103.0 million, and $67.6 million, respectively, to
replace the run-off of principal in the leases initially securitized. Beginning
in June 1994, the Company discontinued securitizing

additional leases. The sale agreement provides recourse to the assets of USFF,
totalling $17.7 million at December 31, 1995, for any uncollectible receivables
in the portfolio. USFF is a separate entity from its parent company, USL Capital
Corporation, and its assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy the
claims of its creditors. An allowance of $212,000 has been provided on the books
of USFF for estimated losses on the sold receivables. The agreement provides
that the Company will service the lease receivables for the purchaser. At
December 31, 1995, $47.3 million of net investment in the leases serviced by the
Company was outstanding.
 
     In April 1992, the Company sold a portfolio of municipal finance leases for
proceeds of $95.1 million. The sale agreement provides the buyers with limited
recourse against the Company, $1.1 million at December 31, 1995, for any
uncollectible receivables in the portfolio. The agreement provides that the
Company will service the lease receivables for the purchaser. At December 31,
1995, $3.3 million of net investment in the leases serviced by the Company was
outstanding.

     Expected maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations
with or without penalty.
 
     Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities were $22.0 million
in 1995 and $5.1 million in 1994, with realized gains of $1.8 million and $0.1
million, respectively. Amortized cost was the basis used in computing the
realized gains. The net unrealized gain/(loss) net of tax included in
shareholder's equity was $(3.8) million and $(3.6) million at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.
 
     The net unrealized gain on trading securities included in earnings (in
thousands) in 1995 was $45.
 
     Proceeds from the sale of investments in debt securities (in thousands)
were $58,251 in 1993, and the resulting gains (in thousands) were $4,888.
 
NOTE 7 -- SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE
 
     Short-term notes payable consist entirely of commercial paper. Average
interest rates, after giving effect to interest rate exchange agreements, on
commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 1995 and 1994, were 6.1% and 6.2%
respectively. The interest rate exchange agreements, which expire through 2005,
had the effect of fixing interest rates on $259.2 million of debt at December
31, 1995, and $364.2 million of debt at December 31, 1994. The balance
outstanding at December 31, 1995, had an average maturity of 24 days. The
Company has committed credit lines, wherein it may borrow up to $1.7 billion at
floating rates based upon a spread over LIBOR. Of these credit lines, $1.2
billion are under five-year agreements expiring in 2000, and the balance are
under one-year agreements. An annual facility fee of .07% to .125% is paid on
the unused portion of these credit lines. These lines contain certain provisions
related to (a) continuing Ford ownership; (b) limitations on liens; and (c)
limitations on activities and indebtedness of subsidiaries. There were no
borrowings outstanding on these lines at December 31, 1995.

NOTE 11 -- PENSIONS
 
     The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan comprising a
profit sharing part and a deferred compensation matching contribution part which
covers substantially all of its employees. The combined contribution for profit
sharing and deferred compensation match is limited to 10% of a participant's
qualified earnings. Under the profit sharing part, contributions are determined
as 6.9% of each covered participant's qualified earnings, plus an additional
5.7% of earnings above the Social Security maximum taxable amount. Profit
sharing cost represents contributions minus forfeited amounts of terminated
participants. Under the deferred compensation part, contributions (cost) are
determined for eligible participants as 75 cents per dollar of deferred
compensation for the first 3% of compensation plus 25 cents per dollar for the
next 3%, up to 6% of compensation. The total cost of the retirement plan (in
thousands) amounted to $2,118 in 1995, $2,750 in 1994, and $3,500 in 1993.
 
NOTE 12 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES
 
     The Company provides administrative services for Ford Credit and other Ford
affiliates, for which the Company is reimbursed. Ford also provides
administrative services to the Company, for which Ford is reimbursed. The
Company believes that these arrangements, which are not covered by any formal
agreement between the Company, Ford Credit, and Ford or its affiliates, are
mutually beneficial. Assessments for services by the Company to Ford Credit and
other affiliates were (in thousands): 1995, $12,458; 1994, $11,746; 1993,
$12,423; and assessments by Ford to the Company were $1,700, $1,900, and $2,280,
respectively.
 
     In 1992, the Company purchased equipment and the remaining payments under
an existing operating lease agreement due from Ford. In December 1992, the lease
with Ford was renewed with upgraded equipment, purchased for $28.2 million, and
classified as a finance lease with an initial lease term of 42 months. The
revenue earned under the finance lease was $0.9 million in 1995, $1.6 million in
1994, and $2.2 million in 1993.
 
     The Company acts as Ford's lease advisor, primarily in the arrangement of
leases of data processing and office equipment for use by Ford, and as such
receives broker fees from the ultimate lessor. Such fees (in thousands) were
$1,910 in 1995, $1,325 in 1994, and $1,591 in 1993. In addition, an agreement
with Ford provided for payment by Ford to the Company of broker fees in 1993 (in
thousands) totaling $955 for the negotiation and arrangement of the sale and
leaseback of equipment.
 
     The Company receives fees for the management of railcars for Ford Credit.
Such fees (in thousands) were $551 in 1995, $515 in 1994, and $294 in 1993.
 
     In 1995 and 1994, the Company declared a dividend, effective December 31,
in the amount of $40 million and $100 million, respectively, which were paid to
Ford Holdings in January 1996 and 1995. The accrued dividend is included in the
Payable to Ford and Affiliates caption on the December 31, 1995 and 1994
Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 1993, Ford Holdings made a capital contribution
to the Company of $40 million.
 
     The Company acts as general partner to a limited partnership in which it
has a 23% equity interest. In accordance with the limited partnership
agreements, the Company receives fees and other compensation for services
provided. Such amounts earned were as follows (in thousands): 1995, $784; 1994,
$800; and 1993, $774. Equity income from the partnership, included in
consolidated revenues, was as follows (in thousands): 1995, $1,564; 1994,
$1,452; and 1993, $1,396.
 
     In 1989, the Company leased office space from Ford Motor Land Development
Corporation, a subsidiary of Ford. The lease, with a term of five years which
expired in July 1994, was classified as an operating lease. Rent expense (in
thousands) amounted to $471 in 1994 and $701 in 1993. A portion of the leased
office space was subleased to several divisions of Ford Motor Company. Sublease
income, which included amounts for leasehold improvements and furniture and
fixtures, (in thousands) amounted to $529 in 1994 and $1,013 in 1993.
 
     In the fourth quarter of 1995, Ford announced that it was reviewing
possible strategic actions, including the partial or complete sale of the
Company. Following this announcement, the Company's Board of Directors reviewed
the Company's compensation plans and programs for employees and management in
light of a

possible change in control of the Company and determined that certain additions
and changes to such plans and programs should be made and that certain further
programs should be adopted. These actions were approved by Ford. The Company
expects to be reimbursed by Ford for any resulting incremental costs.
 
NOTE 13 -- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The Company has entered into arrangements to manage exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. It is the objective of the Company to optimize
its borrowing costs while maintaining stable interest rate margins through term
matching assets with debt of similar maturities. These arrangements primarily
include interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements. Under interest rate
cap agreements, the Company pays a premium for the right to receive interest in
excess of the capped rates. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange
of interest obligations on fixed and floating interest rate debt without the
exchange of the underlying principal amounts. The agreements generally mature at
the time the related debt matures. The differential paid or received on interest
rate swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the
life of the agreements. Notional amounts are used to express the volume of
interest rate swap agreements. The notional amounts do not represent cash flows
and are not subject to risk of loss. In the unlikely event that a counterparty
fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap agreement, the Company's
exposure is the termination value of the contracts.
 
     The following table summarizes the interest rate contracts that the Company
uses to manage its interest rate risk:

NOTE 14 -- OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
 
     The Company has issued a financial guarantee in support of a line of credit
entered into by an affiliate of Ford. This affiliate, located in Australia, was
previously a subsidiary of the Company, which retains management responsibility
for its operations. The line of credit expires in 1996. At December 31, 1995,
the financial guarantee issued totaled $3.0 million, and the outstanding balance
subject to such guarantee was $1.5 million. This remaining debt was repaid in
January 1996.
 
     Additionally, under two domestic lease transactions arranged by the Company
for others, the Company guaranteed under certain conditions that the lessor will
receive additional rents of specified amounts after the original lease terms
expire. The expiration dates are between 1996 and 2001. At December 31, 1995,
such guarantees totaled $17 million. The Company has not provided collateral or
other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.
 
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had committed to purchase railcars in the
amount of $74 million, to be included in its operating lease inventory in 1996.
 
     The Company has also entered into several commitment agreements with third
parties contemplating possible first mortgage loans and equipment leases. The
interest rates on the first mortgage loan commitments represent a spread over
average prime or LIBOR and they have various expiration dates through 2000. At
December 31, 1995, such commitments totaled approximately $128 million.

     The carrying amounts presented in the table are included in the
consolidated balance sheets under the indicated captions, and are net of any
applicable allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
     The following notes summarize the major methods and assumption used in
estimating the fair values of financial instruments:
 
          NOTES RECEIVABLE are estimated by either discounting the future cash
     flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to
     borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining
     maturities, or dealer quotes.
 
          INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES are estimated primarily by market and dealer
     quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated
     using quoted market prices for similar securities. Debt securities are also
     valued using the discounted future cash flows based upon current rates of
     similar debt instruments traded when a market quote of a similar investment
     is not available.
 
          SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE are estimated at their carrying amount
     because of the short maturity of these instruments.
 
          LONG-TERM DEBT is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
     rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and
     remaining maturities. It is the Company's policy to follow a strategy of
     match-funding all financing, and as such, the Company believes that the
     change in the fair market value of its debt would be offset by a
     corresponding increase in the estimated fair value of its investment in
     leases.
 
          DERIVATIVES are estimated as the amount that the Company would receive
     or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into
     account current market interest rates and corresponding borrowing spreads.
 
          FINANCIAL GUARANTEES are estimated as the amount that the Company
     would need to pay an independent third party to assume responsibility for
     the guarantees. Based upon an assessment that the
 
                                       34
<PAGE>   35
 
NOTE 15 -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

     probability of performance under each guarantee is remote, the Company
     believes that such amounts are insignificant.
 
          LOAN COMMITMENTS are estimated at the amount of the commitment, in
     that the financing rates associated with the various commitments float
     until funding.
 
NOTE 16 -- CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
 
     The Company controls its credit risk through credit standards, limits on
exposure, and monitoring the financial condition of other parties. The lease,
note and investment portfolios are well diversified, consisting of more than 35
industries.
 
     A significant portion of the Company's business activity is with customers
and businesses located in California. As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the
Company's net finance and operating leases, notes receivable and investments in
California totaled approximately $804 million and $627 million, respectively.
There were no other significant regional, industrial or group concentrations at
December 31, 1995, or December 31, 1994.
 
     The Company generally requires the leased asset to serve as collateral for
the lease. The collateral consists principally of autos, computers and
peripherals, office furnishings, copiers, railcars, aircraft, and industrial
facilities. Notes receivable are collateralized by first mortgages on real
estate or equipment. Investments are not collateralized.
 
NOTE 17 -- POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     The Company sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
provide medical and life insurance coverage to retirees and their dependents.
The cost of retiree and dependent medical coverage is shared between the Company
and the retiree. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. The accounting for
the health care plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written plan
that are consistent with the Company's past practice. The Company defines a
maximum amount (or "cap") that it will contribute toward the health benefits of
each retiree. This cap is re-determined annually and is based on the individual
retiree's number of dependents. The Company has a history of increasing this
cap. Over the last seven years the aggregate increase in the cap approximates
the average increase in the underlying premium costs of the program. This
valuation assumed that in future years the Company will continue to increase the
cap at the average rate of increase of the underlying cost of the retiree
benefit program. However, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified by the
Company from time to time.

        Assumption: Discount rate at year-end....................    7.25%       8.75%
</TABLE>
 
     For measurement purposes, 7.5% and 5.0% annual rates of increase in the per
capita cost of postretirement medical benefits were assumed for 1995 for the
under age 65 indemnity and HMO and over age 65 indemnity plans, respectively;
the rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for 2001 and remain at that
level thereafter. The comparable rates assumed for 1994 were 9% and 7.5% for the
under age 65 indemnity and HMO and over age 65 indemnity plans, respectively.
The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost trend
rates by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995, by $838,000 and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by $153,000.

written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date
and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more
than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed,
or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of
the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity
herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might

present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes,
unless or except to the extent that the presence of a larger number may be
required by law.

                 If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of
the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to
vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another
place, date, or time.

                 The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at
which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment

in order.

                 SECTION 7.       PROXIES AND VOTING.

                 At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder entitled
to vote may vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing
filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting.

                 Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, each
stockholder shall have one vote for every share of stock entitled to vote which
is registered in his name on the record date for the meeting.

                 All voting, including on the election of directors but

however, that upon demand therefore by a stockholder entitled to vote or his
proxy, a stock vote shall be taken.  Every stock vote shall be take by ballots,
each of which shall state such information as may be required under the
procedure established for the meeting. Every vote taken by ballots shall be

                 SECTION 8.       STOCK LIST.

                 A complete list of stockholders of the corporation entitled to

class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number
of shares registered in his name, shall be open to the examination of any such
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business
hours for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place
within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified

meeting is to be held.

                 The stock list shall also be kept at the place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof and shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the
