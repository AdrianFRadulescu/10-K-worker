</TABLE>
 
BUSINESS UNITS
 
     The Company operates exclusively in the commercial finance segment of the
financial services industry. The Company serves its commercial customers though
six business units, each of which is described in greater detail below.
 
  Business Equipment Financing
 
     Through its Business Equipment Financing unit, the Company finances, under
finance leases, conditional sale agreements, operating leases, and
collateralized loans, the acquisition and use of equipment for business,
professional, industrial, and governmental users throughout the United States.
The types of equipment financed include computers and computer peripherals,
super-computers, office equipment, office furnishings, telecommunications,
medical, transportation, manufacturing, and other kinds of equipment. This
financing is sometimes offered in conjunction with the manufacturer of the
equipment, but in other cases is provided directly to the end user of the
equipment. Financing transactions generally cover equipment having an aggregate
cost between $250,000 and $5 million, with an average transaction size of
approximately $600,000. These financing services are marketed through 19 offices
located throughout the United States.
 
     The Company does not manufacture or sell under its own label any of the
equipment which it leases. It only purchases equipment which a particular lessee
has committed to lease, and does not take order positions or make purchases in
advance of such a binding agreement by a lessee to lease the equipment. All
lessees are obligated to maintain the equipment and reimburse the Company for
any taxes paid thereon. Any casualty losses of equipment are covered either by
insurance carried by the lessee as required under the lease or by lessee
self-insurance when the Company deems the lessee's credit to be satisfactory.
Upon the expiration of leases, the Company either renews the leases with the
lessees, sells the leased equipment to the lessees, or remarkets the equipment.
 
     The Company also acquires from manufacturers pools of leases and their
underlying equipment. The manufacturers may retain an economic interest in the
successful operation of each pool and, in exchange, the manufacturers maintain
the equipment, remarket it after the expiration of the initial term of the
leases, and manage the relationship with the lessees. In other transactions, the
lessee is obligated to maintain the equipment and the Company manages the
relationship with the lessees, bills and collects, and remarkets the equipment.
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   5
 
     The Company also acquires equipment and related leases originated by other
lessors and, to a lesser extent by brokers, although the purchase of
broker-originated business has declined significantly over the past few years.
On the majority of such acquired transactions, the Company bills and collects,
manages the relationships with the lessees and remarkets the equipment.
 
     The following table sets forth certain data with respect to the Business
Equipment Financing unit for the periods ending on and as of the dates
indicated.

  Transportation and Industrial Financing
 
     Through its Transportation and Industrial Financing unit, the Company at
the present time principally owns, leases, finances and remarkets commercial
aircraft, and to a lesser extent leases and finances other types of
transportation, energy and industrial equipment and facilities. Aircraft, other
equipment and facilities are leased and financed under single investor finance
leases, leveraged leases, operating leases and collateralized loans. Under all
leases the lessee is responsible for all taxes, maintenance and insurance. The
majority of this business is acquired through investment bankers and lessee
advisors, and the balance through direct lessee contact.
 
     The Company owns a 23% interest in, and through a wholly-owned subsidiary
is the general partner of, Airlease Ltd., a California Limited Partnership
("Airlease Ltd."). Assets were $114.0 million at December 31, 1993 compared with
$112.3 million at December 31, 1992. The limited partnership units are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. Airlease Ltd. engages in the ownership and leasing
of commercial aircraft to airlines and a freight carrier.
 
     At December 31, 1993, the Company's aggregate commercial aircraft earning
assets in this unit (including its interest in those aircraft owned by Airlease
Ltd.) were $911.2 million. Of the aircraft leased and financed by the Company at
December 31, 1993, 50% of the Company's aircraft earning assets were leased to
or financed for commercial airlines, with the remainder leased primarily to a
freight carrier and aircraft manufacturers. One aircraft is on lease to a
bankrupt airline which expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the summer of 1994.
Approximately 98% of the aircraft owned or financed by the Company (measured by
their book value) were in compliance with Stage III noise regulations (the most
stringent level) of the Aviation Safety and Capacity Act of 1990.
 
     This business unit also manages a portfolio of leveraged leases, single
investor leases and loans in which Ford Credit holds an interest. These managed
leases cover rail cars and locomotives, electric power generation and other
facilities, marine vessels, and other types of assets. The business unit also
acts as agent for Trust Company for USL, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, which
is owner trustee for a portfolio of leveraged leases it arranged for outside
institutional investors prior to 1985. As the remarketing agent for these
institutional investors and Ford Credit, the Company participates in the
residual proceeds from the disposition of the equipment at the termination of
some of these leases.

  Fleet Services
 
     Through its Fleet Services unit, the Company is engaged in the leasing of
automotive, van, and light truck fleets for commercial purposes. Fleet Services
also provides management services for a substantial portion of its leased
vehicles, and for certain of the vehicles owned by its customers. These leasing
and management services are marketed to commercial customers through 12 offices
located throughout the United States. On December 31, 1993, the Company sold its
20% equity interest in AT&T Automotive Services, Inc. to AT&T Capital
Corporation and terminated its joint venture with AT&T Capital Corporation.
However, Fleet Services entered into a new long-term agreement under which it
continues to provide fleet management services for subsidiaries and affiliates
of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. At December 31, 1993, there were
approximately 14,000 vehicles for which the Company provided such services.
 
     At December 31, 1993, Fleet Services had (in addition to the vehicles it
services for AT&T Capital Corporation) an aggregate of approximately 71,600
vehicles in fleets which it leased and managed or managed only, as compared with
approximately 71,500 vehicles at December 31, 1992.
 
     Certain of Fleet Services' vehicles are leased under "open-end finance"
leases in which the Company bears no risk (other than the lessee's credit) on
the resale price of the vehicles at the expiration of the lease. The majority of
the vehicles are leased under "modified open-end" leases, in which the Company,
although not assured of full recovery of the vehicle's cost from rental and
resale proceeds, is at risk for a relatively small portion of such cost, which
portion is expected to be substantially below anticipated resale proceeds. Other
vehicles are leased under "closed-end" leases, in which the Company's full
recovery of the vehicle's cost from rental and resale proceeds is dependent upon
the Company's realization of anticipated residual value. Additionally, certain
of the closed-end leases (less than 9% of all leased vehicles at December 31,
1993) contain maintenance provisions which require that the Company bear the
maintenance expense for the leased vehicle in consideration of a higher lease
rate.

* During 1993, approximately $103 million in earning assets were securitized and
  sold, which together with earning assets securitized and sold in 1991 and
  1992, resulted in a balance of such securitized assets at December 31, 1993 of
  approximately $172 million, which are not included in total earning assets.
  See Borrowing and Other Sources of Funds on page 13.
 
     The increase in modified open-end leases reflects the shift to a lease
structure that is more attractive to the customer. This "modified" structure
permits, for 2-year contracts, operating lease treatment for the customers and
finance lease treatment for the Company.
 
     Under substantially all leases, the lessee is obligated to provide
insurance against public liability and property damage, to reimburse the Company
for all taxes relating to the vehicles or the lease and, except in leases with a
maintenance provision, to maintain, at the lessee's expense, the vehicles in
good operating condition.
 
     Management services are generally computerized and provide monthly cost
analyses of each vehicle in service, allowing customers' fleet operating costs
to be closely controlled. Programs are tailored to meet special customer needs
and many options are offered including, for example, guaranteed maintenance
programs, assistance in selection of automobile units, and analysis of insurance
coverage.
 
  Municipal and Corporate Financing
 
     Through its Municipal and Corporate Financing business, the Company
arranges and carries on its books municipal financings for state and local
governments of essential-use equipment. This business also invests in
publicly-traded and privately-placed preferred stocks and senior and
subordinated debt of public and private companies, principally utilities and
manufacturing companies. These securities are purchased, after extensive due
diligence by the Company, through investment banking intermediaries, either at
the initial offering or on the open market. Approximately 70% of these corporate
securities are currently rated at investment grade.

  Real Estate Financing
 
     Through four loan origination offices in its Real Estate Financing unit,
the Company provides first mortgage financing of income-producing real estate
including apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, and warehouses. This
real estate is geographically diversified throughout the United States. No
financing is provided for motels, hotels, raw land, or specialty properties.
Substantially all transactions are financings of three to five years, and none
is a construction loan. The loans provide funds for acquisitions or
refinancings, or are "bridge" financings between construction and permanent
loans. Prior to August 1990, substantially all of the transactions arranged by
this business were funded by and carried on the books of Ford Credit; the
Company continues to manage these transactions for Ford Credit. At December 31,
1993, the Company had commitments to fund additional first mortgage loans of
approximately $7.1 million. At such date, it also held title to a single
foreclosed property at a book value of $3.8 million, which it recovered on a
defaulted loan and for which additional tenants are actively being sought.

  Rail Services
 
     Through its Rail Services unit, the Company leases to industrial shippers
and railroads approximately 17,700 rail cars. Approximately 92% of all of these
cars are owned by the Company or leased to it under long-term leases. Of the
cars in the Company's fleet at December 31, 1993, 44% were leased out to the
Company's customers for terms of less than one year, 46% for terms of between
one and five years, and 8% for terms of over five years. Under substantially all
leases, the Company maintains and repairs the cars at its expense. As provided
in the rules of the American Association of Railroads, if a car is damaged or
destroyed on the line of any particular railroad, that railroad is obligated
either to repair the car or, if the car is destroyed, pay the car owner an
amount which reflects the car's type and age. Rail Services also manages 1,492
cars for others, including 1,290 cars for Ford affiliates.

FINANCING ARRANGED AND MANAGED FOR FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY
 
     The Company manages certain commercial leasing and financing transactions
originated by and carried on the books of Ford Credit. In addition, a portion of
new Municipal and Corporate Financing and Transportation and Industrial
Financing transactions, including the major portion of leveraged leases, are
funded by and carried on the books of Ford Credit. Ford Credit reimburses the
Company for the Company's operating costs related to arranging and managing all
transactions funded by Ford Credit. All other transactions are funded by and
carried on the books of the Company.
 
MANAGEMENT OF FOREIGN AFFILIATES
 
     The Company manages two affiliated corporations in the United Kingdom and
Australia that are owned by Ford. These two corporations are engaged in the
equipment financing business, which businesses are conducted substantially in
the same manner as the Company's businesses in the United States. These
affiliates fund their equipment acquisitions and pay their own operating
expenses. However, the Company guarantees the indebtedness of such affiliates,
which at December 31, 1993, was $77 million, of which $39 million, representing
the United Kingdom affiliate's indebtedness, was paid off in February 1994.
These corporations were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company prior to
October 1, 1989, on which date they were dividended to Ford. The company located
in the United Kingdom has entered into no new transactions since mid-1992 and is
being liquidated.

GENERAL
 
  Credit Loss Experience
 
     The management of credit exposure is an important element of the Company's
business. The Company reviews the credit of all prospective customers, and
manages concentration exposures by customer, collateral type, and geographic
distribution. It establishes appropriate loss allowances based on the credit
characteristics and the loss experience for each type of business, and also
establishes additional reserves for specific transactions if it believes this
action is warranted. Delinquent receivables are reviewed by management monthly,
and are generally written down to expected realizable value when, in the opinion
of management, they become uncollectible or when they become more than 180 days
past due. Collection activities continue on accounts written off when management
believes such action is warranted.
 
     The table below shows certain information on the Company's allowance for
doubtful accounts for the periods indicated.

     Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts for 1993 increased by $5.6
million from 1992 primarily as a result of the increase in earning assets as
well as management's evaluation of the adequacy of the loss reserve. In
addition, write-offs (deductions) in 1993 increased $400,000 from 1992, the
largest single transaction being $2.7 million.
 
     Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts for 1992 increased by $8.8
million from 1991. This resulted primarily from a one-time reduction to the
allowance made in 1991 to recognize that the Business Equipment Financing unit
no longer engaged in small ticket leasing and unsecured lending, operations
which experienced higher credit losses. In addition, write-offs (deductions) in
1992 increased $3.3 million from 1991, the largest single transaction being $1.3
million.
 
     Total balances of accounts receivable over 90 days past due at year end
1993 decreased $4.2 million over 1992, primarily because of improved collection
and workout activities as well as the write-down of several receivables which
were delinquent at December 31, 1992, and which management has since deemed to
be uncollectible. At December 31, 1993, accounts receivable over 90 days past
due consisted primarily of delinquent notes in the amount of $11.2 million and
$8.7 million, collateralized by an apartment complex and an office complex,
respectively, and a $6.0 million delinquent receivable from an airline,
collateralized by a DC-9-51 aircraft.

  Residual Policy
 
     The establishment and realization of residual values on both finance and
operating leases are important elements of the Company's business. In general,
finance leases are non-cancelable leases in which the lease payments over the
term exceed the cost of the leased equipment plus financing and other expenses.
Operating leases are usually of a shorter term and the lease payments by
themselves are not sufficient to cover such cost and expenses. Full recovery of
equipment cost is dependent upon selling or re-leasing the equipment.
 
     Residual values are established upon acquisition of the equipment based
upon the estimated value of the equipment at the time the Company expects to
dispose of the equipment under finance leases, and at the end of the equipment's
expected useful life under operating leases. Periodically, the Company reviews
its residual values, and if it determines there has been an other than temporary
impairment in value, adjustments are made which result in an immediate charge to
income and/or a reduction in earnings over the remaining term of the lease.
 
     FINANCE LEASES.  The following table shows, for each respective year, for
the Company's continuing businesses: (a) the aggregate sales proceeds and

  Employees
 
     The Company had 682 full time employees at December 31, 1993.
 
  Competition
 
     In all of its financing programs, the Company competes with other leasing
and finance companies, banks, lease brokers and investment banking firms who
arrange for the financing and leasing of equipment, and manufacturers and
vendors who sell, finance and lease their own products to customers.
 
  Borrowing and Other Sources of Funds
 
     The funds required to operate the Company's business are generated
internally from loan and lease payments and equipment sales, and externally from
medium-term debt, commercial paper, securitized financings, and bank borrowings.
 
     The Company raises short-term debt financing through its established
commercial paper programs and raises long-term debt in the public market through
periodic offerings of medium-term notes and underwritten debt offerings. The
Company has committed bank lines of $1.19 billion with 23 banks, consisting of
$995 million under multi-year (principally five-year) credit agreements and $195
million under one-year agreements. Neither Ford nor Ford Holdings guarantees the
debt of the Company, although the Company's existing credit lines require that
Ford maintain at least a 75% direct or indirect ownership interest in the
Company. At present, the Company's profitability is not significantly related to
the business outlook for Ford and this situation is not expected to change in
the future.
 
     In 1991 the Company securitized and sold approximately $212 million of its
vehicle leases by transferring such leases, without recourse to the Company, to
a wholly-owned subsidiary, which, in turn, sold the leases to an unrelated
cooperative corporation. Such wholly-owned subsidiary is a separate entity from
its parent company, USL Capital Corporation, whose assets are available first
and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. As it has since 1991, the
Company intends periodically to securitize additional leases under this
arrangement to replace the run-off of principal in the leases initially
securitized. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page
27.
 
     On April 30, 1992, the Company securitized and sold approximately $94
million in principal amount of receivables under lease-purchase agreements with
various state and local governments. These lease-purchase agreements were
purchased by the Company from Ford Credit, for whom they had been managed by the
Company. The Company then immediately transferred them to tax-exempt grantor
trusts, which issued tax-exempt asset-backed certificates to investors in a
public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1993 (Registration
Statement No. 33-45596). See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 27.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
     The Company owns no significant real property and leases all of its
offices. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 32
for information as to rental obligations.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     There are no pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine
litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company is a party or to
which its property is subject, nor are any such proceedings known to be
contemplated by governmental authorities.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
 
     All outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are owned by Ford
Holdings, and therefore there is no market for such shares. In the fourth
quarter of 1989, the Company dividended to Ford the Company's ownership
interests in its Australian, United Kingdom, Canadian and German operations in
the aggregate amount of $19.9 million. Since such dividend, the Company has paid
no dividend nor made any other distribution to Ford, Ford Holdings or any other
Ford affiliate. Ford Holdings made a $30 million, a $5 million and a $40 million
capital contribution to the Company in 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively. The
Company and Ford Holdings will, from time to time, determine the appropriate
capitalization for the Company, which will, in part, affect any future payment
of dividends to Ford Holdings or capital contributions to the Company.

</TABLE>
 
  Revenues
 
     Revenues increased $63.1 million, or 13% in 1993 compared with 1992
primarily as a result of a 30% increase in average earning assets partially
offset by a decrease in revenue yields relating to the general decline in
interest rates and a change in the mix of assets in the operating lease
portfolio. In addition, there was an increase of $10.1 million in the gain on
sale of residuals and equipment in the Transportation and Industrial Financing
business.
 
  Expenses
 
     Sales, administrative and general expenses increased $7.1 million, or 11%
in 1993, primarily reflecting the effects of the substantial increase in earning
assets.
 
     Interest expense increased $35.8 million, or 23% in 1993, reflecting an
increase in average borrowings from $2.31 billion in 1992 to $3.15 billion in
1993 to finance earning assets. This increase was offset in part by a decline in
borrowing rates, which averaged 6.0% in 1993 compared with 6.6% in 1992.
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   15
 
     Depreciation expense on operating lease equipment decreased $28.2 million,
or 18% in 1993, although the average investment in operating lease equipment
increased 30% or $151 million. This increase in equipment primarily reflects the
addition of approximately $200 million in the Rail Services business, with an
average life of 16 years. The reduction in depreciation expense is the result of
the shift to the longer depreciable life rail car assets.
 
     Other expenses increased $15.3 million, or 43%, due primarily to an $8.8
million increase in maintenance expense incurred by the Rail Services business
as a result of routine maintenance on a significantly larger fleet. There was
also an increase of $5.3 million in the provision for losses (see page 11 for
discussion of credit loss experience).
 
  Operating Profit
 
     Operating profit improved $33.1 million or 37% compared with 1992. The
improvement in operating results reflects the impact of higher earning assets.
 
  Taxes on Income
 
     Income taxes were 36.9% on income before taxes in 1993 compared with 32.8%
in 1992. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 31 for
the principal reasons for differences from the normal statutory rates.
 
  New Acccounting Standards
 
     In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", which requires companies to account for
employee benefits on an accrual basis for periods when employees are no longer
actively employed but have not yet reached retirement. The effect on the
Company's financial statements was not material.
 
     In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan". The Standards requires that impaired loans be measured
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's effective interest rate. The Company does not plan to adopt this standard
until January 1, 1995 and the effect is not expected to be material.
 
     In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities". The Standard establishes standards of financial
accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities (excluding those
accounted for under the equity method and investments in consolidated
subsidiaries) that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments
in debt securities. The Company has adopted this standard effective January 1,
1994, and the effect is not expected to be material.

              MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
     Management is responsible for the preparation of the Company's financial
statements and the other financial information in this report. This
responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of the
financial records and the presentation of the Company's financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     The Company maintains an internal control structure designed to provide,
among other things, reasonable assurance that its records include the
transactions of its operations in all material respects and to provide
protection against significant misuse or loss of Company assets. The internal
control structure is supported by careful selection and training of financial
management personnel, by written procedures that communicate the details of the
control structure to the Company's activities, by a staff of internal auditors
of Ford Motor Company who employ thorough auditing programs, and by the
Company's staff of operating control specialists who conduct reviews of
adherence to the Company's procedures and policies.
 
     The Company's financial statements have been audited by Coopers & Lybrand,
independent certified public accountants. Their audit was conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which include a review of
the Company's internal control structure to the extent deemed necessary for the
purposes of their audit. The Report of Independent Accountants appears on the
following page.
 
     The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management's
fulfillment of its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements
and the financial control of operations. The Board of Directors of Ford Motor
Company, through its Audit Committee, selects the independent accountants. The
independent accountants have full and free access to the Board to discuss their
audit work, the Company's internal controls, and financial reporting matters.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors,
  USL Capital Corporation:
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedules of USL Capital Corporation and subsidiaries listed in Part
IV Item 14(a)1. and 2. of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of USL Capital
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
the information required to be included therein.

                    USL CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include USL Capital
Corporation ("Company") and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments
in partnerships and 50%-or-less owned associated companies are accounted for on
the equity method. Refer to Item 1. Business "Consolidation and Sale of
Subsidiaries." All material intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1993
presentation.
 
     In October 1989, all of the Company's outstanding capital stock was
acquired by Ford Holdings, Inc. ("Ford Holdings") from Ford Motor Company
("Ford"). The acquisition by Ford in 1987 was accounted for as a purchase. The
unamortized balance of the excess of the purchase price paid by Ford over the
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is shown as goodwill on the
Company's books.
 
     Cash and Cash Equivalents -- Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase. Outstanding checks ($21,582,000 at December 31, 1993 and $22,660,000
at December 31, 1992) are reclassified to Accounts Payable. For Cash and Cash
Equivalents, the carrying amount is stated at fair value.
 
     Finance Leases -- At lease commencement, the Company records the lease
receivable, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and unearned lease
income. Initial direct costs are deferred as part of the investment and
amortized over the lease term. Unearned lease income is recognized as revenue
over the lease term so as to approximate a level rate of return on the net
investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the
estimated amount to be received at lease termination from the disposition of
leased equipment.
 
     Operating Leases -- Lease contracts that do not meet the criteria of
finance leases are accounted for as operating leases. Rental equipment is
recorded at cost and depreciated over its useful life or lease term to an
estimated salvage or residual value (10 to 30 years for railroad cars and 3 to 7
years for other equipment), primarily on a straight-line basis.
 
     Leveraged Leases -- Leveraged lease assets acquired by the Company are
financed primarily through nonrecourse loans from third-party debt participants.
These loans are secured by the lessee's rental obligations and the leased
property. Unearned income is recognized over the lease term at a constant
after-tax rate of return on the net investment in the lease in those periods in
which the net investment is positive. Unguaranteed estimated residual values are
principally based on independent appraisals of the estimated values of the
assets remaining at the expiration of the lease.
 
     Investment in Securities -- Investments in securities consist principally
of debt securities (preferred stock, corporate and Municipal bonds) which are
recorded at amortized cost because the Company has the ability to hold such
securities until maturity and presently has this intention. See Note 6 for

     Goodwill -- Goodwill, arising principally from the acquisition by Ford, is
being amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years (1993, $5,643,000;
1992, $5,643,000; 1991, $5,643,000).
 
     Taxes on Income and Tax Credits -- Since the transfer of ownership of the
Company by Ford to Ford Holdings in 1989, the Company has been included in the
consolidated federal income tax return of Ford Holdings and continues to be
included in the combined state income tax returns of Ford, except in those
states where the Company is required to file separate returns. Income taxes,
including the federal alternative minimum tax, if any, are allocated by Ford
Holdings based on the Company's effect on taxes paid by the group. Deferred
income tax liabilities give effect to temporary differences between financial
statement and tax return amounts based upon enacted tax rates in effect for the
future periods when such differences are expected to reverse.

     Finance lease receivables at December 31, 1993 are due in installments as
follows (in thousands): 1994, $751,956; 1995, $547,200; 1996, $327,429; 1997,
$228,880; 1998, $161,459 and thereafter, $1,247,246. Receivables of $6.9 million
serve as collateral to long-term debt.
 
     In December 1991, U.S. Fleet Financing ("USFF") , a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, sold a portfolio of finance leases for proceeds of $211.5
million. During 1992 and 1993, additional leases were sold for proceeds of $79.9
million and $103.0 million, respectively, to replace the run-off of principal in
the leases initially securitized. The sale agreement provides recourse to the
assets of USFF, $35.7 million at December 31, 1993, for any uncollectible
receivables in the portfolio. USFF is a separate entity from its parent company,
USL Capital Corporation, and its assets will be available first and foremost to
satisfy the claims of its creditors. An allowance of $772,000 has been provided
on the books of USFF for estimated losses on the sold receivables. The agreement
provides that the Company will service the lease receivables for the purchaser.
At December 31, 1993, $171.6 million of net investment in the leases serviced by
the Company was outstanding.
 
     In April 1992, the Company sold a portfolio of municipal finance leases for
proceeds of $95.1 million. The sale agreement provides the buyers with limited
recourse against the Company, $3.0 million at December 31, 1993, for any
uncollectible receivables in the portfolio. An allowance of $26,000 has been
provided for estimated losses on the sold receivables. The agreement provides
that the Company will service the lease receivables for the purchaser. At
December 31, 1993, $19.3 million of net investment in the leases serviced by the
Company was outstanding.

NOTE 3 -- INVESTMENT IN OPERATING LEASES (CONTINUED)
 
     Initial lease terms of rental equipment range from one month to 8.5 years.
Future minimum rentals on operating leases at December 31, 1993 are due in
installments as follows (in thousands): 1994, $182,026; 1995, $95,430; 1996,
$66,666; 1997, $27,137; 1998, $15,337 and thereafter, $25,358.
 
     Minimum future rentals do not include contingent rentals that may be
received under certain rail car leases, because of use in excess of specified
amounts. Contingent rentals (in thousands) received were $8,170 in 1993, $2,454
in 1992 and $2,033 in 1991. The increase in 1993 is the result of the large
expansion of the Rail Services fleet (see Item 1. Business "Business Units").

     At December 31, 1993, $609.6 million of principal was collateralized by
equipment, real estate, and other assets. The weighted average interest rate at
December 31, 1993 was 8.1%. Notes receivable are due in subsequent years as
follows (in thousands): 1994, $96,792; 1995, $101,230; 1996, $114,867; 1997,
$98,383; 1998, $142,069; and thereafter, $178,300.
 
     The fair value of loans is estimated by either discounting the future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers
with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, or dealer
quotes. At December 31, 1993, the estimated fair values of the Company's Notes
Receivable were $727.4 million.

     Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because
borrowers may have the right to call or pre-pay obligations with or without call
or pre-payment penalties, and the Company may have the option to redeem or
convert securities prior to redemption.
 
     In 1993 proceeds from the sale of investments in debt securities (in
thousands) were $58,251, resulting in a gross gain of $4,888. In 1992, proceeds
(in thousands) were $44,253, resulting in a gross gain of $2,195.
 
     The fair value of the investment in debt and equity securities is estimated
primarily by market and dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not
available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar
securities. Debt securities are also valued using the discounted future cash
flows based upon current rates of similar debt instruments traded, when a market
quote or market quote of a similar investment is not available.

NOTE 7 -- SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE
 
     Short-term notes payable consist entirely of commercial paper. The balance
outstanding at December 31, 1993 had an average maturity of 10 days. The Company
has committed credit lines, wherein it may borrow up to $1.19 billion at
floating rates which approximate prime. A commitment fee of  1/8% to  1/4% is
paid on the unused portion of these credit lines. These lines contain certain
provisions related to (a) continuing Ford ownership; (b) limitations on liens;
and (c) limitations on activities and indebtedness of subsidiaries. There were
no borrowings outstanding on these lines at December 31, 1993.
 
     For short-term notes payable, the carrying amount approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments.

     Payments required on long-term debt are (in thousands): 1994, $386,422;
1995, $323,165; 1996, $357,310; 1997, $197,351; 1998, $192,393; and thereafter,
$1,091,609. Average interest rates on collateralized and senior debt outstanding
at December 31, 1993 were 6.3% and 6.7%, respectively.
 
     Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt. At
December 31, 1993, the estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt,
collateralized and senior, was $2.451 billion.
 
     It is the Company's policy to follow a strategy of match funding all
financing, and as such, the Company believes that the change in the fair market
value of its debt would be off-set by a corresponding increase in the estimated
fair value of its investment in leases. See Note 13 for information concerning
interest rate swap agreements.

NOTE 9 -- TAXES ON INCOME
 
     The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes
pursuant to SFAS No. 109. The Company adopted the liability method in 1987 in
accordance with SFAS No. 96, which was subsequently superseded by SFAS No. 109.
The adoption of SFAS No. 109 at the beginning of 1992 had no effect on net
income in that year.

NOTE 11 -- PENSIONS
 
     The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan comprising a
profit sharing part and a deferred compensation part which covers substantially
all of its employees. Under the profit sharing part, contributions are
determined as a percent (12.6%) of each covered participant's qualified
earnings, minus the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance portion of
social security taxes paid for the participant by the Company. Profit sharing
cost represents contributions minus the unvested amounts of terminated
participants. Under the deferred compensation part, contributions (cost) are
determined as 75 cents per dollar of deferred compensation for the first 3
percent of a participant's compensation and 25 cents per dollar for the next 3
percent, up to 6 percent of a participant's compensation. The total cost of the
retirement plan (in thousands) amounted to $3,500 in 1993, $3,700 in 1992, and
$4,400 in 1991.
 
NOTE 12 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES
 
     The Company provides administrative services for Ford Credit and other Ford
affiliates, for which the Company is reimbursed. Ford also provides
administrative services to the Company, for which Ford is reimbursed. The
Company believes that these arrangements, which are not covered by any formal
agreement between the Company, Ford Credit and Ford or its affiliates, are
mutually beneficial. Assessments for services by the Company to Ford Credit and
other affiliates were (in thousands): 1993, $12,423; 1992, $11,781; 1991,
$13,553; and assessments by Ford to the Company were $2,280, $2,776, and $2,566,
respectively.
 
     In 1989, the Company leased office space from Ford Motor Land Development
Corporation, a subsidiary of Ford. The lease, with a term of five years plus an
extension of an additional five years, is classified as an operating lease. The
base rent (in thousands) for the initial five year lease term amounts to $2,204,
plus 22% of the operating expenses and property taxes related to the building.
Rent expense (in thousands) amounted to $701 in 1993, $731 in 1992, and $823 in
1991. Beginning in 1991, a portion of the leased office space was subleased to
several divisions of Ford Motor Company. Sublease income, which includes amounts
for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures, (in thousands) amounted
to $1,013 in 1993, $716 in 1992 and $438 in 1991.
 
     In 1992, the Company purchased equipment and the remaining payments under
an existing operating lease agreement due from Ford. The revenue earned during
the remaining operating lease term in 1992 amounted to $8.1 million. The
corresponding depreciation of the asset during the period was $7.5 million. In
December 1992 the lease with Ford was renewed with upgraded equipment, purchased
for $28.2 million, and classified as a finance lease with an initial lease term
of 42 months. The revenue earned under the finance lease was $2.2 million in
1993 and $198,000 in 1992.
 
     A 1991 agreement with Ford provides for payments by Ford to the Company of
broker fees for the negotiation and arrangement of leases for Ford. Such fees
(in thousands) were $2,546 in 1993, $1,514 in 1992 and $1,794 in 1991.
 
     The Company receives fees for the management of rail cars for Ford Credit.
Such fees (in thousands) were $294 in 1993, $145 in 1992, and $130 in 1991.
 
     In 1993 and 1992, Ford Holdings made capital contributions to the Company
of $40 million and $5 million, respectively.
 
     The Company acts as general partner to a limited partnership, in which it
has a 23% equity interest. In addition, the Company had a nominal investment
interest and acted as general partner to three limited partnerships which were
liquidated in 1991. In accordance with the limited partnership agreements, the
Company receives fees and other compensation for services provided. Such amounts
earned were as follows (in thousands): 1993, $774; 1992, $770; and 1991, $1,042.

NOTE 12 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES (CONTINUED)
 
     The Company, in partnership with AT&T Capital Corporation, leased vehicles
to subsidiaries and affiliates of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. In
such arrangements, the Company provided the services of accounting, purchasing,
collections and fleet management, as well as providing loans to an affiliate.
Fees received (in thousands) were $326 in 1993, $276 in 1992, and $326 in 1991.
Notes receivable and interest income, respectively, (in thousands) were: 1993,
$0 and $407; 1992, $11,060 and $409; and 1991, $11,281 and $728. The Company
sold its equity interest in the partnership in December, 1993, but continues to
provide operational services.
 
NOTE 13 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
 
     The Company enters into certain transactions that can give rise to
financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. The following information
pertains to those financial instruments held at December 31, 1993.
 
     The Company has entered into arrangements to manage exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. These arrangements primarily include interest
rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of
interest obligations on fixed and floating interest rate debt without the
exchange of the underlying principal amounts. The agreements generally mature at
the time the related debt matures. The differential paid or received on interest
rate swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the
life of the agreements. Notional amounts are used to express the volume of
interest rate swap agreements. The notional amounts do not represent cash flows
and are not subject to risk of loss. In the unlikely event that a counterparty
fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap agreement, the Company's
exposure is limited to the interest rate differential. The fair value of
interest rate swaps (used for hedging purposes) is the estimated amount that the
Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting
date, taking into account current interest rates and current credit-worthiness
of the swap counterparties. At December 31, 1993, the Company had 95 interest
rates swaps, of which 22 swaps were in a net receivable position with a notional
principal amount of $629.9 million and 73 swaps in a net payable position with a
notional principal amount of $1.3 billion. It would cost the Company $43.6
million to terminate the swaps in a net payable position and the Company would
receive $45.3 million to terminate the swaps in a net receivable position.
 
     The Company has issued financial guarantees in support of lines of credit
and lease/sublease transactions entered into by two affiliates of Ford. These
affiliates, located in the United Kingdom and Australia, were previously
subsidiaries of the Company, which retains management responsibility for their
operations. The lines of credit have various expiration dates through 1994, and
the sublease transactions extend through 1994. At December 31, 1993, the
financial guarantees issued totaled $197 million for the United Kingdom, and $61
million for Australia. At December 31, 1993, the outstanding balances subject to
such guarantees were $39 million for the United Kingdom, and $38 million for
Australia. The disclosed amount of the guarantees is a reasonable estimate of
the market value as it represents the cost to satisfy the guarantees. (See Item
1. Business "Management of Foreign Affiliates".)
 
     Additionally, under several of the Company's domestic lease transactions,
it guaranteed under certain conditions that the lessor or lender will receive
additional rents of specified amounts after the original lease terms expire. The
expiration dates are between 1996 and 2001. At December 31, 1993, such
guarantees totaled $17 million. The Company has not provided collateral or other
security to support financial instruments with credit risk.
 
     The Company has also entered into several commitment agreements with third
parties contemplating possible first mortgage loans and equipment leases. The
interest rates on the first mortgage loan commitments average prime or Libor
plus 3.98% and they have various expiration dates through 1998. At December 31,
1993, such commitments totaled approximately $95 million. The disclosed amount
of the commitments is a reasonable estimate of the market value, as all
financing rates are floating until funding.
 
     The Company has entered into a variety of other financial agreements which
contain potential risk of loss. These agreements include interest rate swap
spread contracts and revolving loan commitments. Neither the amounts of these
agreements, fair value, nor the potential risk of loss was considered to be
significant at December 31, 1993.

NOTE 14 -- CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
 
     The Company controls its credit risk through credit standards, limits on
exposure, and monitoring the financial condition of other parties. The lease,
note and investment portfolios are well diversified, consisting of more than 75
industries.
 
     A significant portion of the Company's business activity is with customers
and businesses located in California. As of December 31, 1993, the Company's net
finance and operating leases, notes receivable and investments in California
totaled approximately $700 million. There were no other significant regional,
industrial or group concentrations at December 31, 1993.
 
     The Company generally requires the leased asset to serve as collateral for
the lease. The collateral consists principally of autos, computers and
peripherals, office furnishings, copiers, rail cars and aircraft. Notes
receivable are collateralized by first mortgages on real estate or equipment.
Investments are not collateralized.
 
NOTE 15 -- POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     The Company sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
provide medical and life insurance coverage to retirees and their dependents.
The cost of retiree and dependent medical coverage is shared between the Company
and the retiree. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. The accounting for
the health care plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written plan
that are consistent with the Company's past practice. The Company defines a
maximum amount (or "cap") that it will contribute toward the health benefits of
each retiree. This cap is redetermined annually, and is based on the individual
retiree's number of dependents. The Company has a history of increasing this
cap. Over the last seven years the aggregate increase in the cap approximates
the average increase in the underlying premium costs of the program. This
valuation assumed that in future years the Company will continue to increase the
cap at the average rate of increase of the underlying cost of the retiree
benefit program. However, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified by the
Company from time to time.
 
     The following table sets forth the plans' combined funded status reconciled
with the amount shown in the Company's statement of financial position at
December 31:

        Assumption: Discount rate at year-end.......................   7.5%       8.5%
</TABLE>
 
     For measurement purposes, 12 percent and 8 percent annual rates of increase
in the per capita cost of postretirement medical benefits were assumed for 1993
for the under age 65 indemnity and HMO and over age 65 indemnity plans,
respectively; the rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.5 percent for
2006 and remain at that level thereafter. The comparable rates assumed for 1992
were 14 percent and 9 percent for the under age 65 indemnity and HMO and over
age 65 indemnity plans, respectively. The health care cost trend rate assumption
has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the
assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
1993 by $477,000 and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components
of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by $159,000.

(1) The weighted average interest rate was based on rates and borrowings at the
    end of the period after giving effect to interest rate exchange agreements.
    These agreements, which expire through 2005, had the effect of fixing
    interest rates on $292.1 million of debt at rates ranging from 5.66% to
    9.46%.
 
(2) The average amount outstanding was based on the balances at the beginning of
    the period and each month-end divided by 13.
 
(3) The weighted average interest rate during the period was computed by
    dividing actual interest expense by the average short-term debt outstanding
    during the period and after giving effect to interest rate exchange
    agreements.

         but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation.
         Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of
         directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have
         made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
         indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
         he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said
         law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its
         board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
         that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct,
         shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
         claimant had not met the applicable standard of conduct.

                 (c)      The rights conferred on any person by paragraphs (a)
         and (b) of this Article Nine shall not be exclusive of any other right
         which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
         provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote
         of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

                 (d)      The corporation may maintain insurance, at its
         expense, to protect itself and any such director or officer of the
         corporation or of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
         trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss,
         whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such
         person against such expense, liability or loss under the General
         Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

                 (e)      The corporation may enter into individual agreements
         with its directors, officers, employees and agents, and the directors,
         officers, employees and agents of its subsidiaries, pursuant to which
         agreements the corporation shall indemnify such persons as provided in
         this Article Nine and as not otherwise prohibited by law.  Such
         agreements shall be upon such terms and conditions as the

<PAGE>   16
         board of directors shall approve.

                                  ARTICLE TEN

         A director of this corporation shall not be personally liable to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation

<PAGE>   4
                 (2)      Directors and officers and Governing Documents.  The
         directors and officers of USLI-Delaware shall be the same upon the
         Effective Date as they are immediately prior thereto. The Certificate

         surviving corporation without change or amendment until further
         amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable laws.

                 (3)      Succession.  On the Effective Date, USLI-Delaware

         shall be executed and delivered on behalf of USLI-California such
         deeds and other instruments, and there shall be taken or caused to be
         taken by it such further and other action, as shall be appropriate or
         necessary in order to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or

         property, interests, assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
         franchises and authority of USLI-California, and otherwise to carry
         out the purposes of this Merger Agreement, and the officers and

                 (5)      Common Stock of USLI-California.  Upon the Effective
         Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
         the holder thereof, each share of California common stock outstanding
         immediately prior thereto shall be changed and converted into one
         fully paid and non-assessable share of Delaware common stock.

                 (6)      Stock Certificates.  On and after the Effective Date,
         all of the outstanding certificates which prior to that time
         represented shares of California common stock shall be deemed for all
         purposes to evidence ownership of and to represent the shares of
         Delaware common stock into which the shares of California common stock
         represented by such certificates have been converted as herein
         provided.  The registered owner on the books and records of
         USLI-Delaware or its transfer agent of any such outstanding stock
         certificate shall, until such certificate shall have been surrendered
         for transfer or otherwise accounted for to USLI-Delaware or its
         transfer agent, have and be entitled to exercise any voting

<PAGE>   5
        and other rights with respect to and to receive any dividend and other
        distributions upon the shares of Delaware common stock evidenced by such
        outstanding certificate as above provided.

                 (7)      Options. Forthwith upon the Effective Date, each
         outstanding option to purchase shares of California common stock
         granted under the Stock Option Plans (the "Plans") of USLI-California
         shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of 
         the holder thereof, be converted into and become an option to purchase
         the same number of shares of Delaware common stock at the same option
         price per share as in effect on the Effective Date and upon the same
         terms and subject to the same conditions as set forth in said Plans or
         option agreement.  A number of shares of Delaware common stock shall
         be reserved for purposes of said Plans equal to the number of shares
         of California common stock so reserved as of the Effective Date.  As
         of the Effective Date, USLI-Delaware hereby assumes all obligations of
         USLI-California under said Plans and the outstanding options of
         portions thereof granted pursuant to said Plans.

                 (8)      Other Employee Benefit Plans.  As of the Effective
         Date,  USLI-Delaware hereby assumes all obligations of USLI-California
         under any and all employee benefit plans in effect as of said date or
         with respect to which employee rights or accrued benefits are
         outstanding as of said date.

                 (9)      Indenture. As of the Effective Date, USLI-Delaware
         hereby assumes all obligations of USLI-California under that certain
         Indenture dated as of January 15, 1986 between USLICalifornia and The

         premium, if any) and interest on all securities issued thereunder.

                 (10)     Other Agreements.  As of the Effective Date,
         USLIDelaware hereby assumes all of the obligations of USLI-California
         under all agreements to which USLI-California is a party or by which
         it is bound.

                 (11)     Common Stock of USLI-Delaware.  Forthwith upon the
         Effective Date, the ten (10) shares of Delaware common stock presently
         issued and outstanding in the name of USLI-California shall be
         cancelled and retired and resume the status of authorized and unissued
         shares of Delaware common stock, and no shares of Delaware common
         stock or other securities of USLI-Delaware shall be issued in respect

Securities of such series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below
in this Article Fourteen.

Section 1402.  Defeasance and Discharge.

                 Upon the Corporation's exercise of its option to effect a
defeasance of the Securities of a series pursuant to this Section, the
Corporation shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with
respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on the date the conditions
set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance").  For this purpose,
such defeasance means that the Corporation shall be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of
such series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such
Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the
Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation, shall execute proper instruments
acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until
otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of
Outstanding Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund
described in Section 1404 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments
in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities
when such payments are due, (B) the Corporation's obligations with respect to
such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (C) the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this
Article Fourteen.  Subject to compliance with this Article Fourteen, the
Corporation may exercise its option under this Section 1402 notwithstanding the
prior exercise of its option under Section 1403 with respect to the Securities
of such series.

Section 1403.  Covenant Defeasance.

                 Upon the Corporation's exercise of its option to effect a
covenant defeasance of the Securities of a series pursuant to this Section, the
Corporation shall be released from its obligations under Section 1005 with
respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on and after the date the
conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, covenant defeasance").
For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the
Outstanding Securities of such series, the Corporation may omit to comply with
and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set
forth in any such Section, whether directly or indirectly by reason of any
reference

                 Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal
                 income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
                 thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the

                 result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal
                 income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the

                 of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect
                 to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be
                 continuing on the date of such deposit or at any time during
                 the period ending on the 91st day after the date of such
                 deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be
                 deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).

Section 1405.  Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in
Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

                 Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section
1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds
thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee collectively,
for purposes of this Section 1405, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1404 in
respect of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be held in trust and
applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities
and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent
(including the Corporation acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but such money
need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

                 The Corporation shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against
any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government
Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1404 or the principal and interest
received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which
by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such
series.

                 Anything in this Article Fourteen to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Corporation from time
to time upon Corporation Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held
by it as provided in Section 1404 which, in the opinion of a nationally 
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount
thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent
defeasance or covenant defeasance.

                 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Second
Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed, and their respective corporate
seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first

  Interest Amounts.  Any amount received by the Purchaser pursuant to clause

<PAGE>   5
 applied for the purposes of this Agreement to reduce the Investment as if such
 amount were paid to the Purchaser pursuant to clause seventh above.
