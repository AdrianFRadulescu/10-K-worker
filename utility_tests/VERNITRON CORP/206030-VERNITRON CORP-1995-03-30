                                     PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Vernitron Corporation (the "Company"), incorporated in New York in 1959 and
reincorporated in Delaware in 1968, is primarily engaged in the design,
manufacture, distribution and sale of electromagnetic sub-systems, specialty AC
(alternating current) and DC (direct current) motors, position and pressure
sensing components, connectors, and the distribution and service of precision
ball bearings.  The Company's products are manufactured primarily for use in
high reliability applications in the aerospace, defense, communications, medical
equipment, office equipment and industrial markets.

BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

     The Company operates in three manufacturing plants and three distribution
facilities located in the United States in one business segment,
electromechanical components and sub-systems, which is organized into two
product groups: the Motion Control group and the Industrial Components group.
The Company also uses contract production capacity in Mexico.

     Motion Control group sales accounted for 42% and Industrial Components
group sales made up 58% of consolidated net sales of $62.1 million in 1994 (see
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for three year sales comparisons).

     MOTION CONTROL GROUP.  The Motion Control group designs, manufactures and
sells electromagnetic sub-systems, specialty AC and DC motors, synchros and
resolvers, optical and contact shaft encoders, potentiometers and pressure
transducers.  These product lines produce all of the Company's motor and sensor
products sold either as individual components or in sub-systems.

     The group's products generally involve a high degree of interactive
applications engineering to meet each customer's unique requirements for
reliability and accuracy under demanding and often hostile environmental or
shock conditions, such as space flight or industrial automation.  Unit prices
generally exceed $100 and range upward to more than $1,000.  In the military and
aerospace markets, contract quantities are relatively low while contract awards
may be large in dollar value.  In the commercial market, contract quantities may
be significantly greater while the average sales price is generally lower.
Approximately 65% of current bookings by this group are for military (both U.S.
and foreign government) and aerospace applications.  The remainder of the
business is spread  over a variety of industrial automation and instrumentation
applications.  A large percentage of the military/aerospace business is used in
or to support tactical missile programs, shipboard instruments and infrared
night vision systems.  Markets for the group's products are generally fragmented
and competition is focused and often well entrenched.

     Motors manufactured by the Company are used in applications which require
extremely reliable and precise motion control, such as computer disk drives,
laser scanners in high-speed printers and bar code readers, missile guidance
systems, industrial controls, aircraft instrumentation and controls and
robotics.  Motor technology includes AC and both brush and brushless DC motors.

     Synchros and resolvers are each used to measure absolute angular position.
These rugged devices have military and aerospace applications in the guidance
systems of ships, aircraft and missiles.  In commercial applications, resolvers
are used to measure the absolute position and velocity of a shaft.

     Optical and contact shaft encoders are devices which accurately measure
rotational motion or shaft position in a digital format and have applications in
satellites, weapon systems, radar and industrial control systems.

     The Company's precision potentiometers are variable resistors, utilizing
either wire wound or conductive film technologies.  These products generally
sense position and produce a feedback signal for use in high reliability


                                        2
<PAGE>

military, aerospace and industrial applications.  Other related products include
pressure transducers which, among other applications, monitor pressure in
hydraulic and HVAC applications.

     INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS GROUP.  The Industrial Components group manufactures
connector products and distributes and services precision miniature ball
bearings.

     The group's products are almost always sold as components, require a
minimum amount of specialized application engineering and are sold through a
network of manufacturers' representatives and distributors.  Average unit
selling prices range from $1 to $3 and individual purchase orders generally
cover large unit quantities.  Competition is often fragmented and focused on
niches within the markets served.  Quality, customer service and competitive
cost are the critical factors in serving these markets.  Substantially all of
the Industrial Components group sales are to domestic commercial and industrial
markets.

     The group's connector product line focuses mainly on safety agency approved
barrier terminal blocks in the .5 amp to 50 amp range.  The products are used in
a broad range of power applications, including  telecommunications, power
supplies, security and fire alarms and industrial controls.  The group produces
power connectors for frequent connect/disconnect applications, such as vending
machines and coin changers.

     The group also distributes precision miniature ball bearings from three
warehouse locations - Montville, New Jersey, Irvine, California and Dallas,
Texas - to bearing distributors and to end users in a variety of industries,
including manufacturers of computer equipment, medical equipment and a variety
of other precision instruments.

     MARKETING.  The Company's products are sold directly to original equipment
manufacturers and U.S. Government agencies and contractors, and are also sold
through distributors and representatives.

     DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN SALES.  The following table sets forth, for each of
the last three fiscal years, information concerning the Company's domestic and
foreign net sales and operating income from continuing operations and

</TABLE>

     COMPETITION.  The Company competes primarily on the basis of its ability to
design and engineer its products to meet relatively stringent shape, performance
and other requirements of its customers, most of whom are original equipment
manufacturers who purchase the component parts for inclusion in their end
products.

     There are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the
various types of electromechanical products manufactured and sold by the
Company.  Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than
the Company.  Imports of end products incorporating foreign manufactured
electromechanical components have increased in recent years resulting, in part,
in smaller available domestic markets for the Company's components.


                                        3
<PAGE>

In addition, reductions in Government defense spending have resulted in
shrinking markets and increased competition for the remaining business.

     While price is a competitive factor, the Company believes that its
applications engineering capability, which enables it to meet a customer's
special needs, is its principal competitive strength.

     CUSTOMERS.  There is no customer or group of affiliated customers to which
sales during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994 were in the aggregate 10%
or more of the Company's consolidated net sales, and there is no customer, the
loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations
taken as a whole.

     In fiscal 1994, the Company had aggregate sales, both military and non-
military, of approximately $3.6 million directly to the U.S. Government,
including its agencies and departments.  These sales accounted for approximately
6% of total net sales in 1994 as compared to 5% in 1993 and 7% in 1992.
Approximately 18% of net sales in 1994 were derived from subcontracts with U.S.
Government contractors as compared to 21% in 1993 and 22% in 1992.  The majority
of these contracts may be subject to termination at the convenience of the
Government, and certain of them may also be subject to renegotiation.
Currently, the Company is not aware of any termination or renegotiation of such
contracts which would have a material adverse effect on its business.  Because
approximately 24% of the Company's business is derived directly from contracts
with the U.S. Government or agencies or departments thereof, or indirectly
through subcontracts with U.S. Government contractors, the Company's results of
operations could be materially affected by changes in Government expenditures
for products using component parts it produces.  However, the Company believes
that its exposure to such risk may be lessened by the conventional tactical
nature of the programs it participates in as well as the broad number and
diversity of its product applications and the strength of its engineering
capabilities.

     BACKLOG; SEASONALITY.  As of December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993, the
Company had a backlog of orders of $23.0 million and $24.0 million,
respectively.  Management believes that a substantial portion of the backlog of
orders at December 31, 1994 will be filled during fiscal 1995.  Bookings and
shipments, while subject to fluctuation due to the build-to-order nature of a
substantial portion of the Company's business, are not subject to significant
seasonal variations.

     PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  The Company develops new electromechanical sub-
systems and components and improves existing products in order to keep pace with
the technological advances which generally characterize its markets.  During
fiscal 1994, combined Company and customer sponsored engineering expense
associated with product development, before customer reimbursement, was $695,000
compared to $639,000 in fiscal 1993 and $535,000 in fiscal 1992.  In general,
the Company recovers from customers between a quarter and a third of such
engineering expense.

     RAW MATERIALS; OTHER SUPPLIERS.  There is no one supplier whose delivery of
raw materials or other products is material to the operations of the Company.
While several divisions use substantial amounts of cobalt, chromium, titanium,
gold, silver and copper in certain of their products, the Company has not
experienced any serious difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies.

     PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES.  The Company's business is not dependent
on any patent or trademark.

     ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  The Company does not believe that its
compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment has or will have any material effect upon its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  There can be no
assurance, however, (i) that changes in federal, state or local laws or
regulations, changes in regulatory policy or the discovery of unknown problems
or conditions will not in the future require substantial expenditures, or (ii)
as to the extent of the Company's liabilities, if any, for past failures, if
any, to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits.

     EMPLOYEES.  The Company employs approximately 600 persons, all in the
United States.  Approximately 120 of such employees are subject to union
contracts, before giving effect to the disposition of the Electronic Components
business (see Note 2 to the Financial Statements). Following this disposition,
approximately 70


                                        4
<PAGE>

employees will be covered by union contracts.  The Company considers its
relations with its employees to be satisfactory.  There has been no significant
interruption of operations due to labor disputes.

     WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES.  The markets in which the Company competes are
not characterized by any unusual inventory or collection practices.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The Company leases its executive office, located at 645 Madison Avenue, New
York, New York.  The principal plants and other materially important properties

1994 VS. 1993

     Net sales increased by $3.5 million, or 6%, in 1994, compared to 1993.

     The Motion Control group's sales declined by $.6 million, or 2%, in 1994,
as compared to 1993, primarily as a result of lower shipments of AC motors and
potentiometers due largely to lower U.S. and foreign government bookings and
lower bookings for certain technologically mature product applications.  These
lower shipments were partially offset by higher shipments of resolvers, due to
the timing of certain large orders received in 1993, and higher electromagnetic
sub-system shipments due to new product introductions.

     The Industrial Components group's sales increased in 1994 by $4.1 million,
or 13%, as compared to 1993.  Sales of bearings were up by $2.9 million, or 16%,
reflecting sales to new customers and an improvement in general economic
conditions.  Sales of connector products rose by $1.2 million, or 9%,
principally as a result of sales to new customers in the OEM market, higher
sales of Eurostyle connectors and an improvement in general economic conditions.

     The Company's backlog at December 31, 1994 of $23.0 million was $1.0
million, or 4% lower, than 1993 year-end, while bookings of $61.2 million were
substantially the same as the prior year.  The lower backlog was primarily due
to a reduction of backlog in the Motion Control group of $1.9 million resulting
from lower bookings in resolvers, primarily due to timing as several large
orders received in 1993 did not repeat in 1994, and potentiometers, primarily
due to lower U.S. Government and foreign bookings.  These lower bookings were
partially offset by higher bookings of electromagnetic sub-systems due to new
product introductions.  The Industrial Components group's backlog increased $1.0
million due primarily to increased bookings in the bearings product line
resulting from an improvement in general economic conditions.

     Operating income, excluding restructuring/inventory writedown charges of
$1.3 million and $3.5 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively, was $3.7 million
in 1994, as compared to $2.2 million in 1993, representing a $1.5 million
increase.  This increase was primarily due to the gross margin earned on the
incremental sales volume and improved profit margins in the Motion Control
product group resulting from restructuring actions taken in 1993, which were
partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.  Gross
margins were 27.7% in 1994, up from 26.1% in 1993.  Productivity, as measured by
the value-added per employee, increased 24.9% to approximately $65,900 in 1994,
from approximately $52,800 in 1993.

     Selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales,
declined to 21.5% in 1994 from 22.1% in 1993.  Selling, general and
administrative expense was up by $.4 million in 1994 as a result of increased
expenses related to the relocation of Motion Control's potentiometer and
pressure transducer product lines from the Company's Deer Park, New York
facility to St. Petersburg, Florida and the reinstatement of certain profit
sharing provisions.


                                        8
<PAGE>

These incremental costs were partially offset by efficiencies resulting from the
aforementioned Motion Control restructuring initiated in 1993.

     In 1993, the Company recorded a $3.5 million charge related to the
restructuring of the Motion Control group, of which $2.3 million was related to
the write-down of certain slow-moving and excess raw material inventory (see
discussion of 1993 vs. 1992 below).  As part of this restructuring, the Company
also announced its intention to close and sell the Deer Park, New York facility.
In 1994, the Company recorded an additional $1.3 million charge related to this
restructuring, $1.0 million of which is to provide additional inventory reserves
to reflect slower turnover of the inventory than was anticipated in the 1993
charge calculation.  The remaining $.3 million of the 1994 charge is to adjust
the carrying amount of the other assets held for disposal in connection with the
restructuring to reflect current market values.

     Interest expense declined by $.2 million in 1994 as a result of lower
average borrowings due primarily to the repurchase of the Company's bank
indebtedness at a discount (see Note 4 to the Financial Statements).  This was
partially offset by higher interest rates.

     At December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately $11 million of net
operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income.

1993 VS. 1992

     Net sales declined by $4.3 million, or 7%, in 1993, compared to 1992.

     The Motion Control group's sales accounted for $5.4 million of this
decline, primarily due to lower U.S. and foreign military sales in 1993 and to
the completion of deliveries for certain commercial equipment and space programs
in 1992.

     Industrial Components group sales increased by $1.1 million, a 4% increase,
compared to 1992.  Sales of connector products rose by 7% as the result of
increased market penetration and the introduction of the Eurostyle connector.
Sales of bearings were up 1%, reflecting some pickup in general economic
activity.

     The Company's total bookings increased approximately 3% in 1993 over 1992,
while backlog at December 31, 1993 was approximately 13% higher compared to
year-end 1992.  Motion Control group bookings were up approximately 3% in 1993
over 1992, primarily as a result of increased bookings of military products.
Bookings for the Motion Control group's sensor products (comprised of
potentiometers, encoders, resolvers and synchros), which declined in 1992,
increased slightly in 1993 over their 1992 level.  Backlog for the Motion
Control group at December 31, 1993 was up by approximately $.7 million compared
to backlog at December 31, 1992.  Industrial Components group bookings increased
by approximately 4% in 1993 compared to 1992 due primarily to the introduction
of the Eurostyle connector.  Backlog for the Industrial Components group
increased by approximately $1.3 million at December 31, 1993, compared to
backlog at December 31, 1992.

     Operating income of $2.2 million, excluding the $3.5 million
restructuring/inventory writedown charge described below, was $.6 million above
1992.  Cost reductions and productivity improvements achieved through reduced
headcount and improved operating efficiencies in the Motion Control group and
the connector product line of the Industrial Components group and lower selling,
general and administrative expense (see below) more than offset the negative
impact on operating income of the lower sales volume in the Motion Control
group.  Gross margins were 26.1% in 1993, up from 25.2% in 1992.  Productivity,
as measured by the value-added per employee, increased 13.5% to approximately
$52,800 in 1993 from approximately $46,500 in 1992.

     Selling, general and administrative expense was $1.1 million lower in 1993
primarily as a result of staff reductions and elimination of profit sharing
provisions due to lower earnings.

     During 1993, the company determined to restructure its Motion Control
group, which had operated as two separate divisions.  The restructuring provided
for the consolidation of the two separate divisions under a single operating
management based in San Diego, California.  The Company also determined to
increase its reserves for slow moving and excess inventories in the Motion
Control group.  The Company determined to consolidate the two divisions because
it believed that the combination would allow the use of more productive, higher
quality


                                        9
<PAGE>

manufacturing techniques in San Diego.  In addition, the Company believed that
the consolidation in San Diego would substantially increase the interaction of
the Motion Control group's various engineering disciplines in response to
commercial and industrial requirements.  The Company determined to increase its
reserves for slow moving and excess inventory in the Motion Control group to
reflect its determination of a permanent reduction in the demand for certain
wire wound potentiometer product lines based on the Company's belief that demand
for such products, which had declined in prior years, was not likely to return
in sufficient amounts.  The reduced demand for such products contributed to the
decision to consolidate the Motion Control group in San Diego and the other
steps taken as part of the restructuring.

     The Company recorded a charge of $3.5 million related to the restructuring
of its Motion Control group.  The charge included $2.3 millon for the write-down
of slow moving and excess raw material and finished good inventories of wire
wound potentiometers.  In addition, $1.2 million was recorded for severance,
early retirement, other employee-related benefits and other costs of the
restructuring.  Of the $1.2 million accrued in 1993, approximately $250,000 and
$850,000 were charged against such accrual in 1993 and 1994, respectively.  It
is expected that the balance will be charged against the accrual in 1995 (see
Note 8 to the Financial Statements).

     In connection with the restructuring, major cost reduction programs were
initiated.  The plan included reducing the group's workforce by more than 15%,
mostly in non-production positions, and the consolidation of engineering staff
and design facilities.  The Company expects that the reduction in workforce will
result in lower labor costs and, together with other reductions in costs
resulting from the consolidation, should increase the Company's competitiveness.

     Interest expense declined by $.2 million in 1993 as a result of both lower
average borrowings and lower interest rates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     During 1994, the Company obtained a new $15.0 million four-year, senior
secured credit facility (see Note 4 to the Financial Statements).  In addition,
the Company completed a rights offering of Common Stock which provided $2.3
million of proceeds, net of expenses (see Note 3 to the Financial Statements).
The proceeds of the new credit facility, along with the net proceeds of the
rights offering, were used to repurchase the Company's then existing bank
indebtedness at a discount and to provide additional working capital.
Subsequent to December 31, 1994, the Company negotiated an amendment to its new
credit facility increasing the amount that can be borrowed under the facility to
$17.5 million, subject to availability based on the satisfaction of certain
borrowing base formulas.

     During 1994, the Company received proceeds of $.6 million from the sale of
certain product lines of the discontinued Electronic Components business.
Subsequent to December 31, 1994, the Company has sold the remaining product line
of this business for $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million has been collected as
of February 24, 1995.  The remaining $.5 million is scheduled to be collected in
the first half of 1995.  The proceeds from these sales will be used to fund
expenses related to the decision to discontinue the Electronic Components group,
to pay down bank indebtedness and to provide additional working capital.

     The Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of
December 31, 1994.

     The Company believes that its $17.5 million credit facility, cash generated
from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets included in net assets held
for disposal, will be sufficient to meet its future capital expenditure and
working capital requirements and required debt amortization.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





To the Board of Directors of
Vernitron Corporation:


     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Vernitron Corporation (a
Delaware corporation) as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the three
years ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements and the schedule
referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Vernitron Corporation as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the three years ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

     Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in the index of
financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
states in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)


NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Inventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first-in, first-
out, or specific identification) or market.

     Deferred financing costs are amortized ratably over the life of the
corresponding debt or commitment.

     The excess of cost over net assets acquired is being amortized over thirty-
five years using the straight-line method.

     Depreciation and amortization are provided primarily by the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, which
are stated at cost, except as otherwise indicated in Note 2.

     Other assets held for disposal are stated at the lower of cost or estimated
net realizable value (see Note 8).

     Inter-division items and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

     Certain items in the 1993 and 1992 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

     Per share data is based upon the weighted average of common shares
outstanding during each period.  Outstanding common stock options or warrants
have not been included in the 1994, 1993 or 1992 computation of per share data
as they were deemed to have been anti-dilutive.

NOTE 2 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     Effective September 30, 1994, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of all
of its Electronic Components business which was comprised of the trimmer,
transformer and microwave component product lines.  The disposal is being
accounted for as a discontinued operation and, accordingly, the related net
assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing
operations.  The Company's prior year's Statements of Operations have been
restated to reflect continuing operations.  The loss on disposal of the
Electronic Components business for the year ended December 31, 1994 is comprised
of the estimated loss on disposal of the net assets of the business and a
provision for anticipated operating losses until disposal.

     During 1994, the Company sold a portion of the assets of its Electronic
Components business for gross proceeds of $605.  Subsequent to December 31,
1994, the Company has sold the remaining discontinued business' assets for
$1,500, of which $1,000 has been collected as of February 24, 1995.  The
remaining $500 is scheduled to be collected in the first half of 1995.

The loss from operations of the discontinued Electronic Components business from
September 30, 1994 to December 31, 1994, which is included in the loss on
disposal, was $326, net of a tax benefit of $209.

NOTE 3 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

COMMON STOCK -


     On July 20, 1994, the Company completed a rights offering of Common Stock
in which 7,352,942 shares were issued for gross proceeds of $2,500 ($2,332, net
of expenses).  As a result of the completion of the rights offering, the total
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 1994 is
12,538,012.

PREFERRED STOCK -

     The certificate of designation (as amended in 1991) setting forth the
amended terms of the Company's $1.20 (formerly $3.75) Cumulative Exchangeable
Redeemable Preferred Stock provides for, among other things, (1) a liquidation
preference of $8 per share, (2) an annual dividend of $1.20 per share, and (3)
the ability to pay dividends thereon in additional shares instead of cash up to
March 1, 1996.  The Company's Senior Credit Facility, however, prohibits the
payment of cash dividends (see Note 4).  The Company at its option may redeem
the Preferred Stock at a price of $8.00 per share or an amount per share equal
to the product of 1.1 and the average of the NASDAQ daily closing prices per
share (defined in general to be the average of the highest reported bid and the
lowest reported asked prices) for ten consecutive trading days, as defined,
together with all accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

     Since August, 1991, the Company has paid quarterly dividends on the
Preferred Stock in additional shares at an annual rate of 15% based on the
shares outstanding.

</TABLE>

     On July 20, 1994, the Company obtained a new $15,000 four-year, senior
secured credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"). The proceeds of the
Senior Credit Facility along with the net proceeds of the rights offering (see
Note 3) were used to repurchase the Company's bank indebtedness at a discount
and to provide additional working capital.  As a result of the repurchase of
indebtedness, an extraordinary gain of $5,856, net of a charge in lieu of taxes
of $3,744, was recorded.

     Subsequent to December 31, 1994, the Company negotiated an amendment to the
Senior Credit Facility increasing the amount that can be borrowed under the
facility to $17,500, subject to availability based on the satisfaction of
certain borrowing base formulas.  Had this amendment been effective as of
December 31, 1994, $15,800 of the $17,500 credit facility would have been
available to the Company.

     Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating
rate per annum equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Chemical Bank
as its prime rate plus 2.5% (the prime rate was 8.5% at December 31, 1994).  A
commitment fee of .5% is payable on any unused amount of the Senior Credit
Facility.  The Senior Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants
which, among other things, impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of
additional liens, mergers, consolidations and specified sale of assets.  In
addition, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of
the assets of the Company.

     The Company had outstanding at December 31, 1993, industrial development
revenue bonds (the "Bonds") in the amount of $1,870 secured by its Gilford, NH
manufacturing facility which has a net carrying amount of approximately $2,400.
The bonds are payable in 2005.  During 1994, the bonds were remarketed and, as a
result, a letter of credit securing repayment was released and the interest rate
was converted from a floating rate to a fixed rate of 13% per annum.

     Scheduled debt maturities during the next five years, which are comprised
solely of payment under the Company's Senior Credit Facility (as amended) are
$442 (1995), $589 (1996), $589 (1997) and $8,873 (1998).

NOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES

     At December 31, 1994, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $11,250 which expire in the years 2005 through 2008 and
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $320.  In
addition, the Company has approximately $8,200 of previously unrecognized tax
benefits, principally related to inventories.  As the portion of the loss
carryforwards and deferred tax benefits originating prior to the 1991 quasi-
reorganization are realized, the corresponding tax effect will be credited to
Capital in Excess of Par under quasi-reorganization accounting principles rather
than reducing the Provision for Taxes.  In 1994, $2,182 was credited to Capital
in Excess of Par representing the utilization of such pre quasi-reorganization
tax benefits to offset current year tax expense related to both continuing and
discontinued operations as well as the extraordinary gain.  As of December 31,
1994, $5,008 of the pre quasi-reorganization tax effected benefits remain
unutilized.  The utilization and realization of the carryforwards and future tax
benefits will substantially reduce or eliminate the amount of cash taxes payable
on taxable income in the future.

     The Company utilizes the liability method (SFAS No. 109) in accounting for
income taxes.  Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes is from
domestic sources only for the three years ended December 31, 1994.

     The provision for taxes on income from continuing operations consists of:

NOTE 7 - PENSION ARRANGEMENTS

     The Company terminated its noncontributory defined benefit plan covering
substantially all employees not subject to a collective bargaining agreement in
1992.  Included in the determination of 1992 pension expense is a curtailment
loss of $16 relating to this plan.  The Company has two other plans for which
benefits and participation have been frozen.  Pension benefits under these plans
are generally based upon years of service and compensation.

     The Company's funding policy is to contribute amounts to the plan
sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the
Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time.

     Multi-employer plans covering certain union members generally provided
benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.  During 1994, in connection
with the restructuring of the Motion Control group (see Note 8), the employment
of the union members participating in these multi-employer plans ended and, as a
result, contributions to these plans ceased.  As of December 31, 1994, there
were no unpaid contributions to multi-employer plans.

     A summary of components of net periodic pension cost for the defined
benefit plans and the total contribution charged to pension expense for the
multi-employer plans follows:

</TABLE>

     Unrecognized net gains and losses are amortized over the average future
service lives of participants.  Plan assets are primarily invested in fixed
income instruments.

     Under the Company's 401(k) plan, eligible employees may elect to contribute
a percentage of their earnings which the Company has matched up to 3% of gross
earnings based on the level of consolidated income.  Company matching
contributions were $363 in 1994 and $423 in 1992. The Company made no matching
contribution in 1993.

NOTE 8 - OTHER INFORMATION

RESTRUCTURING PLAN -

     During 1993, the Company announced its plan to restructure its Motion
Control group.  The motion control business had been organized as two separate
divisions.  The plan consolidated the two divisions under a single operating
management based in San Diego.

     In connection with the restructuring, the Company recorded a charge of
$3,500.  The charge included $2,300 for the write-down of slow moving and excess
inventory to net realizable value.  In addition, $1,200 was recorded for
severance, early retirement, other employee-related benefits and other related
charges.  As part of the restructuring, the Company has closed and is in the
process of selling the Deer Park, New York facility.

     During 1994, the Company recorded an additional $1,315 charge related to
this restructuring, $1,015 of which is to provide additional inventory reserves
to reflect slower turnover of the inventory than was anticipated in the 1993
charge calculation.  The remaining $300 of the 1994 charge is to adjust the
carrying amount of other assets held for disposal in connection with the
restructuring to reflect current market values.

     Rent expense under such leases, net of sublease rental income, amounted to
$1,379 in 1994, $1,348 in 1993 and  $1,308 in 1992.

     In February 1990, the Company sold and leased back its San Diego,
California facility under an operating lease.  The Company has a deferred gain
as of December 31, 1994 on this transaction of $651, which is being amortized to
income over the ten year lease term as a reduction of annual rent expense.

     The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, none of which is expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results
of operations.

THE CIT GROUP/CREDIT FINANCE, INC.
135 West 50th Street
New York, New York 10020

                     Re:  AMENDMENT TO FINANCING AGREEMENTS

Gentlemen:

     Reference is made to certain financing arrangements heretofore entered into
between VERNITRON CORPORATION ("Borrower") and THE CIT GROUP/CREDIT FINANCE,
INC. ("Lender") pursuant to certain financing agreements, including, but not
limited to, the Loan and Security Agreement dated July 20, 1994 entered into
between Borrower and Lender (the "Loan Agreement"), the $2,451,000 Promissory
Note dated July 20, 1994 (the "Note") and related agreements, documents,
instruments, notes, mortgages and guaranties creating or evidencing indebtedness
or granting collateral security therefor, executed and delivered in connection
therewith (all of the foregoing, as the same may now exist or may hereafter be
amended, modified, supplemented, renewed, extended or replaced are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Financing Agreements").  All capitalized terms
used herein which are not otherwise defined herein, shall have the respective
meaning ascribed to such terms as set forth in the Loan Agreement.

     Borrower has requested that Lender make additional loans available to
Borrower and modify and amend certain provisions of the Financing Agreements,
and Lender is willing to do so subject to the terms and conditions of this
Letter Re: Amendment to Financing Agreements (the "Amendment").

     In consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

          1.   (a)  Contemporaneously herewith, Lender is making an additional
advance to Borrower in the original principal amount of $837,050.62 (the
"Additional Term Loan").  The Additional Term Loan shall be consolidated with
the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan (collectively, the "Term
Loan") which Term Loan shall be evidenced by that certain Promissory Note dated
of even date herewith in the original principal amount of $2,701,334 executed
and delivered by Borrower in favor of Lender (the "Note").  All references to
the "Term Loan" or "Note" (as each said quoted term is defined in the Loan
Agreement) shall be deemed amended to mean the Term Loan or Note, respectively,
as defined in this paragraph 1.
<PAGE>

               (b)  Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the
Note to Lender, Lender is delivering to Borrower the original Promissory Note
dated July 20, 1994 by Borrower in favor of Lender in the original principal
amount of $2,451,000, marked "Amended and Restated and Replaced by Promissory
Note dated March 17, 1995 in the original principal amount of $2,701,334".

          2.   (a)  As a one time financial accommodation to the Borrower,
Lender has agreed to make a supplemental advance to Borrower in respect of
Eligible WIP Inventory.  As of the date hereof, after giving effect to such
advance, the outstanding principal amount of the WIP Advance, as defined in
Section 2.1(e)(ii) of the Loan Agreement, is $825,000.

               (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 2.1(e)(ii) of the Loan Agreement, (i) the WIP Advance shall be repaid in
forty-eight (48) consecutive monthly installments, on the first (1st) day of
each month, commencing April 1, 1995, of which the first forty-seven (47)
installments shall each be in the amount of $17,187.50 and the last and forty-
eighth (48th) installment shall be in the amount of the then unpaid outstanding
balance of the WIP Advance; and (ii) if for any fiscal quarter (i.e., at March
31, June 30, September 30 or December 31 of any year) commencing with Borrower's
fiscal quarter ending March 31, 1995, the Borrower's net loss before
extraordinary items, and excluding any loss arising from the sale of Borrower's
owned real estate located in Deer Park, New York and St. Petersburg, Florida,
determined in accordance with GAAP, and as reported on Borrower's quarterly or
annual financial statements, as the case may be, provided for under Section
6.1(c) of the Loan Agreement ("Quarterly Net Loss") exceeds $250,000, then, from
and after the last day of such fiscal quarter, the monthly installments payable
in respect of the WIP Advance shall be in the amount of $22,916.67 until the
repayment in full of the WIP Advance; EXCEPT THAT, if, for any subsequent fiscal
quarter following any fiscal quarter in which the Quarterly Net Loss exceeds
$250,000, Borrower reports net income before extraordinary items, excluding any
loss arising from the sale of Borrower's owned real estate located in Deer Park,
New York and St. Petersburg, Florida, determined in accordance with GAAP, in
excess of $500,000, then, commencing with the immediately following month, the
monthly installments payable in respect of the WIP Advance shall be in the
amount of $17,187.50 until the WIP Advance is paid in full, PROVIDED HOWEVER,
that if during any subsequent fiscal quarter the Borrower's Quarterly Net Loss
again exceeds $250,000 then the monthly installments payable thereafter shall be
in the increased amount of $22,916.67 as set forth above in this paragraph
2(b)(ii), subject to further reduction to $17,187.50 and to further increase to
$22,916.67 in accordance with the terms hereof.

               (c)  In addition to, and not in limitation of, the foregoing,
Borrower shall make mandatory prepayments against the outstanding principal
balance of the WIP


                                       -2-
<PAGE>

Advance in an amount equal to the amount by which the value at cost of Eligible
WIP Inventory (as determined by Lender in its sole discretion) is less than
$2,000,000.  Such mandatory prepayments shall be made at such times and from
time to time as Lender determines that the value, at cost, of Eligible WIP
Inventory is less than $2,000,000.  All payments required to be paid hereunder
may, at Lender's option, be charged to any account(s) of Borrower maintained
with Lender.

          3.   Section 3.1(b) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and
replaced in its entirety as follows:

               "(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if (i) as of any Interest Adjustment Date (as defined below), the outstanding
amount of loans by Lender to Borrower:  (1) against Borrower's real property
located in St. Petersburg, Florida as provided in Section 10.2(a)(i) hereof does
not exceed 50% of the quick-sale value thereof, as determined by Lender in its
sole discretion, AND (2) against Borrower's Equipment, as provided for in
Section 10.2(a)(iii) hereof does not exceed 80% of the auction value of such
Equipment, as determined by Lender in its sole discretion, AND (3) against
Borrower's inventory does not exceed 75% of the orderly liquidation value
thereof, as determined by Lender in Lender's sole discretion, AND (4) against
Borrower's AST Bearings and Beau Interconnect Accounts, as determined by Lender
in its sole discretion, does not exceed 85% of the value thereof, AND (5)
against Borrower's Motion Control Accounts, as determined by Lender in its sole
discretion, does not exceed 83% of the value thereof AND (6) against Borrower's
Precision Components Accounts, as determined by Lender in its sole discretion,
does not exceed 79% of the value thereof, then from and after the Interest
Adjustment Date and so long as all such advance rate limitations described above
continue to be met, the Interest Rate as provided under Section 3.1 (a) and
Section 10.4(a) then in effect (after giving effect to any adjustment as
provided for under Section 2.1(g) hereof) shall be reduced by one-quarter of one
(.25%) percent per annum; and (ii) as of any Interest Adjustment Date, if (x)
all advance rate limitations under Section 3.1(b)(i) are met AND (y) the
Borrower's Cash Flow (as defined below), calculated quarterly on a cumulative
basis, is positive, then, from and after the Interest Adjustment Date and so
long as all such advance rate limitations under Section 3.1(b)(i) continue to be
met, THEN, the Interest Rate as provided under Section 3.1(a) and Section
10.4(a) then in effect (after giving effect to any adjustments as provided for
under Section 2.1(g) hereof) shall be reduced, in addition to the reduction as
set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i) hereof, by an additional one-quarter of one
(.25%) percent per annum."

          4.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9.2
of the Loan Agreement, if Lender terminates the Loan Agreement upon or after the
occurrence of an Event of Default, or if Borrower shall terminate the Loan
Agreement as


                                       -3-
<PAGE>

permitted therein effective prior to the end of the then-current Term for any
reason other than an Acquisition Financing Termination Event (as defined below),
in addition to all other Obligations, Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon the
effective date of termination, in view of the impracticality and extreme
difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties
as to a reasonable calculation of Lender's lost profits, an early termination
fee equal to (a) three (3%) percent of the Maximum Credit if such termination
occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of this Amendment, (b) two (2%)
percent of the Maximum Credit if such termination occurs after the first
anniversary and on or before the second anniversary of this Amendment, (c) one
(1%) percent of the Maximum Credit if such termination occurs after the second
anniversary of this Amendment.  In the event the Borrower terminates the Loan
Agreement in accordance with Section 9 in connection with an Acquisition
Financing Termination Event, Borrower shall pay to Lender the early termination
fee as set forth in Section 9.2 of the Loan Agreement.

          For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Financing Termination Event" shall
mean a termination by Borrower of the then existing financing arrangements
between Lender and Borrower resulting from Lender's inability or unwillingness
to provide, upon terms reasonably acceptable to Borrower, financing for the
purchase by Borrower of all or substantially all of the capital stock and/or
assets of another entity, including, in connection with the financing of such
purchase, the continuation, amendment or refinancing, upon terms reasonably
acceptable to Borrower, of the then existing financing arrangements between
Lender and Borrower.

          5.   Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of the Loan Agreement are hereby amended
and replaced in their entirety as follows:

   "10.1  (a)  Maximum Credit:                                      $17,500,000

                         31, 1995, exceeds $250,000 (whether the same occurs
                         prior to or subsequent to any fiscal quarter in which
                         Borrower reports, in any fiscal quarter, quarterly net
                         income before extraordinary items, excluding any loss
                         arising from the sale of Borrower's owned real estate
                         located in Deer Park, New York and St. Petersburg,
                         Florida (determined in accordance with GAAP) in excess
                         of $500,000) the AST Bearings and Beau Interconnect

                         succeeding month by .25%, FURTHER PROVIDED, however,
                         that in no event shall the AST Bearings and Beau
                         Interconnect Eligible Accounts Percentage be thereby
                         reduced below 85%.  In the event that, AFTER a fiscal

                         such fiscal quarter quarterly net income prior to
                         extraordinary items, excluding any loss arising from
                         the sale of Borrower's owned real estate located in
                         Deer Park, New York and St. Petersburg, Florida
                         (determined in accordance with GAAP) exceeding
                         $500,000, unless and until Borrower's Quarterly Net
                         Loss in any succeeding fiscal quarter exceeds $250,000,

                         value of AST Bearings and Beau Interconnect Accounts,
