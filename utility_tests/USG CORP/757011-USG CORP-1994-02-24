PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

(A)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

     United States Gypsum Company ("U.S. GYPSUM") was incorporated in 1901.  USG
Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, called "USG" or the "CORPORATION")
was incorporated in Delaware on October 22, 1984.  By a vote of stockholders at
a special meeting on December 19, 1984, U.S. Gypsum became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation and the stockholders of U.S. Gypsum became the
stockholders of the Corporation, all effective January 1, 1985.

     In July 1988, the Corporation consummated a plan of recapitalization (the
"1988 RECAPITALIZATION") in part in response to an unsolicited takeover attempt.
Approximately $2.5 billion in new debt was incurred by the Corporation to
finance the 1988 Recapitalization, pay related costs and repay certain debt
existing at that time.  The 1988 Recapitalization immediately changed the
Corporation's capital structure to one that was highly leveraged.  At the time
of the 1988 Recapitalization, the Corporation projected that it would have
sufficient cash flows to meet its debt service obligations in a timely manner.
However, the Corporation was adversely affected by a cyclical downturn in its
construction-based markets which resulted in the Corporation's inability to
achieve projected operating results and service certain debt obligations in a
timely manner.

     On May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed a comprehensive restructuring of
its debt (the "RESTRUCTURING") through implementation of a "prepackaged" plan of
reorganization (the "PREPACKAGED PLAN").  The provisions of the Prepackaged Plan
were agreed upon in principle with all committees and certain institutions
representing debt subject to the Restructuring in January 1993.  The
Corporation's Registration Statement (Registration No. 33-40136), which included
a Disclosure Statement and Proxy Statement - Prospectus, was declared effective
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in February 1993.  The
solicitation process for approvals of the Prepackaged Plan was completed on
March 15, 1993.  The Corporation commenced a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy
case in Delaware (IN RE: USG CORPORATION, Case No. 93-300) on March 17, 1993 and
received the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan on
April 23, 1993.  None of the subsidiaries of the Corporation were part of this
proceeding and there was no impact on trade creditors of the Corporation's
subsidiaries.  Under the Prepackaged Plan, all previously existing defaults on
debt obligations were waived or cured.  The Corporation accounted for the
Restructuring using the principles of fresh start accounting as required by
AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code".  Pursuant to such principles,
individual assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair market value and
reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets ("EXCESS REORGANIZATION
VALUE") was established.  Post-bankruptcy accounting rules require separate
reporting of financial results for the restructured company and the predecessor
company.  As such, the Corporation's financial statements effective May 7, 1993
are presented under "Restructured Company" in Part II, Item 8.  "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data," while financial statements for periods prior
to that date are presented under "Predecessor Company."  Due to the
Restructuring and implementation of fresh start accounting, financial statements
for the Restructured Company are not comparable to those for the Predecessor
Company. However, in order to facilitate a meaningful comparison of the
Corporation's operating performance, certain 1993 financial information is
presented in the following Part I narratives on an annual basis.  See Part II,
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Predecessor Company -
Notes to Financial Statements -  Financial Restructuring and Fresh Start
Accounting" notes for additional information on the Restructuring and
implementation of fresh start accounting.

     On January 7, 1994, the Corporation filed a Registration Statement
(Registration No. 33-51845), as amended on February 16, 1994, pertaining to its
planned public offering of 6,000,000 new shares of its common stock ("COMMON
STOCK") to be sold by the Corporation (the "OFFERING") and 4,000,000 shares of

(C)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

     Through its subsidiaries, USG is a leading manufacturer of building
materials in North America which produces a wide range of products for use in
residential and nonresidential construction, repair and remodeling, as well as
products used in certain industrial processes. U.S. Gypsum is the largest
producer of gypsum wallboard in the United States and accounted for
approximately one-third of total domestic gypsum wallboard sales in 1993. USG
Interiors, Inc. ("USG INTERIORS") is a leading supplier of interior ceiling,
wall and floor products used primarily in commercial applications. In 1993, USG
Interiors was the largest producer of ceiling grid and the second largest
producer of ceiling tile in the United States, accounting for over one-half and
approximately one-third of total domestic sales of such products, respectively.
L&W Supply Corporation ("L&W SUPPLY") is the largest distributor of wallboard
and related products in the United States and in 1993 distributed approximately
22% of U.S. Gypsum's wallboard production. In addition to its United States
operations, the Corporation's 76% owned subsidiary, CGC Inc. ("CGC"), is the
largest manufacturer of gypsum products in Eastern Canada and the Corporation's
USG International, Ltd. ("USG INTERNATIONAL") unit supplies interior systems and
gypsum wallboard products in the Pacific, Europe and Latin America. In the year
ended December 31, 1993, the Corporation had net sales of $1,916 million and
generated EBITDA of $218 million.


U.S. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

     USG's consolidated financial performance is largely influenced by changes
in the three major components of the construction industry in the United States:
new residential construction, new nonresidential construction, and repair and
remodel activity. In recent years, structural changes in residential
construction activity combined with growth in the repair and remodel component
have partially mitigated the impact of the cyclical demand of the overall new
construction components.

NEW RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION

     Demand for the Corporation's products has historically been influenced
primarily by new residential (single and multi-family homes) and nonresidential
(offices, schools, stores, and other institutions) construction. Construction
activity is directly influenced by a variety of economic variables. In the short
term, the new residential segment is characterized by fluctuating activity
levels as builders and buyers respond to changes in funding costs, new home
prices, and the availability of new construction financing. Over the medium to
long term, new residential construction activity reflects the demand generated
by household formations, the home ownership rate, removals of housing stock, and
the growth of personal income.

     Although new residential construction remains the largest single source of
demand for gypsum wallboard in the United States, it has declined significantly
as a percentage of gypsum wallboard demand since 1986 (a year in which total
gypsum wallboard shipments were comparable to 1993 levels). Residential
construction has a nominal impact on demand for Interiors Systems products. The
following table sets forth demand for gypsum wallboard in the United States by
end-use segment as estimated by U.S. Gypsum based on publicly available data,
internal surveys and data from the Gypsum Association, an industry trade group.
Management estimates that the distribution of U.S. Gypsum's sales volume to
these four end-use segments is generally proportional to industry demand.

</TABLE>

     Over recent economic cycles, demand for gypsum wallboard has been favorably
impacted by a shift toward more single family housing within the new residential
construction segment and an increase in the average single family home size. New
single family homes, which typically require twice as much wallboard as
multi-family homes, accounted for 87% of total housing starts in 1993, as
compared to 65% in 1986. Additionally, the size of the average single family
home in the United States increased approximately 15% to 2,095 square feet in
1992 from 1,825 square feet in 1986. Largely as a result of these factors,
United States industry shipments of gypsum wallboard were a record 21.6 billion
square feet in 1993, as compared to 21.3 billion in 1986, despite an approximate
28% decline in the number of housing  starts from 1.8 million units in 1986 to
1.3 million units in 1993, as depicted in the following chart.

     Nonresidential construction responds less quickly to changes in interest
rates than residential construction because long-term financing is normally
arranged in advance of the commencement of major building projects. In the
longer term, nonresidential construction activity levels are also affected by
the general rate of economic growth, the rate of new job formation and
population shifts. Continued weakness in the nonresidential construction segment
has negatively impacted demand for the products manufactured by both U.S. Gypsum
and USG Interiors. Demand for USG Interiors' products is particularly dependent
on new nonresidential construction activity. Management estimates that
approximately one-half of USG Interiors' 1993 sales were in the new
nonresidential construction segment as compared to approximately two-thirds in
1986. In recent years, nonresidential construction demand has accounted for
approximately 10% of gypsum wallboard industry demand in the United States.


REPAIR AND REMODEL

     Based on data published by the U.S. Bureau of The Census, the size of the
total residential repair and remodel market grew to $104 billion in 1992 from
$91 billion in 1986 and $46 billion in 1980. Although data on nonresidential
repair and remodel activity is not readily available, management believes that
this segment grew significantly during the 1980s. The growth of the repair and
remodel market is primarily due to the aging of housing stock, remodeling of
existing buildings and tenant turnover in commercial space. The median age of
housing stock was 27 years in 1990, and the National Association of Homebuilders
forecasts that the median age will increase to 32 years by 2000. Management
believes that the continued aging of housing stock will contribute to further
growth in the repair and remodel segment. In addition, management believes that
the increase in the number of commercial buildings over the last decade will
provide a greater base for nonresidential repair and remodel activity in the
future, as building owners or tenants replace ceiling, wall and floor systems as
part of the tenant turnover process. Demand in the repair and remodel component
tends to be more stable than in new construction,  although it does fluctuate
somewhat in response to general economic conditions.



                                        7

<PAGE>

     Management estimates that repair and remodel demand for gypsum wallboard
has increased more than 22% since 1986 and, in 1993, accounted for 36% of total
demand for gypsum wallboard in the United States. Management estimates that
approximately one-half of USG Interiors' 1993 sales were to the nonresidential
repair and remodel segment.


GYPSUM PRODUCTS

BUSINESS

     The Gypsum Products segment consists primarily of the gypsum operations of
U.S. Gypsum in the United States, CGC in Canada and USG International in Mexico.


     CGC is the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in Eastern Canada.
Management estimates that industry sales in Eastern Canada, including the
Toronto and Montreal metropolitan areas, represent approximately two-thirds of
total Canadian sales volume. In 1993, CGC accounted for approximately 45% of
industry sales in Eastern Canada.


PRODUCTS

     The Gypsum Products segment manufactures and markets building and
industrial products used in a variety of applications. Gypsum panel products are
used to finish the interior walls and ceilings in residential, commercial and
mobile home construction. These products provide aesthetic as well as sound and
fire retarding value. The majority of these products are sold under the
"SHEETROCK" brand name. Also sold under the "SHEETROCK" brand name is a line of
joint compounds used for finishing wallboard joints. The "DUROCK" line of cement
board and accessories is produced to provide fire-resistant and water damage
resistant assemblies for both interior and exterior construction. The
Corporation also produces a variety of plaster products used to provide a custom
finish for residential and commercial interiors. Like "SHEETROCK" brand
wallboard, these products provide aesthetic and sound and fire retarding value.
Plaster products are sold under the trade names of "RED TOP," "IMPERIAL" and
"DIAMOND." The Corporation also produces gypsum-based products sold to
agricultural and industrial customers for use in a number of applications,
including soil conditioning, road repair, fireproofing and ceramics.


FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

     Summary financial results of the Gypsum Products segment are outlined in
the table below. Such results are not adjusted for intersegment sales
eliminations and corporate expenses. Operating profit in 1993 for the Gypsum
Products segment is not comparable to prior years due to $51 million of non-cash
amortization of Excess Reorganization Value.

MANUFACTURING

     Gypsum and related products are produced by the Corporation at 42 plants
located throughout the United States, Eastern Canada and in central Mexico. The
Corporation believes several factors contribute to its low delivered cost,
including (i) the vertical integration of its key raw materials (gypsum and
paper); (ii) the technical expertise provided by its extensive research and
development efforts and its experienced employees and (iii) the proximity of its
plants to major metropolitan areas.

     USG's vertically integrated gypsum and paper operations provide several
cost and quality advantages. Since the Corporation obtains substantially all of
its gypsum requirements from its own quarries and mines, it controls the cost,
quality and continuity of its supply. These factors are vital to producing
wallboard of a consistently high quality at a low cost. The Corporation's
geologists estimate that recoverable rock reserves are sufficient for more than
30 years of operation based on the Corporation's average annual production of
crude gypsum during the past five years. Proven reserves contain approximately
243 million tons, of which approximately 69% are located in the United States
and 31% in Canada. Additional reserves of approximately 153 million tons exist
on three properties not in operation. The Corporation's total average annual
production of crude gypsum in the United States and Canada during the past five
years was 9.4 million tons.

     USG owns and operates seven modern paper mills located across the United
States for efficient distribution of paper to virtually all of its wallboard
plants. These mills have sufficient capacity to satisfy virtually all of the
Corporation's expected paper needs for the foreseeable future. All these mills
presently are designed to produce paper utilizing 100% recycled waste paper
fiber as opposed to more costly virgin pulp. Vertical integration in paper
ensures a continuous supply of high quality paper that is tailored to the
specific needs of USG's wallboard production processes.

     As the leading producer of gypsum products for over 90 years, USG has
developed extensive knowledge of gypsum and the processes used in making its
products.  Combined with USG's experienced work force, USG's technical expertise
provides significant cost efficiencies in the production of existing products
and development of new ones. USG maintains the largest research and development
facility in the gypsum industry in Libertyville, Illinois which conducts fire
and structural testing and product and process development. Research and
development activities involve technology related to gypsum, cellulosic fiber
and cement as the primary raw materials on which panel products and systems,
such as gypsum board and cement board, are based. Related technologies are those
pertaining to joint compounds and textures for wallboard finishing, specialty
plaster products for both construction and industrial applications, coatings and
latex polymers.

     The number and location of the Corporation's gypsum plants enhance its cost
position by minimizing the distance and the transportation costs to major
metropolitan areas. Transportation costs can be a significant part of total
delivered cost of gypsum products.


MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

     Distribution is carried out through L&W Supply's 131 distribution centers
located in 34 states, as well as mass merchandisers and other retailers,
building material dealers, contractors and distributors. Sales of gypsum
products are seasonal to the extent that sales are generally greater from spring
through the middle of autumn than during the remaining part of the year.




                                        9
<PAGE>

COMPETITION

     The Corporation competes in North America as the largest of 18 producers of
gypsum wallboard products and, in 1993, accounted for approximately one-third of
total gypsum wallboard sales in the United States. In 1993, U.S. Gypsum's
shipments of gypsum wallboard totaled 7.3 billion square feet, the highest in
the Corporation's history, compared with total domestic industry shipments of
21.6 billion square feet which is also a record level. Principal competitors in
the United States are: National Gypsum Company, which emerged from Chapter
11 bankruptcy in July 1993, The Celotex Corporation, which has operated under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code since 1990, Domtar, Inc., Georgia-Pacific
Corporation and several smaller, regional competitors. Major competitors of CGC
in Eastern Canada include Domtar, Inc. and Westroc Industries Ltd.


INTERIOR SYSTEMS

BUSINESS

     The Interior Systems segment consists of USG Interiors in the United
States, USG International in Europe, the Pacific and Latin America and CGC in
Canada.

     The Corporation has increased its emphasis on the interior systems business
since 1986 when Donn Inc. ("DONN"), a manufacturer of ceiling suspension systems
("grid") and other interior products, was acquired. Already second behind
Armstrong World Industries, Inc. in the ceiling tile market, the acquisition of
Donn positioned the Corporation as the worldwide leader in ceiling suspension
systems and the only company to offer complete pre-designed, pre-engineered and
fully integrated ceiling systems. With the acquisition of Donn, USG Interiors
was established as a separate subsidiary to combine the operations of Donn and
USG Acoustical Products Company, formerly part of U.S. Gypsum and a leading
producer of mineral fiber ceiling products.

     USG's international position was enhanced in late 1987 when it began to
export ceiling tile to Europe to complement Donn's established grid business and
to capitalize on the strength of its existing distribution channels. By
combining ceiling tile and grid as a system for distributors and contractors,
USG has used its leading position in grid to advance sales of ceiling tile. As a
result, management estimates that USG's share of the European ceiling tile
market has grown to approximately 8%. International sales are managed through
USG International on a regional basis consisting of Europe, the Pacific and
Latin America.

     CGC manufactures and markets ceiling products and wall and floor systems
and accounted for over one-half of Canadian grid sales in 1993. CGC is the
second largest marketer of ceiling tile in Canada, behind Armstrong World
Industries, Inc., and accounted for approximately 30% of Canadian sales of such
products in 1993. CGC markets ceiling tile produced by USG Interiors.


PRODUCTS

     The Interior Systems segment manufactures and markets ceiling grid and
ceiling tile, access floor systems, wall systems and mineral wool insulation and
soundproofing products. USG's integrated line of ceiling products provides
qualities such as sound absorption, fire retardation, and convenient access to
the space above the ceiling for electrical and mechanical systems, air
distribution and maintenance. The Corporation believes its ability to provide
custom-designed and specially fabricated ceiling solutions to meet specific job
design installation conditions is increasingly attractive to architects,
designers and building owners. USG Interiors' significant trade names include
the "ACOUSTONE" and "AURATONE" brands of ceiling tile and the "DX," "FINELINE,"
"CENTRICITEE" and "DONN" brands of ceiling grid.


                                              10

<PAGE>

     USG's wall systems provide the versatility of an open floor plan with the
privacy of floor-to-ceiling partitions which are compatible with leading office
equipment and furniture systems. Wall systems are designed to be installed
quickly and reconfigured easily. In addition, USG manufactures a line of access
floor systems that permit easy access to wires and cables for repairs,
modifications, and upgrading of electrical and communication networks as well as
convenient movement of furniture and equipment.


FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

     Summary financial results for the Interior Systems segment are outlined in
the table below. Such results are not adjusted for intersegment sales

and Predecessor Companies.


MANUFACTURING

  Interior Systems products are manufactured at 16 plants throughout North
America, including 5 ceiling tile plants and 4 ceiling grid plants. The
remaining plants produce other interior products and raw materials for ceiling
tile and grid. Principal raw materials used in the production of Interior
Systems products include mineral fiber, steel, aluminum extrusions and
high-pressure laminates. Certain of these raw materials are produced internally,
while others are obtained from various outside suppliers. Shortages of raw
materials used in this segment are not expected.

  USG Interiors maintains its own research and development facility in Avon,
Ohio, which provides product design, engineering and testing services in
addition to manufacturing development, primarily in metal forming, with tool and
machine design and construction services. Additional research and development is
carried out at the Corporation's research and development center in
Libertyville, Illinois and at its "Solutions Center" -sm- in Chicago.


MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

  Interiors Systems products are sold primarily in markets related to the new
construction and renovation of commercial buildings as well as the retail market
for small commercial contractors. Marketing and distribution to large commercial
users is conducted through a network of distributors and installation
contractors as well as through L&W Supply and is oriented toward providing
integrated interior systems at competitive price levels. The Corporation
emphasizes educational and promotional materials designed to influence decision
makers who play a significant role in choosing material suppliers, such as
interior designers, contractors and facility managers. To this end, USG
Interiors maintains the "Solutions Center"-sm- located adjacent to Chicago's
Merchandise Mart which is used for product displays, educational seminars on
products and new product design and development. In recent

                                       11
<PAGE>

years, the Corporation has increased its emphasis on the retail market and as a
result now sells its products to seven of the ten largest building products
retailers in the United States.


COMPETITION

  The Corporation estimates that it is the world's largest manufacturer of
ceiling suspension systems with approximately 40% of worldwide sales of such
products. USG's most significant competitor is Chicago Metallic Corporation,
which participates in the U.S. and European markets. Other competitors in
ceiling grid include W.A.V.E. (a joint venture of Armstrong World
Industries, Inc. and National Rolling Mills). The Corporation estimates that it
accounts for approximately one-third of sales of acoustical ceiling tile to the
U.S. market. Principal global competitors include Armstrong World
Industries, Inc. (the largest manufacturer), Odenwald of West Germany and the
Celotex Corporation.


BUILDING PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTION

BUSINESS

  The Building Products Distribution segment consists of the operations of the
Corporation's L&W Supply subsidiary. L&W Supply is the largest distributor of
gypsum wallboard and related building products for residential and
nonresidential construction in the United States. L&W Supply distributes
approximately 9% of all gypsum wallboard in the United States (including
approximately 22% of U.S. Gypsum's wallboard production). Wallboard accounts for
approximately 47% of L&W Supply's total net sales.

  Although L&W Supply specializes in distribution of gypsum wallboard, joint
compound and other products manufactured primarily by U.S. Gypsum, it also
distributes USG Interiors' products such as acoustical ceiling tile and ceiling
grid and products of other manufacturers, including drywall metal, insulation,
roofing products and accessories.

  L&W Supply was founded in 1971 by U.S. Gypsum to address what management
perceived as a growing demand in the construction industry for a specialized
delivery service for construction materials, especially gypsum wallboard. U.S.
Gypsum management believed the construction industry could benefit from a
service-oriented organization that would deliver less than truckload quantities
of construction materials to a job site and place them in the areas where the
work was being done, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for handling by
contractors. To perform this service, U.S. Gypsum established a number of
distribution centers that could stock construction materials and be able to
deliver relatively large quantities with short lead times.

  L&W Supply has grown significantly over the past 23 years and now has 131
distribution centers located in 34 states.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

  Summary financial results for the Building Products Distribution segment are
outlined in the table below.  Such results are not adjusted for corporate
expenses and there are no intersegment sales eliminations for this segment.
Operating profit in 1993 for the Building Products Distribution segment is not
comparable to prior years due to $2 million of non-cash amortization of Excess
Reorganization Value.

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

  L&W Supply leases approximately 80% of its facilities from third parties,
which management believes provides it with the flexibility to enter and exit
fluctuating market areas. Usually, initial leases are from three to five years
with a five-year renewal option. Facilities are located in virtually every major
metropolitan area in the United States.

  A typical L&W Supply facility has approximately 12,000 square feet of
warehouse space, 1,500 square feet of office space and is located on 1.5 paved
acres of land in prime industrial areas with good interstate highway access.
Each center is equipped with at least one flatbed truck, a boom truck and, in
some cases, a towable forklift. Boom trucks are standard flatbed trucks with
telescoping hydraulic booms installed on the front of the truckbed. By using
either the telescoping boom or the towable forklift, L&W Supply employees are
able to place wallboard, joint compound and other materials in various locations
on a job site.


COMPETITION

  L&W Supply's closest competitor, Gypsum Management Supply, is an independent
distributor with approximately 70 locations in the southern, central and western
United States. There are several regional competitors, such as Gypsum Drywall
Management Association in the southern United States and Strober Building Supply
in the northeastern United States. L&W Supply's many local competitors include
lumber dealers, hardware stores, mass merchandisers, home improvement centers,
acoustical tile distributors and manufacturers.

  Sales are seasonal to the extent that sales are generally greater from the
middle of spring through the middle of autumn than during the remaining part of
the year.

SALES

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
          FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     On May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed the Restructuring.  Due to the
Restructuring and implementation of fresh start accounting, the Corporation's
financial statements effective May 7, 1993 are not comparable to financial
statements for periods prior to that date.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data - Predecessor Company - Notes to Financial Statements -
Financial Restructuring and Fresh Start Accounting" notes for information on the
Restructuring and implementation of fresh start accounting.

     To facilitate a meaningful comparison of the Corporation's operating
performance, the following discussion and analysis is presented on an annual
basis.  Consequently, 1993 information presented below does not comply with
post-bankruptcy accounting rules which require separate reporting for the
restructured company and the predecessor company.  Included in the following
discussion are comparisons of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
depletion, amortization, and additionally for 1993, non-cash postretirement
charges, reorganization items, extraordinary gain/(loss) and changes in
accounting principles ("EBITDA").  The Corporation believes EBITDA is helpful in
understanding cash flow generated from operations that is available for taxes,
debt service and capital expenditures.  In addition, EBITDA facilitates the
monitoring of covenants related to certain long-term debt and other agreements
entered into in conjunction with the Restructuring.  EBITDA should not be
considered by investors as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of the
Corporation's operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of its overall
liquidity.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

     Net sales increased for the second consecutive year in 1993, up $139
million, or 7.8%, over the prior year. Net sales in 1992 increased $65 million,
or 3.8%, over the 1991 level.  The primary factor for the improved levels of
sales has been increased demand for domestic gypsum wallboard which led to
all-time record shipments in 1993 and seven consecutive quarters of improving
prices.  These trends reflect the continuing recovery in domestic residential
construction as evidenced by an approximate 7% increase in U.S. housing starts
in 1993 compared with the 1992 level, which was 18% higher than 1991 U.S.
housing starts.

     As a percentage of net sales, gross profit in 1993 improved to 19.4% from
17.8% in 1992, reflecting increased gypsum wallboard pricing.  In 1992, gross
profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from the 1991 level of 19.1%,
primarily due to lower margins for gypsum wallboard in Canada and interior
systems products.

     Selling and administrative expenses increased slightly in 1993 versus 1992.
However, these expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 11.5% from
12.3% in 1992 as a result of the increase in 1993 net sales.  In 1992, selling
and administrative expenses increased $24 million, or 12.4%, over the 1991 level
due to increased compensation and benefits, rent associated with the new
corporate headquarters building, expansion of certain international operations
and a nonrecurring charge associated with organizational streamlining
activities.

     Effective May 7, 1993, the Corporation began amortizing its Excess
Reorganization Value which was established in accordance with fresh start
accounting rules.  This non-cash amortization, which will continue through April
1998, amounted to $113 million in 1993 with no counterpart in prior years.
Consequently, 1993 operating profit is not comparable to the prior years.

     EBITDA in 1993 increased $59 million, or 37.1%, over 1992, after decreasing
$35 million, or 18.0%, in 1992 compared with 1991.  These results reflect the
aforementioned gross profit performance and the higher 1992 versus 1991 selling
and administrative expenses.


UNITED STATES

     Net sales and EBITDA for domestic Gypsum Products (primarily U.S. Gypsum)
have increased for two consecutive years.  In 1993, net sales increased $97
million, or 10.9%, over 1992, following a $54 million, or 6.5%, increase in 1992
compared with 1991.  EBITDA in 1993 improved $49 million, or 49.5%, over 1992,
which was $6 million, or 6.5%, higher than the 1991 level.  These improvements
primarily reflect improving gypsum wallboard selling prices and increased
volume.  Higher sales of joint compound, DUROCK cement board and other products
contributed to the more favorable domestic Gypsum Products results.

     As a result of increased demand, 1993 shipments of gypsum wallboard
exceeded 7.3 billion square feet, the highest level in the Corporation's
history, and were up 2% over 1992.  Shipments in 1992 were up 8% over 1991.  As
gypsum wallboard demand and industry capacity utilization increased, prices
improved.  After reaching a 14-year low in the first quarter of 1992, gypsum
wallboard prices rebounded in the following quarter and rose in each of the next
seven consecutive quarters.  For 1993 as a whole, gypsum wallboard prices
increased 10.5% over the prior year average after falling 1.3% in 1992 from
1991.  U.S. Gypsum's average gypsum wallboard prices per thousand square feet
for the three years were as follows:

          Partially offsetting the favorable price and volume trends in 1993 was
a 3% increase in unit manufacturing cost for gypsum wallboard.  This increase
was primarily attributable to higher levels of maintenance expenditures and
energy cost.  In 1992, unit manufacturing cost declined 2% compared with 1991.
However, EBITDA in 1992 was unfavorably impacted by a nonrecurring pre-tax
charge of $4 million associated with organizational streamlining activities.

          Net sales in 1993 for domestic Interior Systems (primarily USG
Interiors) increased $8 million, or 2.2%, over the 1992 level, while EBITDA
decreased $2 million, or 4.3%.  Net sales and EBITDA in 1992 decreased $18
million, or 4.7%, and $12 million, or 20.3%, from the respective 1991 levels.
These results primarily reflect low levels of non-residential construction in
1992 and 1993, partially offset in 1993 by increased sales to retail markets.
The 1993 net sales and EBITDA trends primarily reflect increased sales of lower
margin products and higher raw material costs.

          Building Products Distribution (L&W Supply) has experienced two
consecutive years of increased net sales and EBITDA.  Net sales in 1993
increased $64 million, or 13.8%, and EBITDA rose $2 million, or 40.0%, over the
respective 1992 amounts.  Comparing 1992 to 1991, net sales were up $40 million,
or 9.4%, and EBITDA increased $1 million, or 25.0%.  These improvements reflect
higher gypsum wallboard selling prices and increased volume, as well as improved
results for its other building product lines.


CANADA

          Net sales for the Corporation's Canadian operations (primarily CGC)
declined $6 million, or 4.0%, in 1993 versus 1992, due to the strengthened U.S.
dollar compared with the Canadian dollar.  However, EBITDA was up $3 million, or
21.4%, in 1993 versus 1992 due to higher selling prices for gypsum wallboard.
Canadian gypsum wallboard prices were impacted in 1993 by the Canadian
government's ruling that dumping of U.S.-made gypsum wallboard had occurred and
the resulting imposition of duties on gypsum wallboard imported into Canada from
the United States at prices below certain levels.  This ruling will be in effect
until January 1998.  For 1992, net sales and EBITDA decreased $20 million, or
11.8%, and $15 million, or 51.7%, respectively, from the corresponding 1991
levels.  These declines resulted from lower selling prices and volume for gypsum
wallboard due to the weak Canadian economy.  Results for both 1993 and 1992 were
also unfavorably impacted by lower sales of CGC's interior systems products due
to the low level of commercial construction.


OTHER FOREIGN

          Despite the continuing recession in Europe and the impact of the
strengthened U.S. dollar compared with European currencies, net sales in 1993
for the Corporation's Other Foreign businesses (primarily operations in Europe,
the Pacific and Mexico managed by USG International) were unchanged from 1992
due to increased sales of ceiling tile in Europe.  However, EBITDA in 1993
increased $4 million, or 18.2%, over 1992 due to reduced overhead costs.
Comparing 1992 to 1991, net sales increased $15 million, or 7.8%, while EBITDA
decreased $6 million, or 21.4%.  The improvement in net sales reflects increased
sales of interior systems products in certain markets as well as the impact of a
weakened U.S. dollar in 1992.  The decline in EBITDA resulted from recessionary
market conditions in Europe, costs associated with the Aubange, Belgium ceiling
tile plant and increased overhead costs.


OTHER EARNINGS INFORMATION

          Interest expense, which was significantly reduced as a result of the
Restructuring, amounted to $92 million in the period of May 7 through December
31, 1993, of which $8 million represented non-cash amortization of
reorganization debt discount.  For the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993,
interest expense was $86 million.

                                       20


<PAGE>

For the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, interest expense was $334
million and $333 million, respectively.

          In connection with the Restructuring, the Corporation recorded in the
period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 a one-time reorganization items gain of
$709 million, which primarily consisted of an $851 million gain from recording
the Excess Reorganization Value pursuant to fresh start accounting principles.
See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Predecessor Company -
Notes to Financial Statements - Reorganization Items" note for additional
information on the reorganization items gain.

          Income tax expense amounted to $29 million in the period of May 7
through December 31, 1993 due to the inability to benefit the amortization of
Excess Reorganization Value.  Income tax expense was $17 million for the period
of January 1 through May 6, 1993 while income tax benefits of $33 million and
$53 million were recorded in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The income tax
expense in the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 and the lower 1992
benefit compared to 1991 were primarily due to the inability to fully benefit a
net operating loss carryforward ("NOL CARRYFORWARD") as an offset to deferred
taxes.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to
Financial Statements - Taxes on Income and Deferred Income Taxes" notes for both
the Restructured and Predecessor Companies for additional information on income
taxes.

          Also in connection with the Restructuring, the Corporation recorded in
the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 a one-time after-tax extraordinary
gain of $944 million.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- - Predecessor Company - Notes to Financial Statements - Extraordinary Gain" note
for additional information on the extraordinary gain.  In the period of May 7
through December 31, 1993, the Corporation recorded an after-tax extraordinary
loss of $21 million reflecting the write-off of reorganization discount
associated with debt issues expected to be prepaid, redeemed or purchased in
1994 with a portion of the proceeds from the Offering and the Note Placement.
See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Restructured Company
- - Notes to Financial Statements - Subsequent Event" note for additional
information on the Offering and Note Placement.

          A one-time after-tax net charge of $150 million was recorded in the
first quarter of 1993 representing the cumulative impact of the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes."  See Item 8. "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Predecessor Company - Notes to Financial Statements - Taxes
on Income and Deferred Income Taxes and Postretirement Benefits" notes for
information related to these accounting changes.

          A net loss of $129 million was recorded in the period of May 7 through
December 31, 1993 after the aforementioned amortization of Excess Reorganization
Value of $113 million and the after-tax extraordinary loss of $21 million.  Net
earnings of $1,434 million were recorded in the period of January 1 through May
6, 1993, reflecting the reorganization items gain of $709 million and the after-
tax extraordinary gain of $944 million.  Net losses of $191 million and $161
million were recorded in 1992 and 1991, respectively, primarily due to high
levels of interest expense.  The net loss in 1991 included a $20 million after-
tax provision relating to the sale of DAP Inc. ("DAP"), formerly a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation.  Results for DAP are reported separately as
discontinued operations up to September 1991, when the sale of DAP was
completed.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          On May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed the Restructuring through
implementation of the Prepackaged Plan. The provisions of the Prepackaged Plan
were agreed upon in principle with all committees and certain institutions
representing debt subject to the Restructuring in January 1993.  The
Corporation's Registration Statement (Registration No. 33-40136), which included
a Disclosure Statement and Proxy Statement - Prospectus, was declared



                                       21


<PAGE>

effective by the SEC in February 1993.  The solicitation process for approvals
of the Prepackaged Plan was completed on March 15, 1993.  The Corporation
commenced a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in Delaware (IN RE: USG
CORPORATION, Case No. 93-300) on March 17, 1993 and received the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court's confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan on April 23, 1993.  None of the
subsidiaries of the Corporation were part of this proceeding and there was no
impact on trade creditors of the Corporation's subsidiaries.  Under the
Prepackaged Plan, all previously existing defaults were waived or cured.

          In the Restructuring, the Corporation (i) converted approximately $1.4
billion of subordinated debt and accrued interest into Common Stock and Warrants
to purchase Common Stock, (ii) converted approximately $300 million principal
amount of bank term loan (the "BANK TERM LOAN") and $40 million of other
obligations under an agreement (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT") with a syndicate of
commercial banks (the "BANKS" or the "BANK GROUP") into 10 1/4% Senior Notes due
2002 ("SENIOR 2002 NOTES") and (iii) extended the maturities of its remaining
Bank Debt and certain public debt.  Further, modifications were made to the
Credit Agreement which resulted in, among other things, (i) the issuance of $56
million of notes (the "CAPITALIZED INTEREST NOTES" and, together with the Bank
Term Loan, the "BANK DEBT") in exchange for an equal amount of accrued but
unpaid interest and other obligations and (ii) modifications to the Revolving
Credit Facility.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -
Predecessor Company - Notes to Financial Statements -  Financial Restructuring"
note for additional information on the Restructuring.

          Subsequent to the Restructuring, on August 10, 1993, the Corporation
issued an additional $138 million of Senior 2002 Notes in exchange for Bank
Debt.  This transaction improved the Corporation's financial flexibility and
responded to strong market demand for the Senior 2002 Notes by replacing near-
term maturities of the Bank Debt with the longer term notes. Although issuance
of these notes caused a modest increase in interest expense from the level
experienced since the Restructuring was consummated, it eliminated all Bank Term
Loan scheduled principal payments due through 1996.  Furthermore, in connection
with this exchange, the cash sweep mechanism of the Credit Agreement was
modified, allowing the Corporation to apply cash otherwise subject to the cash
sweep through 1996 to repayment or purchase of senior debt.  For the holders of
the Bank Debt participating in the exchange, the Senior 2002 Notes provide
greater yield and liquidity than the Bank Debt.  See Item 8. "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data - Restructured Company - Notes to Financial
Statements - Indebtedness" note for additional information on this transaction.

          On January 7, 1994, the Corporation filed a Registration Statement
(Registration No. 33-51845), as amended on February 16, 1994, pertaining to its
planned public offering of 6,000,000 new shares of Common Stock to be sold by
the Corporation and 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock to be sold by Water Street
Corporate Recovery Fund I, L.P.  The Offering is part of a refinancing strategy
which also includes (i) the placement of $150 million principal amount of new
senior notes due 2001 with certain institutional investors and (ii) certain
amendments to the Corporation's Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement
Amendments will, among other things, increase the size of the Corporation's
Revolving Credit Facility by $70 million and amend existing mandatory Bank Term
Loan prepayment provisions to allow the Corporation, upon the achievement of
certain financial tests, to retain additional free cash flow for capital
expenditures and the purchase of its public debt.  Certain amendments are
contingent on the consummation of the Offering.

          On February 17, 1994, the Corporation completed the Note Placement of
$150 million principal amount of 9 1/4% Senior Notes due 2001.  In connection
with such placement, the Corporation received in exchange for an equivalent
amount of such new Notes approximately $65 million principal amount of 8% Senior
Notes ($30 million due in 1996 and $35 million due in 1997) and repaid $75
million of its Bank Term Loans in satisfaction of the scheduled payment for 1997
and in reduction of the scheduled payment for 1998 from $100 million to $65
million.

          In addition to the exchange of notes and payment of Bank Term Loans in
conection with the Note Placement as described above, the Corporation expects to
use a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering, together with approximately
$158 million of existing cash generated from operations to pay an additional $65
million of Bank


                                       22


<PAGE>

Term Loans and to redeem or purchase approximately $195 million aggregate
principal amount of certain other senior debt issues.  The remainder of the net
proceeds, approximately $92 million, will be available for general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures for cost reduction, capacity
improvement and future growth opportunities.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data - Restructured Company - Notes to Financial Statements -
Subsequent Event" note for more information on the Transactions.

          The Corporation believes that, as a result of the Restructuring, as
well as the subsequent exchange of Senior 2002 Notes for Bank Debt, the
Corporation's cash generated by operations and the estimated levels of liquidity
available to the Corporation will be sufficient to permit the Corporation to
satisfy its debt service requirements and other capital requirements for the
foreseeable future. Upon completion of the Transactions, the Corporation's
liquidity and capital resources will be further significantly strengthened.
However, the Corporation is subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties that are beyond its control.  There can be no
assurance that the Corporation's financial resources will be sufficient for the
Corporation to satisfy its debt service obligations and other capital
requirements under all circumstances.


WORKING CAPITAL

          As of December 31, 1993, working capital (current assets less current
liabilities) amounted to $121 million and the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was 1.24 to 1, versus December 31, 1992 when current liabilities
exceeded current assets by $2.6 billion and the ratio of current assets to
current liabilities was .21 to 1.  From December 31, 1990 through May 6, 1993,
the Corporation had a deficit working capital position, primarily resulting from
the inclusion of most long-term debt issues in current liabilities due to
various defaults upon certain of the debt issues.  Upon consummation of the
Restructuring, all previously existing defaults were waived or cured and long-
term debt included in current liabilities was either exchanged for Common Stock
and Warrants to purchase Common Stock, reclassified to long-term debt, or in the
case of $140 million of the Revolving Credit Facility, repaid.  See Item 8.
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Predecessor Company - Notes to
Financial Statements - Financial Restructuring" note for additional information
related to the Restructuring.

            For the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993, cash and cash
equivalents increased $162 million as cash flows from operating activities of
$183 million were partially offset by a net repayment of debt of $21 million. As
of December 31, 1993, $158 million of long-term debt was reclassified to
currently maturing long-term debt due to the cash sweep mechanism of the Credit
Agreement.  This cash sweep mechanism requires prepayment of long-term debt in
1994.  For the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993, cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $131 million, primarily due to debt repayments in
connection with the Restructuring.

          Comparing December 31, 1993 balances with December 31, 1992, accrued
expenses of $208 million were down $345 million, or 62.4%, primarily due to the
cancellation and discharge of $375 million of accrued interest in connection
with the Restructuring.  Inventories of $145 million increased $32 million, or
28.3%, primarily due to their revaluation as a result of fresh start accounting.
Accounts receivable (net) of $264 million declined $35 million, or 11.7%,
reflecting a decline in miscellaneous corporate receivables, partially offset by
an increase of $26 million in customer receivables due to the higher level of
net sales.  Accounts payable of $104 million rose $13 million, or 14.3%, due to
the increased level of business and improved trade credit.


CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

          Capital expenditures amounted to $29 million in the period of May 7
through December 31, 1993 and $12 million in the period of January 1 through May
6, 1993 for a total of $41 million in the year ended December 31, 1993.  In
1992, capital expenditures were $49 million.  Capital expenditure commitments
for the replacement, modernization and expansion of operations amounted to $11
million as of December 31, 1993, compared with $24 million as of December 31,
1992.  The Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, capital expenditures
above

                                       23

certain levels.  The Corporation believes that these permitted levels are
adequate.  In connection with the planned Offering and Note Placement, the
Credit Agreement will be amended, allowing the Corporation to retain additional
cash flow for capital expenditures and other uses.  Upon completion of the
Transactions, the Corporation intends to augment its capital spending program on
a basis consistent with such new amendment.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data - Restructured Company - Notes to Financial Statements -
Subsequent Event" note for additional information related to the Transactions.


LITIGATION

          One of the Corporation's subsidiaries, U.S. Gypsum, is a defendant in
asbestos lawsuits alleging both property damage and personal injury.  This
litigation has not had a material effect on the Corporation's liquidity or
earnings.  Virtually all costs of the Personal Injury Cases are being paid by
insurance.  However, many of U.S. Gypsum's insurance carriers are denying
coverage for the Property Damage Cases, although U.S. Gypsum believes that
substantial coverage exists and the trial court in U.S. Gypsum's Coverage Action
has so ruled (such ruling has been appealed).  In view of the limited insurance
funding currently available to U.S. Gypsum for Property Damage Cases resulting
from continued resistance by a number of U.S. Gypsum's insurers to providing
coverage, the effect of the asbestos litigation on the Corporation will depend
upon a variety of factors, including the damages sought in Property Damage Cases
that reach trial prior to the completion of the Coverage Action, U.S. Gypsum's
ability to successfully defend or settle such cases, and the resolution of the
Coverage Action.  As a result, management is unable to determine whether an
adverse outcome in the asbestos litigation will have a material adverse effect
on the results of operations or the consolidated financial position of the
Corporation.

          The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have been notified by
state and federal environmental protection agencies of possible involvement as
one of numerous "potentially responsible parties" in a number of so-called
"Superfund" sites in the United States.  The Corporation believes that neither
these matters nor any other known governmental proceeding regarding
environmental matters will have a material adverse effect upon its earnings or
consolidated financial position.  See Item 8. "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Restructured Company - Notes to Financial Statements -
Litigation" note for more information on legal proceedings.

                                 USG CORPORATION
                             (RESTRUCTURED COMPANY)
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   (TERMS IN INITIAL CAPITAL LETTERS ARE DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K)

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions.  Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products.  Net
currency translation gains or losses on foreign subsidiaries are included in
deferred currency translation, a component of stockholders' equity.

     Excess Reorganization Value, which was recorded as a result of the
implementation of fresh start accounting, is being amortized through April
1998.  The Corporation continues to evaluate whether events and circumstances
have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of Excess
Reorganization Value may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may
not be recoverable.  The Corporation uses an estimate of its undiscounted cash
flows over the remaining life of the Excess Reorganization Value in measuring
whether the asset is recoverable.  See "Financial Restructuring" note below for
more information on the implementation of fresh start accounting.

     For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows, all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING

     On May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed a comprehensive restructuring of
its debt (the "RESTRUCTURING") through implementation of a "prepackaged" plan
of reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws (the "PREPACKAGED PLAN") which
was confirmed on April 23, 1993 by the Bankruptcy Court.  In the Restructuring,
the Corporation (i) converted approximately $1.4 billion of subordinated debt
and accrued interest into Common Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock,
(ii) converted approximately $340 million of its bank obligations into 10 1/4%
Senior Notes due 2002 ("SENIOR 2002 NOTES") and (iii) extended the maturities
of its remaining Bank Debt and certain public debt.  Upon consummation of the
Restructuring, all previously existing defaults upon senior securities were
waived or cured.  None of the subsidiaries of the Corporation were part of this
proceeding and there was no impact on trade creditors of the Corporation's
subsidiaries.  The Corporation accounted for the Restructuring using the
principles of fresh start accounting as required by AICPA Statement of Position
90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code" ("SOP 90-7").  Pursuant to such principles, individual assets and
liabilities were adjusted to fair market value as of May 6, 1993.  See
"Predecessor Company - Notes to Financial Statements - Financial Restructuring
and Fresh Start Accounting" notes for information on the terms and
implementation of the Prepackaged Plan and fresh start accounting.

PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS

     The following unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Earnings for the year ended December 31, 1993 has been prepared giving effect
to the consummation of the Restructuring, including the implementation of fresh
start accounting, as if the consummation had occurred on January 1, 1993.  Due
to the Restructuring and implementation of fresh start accounting, financial
statements effective May 7, 1993 for the restructured company are not
comparable to financial statements prior to that date for the predecessor
company.  However, for presentation of this statement, total results for 1993
are shown under the caption "Total Before Adjustments."  The adjustments set
forth under the caption "Pro Forma Adjustments" reflect the implementation of
the Prepackaged Plan and the adoption of fresh start accounting as if they had
occurred on January 1, 1993.

     (a)  Reflects amortization of Excess Reorganization Value which would
          have been recorded during the period of January 1 through May 6,
          1993.

     (b)  Reflects the adjustment to restate interest expense for the
          period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 to the amount that would
          have been recorded.

     (c)  Represents the reversal of first quarter 1993 amortization of
          historical capitalized financing costs which were written off in
          connection with the Restructuring.

     (d)  Represents the reversal of actual reorganization items incurred
          in connection with the Restructuring and implementation of fresh
          start accounting.  This gain would have been recorded in 1992 had
          the Restructuring occurred on January 1, 1993.

EXTRAORDINARY LOSS

     In December 1993, the Corporation recorded an extraordinary loss of $21
million, net of related income tax benefit of $11 million, reflecting the write-
off of the reorganization discount associated with debt issues expected to be
prepaid, redeemed or purchased in 1994 in connection with the Corporation's
planned public offering of Common Stock and issuance of new senior notes.  See
"Subsequent Event" note for more information on the planned public offering of
stock and issuance of new senior notes.

</TABLE>

     A valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets relating to
pension and retiree medical benefits due to the long-term nature of their
realization.  Because of the uncertainty regarding the application of the
Internal Revenue Code (the "CODE") to the Corporation's NOL Carryforwards as a
result of the Prepackaged Plan, no deferred tax asset is recorded.  Under fresh
start accounting rules, any benefit realized from utilizing predecessor company
NOL Carryforwards will not impact net earnings.

     The Corporation has NOL Carryforwards of $90 million remaining from 1992
after using approximately $23 million to offset U.S. taxable income in 1993 and
a reduction due to cancellation of indebtedness from the Prepackaged Plan.
These NOL Carryforwards may be used to offset U.S. taxable income through 2007.
The Code will limit the Corporation's annual use of its NOL Carryforwards to the
lesser of its taxable income or approximately $30 million plus any unused limit
from prior years.  Furthermore, due to the uncertainty regarding the application
of the Code to the exchange of stock for debt, the Corporation's NOL
Carryforwards could be further reduced or eliminated.  The Corporation has a $4
million minimum tax credit which may be used to offset U.S. regular tax
liability in future years.

     The Corporation does not provide for U.S. Federal income taxes on the
portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are intended to
be permanently reinvested.  The cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings
totaled approximately $79 million as of December 31, 1993.  Any future
repatriation of undistributed earnings would not, in the opinion of management,
result in significant additional taxes.


INVENTORIES

     In accordance with the implementation of fresh start accounting,
inventories were stated at fair market value as of May 6, 1993.  Most of the
Corporation's domestic inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
("LIFO") method.  As of December 31, 1993, the LIFO values of these inventories
were $103 million and would have been the same if they were valued under the
first-in, first-out ("FIFO") and average production cost methods.  The remaining
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, under the FIFO or average
production cost methods.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

     Property, plant and equipment were stated at fair market value as of May 6,
1993 in accordance with fresh start accounting.  Provisions for depreciation are
determined principally on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful
lives of composite asset groups.  Depletion is computed on a basis calculated to
spread the cost of gypsum and other applicable resources over the estimated
quantities of material recoverable.  Interest during construction is capitalized
on major property additions.  Property, plant and equipment classifications were

     As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had $1,531
million total principal amount of debt (before unamortized reorganization
discount) on a consolidated basis.  Of such total debt, $105 million represented
direct borrowings by the subsidiaries, including $38 million of industrial
revenue bonds, $36 million of 7 7/8% sinking fund debentures issued by U.S.
Gypsum in 1974 and subsequently assumed by the Corporation on a joint and
several basis in 1985, $27 million of debt (primarily project financing)
incurred by the Corporation's foreign subsidiaries other than CGC, $2 million of
working capital borrowings by CGC, and $2 million of other long-term borrowings
by CGC.

     The Credit Agreement includes a cash sweep mechanism under which excess
cash as of the end of any year, calculated in accordance with the Credit
Agreement, must be used to pay debt within the following year.  As of
December 31, 1993, such excess cash amounted to $158 million.  Accordingly,
$158 million of long term debt was reclassified to currently maturing long-
term debt.

     On August 10, 1993, the Corporation issued $138 million of Senior 2002
Notes in exchange for $92 million of Bank Term Loans due 1994 through 1996
and $46 million of Capitalized Interest Notes due 2000.  The Corporation did
not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of these securities.  In
connection with this transaction, the Credit Agreement was modified,
providing for the following changes:  (i) scheduled Bank Term Loan
amortization payments of $95 million due in 1994, 1995 and 1996 were
eliminated ($3 million was added to the final maturity of the Bank Term Loan
due in 2000); (ii) USG Interiors paid $9 million of Capitalized Interest
Notes due in 1998; and (iii) the cash sweep mechanism was modified to permit
the use of up to $165 million of cash otherwise subject to mandatory Bank
Term Loan prepayments in 1994, 1995 and 1996 for payment or purchase of
senior debt with maturities prior to January 1, 1999, or for the prepayment
of Bank Term Loans, at the discretion of the Corporation.

     The Bank Term Loan and most other senior debt are secured by a pledge of
all of the shares of the Corporation's major domestic subsidiaries and 65% of
the shares of certain of its foreign subsidiaries including CGC, pursuant to
a collateral trust arrangement controlled primarily by holders of the Bank
Term Loan.  The rights of the Corporation and its creditors to the assets of
any subsidiary upon the latter's liquidation or reorganization will be
subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors, except to the
extent that the Corporation may itself be a creditor with enforceable claims
against such subsidiary.  The average rate of interest on the Bank Term Loan
was 5.3% in the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993.

     The "Other Secured Debt" category shown in the table above primarily
includes short-term and long-term borrowings from several foreign banks by
USG International used principally to finance construction of the Aubange,
Belgium ceiling tile plant.  This debt is secured by a lien on the assets of
the Aubange plant and has restrictive covenants that restrict, among other
things, the payment of dividends.  Foreign borrowings made by the
Corporation's international operations are generally allowed, within certain
limits, under provisions of the Credit Agreement.

     In general, the Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, mergers, asset dispositions,
investments, prepayment of other debt, dealings with affiliates, capital
expenditures, payment of dividends and lease commitments.  The Credit
Agreement, as amended in accordance with the Prepackaged Plan, also requires
the Corporation, beginning January 1, 1995, to satisfy certain financial
covenants.

      The fair market value of debt as of December 31, 1993 was $1,481
million, based on indicative bond prices as of that date, excluding other
secured debt, primarily representing financing for construction of the
Aubange plant, which was not practicable to estimate.

      Aggregate, presently scheduled maturities of long-term debt, after the
assumed effect of prepayments pursuant to the aforementioned cash sweep
mechanism and excluding other amounts classified as current liabilities, are
$9 million, $20 million, $148 million and $153 million in the years 1995
through 1998, respectively.

PENSION PLANS

   The Corporation and most of its subsidiaries have defined benefit
retirement plans for all eligible employees.  Benefits of the plans are
generally based on years of service and employees' compensation during the
last years of employment.  The Corporation's contributions are made in
accordance with independent actuarial reports which, for most plans, required
minimal funding in the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993.  Net
pension expense included the following components (dollars in millions):

   The projected benefit obligation in excess of assets consisted of an
unrecognized net loss due to changes in assumptions and differences between
actual and estimated experience.

   The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9% for the period
of May 7 through December 31, 1993.  The assumed weighted average discount
rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation was 7% and the
rate of increases in projected future compensation levels was 5%.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

   The Corporation maintains plans that provide retiree health care and life
insurance benefits for all eligible employees.  Employees generally become
eligible for the retiree benefit plans when they meet minimum retirement age
and service requirements.  The cost of providing most of these benefits is
shared with retirees.

   The following table summarizes the components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993
(dollars in millions):

</TABLE>

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 11% as of December 31, 1993 with a
gradually declining rate to 5% by the year 2000 and remaining at that level
thereafter.  A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993 by $22 million and increase the
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the period of May 7 through
December 31, 1993 by $2 million.  The assumed discount rate used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7%.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

   The Corporation employs a variety of off-balance sheet financial
instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and energy costs.  These instruments consists
primarily of interest rate caps and swaps, foreign currency forward exchange
contracts and energy price swaps and option agreements.  The Corporation
designates interest rate swaps as hedges of LIBOR-based bank debt, and
accrues as interest expense the differential to be paid or received under the
agreements as rates change over the life of the

                                     37

<PAGE>

contracts.  Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts
offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions.
Upon settlement of energy price contracts, the resulting gain or loss is
included in related manufacturing cost.  The Corporation continually monitors
its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions
which are counterparties to its off-balance sheet financial instruments and
does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties.

   As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation had approximately $500 million
(notional amount) of interest rate contracts outstanding, extending up to
three years, and approximately $50 million (combined notional amount) of
foreign currency and energy price contracts outstanding, extending one year
or less.  The difference in the value of all of the aforementioned contracts
and the December 31, 1993 market value was not material.

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE PLAN

   On May 6, 1993, all outstanding stock options were cancelled without
consideration and certain shares of restricted and deferred stock were
cashed-out pursuant to "change in control" provisions contained in the
Management Performance Plan (the "PERFORMANCE PLAN").  As of December 31,
1993, restricted stock and awards for deferred stock yet to be issued
(totaling 25,259 shares) remained outstanding as a consequence of certain
waivers of the change in control event by senior members of management.

   As permitted by the Prepackaged Plan, 2,788,350 common shares were
reserved for future issuance in conjunction with stock options, all of which
remained in reserve as of December 31,1993.  Options for 1,673,000 common
shares were granted on June 1, 1993, leaving an additional 1,115,350 common
shares available for future grants.  The options granted on June 1, 1993
become exercisable in the years 1994 through 1996 at an exercise price of
$10.3125 per share.

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

   On June 6, 1988, the Corporation adopted a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Plan and pursuant to its provisions declared, subject to the consummation of
the 1988 Recapitalization, a distribution of one right (the "RIGHTS") upon
each new share of Common Stock issued in the 1988 Recapitalization.  The 1988
Recapitalization became effective July 13, 1988 and the distribution occurred
immediately thereafter.  The Rights contain provisions which are intended to
protect stockholders in the event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire the
Corporation.

   The Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan was terminated in connection with
the implementation of the Prepackaged Plan.  On May 6, 1993, a new rights
plan (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") was adopted with provisions substantially
similar to the old rights agreement except that: (i) the purchase price of
the Rights was reset; (ii) the expiration of the Rights was extended; (iii) a
so-called "flip-in" feature and exchange feature were added; (iv) certain
exemptions were added permitting certain acquisition and the continued
holding of common shares by Water Street and its affiliates in excess of the
otherwise specified thresholds; (v) the redemption price was reduced; and
(vi) the amendment provision was liberalized.

     Under the terms of the Rights Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions
for Water Street and its affiliates,

                                     38
<PAGE>

generally the Rights become exercisable (i) 10 days following the date of a
public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons (an "ACQUIRING PERSON"), other than the Corporation, any employee
benefit plan of the Corporation, any entity holding Common Stock for or
pursuant to the terms of any such plan, has beneficial ownership (as defined
in the Rights Agreement) of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock,
(ii) 10 days following the date of a public announcement that a person or
group of affiliated or associated persons (an "ADVERSE PERSON") has
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock, the
acquisition of which has been determined by the Board to present an actual
threat of an acquisition of the Corporation that would not be in the best
interest of the Corporation's stockholders or (iii) 10 days following the
date of commencement of, or public announcement of, a tender offer or
exchange offer for 30% or more of the Common Stock.  When exercisable, each
of the Rights entitles the registered holder to purchase one-hundredth of a
share of a junior participating preferred stock, series C, $1.00 par value
per share, at a price of $35.00 per one-hundredth of a preferred share,
subject to adjustments.

   In the event that the Corporation is the surviving corporation in a merger
or other business combination involving an Acquiring Person or an Adverse
Person and the Common Stock remains outstanding and unchanged or in the event
that an Acquiring Person or an Adverse Person engages in one of a number of
self-dealing transactions specified in the Rights Agreement, proper provision
will be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or
were beneficially owned (as defined in the Rights Agreement) by the Acquiring
Person or the Adverse Person, as the case may be, on the earliest of the
Distribution Date, the date the Acquiring Person acquires 20% or more of the
outstanding Common Stock or the date the Adverse Person becomes such (which
will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise thereof that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value
at the time of such transaction of two times the exercise price of the Right.
In addition, under certain circumstances the Board has the option of
exchanging all or part of the Rights (excluding void Rights) for Common Stock
in the manner described in the Rights Agreement.  The Rights Agreement also
contains a so-called "flip-in" feature which provides that if any person or
group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Adverse Person, then the
provisions of the preceding two sentences shall apply.

WARRANTS

   On May 6, 1993, a total of 2,602,566 warrants, each to purchase a share of
Common Stock at an exercise price of $16.14 per share (the "WARRANTS"), were
issued to holders of the Old Junior Subordinated Debentures in addition to
the shares of Common Stock issued to such holders, all as provided by the
Prepackaged Plan.  Upon issuance, each of the Warrants entitled the holder to
purchase one share of Common Stock at a purchase price of $16.14 per share,
subject to adjustment under certain events.

   The Warrants are exercisable, subject to applicable securities laws, at
any time prior to May 6, 1998.  Each share of Common Stock issued upon
exercise of a Warrant prior to the Distribution Date (as defined in the
Rights Agreement) and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights
will be accompanied by an attached Right issued under the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Rights Agreement as it may then be in effect.  As of
December 31, 1993, 2,601,619 Warrants were outstanding.

LITIGATION

          One of the Corporation's subsidiaries, U.S. Gypsum, is among numerous
defendants in lawsuits arising out of the manufacture and sale of asbestos-
containing building materials.  U.S. Gypsum sold certain asbestos-containing
products beginning in the 1930's; in most cases the products were discontinued
or asbestos was removed from the product formula by 1972, and no asbestos-
containing products were sold after 1977.  Some of these lawsuits seek to
recover compensatory and in many cases punitive damages for costs associated
with maintenance or removal and replacement of products containing asbestos (the
"PROPERTY DAMAGE CASES").  Others of these suits (the "PERSONAL INJURY CASES")
seek to recover compensatory and in many cases punitive damages for personal
injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos and asbestos-containing
products.  It is anticipated that additional personal injury and property damage
cases containing similar allegations will be filed.

          As discussed below, U.S. Gypsum has substantial personal injury and
property damage insurance for the years involved in the asbestos litigation.
Prior to 1985, when an asbestos exclusion was added to U.S. Gypsum's policies,
U.S. Gypsum purchased comprehensive general liability insurance policies
covering personal injury and property  damage in an aggregate face amount of
approximately $850 million.  Insurers that issued approximately $106 million of
these policies are presently insolvent.  After deducting insolvencies and
exhaustion of policies, approximately



                                       40

<PAGE>
$625 million of insurance remains potentially available.  Because U.S. Gypsum's
insurance carriers initially responded to its claims for defense and
indemnification with various theories denying or limiting coverage and the
applicability of their policies, U.S. Gypsum filed a declaratory judgment action
against them in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois  on December 29,
1983.  (U.S. GYPSUM CO. V. ADMIRAL INSURANCE CO., ET AL.) (the "COVERAGE
ACTION").  U.S. Gypsum alleges in the Coverage Action that the carriers are
obligated to provide indemnification for settlements and judgments and, in some
cases, defense costs incurred by U.S. Gypsum in property damage and personal
injury claims in which it is a defendant.  The current defendants are ten
insurance carriers that provided comprehensive general liability insurance
coverage to U.S. Gypsum between the 1940's and 1984.  As discussed below,
several carriers have settled all or a portion of the claims in the Coverage
Action.

          U.S. Gypsum's aggregate expenditures for all asbestos-related matters,
including property damage, personal injury, insurance coverage litigation and
related expenses, exceeded aggregate insurance payments by $10.9 million in
1991, $25.8 million in 1992, and $8.2 million in 1993.


PROPERTY DAMAGE CASES

          The Property Damage Cases have been brought against U.S. Gypsum by a
variety of plaintiffs, including school districts, state and local governments,
colleges and universities, hospitals and private property owners.  U.S. Gypsum
is one of many defendants in four cases that have been certified as class
actions and others that request such certification.  One class action suit is
brought on behalf of owners and operators of all elementary and secondary
schools in the United States that contain or contained friable asbestos-
containing material. (IN RE ASBESTOS SCHOOL LITIGATION, U.S.D.C., E.D. Pa.)
Approximately 1,350 school districts opted out of the class, some of which have
filed or may file separate lawsuits or are participants in a state court class
action involving approximately 333 school districts in Michigan.  (BOARD OF
EDUCATION OF THE CITY OF DETROIT, ET AL. V. THE CELOTEX CORP., ET AL., Circuit
Court for Wayne County, Mich.)  On April 10, 1992, a state court in Philadelphia
certified a class consisting of all owners of buildings leased to the federal
government.  (PRINCE GEORGE CENTER, INC. V. U.S. GYPSUM CO., ET AL., Court of
Common Pleas, Philadelphia, Pa.)  On September 4, 1992, a Federal district court
in South Carolina conditionally certified a class comprised of all colleges and
universities in the United States, which certification is presently limited to
the resolution of certain allegedly "common" liability issues.  (CENTRAL
WESLEYAN COLLEGE V. W.R. GRACE & CO., ET AL., U.S.D.C. S.C.).  On December 23,
1992, a case was filed in state court in South Carolina purporting to be a
"voluntary" class action on behalf of owners of all buildings containing certain
types of asbestos-containing products manufactured by the nine named defendants,
including U.S. Gypsum, other than buildings owned by the federal or state
governments, single family residences, or buildings at issue in the four
above-described class actions (ANDERSON COUNTY HOSPITAL V. W.R. GRACE & CO., ET
AL., Court of Common Pleas, Hampton Co., S.C. (the "ANDERSON CASE").  On January
14, 1993, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that added a number of claims
and defendants, including USG Corporation.  The amended complaint alleges, among
other things, that the guarantees executed by U.S. Gypsum in connection with the
1988 Recapitalization, as well as subsequent distributions of cash from U.S.
Gypsum to the Corporation, rendered U.S. Gypsum insolvent and constitute a
fraudulent conveyance.  The suit seeks to set aside the guarantees and recover
the value of the cash flow "diverted" from U.S. Gypsum to the Corporation in an
amount to be determined.  This case has not been certified as a class action and
no other threshold issues, including whether the  South Carolina Courts have
personal jurisdiction over the Corporation, have been decided.  The damages
claimed against U.S. Gypsum in the class action cases are unspecified.  U.S.
Gypsum has denied the substantive allegations of each of the Property Damage
Cases and intends



                                       41

<PAGE>

to defend them vigorously except when advantageous settlements are possible.

          As of December 31, 1993, 61 Property Damage Cases were pending against
U.S. Gypsum; however, the number of buildings involved is greater than the
number of cases because many of these cases, including the class actions
referred to above, involve multiple buildings.  In addition, approximately 42
property damage claims have been threatened against U.S. Gypsum.

          In total, U.S. Gypsum has settled property damage claims of
approximately 191 plaintiffs involved in approximately 75 cases.  Twenty-five
cases have been tried to verdict, 16 of which were won by U.S. Gypsum and 6
lost; two other cases, one won at the trial level and one lost, were settled
during appeals.  Another case that was lost at the trial court level has been
reversed on appeal and a new trial ordered.  Appeals are pending in 5 of the
tried cases.  In the cases lost, compensatory damage awards against U.S. Gypsum
have totaled $11.5 million.  Punitive damages totalling $5.5 million were
entered against U.S. Gypsum in four trials.  Two of the punitive damage awards,
totalling $1.45 million, were paid after appeals were exhausted; a third was
settled after the verdict was reversed on appeal.  The remaining punitive damage
award is on appeal.

          In 1991, 13 new Property Damage Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum,
11 were dismissed before trial, 8 were settled, 2 were closed following trial or
appeal, and 100 were pending at year-end.  U.S. Gypsum expended $22.2 million
for the defense and resolution of Property Damage Cases and received insurance
payments of $13.8 million in 1991.  During 1992, 7 new Property Damage Cases
were filed against U.S. Gypsum, 10 were dismissed before trial, 18 were settled,
3 were closed following trial or appeal, and 76 were pending at year-end.  U.S.
Gypsum expended $34.9 million for the defense and resolution of Property Damage
Cases and received insurance payments of $10.2 million in 1992.  In 1993, 5 new
Property Damage Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum, 7 were dismissed before
trial, 11 were settled, 1 was closed following trial or appeal, 2 were
consolidated into 1, and 61 were pending at year-end.  U.S. Gypsum expended
$13.9 million for the defense and resolution of Property Damage Cases and
received insurance payments of $7.6 million in 1993.

          In the Property Damage Cases litigated to date, a defendant's
liability for compensatory damages, if any, has been limited to damages
associated with the presence and quantity of asbestos-containing products
manufactured by that defendant which are identified in the buildings at issue,
although plaintiffs in some cases have argued that principles of joint and
several liability should apply.  Because of the unique factors inherent in each
of the Property Damage Cases, including the lack of reliable information as to
product identification and the amount of damages claimed against U.S. Gypsum in
many cases, including the class actions described above, management is unable to
make a reasonable estimate of the cost of disposing of pending Property Damage
Cases.


PERSONAL INJURY CASES

          U.S. Gypsum was among numerous defendants in asbestos personal injury
suits and administrative claims involving approximately 59,000 claimants pending
as of December 31, 1993.  All asbestos bodily injury claims pending in the
federal courts, including approximately one-third of the Personal Injury Cases
pending against U.S. Gypsum, have been consolidated in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

          U.S. Gypsum is a member, together with 19 other former producers of
asbestos-containing products, of the




                                       42

<PAGE>

Center for Claims Resolution (the "CENTER").  The Center has assumed the
handling, including the defense and settlement, of all Personal Injury Cases
pending against U.S. Gypsum and the other members of the Center.  Each member of
the Center is assessed a portion of the liability and defense costs of the
Center for the Personal Injury Cases handled by the Center, according to
predetermined allocation formulas.  Five of U.S. Gypsum's insurance carriers
that in 1985 signed an Agreement Concerning Asbestos-Related Claims (the
"WELLINGTON AGREEMENT") are supporting insurers (the "SUPPORTING INSURERS") of
the Center.  The Supporting Insurers are obligated to provide coverage for the
defense and indemnity costs of the Center's members pursuant to the coverage
provisions in the Wellington Agreement.  Claims for punitive damages are
defended but not paid by the Center; if punitive damages are recovered,
insurance coverage may be available under the Wellington Agreement depending on
the terms of particular policies and applicable state law.  Punitive damages
have not been awarded against U.S. Gypsum in any of the Personal Injury Cases.
Virtually all of U.S. Gypsum's personal injury liability and defense costs are
paid by those of its insurance carriers that are Supporting Insurers.  The
Supporting Insurers provided approximately $350 million of the total coverage
referred to above, of which approximately $262 million remains unexhausted.

          On January 15, 1993, U.S. Gypsum and the other members of the Center
were named as defendants in a class action filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (GEORGINE ET AL. V. AMCHEM PRODUCTS INC.,
ET AL., Case No. 93-CV-0215) (hereinafter "GEORGINE," formerly known as
"CARLOUGH").  The complaint generally defines the class of plaintiffs as all
persons who have been occupationally exposed to asbestos-containing products
manufactured by the defendants and who had not filed an asbestos personal injury
suit as of the date of the filing of the class action.  Simultaneously with the
filing of the class action, the parties filed a settlement agreement in which
the named plaintiffs, proposed class counsel, and the defendants agreed to
settle and compromise the claims of the proposed class.  The settlement, if
approved by the court, will implement for all future Personal Injury Cases,
except as noted below, an administrative compensation system to replace judicial
claims against the defendants, and will provide fair and adequate compensation
to future claimants who can demonstrate exposure to asbestos-containing products
manufactured by the defendants and the presence of an asbestos-related disease.
Class members will be given the opportunity to "opt out," or elect to be
excluded from the settlement, although the defendants reserve the right to
withdraw from the settlement if the number of opt outs is, in their sole
judgment, excessive.  In addition, in each year a limited number of claimants
will have certain rights to prosecute their claims for compensatory (but not
punitive) damages in court in the event they reject the compensation offered by
the administrative processing of their claim.

          The Center members, including U.S. Gypsum, have instituted proceedings
against those of their insurance carriers that had not consented to support the
settlement, seeking a declaratory judgment that the settlement is reasonable
and, therefore, that the carriers are obligated to fund their portion of it.
Consummation of the settlement is contingent upon, among other things, court
approval of the settlement and a favorable ruling in the declaratory judgment
proceedings against the non-consenting insurers.  It is anticipated that appeals
will follow the district court's ruling on the fairness and reasonableness of
the settlement.

          Each of the defendants has committed to fund a defined portion of the
settlement, up to a stated maximum amount, over the initial ten year period of
the agreement (which is automatically extended unless terminated by the
defendants).  Taking into account the provisions of the settlement agreement
concerning the maximum number of claims that must be processed in each year and
the total amount to be made available to the claimants, the Center estimates
that U.S. Gypsum will be obligated to fund a maximum of approximately $125
million of the class action settlement, exclusive of expenses, with a maximum
payment of less than $18 million in any single year; of the total



                                       43

<PAGE>

amount of U.S. Gypsum's obligation, all but approximately $7 million is expected
to be paid by U.S. Gypsum's insurance carriers.

          During 1991, approximately 13,100 Personal Injury Cases were filed
against U.S. Gypsum and approximately 6,300 were settled or dismissed.  U.S.
Gypsum incurred expenses of $15.1 million in 1991 with respect to Personal
Injury Cases of which $15.0 million was paid by insurance.  During 1992,
approximately 20,100 Personal Injury Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum and
approximately 10,600 were settled or dismissed.  U.S. Gypsum incurred expenses
of $21.6 million in 1992 with respect to Personal Injury Cases of which $21.5
million was paid by insurance.  During 1993, approximately 26,900 Personal
Injury Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum and approximately 22,900 were
settled or dismissed.  U.S. Gypsum incurred expenses of $34.9 million in 1993
with respect to Personal Injury Cases of which $34.0 million was paid by
insurance.  As of December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, approximately 59,000,
54,000, and 43,000 Personal Injury Cases were outstanding against U.S. Gypsum,
respectively.

          U.S. Gypsum's average settlement cost for Personal Injury Cases over
the past three years has been approximately $1,600 per claim, exclusive of
defense costs.  Management anticipates that its average settlement cost is
likely to increase due to such factors as the possible insolvency of co-
defendants, although this increase may be offset to some extent by other
factors, including the possibility for block settlements of large numbers of
cases and  the apparent increase in the percentage of asbestos personal injury
cases that appear to have been brought by individuals with little or no physical
impairment.  Through the Center, U.S. Gypsum has reached settlements on
approximately 26,700 pending Personal Injury Cases for an amount estimated at
approximately $32 million.  These settlements will be consummated and the cases
closed over a three year period.  In management's opinion, based primarily upon
U.S. Gypsum's experience in the Personal Injury Cases disposed of to date and
taking into consideration a number of uncertainties, it is probable that all
asbestos-related Personal Injury Cases pending against U.S. Gypsum as of
December 31, 1993, can be disposed of for a total amount, including both
indemnity costs and legal fees and expenses, estimated to be between $100
million and $120 million (of which all but $2 million or $5 million,
respectively, is expected to be paid by insurance).  The estimated cost of
resolving pending claims takes into account, among other factors, (i) an
increase in the number of pending claims; (ii) the settlements of certain large
blocks of claims for higher per-case averages than have historically been paid;
(iii) the committed but unconsummated settlements described above; and (iv) a
small increase in U.S. Gypsum's historical settlement average.

          Assuming that the Georgine class action settlement referred to above
is approved substantially in its current form, management estimates, based on
assumptions supplied by the Center, U.S. Gypsum's maximum total exposure in
Personal Injury Cases during the next ten years (the initial term of the
agreement), including liability for pending claims and claims resolved as part
of the class action settlement, as well as defense costs and other expenses, at
approximately $262 million, of which approximately $250 million is expected to
be paid by insurance.  U.S. Gypsum's additional exposure for claims filed by
persons who have opted out of Georgine would depend on the number of such claims
that are filed, which cannot presently be determined.


COVERAGE ACTION

          As indicated above, all of U.S. Gypsum's carriers initially denied
coverage for the Property Damage Cases and the Personal Injury Cases, and U.S.
Gypsum initiated the Coverage Action to establish its right to such coverage.




                                       44

<PAGE>

U.S. Gypsum has voluntarily dismissed the Supporting Insurers referred to above
from the personal injury portion of the Coverage Action because they are
committed to providing personal injury coverage in accordance with the
Wellington Agreement.  U.S. Gypsum's claims against the remaining carriers for
coverage for the Personal Injury Cases have been stayed since 1984.

     On January 7, 1991, the trial court in the Coverage Action ruled on the
applicability of U.S. Gypsum's insurance policies to settlements and one adverse
judgment in eight Property Damage Cases.  The court ruled that the eight cases
were generally covered, and imposed coverage obligations on particular policy
years based upon the dates when the presence of asbestos-containing material was
"first discovered" by the plaintiff in each case.  The court awarded
reimbursement of approximately $6.2 million spent by U.S. Gypsum to resolve the
eight cases.  U.S. Gypsum has appealed the court's ruling with respect to the
policy years available to cover particular claims, and the carriers have
appealed most other aspects of the court's ruling.  The appeal process is likely
to take up to a year or more from the date of this report.

     U.S. Gypsum's experience in the Property Damage Cases suggests that "first
discovery" dates in the eight cases referred to above (1978 through 1985) are
likely to be typical of most pending cases.  U.S. Gypsum's total insurance
coverage for the years 1978 through 1984 is approximately $350 million (after
subtracting insolvencies and discounts given to settling carriers).  However,
some pending cases, as well as some cases filed in the future, may be found to
have first  discovery  dates  later  than August 1, 1984, after which U.S.
Gypsum's insurance policies did not provide coverage for asbestos-related
claims.  In addition, as described below, the first layer excess carrier for the
years 1980 through 1984 is insolvent and U.S. Gypsum may be required to pay
amounts otherwise covered by those and other insolvent policies.  Accordingly,
if the court's ruling is affirmed, U.S. Gypsum will likely be required to bear a
portion of the cost of the property damage litigation.

     Eight carriers, including two of the Supporting Insurers, have settled U.S.
Gypsum's claims for both property damage and personal injury coverage and have
been dismissed from the Coverage Action entirely.  Four of these carriers have
agreed to pay all or a substantial portion of their policy limits to U.S. Gypsum
beginning in 1991 and continuing over the next four years.  Three other excess
carriers, including the two settling Supporting Insurers, have agreed to provide
coverage for the Property Damage Cases and the Personal Injury Cases subject to
certain limitations and conditions, when and if underlying primary and excess
coverage is exhausted.  It cannot presently  be determined when such coverage
might be reached.  Taking into account the above settlements, including
participation of certain of the settling carriers in the Wellington Agreement,
and consumption through December 31, 1993, carriers providing a total of
approximately $90 million of unexhausted insurance have agreed, subject to the
terms of the various settlement agreements, to cover both Personal Injury Cases
and Property Damage Cases.  Carriers providing an additional $250 million of
coverage that was unexhausted as of December 31, 1993 have agreed to cover
Personal Injury Cases under the Wellington Agreement, but continue to contest
coverage for Property Damage Cases and remain defendants in the Coverage
Action. U.S. Gypsum will continue to seek negotiated resolutions with its
carriers in order to minimize the expense and delays of litigation.

     Insolvency proceedings have been instituted against four of U.S. Gypsum's
insurance carriers.  Midland Insurance Company, declared insolvent in 1986,
provided excess insurance ($4 million excess of $1 million excess of $500,000
primary in each policy year) from February 15, 1975 to February 15, 1978;
Transit Casualty Company, declared insolvent in 1985, provided excess insurance
($15 million excess of $1 million primary in each policy year) from August 1,
1980 to December 31, 1985; Integrity Insurance Company, declared insolvent in
1986, provided excess insurance ($10 million quota share of $25 million excess
of $90 million) from August 1, 1983 to July 31,



                                       45

<PAGE>

1984; and American Mutual Insurance Company, declared insolvent in 1989,
provided the primary layer of insurance ($500,000 per year) from February 1,
1963 to April 15, 1971.  It is possible that U.S. Gypsum will be required to pay
a presently indeterminable portion of the costs that would otherwise have been
covered by these policies.  In addition, portions of various policies issued by
Lloyd's and other London market companies between 1966 and 1979 have also become
insolvent;  under the Wellington Agreement, U.S. Gypsum must pay these amounts,
which total approximately $12 million.

     It is not possible to predict the number of additional lawsuits alleging
asbestos-related claims that may be filed against U.S. Gypsum. The number of
Personal Injury Cases pending against U.S. Gypsum has increased in each of the
last several years.  In addition, many Property Damage Cases are still at an
early stage and the potential liability therefrom is consequently uncertain.  In
view of the limited insurance funding currently available for the Property
Damage Cases resulting from the continued resistance by a number of U.S.
Gypsum's insurers to providing coverage, the effect of the asbestos litigation
on the Corporation will depend upon a variety of factors, including the damages
sought in the Property Damage Cases that reach trial prior to the completion of
the Coverage Action, U.S. Gypsum's ability to successfully defend or settle such
cases, and the resolution of the Coverage Action.  As a result, management is
unable to determine whether an adverse outcome in the asbestos litigation will
have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the consolidated
financial position of the Corporation.


ACCOUNTING CHANGE

     Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation will adopt the requirements of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39.  In accordance with
Interpretation No. 39, U.S. Gypsum will record an accrual for its liabilities
for asbestos-related matters which are deemed probable and can be reasonably
estimated, and will separately record an asset equal to the amount of such
liabilities that is expected to be paid by uncontested insurance.  Due to
management's inability to reasonably estimate U.S. Gypsum's liability for
Property Damage Cases and (until the implementation of Georgine is deemed
probable) future Personal Injury Cases, it is presently anticipated that the
liabilities and assets to be recorded in 1994 will relate only to pending
Personal Injury Cases.  This implementation of Interpretation No. 39 is not
expected to have a material impact on reported earnings or net assets.


ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION

     The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have been notified by state
and federal environmental protection agencies of possible involvement as one of
numerous "potentially responsible parties" in a number of so-called "Superfund"
sites in the United States.  In substantially all of these sites, the
involvement of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries is expected to be minimal.
The Corporation believes that appropriate reserves have been established for its
potential liability in connection with all Superfund sites but is continuing to
review its accruals as additional information becomes available.  Such reserves
take into account all known or estimable costs associated with these sites
including site investigations and feasibility costs, site cleanup and
remediation, legal costs, and fines and penalties, if any.  In addition,
environmental costs connected with site cleanups on USG-owned property are also
covered by reserves established in accordance with the foregoing.  The
Corporation believes that neither these matters nor any other known governmental
proceeding regarding environmental matters will have a material adverse effect
upon its earnings or consolidated financial position.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     On January 7, 1994, the Corporation filed a Registration Statement
(Registration No. 33-51845), as amended on February 16, 1994, pertaining to its
planned public offering (the "OFFERING") of 6,000,000 new shares of Common Stock
to be sold by the Corporation and 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock to be sold by
Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund I, L.P.  The Offering is part of a
refinancing strategy which also includes (i) the placement (the "NOTE
PLACEMENT") of $150 million principal amount of Senior 2001 Notes with certain
institutional investors and (ii) certain amendments to the Corporation's Credit
Agreement (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENTS" and, together with the Offering and
Note Placement, the "TRANSACTIONS").  The Credit Agreement Amendments will,
among other things, increase the size of the Corporation's revolving credit
facility by $70 million and amend existing mandatory Bank Term Loan prepayment
provisions to allow the Corporation, upon the achievement of certain financial
tests, to retain additional free cash flow for capital expenditures and the
purchase of its public debt.  Certain Credit Agreement Amendments are contingent
on the consummation of the Offering.

     The Corporation expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the
Offering and the Note Placement, together with approximately $158 million of
existing cash generated from operations to pay $140 million of Bank Term Loans
and to redeem or purchase approximately $260 million aggregate principal amount
of certain other senior debt issues.  The remainder of the net proceeds,
approximately $92 million, will be available for general corporate purposes,
including capital expenditures for cost reduction, capacity improvement and
future growth opportunities.  The following is an unaudited Pro Forma Condensed

GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

     Transactions between geographic areas are accounted for on an
"arm's-length" basis.  No single customer accounted for 4% or
more of consolidated net sales.  Export sales to foreign unaffiliated
customers represent less than 10% of consolidated net sales.

     Intrasegment and intersegment eliminations largely reflect intercompany
sales from U.S. Gypsum to L&W Supply.  Segment operating profit/(loss)
includes all costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved and
an allocation of expenses which benefit more than one segment.  Operating
profit/(loss) in the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993 reflects the
non-cash amortization of Excess Reorganization Value which had the impact of
reducing the operating profit of domestic Gypsum Products by $51 million,
domestic Interior Systems by $60 million and Building Products Distribution by
$2 million.

     To assist the reader in evaluating the profitability of each geographic
and industry segment, EBITDA is shown separately in the following tables.
EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and
amortization.  For the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993, the
Corporation also added back non-cash postretirement charges and an
extraordinary loss.  The Corporation believes EBITDA is helpful in
understanding cash flow generated from operations that is available for taxes,
debt service and capital expenditures.  In addition, EBITDA facilitates the
monitoring of covenants related to certain long-term debt and other agreements
entered into in conjunction with the Restructuring.  EBITDA should not be
considered by investors as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of
the Corporation's operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of its
overall liquidity.

SUBSIDIARY DEBT GUARANTEES

     The Corporation issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Senior
2002 Notes in May 1993 and an additional $138 million aggregate principal amount
of similar notes in August 1993.  Each of U.S. Gypsum, USG Industries, Inc., USG
Interiors, USG Foreign Investments, Ltd., L&W Supply, Westbank Planting Company,
USG Interiors International, Inc., American Metals Corporation and La Mirada
Products Co., Inc. (together, the "COMBINED GUARANTORS") guaranteed, in the
manner described below, both the obligations of the Corporation under the Credit
Agreement and the Senior 2002 Notes.  The Combined Guarantors are jointly and
severally liable under the Subsidiary Guarantees.  Holders of the Bank Debt have
the right to (i) determine whether, when and to what extent the guarantees will
be enforced (provided that each guarantee payment will be applied to the Bank
Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, Capitalized Interest Notes and Senior 2002
Notes pro rata based on the respective amounts owed thereon) and (ii) amend or
eliminate the guarantees.  The guarantees will terminate when the Bank Term
Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Capitalized Interest Notes are
retired regardless of whether any Senior 2002 Notes remain unpaid.  The
liability of each of the Combined Guarantors on its guarantee is limited to the
greater of (i) 95% of the lowest amount, calculated as of July 13, 1988,
sufficient to render the guarantor insolvent, leave the guarantor with
unreasonably small capital or leave the guarantor unable to pay its debts as
they become due (each as defined under applicable law) and (ii) the same amount,
calculated as of the date any demand for payment under such guarantee is made,
in each case plus collection costs.  The guarantees are senior obligations of
the applicable guarantor and rank PARI PASSU with all unsubordinated obligations
of the guarantor.

     There are 43 Non-Guarantors (the "COMBINED NON-GUARANTORS"), substantially
all of which are subsidiaries of Guarantors.  The Combined Non-Guarantors
primarily include CGC, Gypsum Transportation Limited, USG Canadian Mining Ltd.
and the Corporation's Mexican, European and Pacific subsidiaries.  The long-term
debt of the Combined Non-Guarantors of $24 million as of December 31, 1993 has
restrictive covenants that restrict, among other things, the payment of
dividends.

  The following condensed consolidating information presents:

  (i)  Condensed financial statements as of December 31, 1993 and for the period
       of May 7 through December 31, 1993 of: (a) the Corporation on a parent
       company only basis (the "PARENT COMPANY," which was the only entity of
       the Corporation included in the bankruptcy proceeding); (b) the Combined
       Guarantors; (c) the Combined Non-Guarantors; and (d) the Corporation on a
       consolidated basis.  Due to the Restructuring and implementation of fresh
       start accounting, the financial statements for the restructured company
       (periods after May 6, 1993) are not comparable to those of the
       predecessor

            separate financial information with respect to the Combined
            Guarantors is omitted as such separate financial information is not
            deemed material to investors.

     (ii)   The Parent Company and Combined Guarantors shown with their
            investments in their subsidiaries accounted for on the equity
            method.

     (iii)  Elimination entries necessary to consolidate the Parent Company and

                                MANAGEMENT REPORT

  Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the financial
statements and related notes included herein.  These statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, of
necessity, include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates
and judgments.

  The Corporation's accounting systems include internal controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial records and the
proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such controls are based on
established policies and procedures, are implemented by trained personnel, and
are monitored through an internal audit program.  The Corporation's policies and
procedures prescribe that the Corporation and its subsidiaries are to maintain
ethical standards and that its business practices are to be consistent with
those standards.

  The Audit Committee of the Board, consisting solely of outside Directors of
the Corporation, maintains an ongoing appraisal, on behalf of the stockholders,
of the effectiveness of the independent auditors and management with respect to
the preparation of financial statements, the adequacy of internal controls and
the Corporation's accounting policies.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





To the Stockholders and Board
  of Directors of USG Corporation:

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of USG
Corporation (Restructured Company), a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1993 and the related consolidated statements of earnings and
cash flows for the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

  We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  As discussed in Notes to Financial Statements - "Financial Restructuring"
note, on May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed a comprehensive financial
restructuring through the implementation of a prepackaged plan of reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and applied fresh start
accounting.  As such, results of operations through May 6, 1993 (Predecessor
Company) are not comparable with results of operations subsequent to that date.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of USG Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

  As discussed in Notes to Financial Statements - "Litigation" note, in view of
the limited insurance funding currently available for property damage cases
resulting from the continued resistance by a number of U.S. Gypsum's insurers to
providing coverage, the effect of the asbestos litigation on the Corporation
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the damages sought in property
damage cases that reach trial prior to the completion of the coverage action,
U.S. Gypsum's ability to successfully defend or settle such cases, and the
resolution of the coverage action.  As a result, management is unable to
determine whether an adverse outcome in the asbestos litigation will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or the
consolidated financial position of the Corporation.

  In accordance with fresh start accounting, the Corporation adjusted its
property, plant and equipment accounts as of May 6, 1993 to fair market value.

  Detailed information regarding additions and deductions is omitted as neither
total additions nor total deductions during the period shown above exceeded 10%
of the balance at the end of the period.  Total additions were $29 million,
total deductions were $8 million and other adjustments increased property, plant
and equipment by $2 million in the period of May 7 through December 31, 1993.

  Total deductions include the effect of foreign currency translation which
increased total deductions by $5 million in the period of May 7 through December
31, 1993.

  Upon retirement or other disposition of property, the applicable cost and
accumulated depreciation and depletion are removed from the accounts.  Any gains
and losses are included in earnings.

  In accordance with fresh start accounting, the Corporation adjusted its
property, plant and equipment accounts as of May 6, 1993 to fair market value.
Consequently, there were no reserves for depreciation and depletion as of May 7,
1993.

  Detailed information regarding additions and deductions is omitted as neither
total additions nor total deductions of property, plant and equipment (see
Schedule V) during the period shown above exceeded 10% of the balance of
property, plant and equipment at the end of the period.  Total provisions for
depreciation and depletion were $34 million, total deductions were $1 million
and other adjustments increased reserves by $3 million in the period of May 7
through December 31, 1993.

  Upon retirement or other disposition of property, the applicable cost and
accumulated depreciation and depletion are removed from the accounts.  Any gains
and losses are included in earnings.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
       WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES



     We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial statements of USG Corporation (Restructured Company)
included in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January 31,
1994.  Our report on the consolidated financial statements includes an
explanatory paragraph with respect to the asbestos litigation as discussed in
Notes to Financial Statements - "Litigation" note.  Our audit was made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.  The supplemental note and financial statement schedules on pages 54
through 59 are the responsibility of the Corporation's management and are
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and are not part of the basic financial statements.  The
supplemental note and financial statement schedules have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and,
in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   (TERMS IN INITIAL CAPITAL LETTERS ARE DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K)


PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions.  Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products.  Net
currency translation gains or losses on foreign subsidiaries are included in
deferred currency translation, a component of stockholders' equity, except for
the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, for which Mexican currency
translation losses were charged to earnings.  Purchased goodwill, which was
written off in accordance with the implementation of fresh start accounting, was
previously being amortized over a period of 40 years.  See "Fresh Start
Accounting" note below for more information on the implementation of fresh start
accounting.

     For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows, all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.


FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING

     On May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed a comprehensive restructuring of
its debt (the "RESTRUCTURING") through implementation of a "prepackaged" plan of
reorganization (the "PREPACKAGED PLAN").  The provisions of the Prepackaged Plan
were agreed upon in principle with all committees and certain institutions
representing debt subject to the Restructuring in January 1993.  The
Corporation's Registration Statement (Registration No. 33-40136), which included
a Disclosure Statement and Proxy Statement - Prospectus, was declared effective
by the SEC in February 1993.  The solicitation process for approvals of the
Prepackaged Plan was completed on March 15, 1993.  The Corporation commenced a
prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in Delaware (IN RE: USG CORPORATION, Case
No. 93-300) on March 17, 1993 and received the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's
confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan on April 23, 1993.  None of the
subsidiaries of the Corporation were part of this proceeding and there was no
impact on trade creditors of the Corporation's subsidiaries.  Under the
Prepackaged Plan, all previously existing defaults were waived or cured.

     The following summary of the major provisions of the Prepackaged Plan is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed information
appearing in the Disclosure Statement.

(a)  The Prepackaged Plan provided for a one-for-50 reverse stock split (the
     "REVERSE STOCK SPLIT") which was effected immediately prior to the
     distribution of new common stock (the "NEW COMMON STOCK") pursuant to the
     Prepackaged Plan.  On May 6, 1993, after giving effect to the Reverse Stock
     Split, the following distributions were made to holders of the following
     securities of the Corporation:

     (i)  For each $1,000 principal amount of 13 1/4% senior subordinated
          debentures due 2000 (the "OLD SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES")
          (excluding accrued interest thereon, which was cancelled), the holder
          received 50.81 shares of New Common Stock.  As of May 6, 1993, the
          total principal amount of the Old Senior Subordinated Debentures was
          $600 million.

     (ii) For each $1,000 principal amount of 16% junior subordinated debentures
          due 2008 (the "OLD JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES") (excluding accrued
          interest thereon, which was cancelled), the holder received 11.61
          shares of New Common Stock and 5.42 Warrants.  As of May 6, 1993, the
          total principal amount of Old Junior Subordinated Debentures was $533
          million, of which $480 million was




                                       64

<PAGE>

          subject to the distribution.

     Stockholders existing prior to the distribution of New Common Stock
     retained their shares of Common Stock, subject to the Reverse Stock Split.
     After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split and distribution of New
     Common Stock, there were 37,157,458 shares of Common Stock outstanding on
     May 6, 1993, of which the shares held by stockholders existing prior to
     such distribution represented 3% of the total number of outstanding shares.
     If all Warrants were exercised, the aggregate holdings of Old Senior
     Subordinated Debenture holders, Old Junior Subordinated Debenture holders
     and previously existing stockholders would represent 76.7%, 20.6% and 2.7%,
     respectively, of the total number of outstanding shares.

(b)  For each $1,000 principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due 1991 (the "OLD
     SENIOR 1991 NOTES"), the holder received $750 principal amount of 8% senior
     notes due 1995 (the "SENIOR 1995 NOTES") and $250 principal amount of 9%
     senior notes due 1998 (the "SENIOR 1998 NOTES").  As of May 6, 1993, the
     total principal amount of the Old Senior 1991 Notes was $100 million.  In
     addition, the Corporation issued $10 million principal amount of Senior
     1998 Notes to two institutional holders of existing 8% senior notes due
     1996 (the "SENIOR 1996 NOTES") in exchange for an equal principal amount
     thereof.  The Senior 1995 and 1998 Notes are secured, with certain other
     indebtedness of the Corporation and subject to a collateral trust
     arrangement controlled primarily by holders of the Banks' claims, by first
     priority security interests in the capital stock of certain subsidiaries of
     the Corporation.

(c)  Pursuant to the Prepackaged Plan, modifications were made to a credit
     agreement dated as of July 1, 1988 (the "OLD CREDIT AGREEMENT") with the
     Bank Group.  The modifications, reflected in the Credit Agreement, are
     summarized as follows:  (i) issuance of $340 million of Senior 2002 Notes
     in exchange for $300 million principal amount of Bank Term Loans, $24
     million of accrued but unpaid interest on the Bank Term Loan and $16
     million owed in connection with certain interest rate swap contracts; (ii)
     extension of the final maturity of the remaining principal outstanding on
     the Bank Term Loan ($540 million) from 1996 to 2000 and deferral of any
     scheduled principal payments until December 1994; (iii) issuance of $56
     million of Capitalized Interest Notes bearing annual interest at LIBOR plus
     2 1/4% (or Citibank's base rate plus 1 1/4%) in exchange for $51 million of
     accrued but unpaid interest on the Bank Debt and $5 million in additional
     amounts owed in connection with interest rate swap contracts; (iv) making
     available (at the Corporation's option but subject to certain limitations
     on the availability of LIBOR) an annual interest rate applicable to the
     Bank Term Loan and an extended revolving credit facility of LIBOR plus 1
     7/8% (or Citibank's base rate plus  7/8%), with the option to issue
     additional Capitalized Interest Notes for the amount of such interest in
     excess of LIBOR plus 1% per annum; (v) provision for an excess cash flow
     sweep that will take into account certain liquidity thresholds; (vi)
     suspension of all financial covenants through January 1, 1995 and providing
     for new covenants thereafter; and (vii) extension to 1998 of the maturity
     date of and establishment of a maximum borrowing capacity of $175 million
     under the Revolving Credit Facility, including a $110 million letter of
     credit subfacility.  Capitalized Interest Notes of $47 million were
     allocated as term capitalized interest notes maturing in 2000, being direct
     obligations of the Corporation, and $9 million of the Capitalized Interest
     Notes were allocated as revolver capitalized interest notes maturing in
     1998, being direct obligations of USG Interiors.

  The Corporation deferred certain principal and interest payments in order to
maintain adequate liquidity during the Restructuring process.  These payment
deferrals constituted defaults under the applicable loan agreements and
indentures, which were waived or cured on May 6, 1993.

FRESH START ACCOUNTING

  The Corporation accounted for the Restructuring using the principles of fresh
start accounting as required by SOP 90-7.  Pursuant to such principles, in
general, the Corporation's assets and liabilities were revalued.  Total assets
were stated at the reorganization value of the Corporation following the
Restructuring.  The Corporation primarily used "net present value" and
"comparable companies" approaches to determine reorganization value (the
"REORGANIZATION VALUE").  In the net present value approach, projected,
unleveraged after-tax cash flows of the Subsidiaries and corporate operations
through 1995 were discounted at rates approximating the Corporation's adjusted
weighted average cost of capital.  Terminal value was determined by capitalizing
the 1995 projected results.  Liabilities were stated at fair market value.  The
difference between the Reorganization Value of the assets and the fair market
value of the liabilities was recorded as stockholders' equity with retained
earnings restated to zero.

  In accordance with SOP 90-7, individual assets and liabilities were adjusted
to fair market value as of May 6, 1993.  The portion of the Reorganization Value
not attributable to specific assets ("EXCESS REORGANIZATION VALUE") will be
amortized over a five year period.  Adjustments were made to the historical
balances of inventory, property, plant and equipment, purchased goodwill, long-
term debt, various accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

  A one-time after-tax charge of $150 million was recorded in the first quarter
of 1993 representing the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
("SFAS") No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," - $180 million, partially offset by the adoption of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," - $30 million.  See "Postretirement Benefits" and
"Taxes on Income and Deferred Taxes" notes for information on the adoption of
these standards.  Neither of these standards impact cash flow.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

  Results for DAP are set forth separately as discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary data schedules
up to September 20, 1991, the completion date of the sale of the business and
substantially all of the assets.  Operating results for DAP in 1991 included net
sales of $128 million, taxes on income of $1 million and breakeven net earnings.

  In the second quarter of 1991, the Corporation absorbed an expense provision
of $20 million related to the disposition of DAP, net of related income tax
expense of $8 million.  An expense provision of $41 million, net of a related
income tax benefit of $2 million, was previously recorded in the fourth quarter
of 1990.  Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately $84
million.  In connection with the execution of the DAP sale agreement, the Banks
consented to the sale as required under the Old Credit Agreement subject to an
agreement by the Corporation and DAP to deposit the proceeds in a bank account
to be held exclusively for use in the Restructuring.  As a result, these funds,
and interest earned on these funds, were maintained on an interim basis in a
restricted bank account and were classified as restricted cash in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet until their release in connection with the
Restructuring.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

  Research and development expenditures are charged to earnings as incurred and
amounted to $4 million, $14 million and $12 million in the period of January 1
through May 6, 1993 and in the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.


TAXES ON INCOME AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

  Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes."  The cumulative effect as of January 1, 1993 of adopting SFAS
No. 109 was a one-time benefit to first quarter 1993 net earnings of $30
million, primarily due to adjusting deferred taxes from historical to current
tax rates.  Financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 1993 have not
been restated to reflect the adoption of this standard.

  Earnings/(loss) from continuing operations before taxes on income,
extraordinary gain and changes in accounting principles consisted of the

     A valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets relating to
pension and retiree medical benefits due to the long-term nature of their
realization.  Because of the uncertainty regarding the application of the Code
to the Corporation's NOL Carryforwards as a result of the Prepackaged Plan, no
deferred tax asset is recorded.

     The Corporation has NOL Carryforwards of $113 million remaining from 1992
after a reduction due to cancellation of indebtedness from the Prepackaged Plan.
These NOL Carryforwards may be used to offset U.S. taxable income through 2007.
The Code will limit the Corporation's annual use of its NOL Carryforwards to the
lesser of its taxable income or approximately $30 million plus any unused limit
from prior years.  Furthermore, due to the uncertainty regarding the application
of the Code to the exchange of stock for debt, the Corporation's NOL
Carryforwards could be further reduced or eliminated.  The Corporation has a $3
million minimum tax credit which may be used to offset U.S. regular tax
liability in future years.

     During 1991 and 1992, deferred income taxes resulted from certain items
being treated differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax
purposes.  The tax effect of such differences is summarized as follows (dollars
in millions):

     The Corporation does not provide for U.S. Federal income taxes on the
portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are intended to
be permanently reinvested.  The cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings
totaled approximately $75 million as of May 6, 1993.  Any future repatriation of
undistributed earnings would not, in the opinion of management, result in
significant additional taxes.


INVENTORIES

     In accordance with the implementation of fresh start accounting,
inventories were stated at fair market value as of May 6, 1993.  Most of the
Corporation's domestic and Mexican inventories are valued under the LIFO method.
As of May 6, 1993, the LIFO values of these inventories were $103 million and
would have been the same if they were valued under the FIFO and average
production cost methods.  Inventories valued under the LIFO method totaled $72
million as of December 31, 1992 and would have been $25 million higher if they
were valued under the FIFO and average production cost methods.  The remaining
inventories as of December 31, 1992 were stated at the lower of cost or market,
under the FIFO or average production cost methods.  Inventories include

     The LIFO value of U.S. domestic inventories under fresh start accounting
exceeded that computed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes by $26 million as of
May 6, 1993.  As of December 31, 1992, the LIFO value of USG Interiors'
inventories acquired under the purchase method exceeded that computed for U.S.
Federal income tax purposes by $6 million.


PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

     Property, plant and equipment were stated at fair market value as of May 6,
1993 in accordance with fresh start accounting and at cost as of December 31,
1992.  Provisions for depreciation are determined principally on a straight-line
basis over the expected average useful lives of composite asset groups.
Depletion is computed on a basis calculated to spread the cost of gypsum and
other applicable resources over the estimated quantities of material
recoverable.  Interest during construction is capitalized on major property
additions.  Property, plant and equipment classifications were as follows

</TABLE>


     As of May 6, 1993, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had $1,556 million
total principal amount of debt (before unamortized reorganization discount) on a
consolidated basis.  Of such total debt, $118 million represented direct
borrowings by the subsidiaries, including $38 million of industrial revenue
bonds, $41 million of 7 7/8% sinking fund debentures issued by U.S. Gypsum in
1974 and subsequently assumed by the Corporation on a joint and several basis in
1985, $33 million of debt (primarily project financing) incurred by the
Corporation's foreign subsidiaries other than CGC, $4 million of working capital
borrowings by CGC, and $3 million of other long-term borrowings by CGC.

     Throughout the Restructuring process (from December 31, 1990 through May 6,
1993), most long-term debt issues were included in current liabilities due to
various defaults upon certain of the debt issues which allowed for the possible
triggering of acceleration and cross-acceleration provisions.  Upon consummation
of the Prepackaged Plan, all previously existing defaults were waived or cured
and long-term debt included in current liabilities was treated in accordance
with the Prepackaged Plan as described in "Financial Restructuring" note above.

     The Bank Debt and most other senior debt are secured by a pledge of all of
the shares of the Corporation's



                                       73

<PAGE>

major domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the shares of certain of its foreign
subsidiaries, including CGC, pursuant to a collateral trust arrangement
controlled primarily by holders of the Bank Debt.  The rights of the Corporation
and its creditors to the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter's liquidation
or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's
creditors, except to the extent that the Corporation may itself be a creditor
with enforceable claims against such subsidiary.  The average rate of interest
on the Bank Term Loan, excluding default interest which was cured or waived in
accordance with the Prepackaged Plan, was 6.5% in the period of January 1
through May 6, 1993.  The rate of interest on the Capitalized Interest Notes
issued on May 6, 1993 in connection with the provisions of the Prepackaged Plan
was 5.4% based on LIBOR plus 2 1/4%.

     The "Other Secured Debt" category shown in the table above primarily
includes short-term and long-term borrowings from several foreign banks by USG
International used principally to finance construction of the Aubange, Belgium
ceiling tile plant.  This debt is secured by a lien on the assets of the Aubange
plant and has restrictive covenants that restrict, among other things, the
payment of dividends.  Foreign borrowings made by the Corporation's
international operations are generally allowed, within certain limits, under
provisions of the Credit Agreement.

     In general, the Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, mergers, asset dispositions, investments,
prepayment of other debt, dealings with affiliates, capital expenditures,
payment of dividends and lease commitments.

     The fair market value of debt as of May 6, 1993 was $1,421 million, based
on estimates of fair market value calculated in connection with implementation
of fresh start accounting, excluding other secured debt, primarily representing
financing for construction of the Aubange plant that is secured by a direct lien
on its assets, which was not practicable to estimate.  As of December 31, 1992,
the fair market value of debt amounted to $679 million, based on indicative bond
prices as of that date excluding the following items which were not practicable
to estimate: (i) the bank debt for which there was no active market; (ii) the 7
7/8% senior debentures due 2004 virtually all of which were owned by a single
investment group; and (iii) the other secured debt which primarily represented
financing for construction of the Aubange plant as described above.


PENSION PLANS

     The Corporation and most of its subsidiaries have defined benefit
retirement plans for all eligible employees.  Benefits of the plans are
generally based on years of service and employees' compensation during the last
years of employment.  The Corporation's contributions are made in accordance
with independent actuarial reports which,



                                       74

<PAGE>

for most plans, required minimal funding in the period of January 1 through May
6, 1993 and the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991.  Net pension
expense/(benefit) included the following components (dollars in millions):

the accumulated benefit obligation was 8% and 9% as of May 6, 1993 and December
31, 1992, respectively.  The rate of increases in projected future compensation
levels was 5.5% for the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 and the year
ended December 31, 1992.  The unrecognized cost of retroactive benefits granted
by plan amendments was being amortized over 13 years as of December 31, 1992.


POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     The Corporation maintains plans that provide retiree health care and life
insurance benefits for all eligible employees.  Employees generally become
eligible for the retiree benefit plans when they meet minimum retirement age and
service requirements.  The cost of providing most of these benefits is shared
with retirees.

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," for its
retiree benefit plans.  Under this accounting standard, the Corporation is
required to accrue the estimated cost of retiree benefit payments during
employees' active service period.  The Corporation elected to recognize this
change in accounting principles on the immediate recognition basis.  The
cumulative effect as of January 1, 1993 of adopting SFAS No. 106 was a one-time
after-tax charge to first quarter 1993 net earnings of $180 million.  The
Corporation previously expensed the cost of these benefits, which principally
relate to health care, as claims were incurred.  These costs were $8 million and
$7 million in the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     The following table summarizes the components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993

thereafter.  A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of May 6, 1993 by $18 million and increase the net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 by
$1 million.  The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 8%.


MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE PLAN

  The Performance Plan reserved 8,600,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance
in connection with grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock,
performance shares and performance units.

  In accordance with the Prepackaged Plan, all outstanding stock options (for
3,786,575 shares) were cancelled without consideration, 1,016,090 shares of
restricted and deferred stock were cashed-out pursuant to "change in control"
provisions contained in the Performance Plan, and 25,580 shares (after giving
effect to the Reverse Stock Split) of restricted stock and awards for deferred
stock yet to be issued remained outstanding as a consequence of certain waivers
of the change in control event by senior members of management.

  Limitations on the Performance Plan in accordance with the Prepackaged Plan
provide that: (i) options to purchase a number of shares not to exceed 7.5% of
the number of shares of New Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the Reverse Stock Split and all distributions of New Common Stock
under the Prepackaged Plan will be reserved for management incentives (2,788,350
shares); (ii) a portion of such options (not to exceed 4.5% of such number of
outstanding shares) may be granted immediately upon consummation of the
Prepackaged Plan; (iii) prior to June 22, 1997, the Corporation will not issue,
award or grant, for compensatory purposes, any stock (including restricted and
deferred stock grants and awards), stock options, stock appreciation rights or
other stock-based awards, except for the options described above or as may
otherwise be approved by the Corporation's stockholders; and (iv) reference to
the year "1988" is deleted from the name of the Performance Plan.

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

  On June 6, 1988, the Corporation adopted a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Plan and pursuant to its provisions declared, subject to the consummation of the
1988 Recapitalization, the distribution of one Right upon each new share of
Common Stock issued in the 1988 Recapitalization.  The 1988 Recapitalization
became effective July 13, 1988 and the distribution occurred immediately
thereafter.  The Rights contain provisions which are intended to protect
stockholders in the event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire the Corporation.

  The Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan was terminated in connection with
implementation of the Prepackaged Plan.  On May 6, 1993, the Rights Agreement
was adopted with provisions substantially similar to the old rights except that:
(i) the purchase price of the Rights was reset; (ii) the expiration of the
Rights was extended; (iii) a so-called "flip-in" feature and exchange feature
was added; (iv) certain exemptions were added permitting certain acquisitions
and the continued holding of common shares by Water Street and its affiliates in
excess of the otherwise specified thresholds; (v) the redemption price was
reduced; and (vi) the amendment provision was liberalized.

  Under the terms of the Rights Agreement and subject to certain exceptions for
Water Street and its affiliates,

                                       77
<PAGE>


generally the Rights become exercisable (i) 10 days following the date of a
public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
(an "ACQUIRING PERSON"), other than the Corporation, any employee benefit plan
of the Corporation, any entity holding Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms
of any such plan has beneficial ownership (as defined in the Rights Agreement)
of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock, (ii) 10 days following the
date of a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons (an "ADVERSE PERSON") has beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the
then outstanding Common Stock, the acquisition of which has been determined by
the Board to present an actual threat of an acquisition of the Corporation that
would not be in the best interest of the Corporation's stockholders or (iii) 10
days following the date of commencement of, or public announcement of, a tender
offer or exchange offer for 30% or more of the Common Stock.  When exercisable,
each of the Rights entitles the registered holder to purchase one-hundredth of a
share of a junior participating preferred stock, series C, $1.00 par value per
share, at a price of $35.00 per one-hundredth of a preferred share, subject to
adjustment.

  In the event that the Corporation is the surviving corporation in a merger or
other business combination involving an Acquiring Person or an Adverse Person
and the Common Stock remains outstanding and unchanged or in the event that an
Acquiring Person or an Adverse Person engages in one of a number of self-dealing
transactions specified in the Rights Agreement, proper provision will be made so
that each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or were beneficially
owned (as defined in the Rights Agreement) by the Acquiring Person or the
Adverse Person, as the case may be, on the earliest of the Distribution Date,
the date the Acquiring Person acquires 20% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock or the date the Adverse Person becomes such (which will thereafter be
void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise thereof that
number of shares of Common Stock having a market value at the time of such
transaction of two times the exercise price of the Right.  In addition, under
certain circumstances the Board has the option of exchanging all or part of the
Rights (excluding void Rights) for Common Stock in the manner described in the
Rights Agreement.  The Rights Agreement also contains a so-called "flip-in"
feature which provides that if any person or group of affiliated or associated
persons becomes an Adverse Person, then the provisions of the preceding two
sentences shall apply.


WARRANTS

  On May 6, 1993, a total of 2,602,566 Warrants were issued to holders of the
Old Junior Subordinated Debentures in addition to the shares of Common Stock
issued to such holders, all as provided by the Prepackaged Plan.  Upon issuance,
each of the Warrants entitled the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock
at a purchase price of $16.14 per share, subject to adjustment under certain
events.

  The Warrants are exercisable, subject to applicable securities laws, at any
time prior to May 6, 1998.  Each share of Common Stock issued upon exercise of a
Warrant prior to the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) and
prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights will be accompanied by an

LITIGATION

  One of the Corporation's subsidiaries, U.S. Gypsum, is among numerous
defendants in lawsuits arising out of the manufacture and sale of asbestos-
containing building materials.  U.S. Gypsum sold certain asbestos-containing
products beginning in the 1930's; in most cases the products were discontinued
or asbestos was removed from the product formula by 1972, and no asbestos-
containing products were sold after 1977.  Some of these lawsuits seek to
recover compensatory and in many cases punitive damages for costs associated
with maintenance or removal and replacement of products containing asbestos (the
"PROPERTY DAMAGE CASES").  Others of these suits (the "PERSONAL INJURY CASES")
seek to recover compensatory and in many cases punitive damages for personal
injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos and asbestos-containing
products.  It is anticipated that additional personal injury and property damage
cases containing similar allegations will be filed.

  As discussed below, U.S. Gypsum has substantial personal injury and property
damage insurance for the years involved in the asbestos litigation.  Prior to
1985, when an asbestos exclusion was added to U.S. Gypsum's policies, U.S.
Gypsum purchased comprehensive general liability insurance policies covering
personal injury and property  damage in an aggregate face amount of
approximately $850 million.  Insurers that issued approximately $100 million of
these policies are presently insolvent.  Because U.S. Gypsum's insurance
carriers initially responded to its claims for defense and indemnification with
various theories denying or limiting coverage and the applicability of their
policies, U.S. Gypsum filed a declaratory judgment action against them in the
Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois  on December 29, 1983.  (U.S. GYPSUM CO.
V. ADMIRAL INSURANCE CO., ET AL.) (the "COVERAGE ACTION").  U.S. Gypsum alleges
in the Coverage Action that the carriers are obligated to provide
indemnification for settlements and judgments and, in some cases, defense costs
incurred by U.S. Gypsum in personal injury and property damage cases in which it
is a defendant.  The current defendants are ten insurance carriers that provided
comprehensive general liability insurance coverage to U.S. Gypsum between the
1940's and 1984.  As discussed below, several carriers have settled all or a
portion of the claims in the Coverage Action.

  U.S. Gypsum's aggregate expenditures for all asbestos-related matters,
including property damage, personal injury, insurance coverage litigation and
related expenses, exceeded aggregate insurance payments by $10.9 million and
$25.8 million in the years ended December 31, 1991 and 1992, respectively, and
by $3.8 million in the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993.


PROPERTY DAMAGE CASES

  The Property Damage Cases have been brought against U.S. Gypsum by a variety
of plaintiffs, including school districts, state and local governments, colleges
and universities, hospitals, and private property owners.  U.S. Gypsum is one of
many defendants in four cases that have been certified as class actions and
others that request such certification.  One class action suit is brought on
behalf of owners and operators of all elementary and secondary schools in the
United States that contain or contained friable asbestos-containing material.
(IN RE ASBESTOS SCHOOL LITIGATION, U.S.D.C., E.D. Pa.) Approximately 1,350
school districts opted out of the class, some of which have filed or may file
separate  lawsuits or are participants in a state court class action involving
approximately 333 school districts in Michigan.  (BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE CITY
OF DETROIT, ET AL. V. THE CELOTEX CORP., ET AL., Cir. Ct. for Wayne County,
Mich.)  On April 10, 1992, a state court in Philadelphia certified a class
consisting of all owners of buildings leased to the federal government.  (PRINCE
GEORGE CENTER, INC. V. U.S. GYPSUM CO., ET AL.,


                                       80


<PAGE>



Ct. of Common Pleas, Philadelphia, Pa.)  On September 4, 1992, a Federal
district court in South Carolina conditionally certified a class comprised of
all colleges and universities in the United States, which certification is
presently limited to the resolution of certain allegedly "common" liability
issues.  (CENTRAL WESLEYAN COLLEGE, V. W.R. GRACE & CO., ET AL., U.S.D.C.,
S.C.).  On December 23, 1992, a case was filed in state court in South Carolina
purporting to be a "voluntary" class action on behalf of owners of all buildings
containing certain types of asbestos-containing products manufactured by the
nine named defendants, including U.S. Gypsum, other than buildings owned by the
federal or state governments, single family residences, or buildings at issue in
the four above described class actions (ANDERSON COUNTY HOSPITAL V. W.R. GRACE &
CO., ET AL., Court of Common Pleas, Hampton Co., S.C. (the "ANDERSON CASE").  On
January 14, 1993, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that added a number
of defendants, including the Corporation.  The amended complaint alleges, among
other things, that the guarantees executed by U.S. Gypsum in connection with the
1988 Recapitalization, as well as subsequent distributions of cash from U.S.
Gypsum to the Corporation, rendered U.S. Gypsum insolvent and constitute a
fraudulent conveyance.  The suit seeks to set aside the guarantees and recover
the value of the cash flow "diverted" from U.S. Gypsum to the Corporation in an
amount to be determined.  This case has not been certified as a class action and
no other threshold issues, including whether the  South Carolina Courts have
personal jurisdiction over the Corporation, have been decided.  The damages
claimed against U.S. Gypsum in the class action cases are unspecified.  U.S.
Gypsum has denied the substantive allegations of each of the Property Damage
Cases and intends to defend them vigorously except when advantageous settlements
are possible.

  As of May 6, 1993, 67 Property Damage Cases were pending against U.S. Gypsum;
however, the number of buildings involved is greater than the number of cases
because many of these cases, including the class actions referred to above,
involve multiple buildings.  Approximately 40 property damage claims have been
threatened against U.S. Gypsum.

  In total, U.S. Gypsum has settled property damage claims of approximately 187
plaintiffs involved in approximately 71 cases.  Twenty-two cases have been tried
to verdict, 13 of which were won by U.S. Gypsum and 7 lost; two other cases, one
won at the trial level and one lost, were settled after appeals.  Appeals are
pending in 4 of the tried cases.  In the cases lost, compensatory damage awards
against U.S. Gypsum have totaled $12.5 million.  Punitive damages totaling $5.5
million were entered against U.S. Gypsum in four trials.  Two of the punitive
damage awards, totaling $1.45 million, were paid after appeals were exhausted; a
third was settled after the verdict was reversed on appeal.  The remaining
punitive award is on appeal.

  In 1991, 13 new Property Damage Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum, 11 were
dismissed before trial, 8 were settled, 2 were closed following trial or appeal,
and 100 were pending at year end; U.S. Gypsum expended $22.2 million for the
defense and resolution of Property Damage Cases and received insurance payments
of $13.8 million in 1991.  In 1992, 7 new Property Damage Cases were filed
against U.S. Gypsum, 10 were dismissed before trial, 18 were settled, 3 were
closed following trial or appeal, and 76 were pending at year end.  U.S. Gypsum
expended $34.9 million for the defense and resolution of Property Damage Cases
and received insurance payments of $10.2 million in 1992.  In the period of
January 1 through May 6, 1993, no new Property Damage Cases were filed against
U.S. Gypsum, 2 were dismissed before trial, 7 were settled, and 67 were pending
at the end of the period.  U.S. Gypsum expended $7.0 million for the defense and
resolution of Property Damage Cases and received insurance payments of $3.7
million in the period.

  In the Property Damage Cases litigated to date, a defendant's liability for
compensatory damages, if any, has

                                       81

<PAGE>


been limited to damages associated with the presence and quantity of asbestos-
containing products manufactured by that defendant which are identified in the
buildings at issue, although plaintiffs in some cases have argued that
principles of joint and several liability should apply.  Because of the unique
factors inherent in each of the Property Damage Cases, including the lack of
reliable information as to product identification and the amount of damages
claimed against U.S. Gypsum in many cases, including the class actions described
above, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the cost of
disposing of pending Property Damage Cases.


PERSONAL INJURY CASES

  U.S. Gypsum was among numerous defendants in asbestos personal injury suits
and administrative claims involving 57,645 claimants pending as of May 6, 1993.
All asbestos bodily injury claims pending in the federal courts, including
approximately one-third of the Personal Injury Cases pending against U.S.Gypsum,
have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania.

  U.S. Gypsum is a member, together with 19 other former producers of asbestos-
containing products, of the Center for Claims Resolution (the "CENTER").  The
Center has assumed the handling, including the defense and settlement, of all
Personal Injury Cases pending against U.S. Gypsum and the other members of the
Center.  Each member of the Center is assessed a portion of the liability and
defense costs of the Center for the Personal Injury Cases handled by the Center,
according to predetermined allocation formulas.  Five of U.S. Gypsum's insurance
carriers that in 1985 signed an Agreement Concerning Asbestos-Related Claims
(the "WELLINGTON AGREEMENT") are supporting insurers (the "SUPPORTING INSURERS")
of the Center.  The Supporting Insurers are obligated to provide coverage for
the defense and indemnity costs of the Center's members pursuant to the coverage
provisions in the Wellington Agreement.  Claims for punitive damages are
defended  but not paid by the Center; if punitive damages are recovered,
insurance coverage may be available  under  the  Wellington  Agreement
depending  on  the  terms  of particular policies and applicable state law.
Punitive damages have not been awarded against U.S. Gypsum in any of the
Personal  Injury  Cases.   Virtually all of U.S. Gypsum's personal injury
liability and defense costs are paid by those of its insurance carriers that are
Supporting Insurers.  The Supporting Insurers provided approximately $350
million of the total coverage referred to above.

  On January 15, 1993, U.S. Gypsum and the other members of the Center were
named as defendants in a class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District Pennsylvania (GEORGINE ET AL. V. AMCHEM PRODUCTS INC., ET AL.,
Case No. 93-CV-0215) (hereinafter "GEORGINE," formerly known as "CARLOUGH").
The complaint generally defines the class of plaintiffs as all persons who have
been occupationally exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the
defendants and who had not filed an asbestos personal injury suit as of the date
of the filing of the class action.  Simultaneously with the filing of the class
action, the parties filed a settlement agreement in which the named plaintiffs,
proposed class counsel, and the defendants agreed to settle and compromise the
claims of the proposed class.  The settlement, if approved by the court, will
implement for all future Personal Injury Cases, except as noted below, an
administrative compensation system to replace judicial claims against the
defendants, and will provide fair and adequate compensation to future claimants
who can demonstrate exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the
defendants and the presence of an asbestos-related disease.  Class members will
be given the opportunity to "opt out," or elect to be excluded from the
settlement, although the defendants reserve the right to withdraw from the
settlement if the number of opt outs is, in their sole judgment, excessive.  In
addition, in each year a limited number of claimants will have certain rights to
prosecute their claims

                                       82

<PAGE>


for compensatory (but not punitive) damages in court in the event they reject
compensation offered by the administrative processing of their claim.

  The Center members, including U.S. Gypsum, have instituted proceedings
against those of their insurance carriers that had not consented to support the
settlement, seeking a declaratory judgment that the settlement is reasonable
and, therefore, that the carriers are obligated to fund their portion of it.
Consummation of the settlement is contingent upon, among other things, court
approval of the settlement and a favorable ruling in the declaratory judgment
proceedings against the non-consenting insurers.  It is anticipated that appeals
will follow the district court's ruling on the fairness and reasonableness of
the settlement.

  Each of the defendants has committed to fund a defined portion of the
settlement, up to a stated maximum amount, over the initial ten-year period of
the agreement (which is automatically extended unless terminated by the
defendants).  Taking into account the provisions of the settlement agreement
concerning the maximum number of claims that must be processed in each year and
the total amount to be made available to the claimants, the Center estimates
that U.S. Gypsum will be obligated to fund a maximum of approximately $125
million of the class action settlement, exclusive of expenses, with a maximum
payment of less than $18 million in any single year; of the total amount of U.S.
Gypsum's obligation, all but approximately $13 million or less is expected to be
paid by U.S. Gypsum's insurance carriers.

  During 1991, approximately 13,100 Personal Injury Cases were filed against
U.S. Gypsum and approximately 6,300 were settled or dismissed.  U.S. Gypsum
incurred expenses of $15.1 million in 1991 with respect to Personal Injury
Cases, of which $15.0 million was paid by insurance.  During 1992, approximately
20,100 Personal Injury Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum and approximately
10,600 were settled or dismissed.  U.S. Gypsum incurred expenses of $21.6
million in 1992 with respect to Personal Injury Cases of which $21.5 million was
paid by insurance.  In the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993,
approximately 8,700 Personal Injury Cases were filed against U.S. Gypsum and
approximately 5,300 were settled or dismissed.  U.S. Gypsum incurred expenses of
$10.9 million in the period with respect to Personal Injury Cases of which $10.8
million was paid by insurance.  As of May 6, 1993, December 31, 1992 and
December 31, 1991, approximately 58,000, 54,000 and 43,000 Personal Injury Cases
were outstanding against U.S. Gypsum, respectively.

  U.S. Gypsum's average settlement cost for Personal Injury Cases over the past
three years has been approximately $1,350 per claim, exclusive of defense costs.
Management anticipates that its average settlement cost is likely to increase
due to such factors as the possible insolvency of co-defendants, although this
increase may be offset to some extent by other factors, including the
possibility for block settlements of large numbers of cases and  the apparent
increase in the percentage of asbestos personal injury cases that appear to have
been brought by individuals with little or no physical impairment.  In
management's opinion, based primarily upon U.S. Gypsum's experience in the
Personal Injury Cases disposed of to date and taking into consideration a number
of uncertainties, it is probable that asbestos-related Personal Injury Cases
pending against U.S. Gypsum as of December 31, 1992, can be disposed of for an
amount estimated to be between $80 million and $100 million, including both
indemnity costs and legal fees and expenses.  The estimated cost of resolving
pending claims takes into account, among other factors, (i) an increase in the
number of pending claims; (ii) the settlements of certain large blocks of claims
for higher per-case averages than have historically been paid; and (iii) a
slight increase in U.S. Gypsum's historical settlement average.  No accrual has
been recorded for this amount because, pursuant to the Wellington Agreement,
U.S. Gypsum's Supporting Insurers are obligated to pay these costs.

                                       83

  Assuming that the Georgine class action settlement referred to above is
approved substantially in its current form, management estimates, based on
assumptions supplied by the Center, U.S. Gypsum's maximum total exposure in
Personal Injury Cases during the next ten years (the initial term of the
agreement), including liability for pending claims, claims resolved as part of
the class action settlement, and opt out claims, as well as defense costs and
other expenses, at approximately $271 million, of which at least $254 million is
expected to be paid by insurance.  U.S. Gypsum's additional exposure for claims
filed by persons who have opted out of Georgine would depend on the number of
such claims that are filed, which cannot presently be determined.


COVERAGE ACTION

  As indicated above, all of U.S. Gypsum's carriers initially denied coverage
for the Property Damage Cases and the Personal Injury Cases, and U.S. Gypsum
initiated the Coverage Action to establish its right to such coverage.  U.S.
Gypsum has voluntarily dismissed the Supporting Insurers referred to above from
the personal injury portion of the Coverage Action because they are committed to
providing personal injury coverage in accordance with the Wellington Agreement.
U.S. Gypsum's claims against the remaining carriers for coverage for the
Personal Injury Cases have been stayed since 1984.

  On January 7, 1991, the trial court in the Coverage Action ruled on the
applicability of U.S. Gypsum's insurance policies to settlements and one adverse
judgment in eight Property Damage Cases.  The court ruled that the eight cases
were generally covered, and imposed coverage obligations on particular policy
years based upon the dates when the presence of asbestos-containing material was
"first discovered" by the plaintiff in each case.  The court awarded
reimbursement of approximately $6.2 million spent by U.S. Gypsum to resolve the
eight cases.  U.S. Gypsum has appealed the court's ruling with respect to the
policy years available to cover particular claims, and the carriers have
appealed most other aspects of the court's ruling.  These appeals are likely to
take a year or more.

  U.S. Gypsum's experience in the Property Damage Cases suggests that "first
discovery" dates in the eight cases referred to above (1978 through 1985) are
likely to be typical of most pending cases.  U.S. Gypsum's total insurance
coverage for the years 1978 through 1984 totals approximately $350 million
(after subtracting insolvencies and discounts given to settling carriers).
However, some pending cases, as well as some cases filed in the future, may be
found to have first  discovery  dates  later  than August 1, 1984, after which
U.S. Gypsum's insurance policies did not provide coverage for asbestos-related
claims.  In addition, as described below, the first layer excess carrier for the
years 1980 through 1984 is insolvent and U.S. Gypsum may be required to pay
amounts otherwise covered by those and other insolvent policies.  Accordingly,
if the court's ruling is affirmed, U.S. Gypsum will likely be required to bear a
portion of the cost of the property damage litigation.

  Eight carriers, including two of the Supporting Insurers, have settled U.S.
Gypsum's claims for both property damage and personal injury coverage and have
been dismissed from the Coverage Action entirely.  Four of these carriers have
agreed to pay all or a substantial portion of their policy limits to U.S. Gypsum
beginning in 1991 and continuing over the next four years.  Three other excess
carriers, including the two settling Supporting Insurers, have agreed to provide
coverage for the Property Damage Cases and the Personal Injury Cases subject to
certain limitations and conditions, when and if underlying primary and excess
coverage is exhausted.  It cannot presently  be determined when such coverage
might be reached.  Taking into account the above settlements, including
participation of certain of the settling carriers in the Wellington Agreement,
and consumption through December 31, 1992, carriers providing a total of
approximately $97 million of unexhausted insurance have agreed, subject to

                                       84

<PAGE>


the terms of the various settlement agreements, to cover both Personal Injury
Cases and Property Damage Cases.  Carriers providing an additional $276 million
of coverage that was unexhausted as of December 31, 1992 have agreed to cover
Personal Injury Cases under the Wellington Agreement, but continue to contest
coverage for Property Damage Cases and remain defendants in the Coverage Action.
U.S. Gypsum will continue to seek negotiated resolutions with its carriers in
order to minimize the expense and delays of litigation.

  Insolvency proceedings have been instituted against four of U.S. Gypsum's
insurance carriers.  Midland Insurance Company, declared insolvent in 1986,
provided excess insurance ($4 million excess of $1 million excess of $500,000
primary in each policy year) from February 15, 1975 to February 15, 1978;
Transit Casualty Company, declared insolvent in 1985, provided excess insurance
($15 million excess of $1 million primary in each policy year) from August 1,
1980 to December 31, 1985; Integrity Insurance Company, declared insolvent in
1986, provided excess insurance ($10 million quota share of $25 million excess
of $90 million) from August 1, 1983 to July 31, 1984; and American Mutual
Insurance Company, declared insolvent in 1989, provided the primary layer of
insurance ($500,000 per year) from February 1, 1963 to April 15, 1971.  It is
possible that U.S. Gypsum will be required to pay a presently indeterminable
portion of the costs that would otherwise have been covered by these policies.

  It is not possible to predict the number of additional lawsuits alleging
asbestos-related claims that may be filed against U.S. Gypsum. The number of
Personal Injury Claims pending against U.S. Gypsum has increased in each of the
last several years.  In addition, many Property Damage Cases are still at an
early stage and the potential liability therefrom is consequently uncertain.  In
view of the limited insurance funding currently available for the Property
Damage Cases resulting from the continued resistance by a number of U.S.
Gypsum's insurers to providing coverage, the effect of the asbestos litigation
on the Corporation will depend upon a variety of factors, including the damages
sought in the Property Damage Cases that reach trial prior to the completion of
the Coverage Action, U.S. Gypsum's ability to successfully defend or settle such
cases, and the resolution of the Coverage Action.  As a result, management is
unable to determine whether an adverse outcome in the asbestos litigation will
have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the consolidated
financial position of the Corporation.


ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION

  The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have been notified by state
and federal environmental protection agencies of possible involvement as one of
numerous "potentially responsible parties" in a number of so-called "Superfund"
sites in the United States.  In substantially all of these sites, the
involvement of the Corporation or its subsidiaries is expected to be minimal.
The Corporation believes that appropriate reserves have been established for its
potential liability in connection with all Superfund sites but is continuing to
review its accruals as additional information becomes available.  Such reserves
take into account all known or estimable costs associated with these sites
including site investigations and feasibility costs, site cleanup and
remediation, legal costs, and fines and penalties, if any.  In addition,
environmental costs connected with site cleanups on USG-owned property are also
covered by reserves established in accordance with the foregoing.  The
Corporation believes that neither these matters nor any other known governmental
proceeding regarding environmental matters will have a material adverse effect
upon its earnings or consolidated financial position.

GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

      Transactions between geographic areas are accounted for on an
"arm's-length" basis.  No single customer accounted for 4% or more of
consolidated net sales.  Export sales to foreign unaffiliated customers
represent less than 10% of consolidated net sales.

      Intrasegment and intersegment eliminations largely reflect intercompany
sales from U.S. Gypsum to L&W Supply.  Segment operating profit/(loss)
includes all costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved and
an allocation of expenses which benefit more than one segment.  Geographic and
industry segment data for 1991 exclude discontinued operations.

      To assist the reader in evaluating the profitability of each geographic
and industry segment, EBITDA is shown separately in the following tables.
EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and
amortization.  For the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993, the
Corporation also added back non-cash postretirement charges, reorganization
items, an extraordinary gain and the cumulative impact of changes in
accounting principles.  The Corporation believes EBITDA is helpful in
understanding cash flow generated from operations that is available for taxes,
debt service and capital expenditures.  In addition, EBITDA facilitates the
monitoring of covenants related to certain long-term debt and other agreements
entered into in conjunction with the Restructuring.  EBITDA should not be
considered by investors as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of
the Corporation's operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of its
overall liquidity.  Certain amounts for 1992 and 1991 have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation.

      Variations in the levels of corporate identifiable assets primarily
reflect fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents.  Restricted
cash of $88 million and $84 million, which represents the proceeds from the
sale of DAP, are included in corporate identifiable assets for 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

SUBSIDIARY DEBT GUARANTEES

   In May 1993, the Corporation issued $340 million aggregate principal amount
of Senior 2002 Notes.  Each of U.S. Gypsum, USG Industries, Inc., USG
Interiors, USG Foreign Investments, Ltd., L&W Supply, Westbank Planting
Company, USG Interiors International, Inc., American Metals Corporation and La
Mirada Products Co., Inc. (together, the "COMBINED GUARANTORS") guaranteed,
in the manner described below, both the obligations of the Corporation under
the Credit Agreement and the Senior 2002 Notes.  The Combined Guarantors are
jointly and severally liable under the Subsidiary Guarantees.  Holders of the
Bank Debt have the right to (i) determine whether, when and to what extent the
guarantees will be enforced (provided that each guarantee payment will be
applied to the Bank Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, Capitalized Interest
Notes and Senior 2002 Notes pro rata based on the respective amounts owed
thereon) and (ii) amend or eliminate the guarantees.  The guarantees will
terminate when the Bank Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility and the
Capitalized Interest Notes are retired regardless of whether any Senior 2002
Notes remain unpaid.  The liability of each of the Combined Guarantors on its
guarantee is limited to the greater of (i) 95% of the lowest amount,
calculated as of July 13, 1988, sufficient to render the guarantor insolvent,
leave the guarantor with unreasonably small capital or leave the guarantor
unable to pay its debts as they become due (each as defined under applicable
law) and (ii) the same amount, calculated as of the date any demand for
payment under such guarantee is made, in each case plus collection costs.  The
guarantees are senior obligations of the applicable guarantor and rank PARI
PASSU with all unsubordinated obligations of the guarantor.

   There are 43 Non-Guarantors (the "COMBINED NON-GUARANTORS"),
substantially all of which are subsidiaries of Guarantors.  The Combined
Non-Guarantors primarily include CGC, Gypsum Transportation Limited, USG
Canadian Mining Ltd. and the Corporation's Mexican, European and Pacific
subsidiaries.  The long-term debt of the Combined Non-Guarantors of $28
million as of May 6, 1993 has restrictive covenants that restrict, among other
things, the payment of dividends.

   The following condensed consolidating information presents:

   (i)  Condensed financial statements as of May 6, 1993 and December 31, 1992
        and for the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993, and the years
        ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 of: (a) the Corporation on a parent
        company only basis (the "PARENT COMPANY," which was the only entity
        of the Corporation included in the bankruptcy proceeding); (b) the
        Combined Guarantors; (c) the Combined Non-Guarantors; and (d) the
        Corporation on a consolidated basis.  Due to the Restructuring and
        implementation of fresh start accounting, the financial statements for
        the restructured company (periods after May 6, 1993) are not
        comparable to those of the predecessor company.  Except for the
        following condensed financial statements, separate financial
        information with respect to the Combined Guarantors is omitted as such
        separate financial information is not deemed material to investors.

   (ii) The Parent Company and Combined Guarantors shown with their
        investments in their subsidiaries accounted for on the equity method.

   (iii)      Elimination entries necessary to consolidate the Parent Company
              and its subsidiaries.

                                MANAGEMENT REPORT

     Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the
financial statements and related notes included herein.  These statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and,
of necessity, include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates
and judgments.

     The Corporation's accounting systems include internal controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial records and the
proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such controls are based on
established policies and procedures, are implemented by trained personnel, and
are monitored through an internal audit program.  The Corporation's policies and
procedures prescribe that the Corporation and its subsidiaries are to maintain
ethical standards and that its business practices are to be consistent with
those standards.

     The Audit Committee of the Board, consisting solely of outside Directors of
the Corporation, maintains an ongoing appraisal, on behalf of the stockholders,
of the effectiveness of the independent auditors and management with respect to
the preparation of financial statements, the adequacy of internal controls and
the Corporation's accounting policies.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board
     of Directors of USG Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of USG
Corporation (Predecessor Company), a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries as
of May 6, 1993 and December 31, 1992 and the related consolidated statements of
earnings and cash flows for the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993 and for
the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As discussed in Notes to Financial Statements - "Financial Restructuring"
and "Fresh Start Accounting" notes, on May 6, 1993, the Corporation completed a
comprehensive financial restructuring through the implementation of a
prepackaged plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code and applied fresh start accounting.  The restructuring resulted
in an extraordinary gain of $944 million, primarily from the exchange of debt,
and fresh start accounting resulted in a $709 million gain, primarily from
revaluing assets and liabilities to reflect reorganization value.  These one-
time credits to income were recorded as of May 6, 1993 by the Predecessor
Company.  As such, results of operations through May 6, 1993 (Predecessor
Company) are not comparable with results of operations subsequent to that date.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of USG Corporation and
subsidiaries as of May 6, 1993 and December 31, 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the period of January 1 through May 6, 1993
and for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in Notes to Financial Statements - "Litigation" note, in view
of the limited insurance funding currently available for property damage cases
resulting from the continued resistance by a number of U.S. Gypsum's insurers to
providing coverage, the effect of the asbestos litigation on the Corporation
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the damages sought in property
damage cases that reach trial prior to the completion of the coverage action,
U.S. Gypsum's ability to successfully defend or settle such cases, and the
resolution of the coverage action.  As a result, management is unable to
determine whether an adverse outcome in the asbestos litigation will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or the
consolidated financial position of the Corporation.

     As discussed in Notes to Financial Statements - "Cumulative Effect of
Changes in Accounting Principles" note, on January 1, 1993 the Corporation
changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions
and accounting for income taxes.

January 1 through May 6, 1993 and $38 million and $6 million in the years ended
December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     Total deductions include the effect of foreign currency translation which
increased total deductions by $1 million in the period of January 1 through May
6, 1993 and by $18 million in the year ended December 31, 1992.  In 1991,
foreign currency translation adjustments decreased total deductions by $1

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
       WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES



     We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial statements of USG Corporation (Predecessor Company)
included in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January 31,
1994.  Our report on the consolidated financial statements includes an
explanatory paragraph with respect to the asbestos litigation as discussed in
Notes to the Financial Statements - "Litigation" note.  Our report on the
consolidated financial statements also includes an explanatory paragraph with
respect to the changes in the methods of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions and accounting for income taxes as discussed in Notes to
Financial Statements - "Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles"
note.  Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental note and financial
statement schedules on pages 97 through 102 are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management and are presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the basic
financial statements.  The supplemental note and financial statement schedules
have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

<FN>

(a)  Due to the Restructuring and implementation of fresh start accounting, the
     financial statements effective May 7, 1993 for the  restructured company
     are not comparable to financial statements prior to that date for the
     predecessor company.

(b)  Effective May 7, 1993, the Corporation began amortizing its Excess
     Reorganization Value. This non-cash amortization reduced operating profit
     and net earnings by $28 million, $43 million and $42 million in the period
     of May 7 through June 30, the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 1993,
     respectively.

(c)  Net loss in the first quarter of 1993 reflects a one-time after-tax net
     charge of $150 million for the cumulative effect of changes in accounting
     principles and a pre-tax reorganization items expense of $69 million. Net
     earnings in the period of April 1 through May 6, 1993 include a one-time
     pre-tax reorganization items gain of $778 million and a one-time after-tax
     extraordinary gain of $944 million, both of which were associated with the
     Restructuring. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 1993 include an
     after-tax extraordinary loss of $21 million related to the Corporation's
     proposed 1994 financing plan.

(d)  Per-share information for periods prior to May 7, 1993 is omitted because,
     due to the Restructuring and implementation of fresh start accounting, it
     is not meaningful.

(e)  Stock price ranges are for transactions on the New York Stock Exchange
     (trading symbol USG), which is the principal market for these securities.
     Stockholders of record as of January 31, 1994: Common - 14,702; Preferred -
     none.

ITEM 9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
          FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

     A Form 8-K reporting a change of accountants has not been filed within
24 months prior to the date of the most recent financial statements.


                                  PART III

ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

     In connection with the consummation of the Prepackaged Plan, the number
of persons comprising the Board was increased by five effective May 6, 1993
which, after the May 1993 retirement of one director whose position was
eliminated, brought the total Board membership to 15.  Of the five New
Directors (the "NEW DIRECTORS"), two, Messrs. Crutcher and Lesser, were
nominated by a committee representing holders of the Corporation's senior
subordinated debentures which were converted into Common Stock under the
Prepackaged Plan (each a "SENIOR SUBORDINATED DIRECTOR"); two, Messrs. Fetzer
and Zubrow, were nominated by Water Street (each a "WATER STREET DIRECTOR");
and one, Mr. Brown, was nominated by a committee  representing holders of the
Corporation's junior subordinated debentures which were converted into Common
Stock and Warrants to purchase Common Stock under the Prepackaged Plan (a
"JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DIRECTOR").

     As the respective terms of office of the New Directors expire, the
Prepackaged Plan provides that each such New Director will be renominated.
If a New Director declines or is unable to accept such nomination, or in the
event a New Director resigns during his term or otherwise becomes unable to
continue his duties as a director, such New Director or, in the case of a
Water Street Director, Water Street, shall recommend his successor to the
Committee on Directors of the Board.  In the event of the death or incapacity
of a New Director, his successor shall be recommended, in the case of a Water
Street Director, by Water Street, in the case of a Senior Subordinated
Director, by the remaining Senior Subordinated Director, and in the case of a
Junior Subordinated Director, by the remaining New Directors.  Any such
nominee shall be subject to approval by the Board's Committee on Directors
and the Board, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     Until June 22, 1997, the time at which the director nomination and
selection procedures established by the Prepackaged Plan terminate, no more
than two employee directors may serve simultaneously on the Board.  An
"employee director" is defined for this purpose as any officer or employee of
the Corporation or any direct or indirect subsidiary, or any director of any
such subsidiary who is not also a director of the Corporation.

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

     The discussion that follows has been prepared based on the actual
compensation paid and benefits provided by the Corporation to the five most
highly compensated executive officers of the Corporation (collectively, the
"NAMED EXECUTIVES"), for services performed during 1993 and the other periods
indicated.  This historical data is not necessarily indicative of the
compensation and benefits that may be provided to such persons in the future.

     In general, the Prepackaged Plan provided for the continuation by the
Corporation of the existing employment, compensation and benefit arrangements.
The Prepackaged Plan resulted in a substantial reduction on May 6, 1993 in the
amounts otherwise potentially payable to the Named Executives in 1994 under the
Corporation's three-year Incentive Recovery Program (the "IRP") and the
concurrent cash settlement of such reduced awards.  Although no further awards
will be made to the Named Executives under the IRP, the Named Executives were
eligible for incentive awards under the Corporation's 1993 Annual Management
Incentive Program.

     (a)  Reflects payments arising from cash award opportunities under the Corporation's 1993 Annual Management Incentive Program
          which were afforded to the Named Executives upon termination of the IRP referred to in footnote (e).  The amounts shown
          are taken into account for purposes of computing benefits under the Corporation's retirement plans.  None of the Named
          Executives received an annual cash bonus for 1992 or 1991.

     (b)  Mr. Connolly's Other Annual Compensation for 1993 included $14,100 in automobile allowance and $16,724 as the estimated
          cost of equivalent life insurance provided by the Corporation's executive death benefit plan; no other Named Executive had
          perquisites and other personal benefits aggregating the lesser of either $50,000 or 10 percent of salary and bonus for
          1993, and none of the Named Executives had such perquisites or other personal benefits for 1992 or 1991.

     (c)  The amounts shown reflect the value (determined by the closing price of the Corporation's Common Stock on the New York
          Stock Exchange on the date of grant) of grants of restricted stock awards made in 1991 under the Management Performance
          Plan.  The shares subject to some such awards were originally scheduled to vest no later than the tenth anniversary of the
          applicable date of grant, subject to acceleration upon the attainment of specified performance objectives, and the awards
          included the right to receive dividends paid to stockholders.  None of the restricted stock awards were originally
          scheduled to vest in less than three years from the date of grant.  No dividends were paid by the Corporation in 1991,
          1992, or 1993.  The shares subject to such awards were reduced proportionally as a result of the one for 50 reverse stock
          split effected by the Prepackaged Plan.  Although none of such shares had vested as of December 31, 1993, the Compensation
          and Organization Committees of the Board of Directors determined in November 1993 to accelerate the vesting of all
          outstanding restricted stock awards, including the awards held by the Named Executive in the amounts indicated in the next
          sentence, to February 14, 1994.  As of December 31, 1993, the aggregate number of restricted shares held by each of the
          Named Executives and the aggregate value thereof, determined with reference to closing prices on such date, were as
          follows:  Mr. Connolly, 3,852 shares, $112,671; Mr. Falvo, 2,628 shares, $76,869; Mr. O'Bryan, 1,528 shares, $44,694; Mr.
          Roller, 1,480 shares, $43,290; and Mr. Pendexter, 1,329 shares, $38,873.

     (d)  Option awards in 1993 were granted effective June 1, 1993.  No option awards were granted to the Named Executives in 1992
          or 1991 and all option awards outstanding as of May 6, 1993 were cancelled without consideration by the terms of the
          Prepackaged Plan.

     (e)  Reflects cash settlements of reduced awards, otherwise potentially payable in 1994, in connection with termination of the
          IRP pursuant to and concurrently with the effectiveness of the Prepackaged Plan.  The amounts shown are taken into account
          for purposes of computing benefits under the Corporation's retirement plans.  None of the Named Executives received long-
          term incentive plan payouts in 1992 or 1991.

     (f)  All Other Compensation for the Named Executives for each year consisted solely of matching contributions from the
          Corporation to defined contribution plans.

(a)   No SARs were granted in 1993.

(b)   Pursuant to the Prepackaged Plan, all outstanding option awards as of May 6, 1993, were cancelled without consideration.  As
      permitted by the Prepackaged Plan, 2,788,350 shares of Common Stock were reserved for future issuance in conjunction with
      stock options.  Options for 1,673,000 shares of Common Stock were granted on June 1, 1993 to 45 individuals, including the
      Named Executives, at the exercise price of $10.3125 per share, which was the average of the high and low sales prices for a
      share of Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Tape for such date.  These options become exercisable at the rate of
      one-third of the aggregate grant on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of the grant (except for the option
      grant with respect to 50,000 shares to Mr. Falvo, which is expected to become exercisable in 1994 in conjunction with his
      anticipated retirement) and expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant except in the case of retirement, death or
      disability in which case they expire on the earlier of the fifth anniversary of such event or the expiration of the original
      option term.

(c)   Assumes appreciation in value from the date of grant to the end of the option term, at the indicated rate.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     In order to assure continued availability of services of the Named
Executives, the Corporation (or, in the case of Mr. Roller, U.S. Gypsum) entered
into employment agreements (the "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS") with the Named
Executives in 1993 which superseded substantially identical agreements entered
into on various dates prior to 1993.  The Employment Agreements, which do not by
their terms provide for renewal or extension, terminate on December 31, 1996.

     The Employment Agreements provide for minimum annual salaries at the then
current rate to be paid at normal pay periods and at normal intervals to Messrs.
Connolly ($585,000), Falvo ($455,000), O'Bryan ($280,000), Roller ($280,000),
and Pendexter ($255,000), with the minimum annual salaries deemed increased
concurrently with salary increases authorized by the Compensation and
Organization Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Employment Agreements
require that each Named Executive devote his full attention and best efforts
during the term of such agreement to the performance of assigned duties.  If a
Named Executive is discharged without cause by the Corporation during the term
of his Employment Agreement, he may elect to be treated as a continuing employee
under such agreement, with salary continuing at the minimum rate specified in
such agreement or at the rate in effect at the time of discharge, if greater,
for the balance of the term of the Employment Agreement or for a period of two
years, whichever is greater.  In the event of any such salary continuation,
certain benefits will be continued at corresponding levels and for the same
period of time.  If a Named Executive becomes disabled during the term of his
Employment Agreement, his compensation continues for the unexpired term of the
Employment Agreement at the rate in effect at the inception of the disability.
In the event of a Named Executive's death during the term of his Employment
Agreement, one-half of the full rate of compensation in effect at the time of
his death will be paid to his beneficiary for the remainder of the unexpired
term of the Employment Agreement.

     Each of the Named Executives has undertaken, during the term of his
Employment Agreement and for a period of three years thereafter, not to
participate, directly or indirectly, in any enterprise which competes with the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries in any line of products in any region of
the United States.  Each Named Executive has also agreed not to, at any time,
use for his benefit or the benefit of others or disclose to others any of the
Corporation's confidential information except as required by the performance of
his duties under his Employment Agreement.


TERMINATION COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS

     The Corporation is a party to termination compensation agreements with the
Named Executives, each of such agreement which will terminate at the earlier of
the close of business on December 31, 1995, or upon the Named Executive
attaining age 65.

     The agreements provide certain benefits in the event of a "change in
control" and termination of employment within three years thereafter or prior to
the Named Executive attaining age 65, whichever is earlier, but only if such
termination occurs under one of several sets of identified circumstances.  Such
circumstances include termination by the Corporation other than for "cause" and
termination by the Named Executive for "good reason".  Each "change in control"
will begin a new three-year period for the foregoing purposes.  For purposes of
the agreements: (i) a "change in control" is deemed to have occurred, in
general, if any person or group of persons acquires beneficial ownership of 20%
or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding
voting securities, if there is a change in a majority of the members of the
Board within a two year period and in certain other events; (ii) the term
"cause" is defined as, in general, the willful and continued failure by the
Named Executive substantially to perform his duties after a demand for
substantial performance has been delivered or the willful engaging of the Named
Executive in misconduct which is materially injurious to the Corporation; and
(iii) "good reason" for termination by a Named Executive means, in general,
termination subsequent to a change in control based on specified changes in the
Named Executive's duties, responsibilities, titles, offices or office location,

                                       115

<PAGE>

compensation levels and benefit levels or participation.

     The benefits include payment of full base salary through the date of
termination at the rate in effect at the time of notice of termination, payment
of any unpaid bonus for a past fiscal year and pro rata payment of bonus for the
then current fiscal year, and continuation through the date of termination of
all stock ownership, purchase and option plans and insurance and other benefit
plans.  In the event of a termination giving rise to benefits under the
agreements, the applicable Named Executive will be entitled to payment of a lump
sum amount equal to 2.99 times the sum of (i) his then annual base salary,
computed at 12 times his then current monthly pay and (ii) his full year
position par bonus for the then current fiscal year, subject to all applicable
federal and state income taxes, together with payment of a gross-up amount to
provide for applicable federal excise taxes in the event such lump sum and all
other benefits payable to the Named Executive constitute an "excess parachute
payment" under the Internal Revenue Code.  The Corporation is required to
maintain in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) two years after the
date of any termination which gives rise to benefits under any of the agreements
and (ii) commencement by the Named Executive of full-time employment with a new
employer, all insurance plans and arrangements in which the Named Executive was
entitled to participate immediately prior to his termination in a manner which
would give rise to benefits under his agreement, provided that if such
participation is barred, the Corporation will be obligated to provide
substantially similar benefits.  In the event of any termination giving rise to
benefits under the agreements, the Corporation is required to credit the
applicable Named Executive with three years of benefit and credited service in
addition to the total number of years of benefit and credited service the Named
Executive accrued under the USG Corporation Retirement Plan.  See "Retirement
Plans" below.  If the Named Executive has a total of less than five years of
credited service following such crediting, he nonetheless will be treated as if
he were fully vested under that Plan, but with benefits calculated solely on the
basis of such total benefit service.

     The Corporation is obligated to pay to each Named Executive all legal fees
and expenses incurred by him as a result of a termination which gives rise to
benefits under his agreement, including all fees and expenses incurred in
contesting or disputing any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce
any right or benefit provided under such agreement.  No amounts are payable
under such agreements if the Named Executive's employment is terminated by the
Corporation for "cause" or if the Named Executive terminates his employment and
"good reason" does not exist.

     Although Water Street's ownership of more than 20% of the Corporation's
voting securities as a result of the Restructuring constituted a "change in
control" under the agreements, each of the Named Executives agreed to waive this
occurrence.  Such waivers do not constitute a waiver of any other occurrence of
a change in control.

     The Corporation has established a so-called "rabbi trust" to provide a
source of payment for benefits payable under such agreements.  Immediately upon
any change in control, the Corporation may deposit with the trustee under such
trust an amount reasonably estimated to be potentially payable under all such
agreements, taking into account any previous deposits.  The Corporation did not
make any such deposit to the trust as a result of Water Street's ownership.  In
the event that the assets of such trust in fact prove insufficient to provide
for benefits payable under all such agreements, the shortfall would be paid
directly by the Corporation from its general assets.


RETIREMENT PLANS

     The following table shows the annual pension benefits on a straight-life
annuity basis for retirement at normal retirement age under the terms of the
Corporation's contributory retirement plan (the "RETIREMENT PLAN"), before the
applicable offset of one-half of the primary social security benefits at time
of retirement. The table has been prepared for various compensation
classifications and representative years of credited service under the Plan.
Each participating employee contributes towards the cost of his or her
retirement benefit.  Retirement benefits are based on the average rate of
annual covered compensation during the three consecutive years of highest
annual compensation in the ten years of employment immediately preceding
retirement.  Participants become fully vested

                                       116

after five years of continuous credited service.

</TABLE>

  The Named Executives participate in the Retirement Plan. The Named
Executives' full years of continuous credited service at December 31, 1993 were
as follows:  Mr. Connolly, 35; Mr. Falvo, 38; Mr. O'Bryan, 35; Mr. Roller, 33;
and Mr. Pendexter, 36.  Compensation under the Retirement Plan includes salary
and incentive compensation (bonus and IRP payments) for the year in which
payments are made.

  Pursuant to a supplemental retirement plan, the Corporation has undertaken to
pay any retirement benefits otherwise payable to certain individuals, including
the Named Executives, under the terms of the Corporation's contributory
Retirement Plan but for provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limiting amounts
payable under tax-qualified retirement plans in certain circumstances.  The
Corporation has established a so-called "rabbi trust" to provide a source of
payment for benefits under this supplemental plan.  Amounts are deposited in
this trust from time to time to provide a source of payments to participants as
they retire as well as for periodic payments to certain other retirees.  In
addition, the Corporation has authorized establishment by certain individuals,
including the Named Executives, of special retirement accounts  with independent
financial institutions as an additional means of funding the Corporation's
obligations to make such supplemental payments.


DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

  Directors who are not employees of the Corporation are currently entitled to
receive a retainer of $6,000 per quarter plus a fee of $900 for each Board or
Board committee meeting attended, together with reimbursement for out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings.  A non-employee
director serving as chairman of a committee is entitled to receive an additional
retainer of $1,000 per quarter for each such chairmanship.  Additional fees for
pre-meeting consultations may be paid as applicable to non-employee directors,
the amount of such fees to bear a reasonable relationship to the regular meeting
fee of $900 and the customary length of a meeting of the Board committee
involved.  No director of the Corporation has received any compensation of any
kind for serving as a director while also serving as an officer or other
employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

  In the past, the Corporation has entered into consulting agreements with
retiring non-employee directors who had specified minimum periods of service on
the Board.  Those agreements continued the annualized retainer which was in
effect in each instance at the time of retirement from the Board in return for
an undertaking to serve in an advisory capacity and to refrain from any activity
in conflict or in competition with the Corporation.  The Board has determined to
continue to offer such agreements on a case-by-case basis but also has
determined to limit any such agreement to a term not to exceed five years.

1994 Stock Option Grants

  Options for 933,000 shares of Common Stock were granted on February 9, 1994
to 76 officers and key managers, none of whom is a Named Executive, at the
exercise price of $32.5625 per share, which was the average of the
high and low sales prices for a share of Common Stock as reported on the
NYSE Composite Tape for such date.  These options become exercisable at the
rate of one-third of the aggregate grant on each of the first three
anniversaries of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of
the date of grant, except in the case of retirement, death or disability,
in which case they expire on the earlier of the fifth anniversary of such
event or the expiration of the original option term.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

AGREEMENT WITH WATER STREET ENTITIES

  On February 25, 1993, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Water
Street (the "WATER STREET AGREEMENT").  The Water Street Agreement, among other
things, (i) restricts Water Steet and its affiliates Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. (collectively the "WATER STREET ENTITIES") from
purchasing, or offering or agreeing to purchase, any shares of Common Stock or
other voting securities of the Corporation, except for Permitted Acquisitions
(as defined in the Water Street Agreement) and acquisitions by any Water Street
Entity other than Water Street of up to an aggregate of 10% of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock in the ordinary course of its business; (ii)
requires (a) Water Street to vote all shares of Common Stock and other voting
securities of the Corporation beneficially owned by it and (b) the other Water
Street Entities to vote all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them in
excess of 10% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, in each case, in
the same proportion as the votes cast by all other holders of Common Stock and
other voting securities of the Corporation, subject to certain exceptions
described below; (iii) places restrictions on the ability of the Water Street
Entities to transfer shares of Common Stock to any person, except for (a) sales
consistent with Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1993, (b) underwritten public
offerings, (c) persons not known to be 5% holders, (d) pledgees who agree to be
bound by certain provisions of the Water Street Agreement, (e) in the case of
Water Street, distributions to Water Street's partners in accordance with the
governing partnership agreement, (f) pursuant to certain tender or exchange
offers for shares of Common Stock and (g) pursuant to transactions approved by
the Board; (iv) provides Water Street with certain rights to nominate directors
to the Board and Finance Committee (as described below); (v) requires the
maintenance of directors' and officers' liability insurance and indemnification
rights; (vi) requires that the Corporation's shareholder rights plan provide
temporary exemptions for ownership of Common Stock by the Water Street Entities;
(vii) provides Water Street with four demand registrations and unlimited
piggyback registrations, subject to certain limitations described below; and
(viii) provides for indemnification by the Corporation of Water Street, its
underwriters and related parties for securities law claims related to any demand
or piggyback registration contemplated in clause (vii) above.

  In connection with the Restructuring, Water Street nominated two New
Directors to the Board, Wade Fetzer III and Barry L. Zubrow.  See Item 10,
"Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant".  In the event that the
Water Street Directors are removed from office without the consent of Water
Street, then the restrictions on the Water Street Entities relating to (i) the
purchases of voting securities of the Corporation other than Permitted
Acquisitions, (ii) the voting of securities of the Corporation and (iii) the
transfer of shares of Common Stock, as described above, shall terminate.  These
restrictions shall also terminate upon the earliest to occur of:  (i) the
consummation of a merger, consolidation or other business combination to which
the Corporation is a constituent corporation, if the stockholders of the
Corporation immediately before such merger, consolidation or combination do not
own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of the surviving corporation, (ii) the Board consisting of a majority
of directors not approved by a vote of the directors serving at the time the
Water Street Agreement was executed, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the
Water Street Agreement.  In addition, the restrictions on purchases of voting
securities and transfers of Common Stock shall also terminate upon the Water
Street Entities owning less than 5% of the then outstanding shares of Common
Stock.

  Furthermore, the Water Street Entities will not be subject to the voting
restrictions contained in the Water Street Agreement if, among other things:
(i) the Corporation defaults on the payment of principal or interest required to
be paid pursuant to any indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such
indebtedness is $25 million or more; (ii) the principal of any of the
Corporation's indebtedness is declared due and payable prior to the date on
which it would otherwise become due and payable if the aggregate amount of such
indebtedness is $25 million or more; (iii) any person other than Water Street
becomes the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the then outstanding shares of
Common Stock; or (iv) the Corporation fails to comply with (x) the following
financial covenants:  a minimum senior interest coverage ratio, a minimum total
interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum
adjusted cumulative net worth, and a maximum leverage ratio or (y) a minimum
total interest coverage

ratio of 0.63 for a specified coverage period in 1993 and for the first quarter
of 1994, 0.84 for the second quarter of 1994, 0.97 for the third quarter of 1994
and 1.14 for the fourth quarter of 1994, provided that (a) such financial
covenants shall be calculated based only on domestic revenues unless the
Corporation's non-domestic consolidated revenues exceed 35% of its total
consolidated revenues, and (b) the Corporation shall not be deemed out of
compliance in the event of a breach, after 1994 and prior to 1998, of the senior
interest coverage ratio or the total interest coverage ratio unless there shall
also exist at such time a breach of the fixed charge coverage ratio or in the
event of a breach, after 1994 and prior to 1998, of the fixed charge coverage
ratio unless there shall also exist at such time a breach of either the senior
interest coverage ratio or the total interest coverage ratio.  See "Description
of Credit Agreement".  If the Corporation complies with the financial covenants
within the two fiscal quarters following the first failure to comply, the voting
restrictions shall apply again.  However, if the Corporation thereafter fails to
comply with any of the financial covenants, the voting restrictions shall
terminate.

     The provision of registration rights to Water Street is subject to certain
limitations, including but not limited to the following:  (i) of Water Street's
four demand registrations, the Corporation shall pay the registration expenses
(other than commissions and discounts of underwriters) for two registrations,
and the Corporation and Water Street shall each pay one-half of the registration
expenses (other than commissions and discounts of underwriters) for two
registrations; and (ii) other than in connection with the Offering, Water Street
(and any Water Street Entity that receives a distribution of Common Stock from
Water Street and owns 5% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock)
shall not request a demand registration of Common Stock during any period in
which the Corporation is actively engaged in a registered distribution of Common
Stock until 90 days after the effective date of the registration statement
relating to such distribution.  With respect to the Offering, Water Street (and,
if it distributes Common Stock to its partners, those partners) shall not
request a demand registration of Common Stock during the 120-day period after
the effective date of the Offering.  In addition, during such 120-day period,
Water Street and Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any
shares of Common Stock or Warrants, except that, at any time after 90 days after
the effective date of the Offering, Water Street may distribute all or any
portion of its shares of Common Stock or Warrants to its partners in accordance
with its governing partnership agreement.  In the event of any such distribution
by Water Street, the partners (other than Goldman, Sachs & Co.) would not be
subject to the restriction on selling shares of Common Stock or Warrants during
the remainder of the 120-day period referred to above.  Except in the case of
the Offering, the Corporation and Water Street have mutual piggyback rights on
registrations initiated by either, generally on a 50-50 basis.

     The Water Street Agreement originally provided, subject to certain
exceptions, that, in connection with the first underwritten public offering of
Common Stock after the Restructuring, the Corporation would have the right to
sell, without participation of Water Street, up to such number of shares of
Common Stock as would yield an aggregate price to the public of $100,000,000 and
that, if a greater number of shares were to be sold in that offering, Water
Street and the Corporation would each have the right to sell 50% of such greater
number of shares.  In addition, in connection with such offering, subject to
certain exceptions, the Water Street Agreement originally provided that Water
Street (and, if it distributes Common Stock to its partners, those partners)
would not request or demand registration of Common Stock during the 180-day
period after the effective date of such offering, rather than the 120-day period
that applies to the Offering.  In connection with the Offering, the Corporation
and Water Street have mutually determined that they would sell in the Offering
4,000,000 shares of Common Stock, without regard to such $100,000,000
limitation, and that such 120-day period would apply in lieu of such 180-day
period.

NOTE PLACEMENT
     Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Management Trust

principal amount of the Corporation's outstanding Senior Notes due 1997
and paid the $85 million balance of the purchase price in cash.

          rate per annum equal to one-fourth of one percent above the rate per
          annum borne by the 1996 Notes compounded semi-annually.  The net
          amount of rent required to be paid under any such lease for any
          such period shall be the aggregate amount of the rent payable by the

          Directors) to the retirement of Senior Funded Debt of the Corporation
          or Funded Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that the amount
          to be applied to the retirement of Senior Funded Debt of the
          Corporation or Funded Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary shall be reduced
          by (i) the principal amount of any Notes (or other debentures or notes
          constituting Senior Funded Debt of the Corporation or Funded Debt of a
          Restricted Subsidiary) delivered within 75 days after such sale or

          clause (B) may be effected by payment at maturity or pursuant to any
          mandatory sinking fund payment or any mandatory prepayment provision,
          or

          indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which shall
          happen and shall result in such indebtedness becoming or being
          declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise
          become due and payable, and such acceleration or accelerations shall
          not be rescinded or annulled for a period of ten days after there has
          been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Corporation by the

notice given as provided in the Indenture, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of such series of Notes plus accrued interest to the date of

is on or prior to the date of redemption, shall be payable to the Holder of such
Notes, registered as such as the close of business on the relevant record dates,
according to the terms and provisions of Section 2.04 and 3.03 of the
Indenture).  The date of redemption for any redemption required by this

days following the earliest date on which the conditions specified in clause (i)
and (ii) above shall have been satisfied.  Nothing contained in this paragraph
(b) shall require the Corporation to effect more than one redemption of a series
of the Notes, irrespective of any elections made by Holders pursuant to
paragraph (d) below.

               (c) PREVAILING RATING. The "Prevailing Rating" of a series of the
          Notes on any date shall be the rating of such series of the Notes by
          S&P or Moody's as of the close of business on such date.  The
          Corporation shall take all reasonable action necessary to enable S&P
          and Moody's to provide ratings for the Notes.

               (d)  ELECTION BY HOLDERS.  Any Holder of Notes may elect not to
          have redeemed all (but not less than all) the Notes held by such
          Holder by delivering written notice of such election to the
          Corporation (or an agent designated by the Corporation for such
          purpose in the notice of redemption) by the close of business on the
          fifteenth day preceding the date of redemption, which notice shall
          specify the name of such Holder and shall identify the Notes which are
          not to be redeemed and their aggregate principal amount.  No such
          notice shall be deemed to have been delivered until such notice is
          actually received by the Corporation (or its agent).

          (12)  The provisions of Article Twelve of the Indenture relating to
     defeasance of Securities shall be applicable to each series of the Notes,
     except that Section 12.02 of the Indenture as it relates to each series of
     the Notes shall be replaced by the following provision:

               SATISFACTION, DISCHARGE AND DEFEASANCE OF NOTES.  At the
          Corporation's option, either (a) the Corporation shall be deemed to

          Outstanding Notes of a series and the Trustee, at the expense of the
          Corporation, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging
          satisfaction and discharge of such indebtedness, or (b) the
          Corporation shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with any
          term, provision, condition or covenant applicable to the Notes of a
          series set forth in Section 11.01 of the Indenture, in item 9 of this
          Resolution (I.E., the covenants regarding "Limitations on Liens" and
          "Limitation on Sale and Leaseback") and in item 11 of this Resolution
          (i.e., the provisions regarding "Limited Mandatory Repurchase
          Obligation") when

               (1) with respect to all Outstanding Notes of such series,

MGT426F

                    (A)  the Corporation shall have deposited or caused to be
               deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the
               purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
               indebtedness of all Outstanding Notes of such series for
               principal and interest to the stated maturity or any redemption
               date (as contemplated by the penultimate paragraph hereof), as
               the case may be; or

                    (B)  the Corporation shall have deposited or caused to be
               deposited with the Trustee as obligations in trust for the
               purpose such amount of direct noncallable obligations of, or
               noncallable obligations the payment of principal of and interest
               on which is fully guaranteed by, the United States of America, or
               to the payment of which obligations or guarantees the full faith
               and credit of the United States of America is pledged, maturing
               as to principal and interest in such amounts and at such times as
               will, together with the income to accrue thereon (but without
               reinvesting any proceeds thereof), be sufficient to pay and
               discharge the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Notes of
               such series for principal and interest to the stated maturity or
               any redemption date (as contemplated by the penultimate paragraph
               hereof), as the case may be;

               (2)  the Corporation shall have paid or caused to be paid all
          other sums payable with respect to the Outstanding Notes of such
          series;

               (3)  if the Notes of such series are then listed on any national
          securities exchange, the Corporation shall have delivered to the
          Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Corporation's
          exercise of its option under this provision would not cause such Notes
          to be delisted;

               (4)  no Event of Default or event (including such deposit) which
          with notice or lapse of time would become an Event of Default with
          respect to the Notes of such series shall have occurred and be
          continuing on the date of such deposit;

               (5)  the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an
          Opinion of Counsel of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect
          that Holders of the Notes of such series will not recognize income,
          gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the
          Corporation's exercise of its option under this provision and will be
          subject to Federal income tax in the same amount and in the


                                      -12-



<PAGE>

MGT426F
          same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
          option had not been exercised;

               (6)  the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an
          Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Corporation's exercise of
          its option under this provision will not cause any violation of the
          Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, on the part of the
          Corporation, the trust, the trust funds representing the Corporation's
          deposit or the Trustee; and

               (7)  the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an
          Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
          conditions precedent relating to the Corporation's exercise of its
          option under this provision have been complied with.

               Any deposits with the Trustee referred to above shall be
          irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust
          agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee.  If any
          Outstanding Notes of such series are to be redeemed prior to their
          stated maturity, the applicable escrow trust agreement shall provide
          therefor and the Corporation shall make such arrangements as are
          satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
          the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Corporation.

               For purposes of this provision, "discharged" means that the
          Corporation shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire
          indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the Notes of such
          series and to have satisfied all the obligations under this Indenture
          relating to the Notes of such series (and the Trustee, at the expense
          of the Corporation, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the
          same), except (x) the rights of Holders of Notes of such series to
          receive, from the trust fund described above, payment of the principal
          of and interest on such Notes when such payments are due, (y) the
          Corporation's obligations with respect to the Notes of such series
          under Sections 2.05, 2.07, 4.02 and 12.03 of the Indenture and (z) the
          rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee
          hereunder.

     attached hereto is in all respects approve, and that the execution and
    delivery of the Notes as provided in the Indenture is hereby authorized,
    with such changes therein as the officer executing the same shall approve,

             FORM OF RESOLUTION CREATING 8-3/4% DEBENTURES DUE 2017

     NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED: That the following resolutions are adopted
by the Special Committee effective March 5, 1987.

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That there is hereby approved and established a
series of Securities under the Indenture, whose terms shall be as follows:

     (1)  The series of Securities established hereby to be issued pursuant to
the Indenture shall be known and designated as the "8-3/4% Debentures Due 2017"
(the "Debentures").

     (2)  The aggregate principal amount of the Debentures is limited to
$200,000,000 (except as provided in Section 2.01(2) of the Indenture).

     (3)  The stated maturity of the principal of the Debentures shall be March
1, 2017.

     (4)  The Debentures shall bear interest at the rate of 8-3/4% per annum
from March 1, 1987 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which
interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, payable on each
September 1 and March 1, commencing September 1, 1987 until the principal amount
thereof is paid or made available for payment. Each September 1 and March 1
shall be an "Interest Payment Date" for the Debentures. The August 15 or
February 15 (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding an Interest Payment
Date shall be the "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such
Interest Payment Date.

     (5)  The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debentures
shall be payable, and the Debentures shall be transferable and exchangeable, at
the office or agency of the Corporation maintained for that purpose in the City
of Chicago, State of Illinois; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at the option of the
Corporation, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of
the Holder entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security
Register.

     (6)  The Debentures shall be redeemable at the Corporation's option, as a
whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 90 days' notice given as
provided in the Indenture, at any time prior to maturity upon payment of the
applicable optional redemption price set forth in the form of the Debenture
attached hereto, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption (provided

<PAGE>

that instalments of interest, the stated maturity of which is on or prior to
the date of redemption, shall be payable to the Holders of such Debentures,
registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates,
according to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.04 and 3.03 of the
Indenture).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may not, prior to March 1,
1997, redeem any of the Debentures pursuant to this item 6, as part of, or in
anticipation of, any refunding operation by the application, directly or
indirectly, of moneys borrowed by or for the account of the Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries (as defined in item 10 of this Resolution) having an
interest cost (calculated in accordance with generally accepted
financial practice) of less than 8.77% per annum.

     (7)  As and for a sinking fund (the "Sinking Fund") for the retirement of
the Debentures the Corporation will, until all the Debentures are paid or
payment thereof provided for, deposit with the Trustee prior to March 1 in each
year, commencing with the year 1998 to and including the year 2016, an amount in
cash sufficient to redeem, at 100% of their principal amount, not less than
$10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (the "mandatory
amount") nor more than $25,000,000, less the amount of any credit against such
payment received by the Corporation under the following paragraph.  Each such
Sinking Fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Debentures on such
March 1, as provided below.  The right to deposit an amount sufficient to redeem
in excess of $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Debentures for the
Sinking Fund in any of the years 1998 to 2016, inclusive, shall be
noncumulative.

     The Corporation (1) may deliver uncancelled Debentures (other than any
previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit (i) Debentures
redeemed at the election of the Corporation pursuant to item 6 of this
Resolution and (ii) Debentures redeemed in excess of the mandatory amounts
pursuant to the preceding paragraph in satisfaction of all or any part of any
Sinking Fund payment required to be made pursuant to the preceding paragraph
(provided that Debentures so delivered or credited have not been previously
delivered or credited in satisfaction of any mandatory Sinking Fund payment or
any retirement of Senior Funded Debt of the Corporation or Funded Debt of a
Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to item 10 of this Resolution).  Each such
Debenture shall be received or credited for such purpose by the Trustee at 100%
of its principal amount for redemption through the operation of the Sinking
Fund, and the amount of such Sinking Fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

     On or before January 15 in each year commencing with the year 1998 to and
including the year 2016, the Corporation will deliver to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate specifying


                                       -2-
<PAGE>

the amount of the next ensuing Sinking Fund payment (in which event the amount
so specified shall be due prior to the next ensuing March 1) and the portions of
such Sinking Fund payment which are to be satisfied by payment of cash, by
delivery of Debentures or by crediting Debentures, and will also deliver to the
Trustee the Debentures to be so delivered.  Such Officers' Certificate shall
also state that the Debentures then delivered or forming the basis of any such
credit qualify therefor under the preceding paragraph and do not include any
Debentures which have been previously credited against any Sinking Fund payment
or any retirement of Funded Debt pursuant to item 10 of this Resolution.  In
case of the failure, on or before January 15 in any such year, of the
Corporation to give such notice and to deliver such Debentures, if any, the
Sinking Fund obligation shall be $10,000,000 and shall be paid entirely in cash.
On or before February 1 in each such year the Trustee shall select the
Debentures or portions thereof to be redeemed upon the next ensuing
March 1 in the manner specified, and cause notice of the redemption thereof to
be given in the name of and at the expense of the Corporation in the manner
provided, in Section 3.02 of the Indenture.  Such notice having been duly given,
the Sinking Fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of such Debentures
or portions, such redemption to be made upon the terms and in the manner stated
in Section 3.03 of the Indenture.

     (8)  The Debentures shall be issued only in denominations of $1,000 and
integral multiples thereof.

     (9)  The Debentures shall be issued as Registered Securities only, in fully
registered form.

    (10)  The following additional covenants of the Corporation shall be added

     Principal Operating Property of the Corporation or any Restricted
     Subsidiary, or any shares of stock of or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary,
     without effectively providing that the Debentures (together with, if the
     Corporation shall so determine, any other Debt of the Corporation or such
     Restricted Subsidiary then existing or thereafter created which is not
     subordinated Debt) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, at the
     option of the Corporation, prior to) such secured Debt so long as such
     secured Debt shall be so secured, unless, after giving effect thereto, the
     aggregate amount of all such secured Debt plus all Attributable Debt of the
     Corporation and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of sale and
     leaseback transactions (as defined in the following paragraph, but

     computation under this paragraph, Debt secured by:

               (A)    Mortgages on, and limited to, property of, or on any

          pertaining to workmen's compensation, unemployment insurance, old age
          pensions, social security or similar matters;

               (E)    Mortgages for taxes, assessments or governmental charges
          or levies if such taxes, assessments, governmental charges or levies
          shall not at the time be due and payable, or if the same thereafter
          can be paid without penalty, or if the same are being contested in
          good faith by appropriate proceedings;

               (F)    Mortgages created by or resulting from any litigation or

          proceeding for review has not expired;

               (G)    Mortgages on, and limited to, property (including
          leasehold estates), shares of stock or Debt existing at the time of
          acquisition thereof (including acquisition through merger or
          consolidation) or to secure the payment of all or any part of the
          purchase price thereof or construction thereon or to secure any Debt
          incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 120 days after the later
          of the acquisition, the completion of construction or the commencement
          of full operation of such property or within 120 days after the
          acquisition of such shares or Debt for the purpose of financing all or
          any part of the purchase price thereof or construction thereon; or

               (H)    any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive
          extensions, renewals or replacements), as a whole or in part, of any

          inclusive, provided, that (i) such extension, renewal or replacement
          Mortgage shall be limited to all or a part of the same property,
          shares of stock or Debt that secured the Mortgage extended, renewed or
          replaced (plus improvements on such property) and (ii) the Debt
          secured by such Mortgage at such time is not increased.

     Outstanding, except as hereinafter provided, the Corporation will not
     itself, and it will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any
     transaction with any bank, insurance company or other lender or investor,
     or to which any such bank, company, lender or investor is a party,

     to clauses (A) through (H) thereof, on the Principal Operating Property to
     be leased in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such
     sale and leaseback transaction without equally and ratably securing the
     Debentures, or

          (B)  the Corporation or a Restricted Subsidiary, within 120 days after
     the sale or transfer shall have been made by the Corporation or by a
     Restricted Subsidiary, applies an amount equal to the greater of the net
     proceeds from the sale of the Principal Operating Property leased pursuant
     to such arrangement or the fair market value of the Principal Operating
     Property so leased at the time of entering into such arrangement (as
     determined in any manner approved by the Board of Directors) to the
     retirement of Senior Funded Debt of the Corporation or Funded Debt of a
     Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that the amount to be applied to the
     retirement of Senior Funded Debt of the Corporation or Funded Debt of a
     Restricted Subsidiary shall be reduced by (i) the principal amount of any
     Debentures (or other debentures or notes constituting Senior Funded Debt
     of th Corporation or Funded Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary) delivered with
     in 75days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee or other applicable
     trustee for retirement and cancellation and (ii) the principal amount of
     Senior Funded Debt of the Corporation or Funded Debt of a Restricted
     Subsidiary, other than Funded Debt included under clause (i), voluntarily
     retired by the Corporation or a Restricted Subsidiary within 75 days after
     such sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no retirement referred to in this
     clause (B) may be effected by payment at maturity or pursuant to any
     mandatory sinking fund payment or any mandatory prepayment provision, or

          (C)  the lease in such sale and leaseback transaction is for a period,
     including renewals, of no more than three years; or

          (D)  such arrangement is between the Corporation and a Restricted

     the Corporation or any Subsidiary in excess of $50,000,000 principal amount
     in the aggregate, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter
     be created, which shall happen and shall result in such indebtedness
     becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it
     would otherwise become due and payable, and such acceleration or
     accelerations shall not be rescinded or annulled for a period of ten days
     after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
     Corporation by the Trustee or to the Corporation and the Trustee by the
     Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Debentures Outstanding,

     action necessary to enable S&P and Moody's to provide ratings for the
     Debentures.

          (d)  ELECTION BY HOLDERS.  Any Holder of Debentures may elect not to

     redemption) by the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding the
     date of redemption, which notice shall specify the name of such Holder and

     Debentures and the Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation, shall
     execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of such
     indebtedness, or (b) the Corporation shall cease to be under any obligation
     to comply with any term, provision, condition or covenant applicable to the
     Debentures of a series set forth in Section 11.01 of the Indenture, in item
     10 of this Resolution (I.E., the covenants regarding "Limitation on Liens"
     and "Limitation on Sale and Leaseback") and in item 12 of this Resolution
     (i.e., the provisions regarding "Limited Mandatory Repurchase Obligation")
     when

          (1)  with respect to all Outstanding Debentures,

               (A)    the Corporation shall have deposited or caused to be
          deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an
          amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness of all
          Outstanding Debentures for principal (and premium, if any) and
          interest to the stated maturity or any

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

          redemption date (as contemplated by the penultimate paragraph hereof),
          as the case may be; or

               (B)    the Corporation shall have deposited or caused to be
          deposited with the Trustee as obligations in trust for the purpose
          such amount of direct noncallable obligations of, or noncallable
          obligations the payment of principal of and interest on which is fully
          guaranteed by, the United States of America, or to the payment of
          which obligations or guarantees the full faith and credit of the
          United States of America is pledged, maturing as to principal and
          interest in such amounts and at such times as will, together with the
          income to accrue thereon (but without reinvesting any proceeds
          thereof), be sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
          on all Outstanding Debentures for principal (and premium, if any) and
          interest to the stated maturity or any redemption date (as
          contemplated by the penultimate paragraph hereof), as the case may be;

          (2)  the Corporation shall have paid or caused to be paid all other
     sums payable with respect to the Outstanding Debentures;

          (3)  if the Debentures are then listed on any national securities
     exchange, the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
     Counsel to the effect that the Corporation's exercise of its option under
     this provision would not cause such Debentures to be delisted;

          (4)  no Event of Default or event (including such deposit) which with
     notice or lapse of time would become an Event of Default with respect to
     the Debentures shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
     deposit;

          (5)  the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
     Counsel of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that Holders of
     the Debentures will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income
     tax purposes as a result of the Corporation's exercise of its option under
     this provision and will be subject to Federal income tax in the same amount
     and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
     such option had not been exercised;

          (6)  the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
     Counsel to the effect that the Corporation's exercise of its option under
     this provision will not cause any violation of the Investment Company Act
     of 1940, as amended, on the part of the Corporation, the

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

     trust, the trust funds representing the Corporation's deposit or the
     Trustee; and

          (7)  the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
     Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
     precedent relating to the Corporation's exercise of its option under this
     provision have been complied with.

               Any deposits with the Trustee referred to above shall be
     irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust agreement
     in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee.  If any Outstanding
     Debentures are to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity (including
     through operation of the Sinking Fund applicable to the Debentures), the
     applicable escrow trust agreement shall provide therefor and the
     Corporation shall make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the
     Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the
     name, and at the expense, of the Corporation.

               For purposes of this provision, "discharged" means that the
     Corporation shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire
     indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the Debentures and to
     have satisfied all the obligations under this Indenture relating to the
     Debentures (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation, shall
     execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except (x) the rights
     of Holders of Debentures to receive, from the trust fund described above,
     payment of the principal (and premium, if any) of and interest on such
     Debentures when such payments are due, (y) the Corporation's obligations
     with respect to the Debentures under Sections 2.05, 2.07, 4.02 and 12.03 of
     the Indenture and (z) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of
     the Trustee hereunder.

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:  That the form of the Debenture attached hereto is
in all respects approved, and that the execution and delivery of the Debentures
as provided in the Indenture is hereby authorized, with such changes therein as
the officer executing the same shall approve, such execution to be conclusive
evidence of such approval.

          Property unless owned and operated by such corporation for more than
          90 days after it becomes a Subsidiary; and provided, further, that the

     would otherwise become due and payable, and such acceleration or
     accelerations shall not be rescinded or annulled for a period of ten days
     after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
     Corporation by the Trustee or to the Corporation and the Trustee by the
     Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding, a
     written notice specifying such event of default or events of default and

                (A)  the Corporation shall have deposited or caused to be
          deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an
          amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness of all

          hereof), as the case may be; or

                (B)  the Corporation shall have deposited or caused to be
          deposited with the Trustee as obligations in trust for the purpose
          such amount of direct noncallable obligations of, or noncallable
          obligations the payment of principal of and interest on which is fully
          guaranteed by, the United States of America, or to the payment of
          which obligations or guarantees the full faith and credit of the
          United States of America is pledged, maturing as to principal and
          interest in such amounts and at such times as will, together with the
          income to accrue thereon (but without reinvesting any proceeds
          thereof), be sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
          on all Outstanding Notes for principal and interest to the stated
          maturity or any redemption date (as contemplated by the penultimate
          paragraph hereof), as the case may be;

          (2)   the Corporation shall have paid or caused to be paid all other
     sums payable with respect to the Outstanding Notes;

          (3)   if the Notes are then listed on any national securities
     exchange, the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
     Counsel to the effect that the Corporation's exercise of its option under
     this provision would not cause such Notes to be delisted;

          (4)   no Event of Default or event (including such deposit) which with
     notice or lapse of time would become an Event of Default with respect to
     the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
     deposit;

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

          (5)   the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
     of Counsel of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that Holders
     of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax
     purposes as a result of the Corporation's exercise of its option under this
     provision and will be subject to Federal income tax in the same amount and
     in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
     such option had not been exercised;

          (6)   the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
     of Counsel to the effect that the Corporation's exercise of its option
     under this provision will not cause any violation of the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended, on the part of the Corporation, the trust, the
     trust funds representing the Corporation's deposit or the Trustee; and

          (7)   the Corporation shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
     Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
     precedent relating to the Corporation's exercise of its option under this
     provision have been complied with.

                Any deposits with the Trustee referred to above shall be
     irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust agreement
     in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee.  If any Outstanding
     Notes are to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity, the applicable
     escrow trust agreement shall provide therefor and the Corporation shall
     make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
     notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
     Corporation.

                For purposes of this provision, "discharged" means that the
     Corporation shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire
     indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the Notes and to have
     satisfied all the obligations under this Indenture relating to the notes
     (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation, shall execute proper
     instruments acknowledging the same), except (x) the rights of Holders of
     Notes to receive, from the trust fund described above, payment of the
     principal of and interest on such Notes when such payments are due, (y) the
     Corporation's obligations with respect to the Notes under Sections 2.05,
     2.07, 4.02 and 12.03 of the Indenture and (z) the rights, powers, trusts,
     duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder.

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:  That the form of the Note attached hereto is in
all respects approved, and that the execution and

                                      -12-
