As discussed in note 14 to the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements,  the
Company's operations are divided into four industry segments.

Heavy Vehicle  Components - The Company's heavy vehicle  component product lines
include  electronic  throttles,  exhaust  brakes  and  pneumatic  and  hydraulic
controls.  These products are used in applications which include heavy vehicles,
utility  and  off-highway  equipment,   transit  buses  and  underground  mining
machines. The majority of these products are sold directly to original equipment
manufacturers such as Freightliner,  Navistar, Volvo, Motor Coach Industries and
Blue  Bird  Corporation.  The  Company  also  sells  these  products  through  a
well-established network of independent  distributors.  The major competitors in
one or more product lines include Allied Signal, Schraeder-Bellows and RMH.

Automotive  Accessories - The automotive  accessories  product lines include bug
and stone deflectors,  running boards,  side steps and bed mats for light trucks
and sport-utility  vehicles.  These products are sold in the aftermarket to mass
merchants  and auto supply stores such as Kmart,  WalMart,  Pep Boys and Western
Auto. The major competitors include Lund, Deflecta Shield and Dee Zee.

Landscape  Maintenance  Equipment - The landscape  maintenance equipment product
lines include  rotary  cutters,  sprayers,  discs,  harrows and trailers.  These
products are sold to  independent  equipment  dealers  located  primarily in the
Southeastern  United  States.  The major  competitors  include Wood Brothers and
Alamo Group.

Electrical  Components - The  electrical  components  product line  includes the
design and production of  microcircuits,  cable  assemblies and other electronic
products.   These   products  are  used  in   telecommunication,   computer  and
transportation  industries.  The major customers include Allied Signal, AT&T and
Nokia. The major competitors include CTS, AMP and Nethode.


Acquisitions

During 1995 the Company  completed  acquisitions  which  accounted for $9,646 of
total sales and $1,039 of earnings from  operations.  These  acquisitions are as
follows:

In February 1995 the Company acquired assets of approximately $5,400 from Hardee
Manufacturing  Company,  Inc. and the Waccamaw Wheel division of Red Bluff Grain
and Farm Supply,  Inc., of Loris,  South Carolina.  The acquisition was financed
through a combination of the assumption of liabilities, debt and cash. Hardee is
a manufacturer  of equipment used in highway and park  maintenance,  landscaping
and farming. Its product line includes sprayers,  rotary cutters, discs, harrows
and highway trailers.  Waccamaw Wheel manufactures solid rubber tail wheels from
recycled  truck and bus tires.  These are sold to Hardee and other rotary cutter
manufacturers.  Hardee's and Waccamaw Wheel's products are sold primarily in the
southeastern United States. The Company completed these acquisitions through two
newly formed subsidiaries each owned 80% by the Company and 20% by the seller.

In April 1995 the Company acquired  substantially  all of the business assets of
Aptek Technologies,  Inc. of Deerfield Beach,  Florida, for $1,400. In June 1995
the  Company  acquired  the land and  building  comprising  the Aptek  operating
facilities  for $4,600.  The $6,000  purchase price was a combination of cash of
$4,200 and Company common stock valued at $1,800 (543,806 shares). Aptek designs
and produces microcircuits,  cable assemblies and other electronic products used
in the telecommunication, computer and medical industries.



                                        3

<PAGE>

In August 1995 the  Company  acquired  substantially  all the assets of Agrotec,
Inc. of Pendleton,  North Carolina, for approximately $500 and the assumption of
certain  liabilities.  These  acquisitions  have been accounted for as purchases
and,  accordingly,   the  results  of  operations  have  been  included  in  the
Consolidated Statements of Operations from their purchase dates.


Competition

In general,  the Company's  products are sold in highly  competitive  markets to
customers who are sophisticated and demanding concerning price,  performance and
quality. Products are sold in competition with other independent suppliers (some
of which have  substantial  financial  resources and  significant  technological
capabilities),  and many of these  products  are,  or could be,  produced by the
manufacturers   to  which  the  Company  sells  such  products.   The  Company's
competitive position varies among its product lines.


Marketing and Distribution

For the years ended  September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993,  Freightliner  accounted
for 12%,  14% and  19%,  respectively,  of net  sales  while  in 1994 and  1993,
Navistar  accounted  for 10% and  14%,  respectively,  of net  sales  and  Volvo
accounted for 10% and 9%, respectively, of net sales.

During the years ended September 30, 1995,  1994, and 1993,  approximately  13%,
16% and 20% of the  Company's  total net sales were to customers  outside of the
United  States,  primarily  in  Canada,  and to a lesser  extent in  Europe  and
Australia. See note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Existing Future Sales Orders

Future sales orders for the Company's products were approximately  $9,200,000 at
September 30, 1995,  compared to $6,600,000 at September 30, 1994.  Future sales
orders are orders for which  customers  have  requested  delivery  at  specified
future  dates.  The  Company  has  not  experienced  any  significant   problems
delivering products on a timely basis.


Environment

The  Company's  operations  result  in the  production  of small  quantities  of
materials identified by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States
Government  as  "hazardous  waste  substances"  which  must  be  disposed  of in
accordance with applicable state and federal guidelines.  Substantial  liability
may result to a company for failure,  on the part of itself or its  contractors,
to dispose of hazardous  wastes in accordance with the  established  guidelines,
including  potential  liability  for the  clean up sites  affected  by  improper
disposals.  The  Company  uses its best  efforts  to ensure  that its  hazardous
substances are disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.



                                        4

<PAGE>

Government Regulation

The  Company's  heavy vehicle  component  products must comply with the National
Traffic  and Motor  Vehicle  Safety Act of 1966,  as  amended,  and  regulations
promulgated  thereunder  which are  administered by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration  ("NHTSA"). If, after investigation,  NHTSA finds that the
Company is not in  compliance  with any  standard  or  regulation,  among  other
things, it may require the Company to recall its products which are found not to
be in compliance and repair or replace such products.


Product Research and Development

The  Company's  operating   facilities  engage  in  engineering,   research  and
development  and  quality  control   activities  to  improve  the   performance,
reliability and cost-effectiveness of the Company's product lines. The Company's
engineering  staff works closely with customers in the design and development of
new products and adapting products for new  applications.  During 1995, 1994 and
1993, the Company spent $1,445,000,  $1,145,000 and $1,102,000 respectively,  on
these activities.


Patents and Trademarks

The Company's  product lines generally have strong  identities in the markets in
which they serve.  The Company has a number of product  patents  obtained over a
period of years and which expire at various  times.  The Company  considers each
patent to be of value and aggressively  protects its rights against infringement
throughout the world.  Although the Company owns two patents  (expiring in 2009)
which the Company believes improved the marketability of the electronic  product
line of the heavy  vehicle  components  segment and which are subject to a civil
action  (described  in Item 3 -  "Legal  Proceedings"),  the  Company  does  not
consider that the loss or expiration of any particular  patent would  materially
adversely  affect the Company;  however,  competition in this product line could
increase  if these  patents are not  successfully  defended.  The  Company  owns
numerous  trademarks which are registered in many countries enabling the Company
to market its products worldwide.  These trademarks include "Williams," "Kenco,"
"Hardee" and  "Bugman."  The Company  believes  that in the aggregate the rights
under its patents and trademarks are generally important to its operations,  but
does not  consider  that any patent or  trademark  or group of them related to a
specific  process  or product  is of  material  importance  in  relation  to the
Company's total business except as described above.


Raw Materials

The Company produces its products from raw materials, including brass, aluminum,
steel, rubber and zinc which currently are widely available on reasonable terms.
The Company relies upon, and expects to continue to rely upon, CTS  Corporation,
Conner  Formed Metal  Products,  Inc.  and  Caterpillar,  Inc. as single  source
suppliers for critical components and/or products. Although these suppliers have
been able to meet the Company's future needs on a timely basis, or be willing to
continue  to be a  supplier  to  the  Company,  there  is no  assurance  that  a
disruption  in a supplier's  business,  such as a strike,  would not disrupt the
supply of a component.





                                        5

Product Warranty

The Company  warrants its products to the first retail  purchaser and subsequent
owners against malfunctions  occurring during the warranty period resulting from
defects in  material  or  workmanship,  subject to  specified  limitations.  The
warranty is limited to a specified  time  period,  mileage or hours of use,  and
varies by product  and  application.  The  Company  has  established  a warranty
reserve  based upon its  estimate  of the future  cost of  warranty  and related
service costs. The Company regularly  monitors its warranty reserve for adequacy
in response to historical experience and other factors.

Employees

The  Company  employs   approximately  120  union  employees  and  380  nonunion
employees.  The  nonunion  employees  of the  Company  are  engaged in sales and
marketing,  accounting and  administration,  product  research and  development,
production and quality control.

The union employees are engaged in manufacturing heavy vehicle components in the
Portland, Oregon facility and are represented by the International Union, United
Automobile  Workers of America  and  Amalgamated  Local 492 (the  "Union").  The
Company and the Union have a collective  bargaining  agreement  which expires in
September 1997, which provides for wages and benefits (including pension, death,
disability, health care, unemployment, vacation and other benefits) and contains
provisions governing other terms of employment,  such as seniority,  grievances,
arbitration and union  recognition.  Management of the Company believes that its
relationship with its employees and the Union is good.


Item 2. Properties

The following table outlines the principal  manufacturing  and other  facilities
owned by the Company,  subject to mortgages on each facility.  See notes 7 and 8
to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
                                                              Type and Size

        Williams        Portland, Oregon               Manufacturing and offices
                                                       160,000 square feet

        Kenco           Middlebury, Indiana            Manufacturing and offices
                                                       139,000 square feet

        Hardee          Loris, South Carolina          Manufacturing and offices
                                                       100,000 square feet

        Aptek           Deerfield Beach, Florida       Manufacturing and offices
                                                       50,000 square feet

        Agrotec         Pendleton, North Carolina      Manufacturing and office
                                                       50,000 square feet

The  Company's  manufacturing  facilities  are equipped  with the  machinery and
equipment  necessary  to  manufacture  and  assemble  its  products.  Management
believes  that the  facilities  have been  maintained  adequately,  and that the
Company  could  increase  its  production  output  significantly  at  any of its
facilities with minimal expansion of its present equipment and work force.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its  consolidated  subsidiaries  are parties to various  pending
judicial  and  administrative  proceedings  arising  in the  ordinary  course of
business.  The Company's management and legal counsel have reviewed the probable
outcome of these proceedings,  the costs and expenses  reasonably expected to be
incurred,  the availability and limits of the Company's insurance coverage,  and
the Company's established reserves for uninsured liabilities.  While the outcome
of the pending  proceedings  cannot be predicted  with  certainty,  based on its
review,  management  believes  that  any  liabilities  that may  result  are not
reasonably  likely  to  have  a  material  effect  on the  Company's  liquidity,
financial condition or results of operations.

On April 24,  1995 CTS  Corporation  filed a civil  action in the U.S.  District
Court for the Northern  District of Indiana,  seeking to  invalidate  two of the
Company's  patents or, in the  alternative,  a declaration of joint ownership of
the patent rights thereunder, and unspecified damages. These patents relate to a
component used in the Company's  electronic foot throttle controls.  The Company
has denied the claims of CTS and filed a counterclaim  for infringement of these
patents seeking a permanent  injunction and treble damages. The Company believes
that CTS's  claims are without  merit,  that payment of damages is remote and is
vigorously  defending  its patent  rights.  The Company is unable to predict the
outcome  of th1s  litigation;  however;  if the  patents  are  not  successfully
defended, It believes that competion in this product line could increase.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

The Company did not submit any matters to a vote of its security  holders during
the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 1995.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations (Dollars in thousands - except per share amounts)

Financial Position and Capital Resources

The Company's  financial  condition improved during 1995 due to a combination of
strong  operating  results for the year ended September 30, 1995 and obtaining a
three-year  $30,000  credit  facility.  At  September  30,  1995 the Company had
working  capital  of $17,907  compared  to $10,862 at  September  30,  1994,  an
increase of 65%. The current  ratio on September  30, 1995 was 3.3 compared with
2.1 at September 30, 1994.

Stockholders'  equity increased to $18,293 at September 30, 1995 from $12,448 at
September 30, 1994. The increase in stockholders' equity is due primarily to net
earnings  of  $4,512  and the  issuance  of  common  stock of  $1,963  issued in
connection with acquisitions.

In July 1995 the  Company  obtained a $30,000  credit  facility  to replace  its
previous  financing  package  comprised  of term loans of $8,600 and a revolving
loan of $10,000.  The $30,000  credit  facility is a 3 year revolving loan which
carries  an  interest  rate at either the  bank's  prime  rate or the  Interbank
Offering Rate (IBOR) plus 2% to 3% depending upon certain financial ratios.  The
Company has the option to borrow at the bank's prime rate or the IBOR plus rate.
The Company has borrowed  approximately  $15,000  under the new credit  facility
with  interest  at  7.9%  which  is  IBOR  plus  2%.  The  Company  has  pledged
substantially  all of its  assets as  collateral  for the credit  facility.  The
Company  is  required  to  maintain  a minimum  net worth and  maintain  certain
financial  ratios.  The loan agreement also contains certain  restrictions  that
limit acquisitions, investments, payment of dividends, and capital expenditures.

During  1994 the  Company  provided a $7,000  revolving  loan  facility  to Ajay
Sports,  Inc.  ("Ajay") for Ajay's  operating  subsidiary.  The loan to Ajay was
recorded as a note receivable,  affiliate in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In
July 1995 Ajay obtained an $8,500 credit  facility which was used to pay off the
revolving loan provided by the Company. The Company has guaranteed Ajay's $8,500
credit  facility  and is  charging  Ajay a fee  of  1/2 of 1% per  annum  of the
outstanding loan amount for providing this guaranty.  The Chairman and President
of the Company is also Chairman and President of Ajay, and has guaranteed Ajay's
obligation to the Company under the loan guaranty.

In exchange for the Company  providing  this  financing the Company  received an
option to purchase up to  15,228,520  shares of Ajay common  stock  (which would
represent  approximately  45% of  Ajay's  then  outstanding  common  stock)  and
received  manufacturing  rights in certain Ajay facilities  through 2002 under a
joint  venture  agreement.  In October  1994 the  Company  exercised  options to
acquire  4,117,647  shares of Ajay  common  stock for $.34 per share,  through a
reduction  in the note  receivable  in the  amount of $1,400,  resulting  in the
Company owning  approximately  18% of Ajay's then outstanding  common stock. The
investment  in Ajay is recorded as an  investment  in affiliate in the unaudited
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets net of the  Company's  equity  interest of $282 in
Ajay's loss for the  twelve-month  period ending September 30, 1995. The Company
is required to account for the  investment  in Ajay on the equity  method due to
common  ownership  by the  Chairman  and  President  of the  Company who is also
Chairman  and  President of Ajay.  At September  30, 1995 the Company has vested
options to acquire 11,110,873 shares of Ajay common stock at prices ranging from
$.34 to $.50 per share.

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations (Dollars in thousands - except per share amounts)



In October  1995 Ajay  increased  its bank line from  $8,500 to $13,500  and the
Company increased its guaranty of this loan from $8,500 to $13,500. The Chairman
and  President  of the  Company,  who also is Chairman  and  President  of Ajay,
correspondingly  increased  his  guaranty to the Company from $8,500 to $13,500.
The increase allowed Ajay to complete two  acquisitions.  All other terms of the
agreement between the Company and Ajay remained as described above.

During 1995 the Company  completed  acquisitions  which  accounted for $9,646 of
total sales and $1,039 of earnings from  operations.  These  acquisitions are as
follows:

In February 1995 the Company acquired assets of approximately $5,400 from Hardee
Manufacturing  Company,  Inc. and the Waccamaw Wheel division of Red Bluff Grain
and Farm Supply,  Inc., of Loris,  South Carolina.  The acquisition was financed
through a combination of the assumption of liabilities, debt and cash. Hardee is
a manufacturer  of equipment used in highway and park  maintenance,  landscaping
and farming. Its product line includes sprayers,  rotary cutters, discs, harrows
and highway trailers.  Waccamaw Wheel manufactures solid rubber tail wheels from
recycled  truck and bus tires.  These are sold to Hardee and other rotary cutter
manufacturers.  Hardee's and Waccamaw Wheel's products are sold primarily in the
southeastern United States. The Company completed these acquisitions through two
newly formed subsidiaries each owned 80% by the Company and 20% by the seller.

In April 1995 the Company acquired  substantially  all of the business assets of
Aptek Technologies,  Inc. of Deerfield Beach,  Florida, for $1,400. In June 1995
the  Company  acquired  the land and  building  comprising  the Aptek  operating
facilities  for $4,600.  The $6,000  purchase price was a combination of cash of
$4,200 and Company common stock valued at $1,800 (543,806 shares). Aptek designs
and produces microcircuits,  cable assemblies and other electronic products used
in the telecommunication, computer and medical industries.

In August 1995 the  Company  acquired  substantially  all the assets of Agrotec,
Inc. of Pendleton,  North Carolina, for approximately $500 and the assumption of
certain  liabilities.  These  acquisitions  have been accounted for as purchases
and,  accordingly,   the  results  of  operations  have  been  included  in  the
Consolidated Statements of Operations from their purchase dates.

The Company's  results of operations have  historically  been dependent upon the
heavy vehicle component segment,  which accounted for over 55% of sales and over
90% of earnings from operations in 1995 and 1994. Over the past five years,  the
heavy  vehicle  industry  growth has been due to the  strength  of class 8 truck
sales  which  are  expected  to exceed  200,000  units in 1995.  Based  upon the
projections of industry analysts, class 8 truck sales could decrease by at least
15% to 20% during 1996.  Management  believes that the impact of the anticipated
decrease in class 8 truck sales on the  Company's  operations  will be mitigated
due to the following  factors:  1) the Company was awarded a contract to provide
electronic  throttles for the new Ford class 8 truck, 2) the class 6 and 7 truck
market is continuing to increase the use of electronic throttles, 3) new product
offerings by current class 8 customers are expected to capture additional market
share,  and 4) the use of electronic  throttles in off-highway  applications  is
expected to increase during the next few years.

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations (Dollars in thousands - except per share amounts)



The Company's automotive accessories segment has been experiencing lower margins
as a result of increased  competition  and soft retail sales by mass  merchants.
Management  has  implemented  a program to reduce  product  costs  through  more
efficient  production and  distribution to improve these margins.  The impact of
these changes may not be realized  until the later part of 1996.  The automotive
accessories  segment's primary  distribution  channel is through mass merchants.
The financial press recently reported the financial  difficulties  facing Kmart,
which is one of Kenco's largest  customers.  Although Kmart is not a significant
customer  to the  overall  Company,  the  loss  of  its  business  would  have a
significant  impact on the operations of the Kenco subsidiary.  Kenco's sales to
Kmart were  approximately  $1,500 during 1995, and Kmart  maintained an accounts
receivable  balance which  averaged  approximately  $500.  Management is closely
monitoring its extension of credit to the financial condition of Kmart.

It is anticipated that  acquisitions  made during the year will have a favorable
impact on the Company's  financial position and results of operations;  however,
management  is faced with the  challenge of  integrating  the  operations of its
acquisitions with its existing businesses while minimizing operating expenses.

The Company  anticipates  that cash generated from operations and utilization of
its loan  facility will be  sufficient  to satisfy  working  capital and capital
expenditure  requirements  for the foreseeable  future,  and provide the Company
with  financial  flexibility  to  respond  quickly  to  business  opportunities,
including opportunities for growth through internal development, strategic joint
ventures or acquisitions.

The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board has  recently  issued SFAS No. 107,
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments; No. 119, Disclosure about
Derivative Financial  Instruments and Fair Value of Financial  Instruments;  and
SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 107 and No. 119 are effective for the Company
for fiscal years ending after  December 15, 1995,  and SFAS No. 121 is effective
for fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 1995.  Adoption of SFAS No. 107,
No. 119 and No. 121 are not expected to have a material  impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

pneumatic/hydraulic controls product lines. The electronic throttle product line
sales,  which accounted for 53% of heavy vehicle component sales,  increased 24%
over the prior year.  Electronic  throttle unit sales increased  during the year
due to the  growth  of the  Class  8  truck  market  and  the  increased  use of
electronic throttles in the Class 6 and 7 truck market.

Gross Margin - Gross margin as a percent of sales was 28% in 1995 and 1994.

Operating  Expenses - Operating  expenses  for 1995 were $7,715 or 13% of sales,
compared to $5,127 or 12% of sales in the prior year.

period ending September 30, 1995.

Interest  Expense - Interest  expense for 1995 was $2,409 compared to $1,011 for
the prior year.  The increase in interest  expense is due to the increased  debt
incurred to finance acquisitions.

Note 2.  Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation - The Consolidated  Financial Statements include the
accounts of the  Company  and its  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,  first-out)
or market.

Property,  Plant and Equipment - Land, buildings,  equipment and improvements to
existing  facilities are recorded at cost.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred.  Depreciation has been computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of property and equipment as follows:  buildings 31.5
years,  machinery  and equipment 3 to 12 years,  and office  furniture 10 years.
Capitalized  leases are amortized  using the same method over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives or the lease term.

Cost in Excess of Net  Assets of  Businesses  Acquired - The excess of cost over
net assets of acquired  companies  is being  amortized  using the  straight-line
method  over  periods  not  exceeding  40 years.  At each  balance  sheet  date,
management  assesses  whether there has been an impairment in the carrying value
of cost in excess of net assets of businesses  acquired,  primarily by comparing
current and  projected  sales,  operating  income and annual  cash flows,  on an
undiscounted  basis,  with the related annual  amortization  expenses as well as
considering the equity of such companies.

Concentration  of Credit Risk - The Company invests a portion of its excess cash
in debt instruments of financial institutions with strong credit ratings and has
established  guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that maintain
safety and  liquidity.  The Company has not  experienced  any losses on its cash
equivalents.  The  Company  sells  its  products  to  customers  in  diversified
industries  worldwide.  The Company performs  ongoing credit  evaluations of its
customers'  financial  condition and maintains  allowances for potential  credit
losses. Actual losses and allowances have been within management's expectations.

Deferred  Debt  Issuance  Costs  - Costs  incurred  in the  acquisition  of debt
financing are amortized over the term of the debt agreement.

Years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)         Williams Controls, Inc.



Product Warranty - The Company provides a warranty covering defects arising from
products sold.  The warranty is limited to a specified  time period,  mileage or
hours of use, and varies by product and application.  The Company has provided a
reserve, which in the opinion of management,  is adequate to cover such warranty
costs.

Research and Development  Costs - Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.

Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax  consequences  attributable to differences  between the financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  the
consolidated  statement of  operations in the period that includes the enactment
date.

Post  Retirement  Benefits  -  Effective  October  1, 1993 the  Company  adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 106, Employers'  Accounting for
Post Retirement Benefits Other than Pensions. Statement 106 requires the Company
to accrue retiree  insurance  benefits over the period in which employees become
eligible for such benefits.  The Company implemented Statement 106 by amortizing
the transition obligation over twenty years.

Earnings per Share - Primary and fully  diluted  earnings per share are computed
on the basis of the  weighted  average  number of  shares  outstanding  plus the
common stock  equivalents  which would arise from the exercise of stock  options
and  warrants.  The primary  earnings  per share  calculation  uses the weighted
average share price for the period.  Fully  diluted  earnings per share uses the
period-end share price when higher than the weighted average share price for the
period. The average number of shares (in thousands) outstanding was:

Reclassifications  - Certain  amounts  previously  reported in the 1993 and 1994
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to classifications in the

Recent  FASB  Pronouncements  - The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board has
recently  issued  SFAS No.  107,  Disclosures  about  Fair  Value  of  Financial
Instruments; No. 119, Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair
Value of Financial  Instruments;  and SFAS No. 121, Accounting for Impairment of
Long-lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 107 and
No. 119 are effective for the Company for fiscal years ending after December 15,
1995,  and SFAS No. 121 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after December
15, 1995. Adoption of SFAS No. 107, No. 119 and No. 121 are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Note 3.  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Management  makes these  estimates using the best  information  available at the
time the estimates  are made;  however,  actual  results could differ from these
estimates.

Note 6.  Note Receivable, Affiliate

During  1994 the  Company  provided a $7,000  revolving  loan  facility  to Ajay
Sports,  Inc.  ("Ajay") for Ajay's operating  subsidiary.  Ajay manufactures and
distributes golf and billiard accessories  primarily to retailers throughout the
United States. The loan to Ajay was recorded as a note receivable,  affiliate in
the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  In July 1995 Ajay obtained an $8,500 credit
facility  which was used to pay off the revolving  loan provided by the Company.
The Company has guaranteed  Ajay's $8,500 credit facility and is charging Ajay a
fee of 1/2 of 1% per annum of the  outstanding  loan amount for  providing  this
guaranty.  The  Chairman  and  President  of the  Company is also  Chairman  and
President of Ajay, and has guaranteed Ajay's obligation to the Company under the
loan guaranty.

In exchange for the Company providing interim financing, the Company received an
option to purchase up to  15,228,520  shares of Ajay common  stock  (which would
represent  approximately  45% of  Ajay's  then  outstanding  common  stock)  and
received  manufacturing  rights in certain Ajay facilities through 2002, under a
joint venture agreement. At September 30, 1995 the Company has vested options to
acquire  11,110,873  shares of Ajay common stock at prices  ranging from $.34 to
$.50 per share.

In October  1995 Ajay  increased  its bank line from  $8,500 to $13,500  and the
Company increased its guaranty of this loan from $8,500 to $13,500. The Chairman
and  President  of the  Company,  who also is Chairman  and  President  of Ajay,
correspondingly  increased  his  guaranty to the Company from $8,500 to $13,500.
The increase allowed Ajay to complete two  acquisitions.  All other terms of the
agreement between the Company and Ajay remained as described above.


Note 7.  Investment in Affiliate

In October 1994 the Company  exercised  options to acquire  4,117,647  shares of
Ajay common stock  through a reduction in the note  receivable  in the amount of
$1,400,  resulting  in the  Company  owning  approximately  18% of  Ajay's  then
outstanding common stock. The investment in Ajay is recorded as an investment in
affiliate  in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  net of  the  Company's  equity
interest of $282 in Ajay's loss for the twelve-month  period ended September 30,
1995.  The  Company is required  to account  for the  investment  in Ajay on the
equity  method due to common  ownership  by the  Chairman  and  President of the
Company who is also  Chairman and  President of Ajay. If valued at the September
30, 1995 quoted  closing price of publicly  traded Ajay shares,  the  calculated
value of the Company's investment in Ajay would be approximately $2,574.

Note 9.  Debt

In July 1995 the  Company  obtained a $30,000  credit  facility  to replace  its
previous  financing  package  comprised  of term loans of $8,600 and a revolving
loan of $10,000.  The $30,000  credit  facility is a 3 year revolving loan which
carries  an  interest  rate at either the  bank's  prime  rate or the  Interbank
Offering Rate (IBOR) plus 2% to 3% depending upon certain financial ratios.  The
Company has the option to borrow at the bank's prime rate or the IBOR plus rate.
The Company has borrowed  approximately  $15,000  under the new credit  facility
with interest at 7.9% which is IBOR plus 2%. The weighted average interest rates
on the  Company's  revolving  lines of credit for the years ended  September 30,
1995, 1994 and 1993 were 9.0%, 8.9% and 8.3%, respectively.

The Company has pledged  substantially  all of its assets as collateral  for the
credit  facility.  The  Company is  required to maintain a minimum net worth and
maintain  certain  financial  ratios.  The loan agreement also contains  certain
restrictions that limit  acquisitions,  investments,  payment of dividends,  and
capital expenditures.

Note 11.  Pension Plans

The Company maintains two pension plans; one plan covers the salaried  employees
and the other plan covers the hourly employees.

Annual net periodic  pension costs under the pension plans are  determined on an
actuarial  basis.  The  Company's  policy is to fund these costs accrued over 15
years and obligations arising due to plan amendments over the period benefitted.
The assets and liabilities are adjusted annually based on actuarial results.

Net pension cost is computed as follows:

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 87 requires recognition in the
balance sheet of a minimum pension liability for underfunded  plans. The minimum
liability  that must be  recognized  is equal to the  excess of the  accumulated
benefit  obligation  over plan assets.  The minimum  liability for the Company's
underfunded  plan of $551 has been  recorded  as a  long-term  liability  with a
partially  offsetting  intangible  asset of $278  recorded in other assets and a

In 1995 the Company had one customer who accounted for  approximately 12% of net
sales. In 1994 one customer  accounted for approximately  14%, and two customers
who each  accounted for 10% of net sales.  In 1993 two  customers  accounted for
approximately  19% and 14% of net sales.  These sales were made by the Company's
heavy vehicle  components  segment.  The Company grants credit generally without
collateral to its customers. The Company's customers are not concentrated in any
geographic region.


Note 16.  Other Benefit Plans

The Company  maintains an Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan (ESOP) for  non-union
employees.  The ESOP may buy  shares  on the open  market or  directly  from the
Company.

The ESOP has  been  authorized  to  borrow  up to  $1,000  from the  Company  or
financial  institution to finance the purchase of the Company's common stock. At
September 30, 1995 the outstanding  balance of the loan was  approximately  $630
which has been used to finance the purchase of  approximately  530,000 shares of
common stock. The Company is required to make contributions to the ESOP to repay
the loan including interest.

The Company  sponsors a 401(k) plan in which  eligible  salaried  employees  may
elect to  contribute a portion of their  compensation.  The Company  contributed
approximately  $85 and $43 in the  form of  matching  contributions  in 1995 and
1994.


Note 17.  Post Retirement Benefits other than Pensions

The Company  provides  health care and life  insurance  benefits for many of its
retired  employees.  These  benefits  are  subject  to  deductibles,  co-payment
provisions  and other  limitations.  The  Company  may amend or change  the plan
periodically. The cost of these benefits is expensed as claims are paid.

Effective  October 1, 1993 the Company adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standards
Standard No. 106, Employers'  Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits other than
Pensions  (SFAS 106).  SFAS 106  requires  companies  to accrue the cost of post
retirement  health care and life insurance  benefits  within  employees'  active
service period rather than  recognizing  these costs on a cash basis as had been
prior practice.

The  Company  elected  to  amortize  the  Accumulated  Post  Retirement  Benefit
obligation  at  October  1,  1993  over  twenty  years  as a  component  of post
retirement benefits expense.

The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the  Accumulated  Post
Retirement  Benefit  Obligation  (APBO) ranged  between 3%-5% in the first year,
declining to 0% after four years. The discount rate used in determining the APBO
was 8.0%.

If the  assumed  medical  costs  trends  were  increased  by 1%,  the APBO as of
September  30, 1995 would  increase by $8, and the aggregate of the services and
interest cost components of the net annual post retirement benefit cost would be
increased by $1.

Note 18.  Acquisitions

In January 1994 the Company acquired the assets of Michiana  Performance  Group,
Inc. for $65 in cash and 100,000  shares of common  stock.  The number of shares
issued in conjunction  with the transaction can increase at the end of two years
by up to an additional  25,000 shares as part of a price  protection  provision.
The Michiana  assets acquired  include  light-truck  and  sport-utility  vehicle
accessories.  In January  1994 the  Company  acquired  substantially  all of the
assets of National Energy Service  Company of Zanesville,  Ohio for $880 in cash
and 40,000 shares of the Company's  common stock.  The assets acquired include a
product line of conversion kits to allow vehicles to use compressed  natural gas
and gas metering and regulating products.  Management does not consider the 1994
acquisitions to be significant.

In February  1995 the Company  acquired  substantially  all the assets valued at
approximately  $5,400 of Hardee  Manufacturing  Company,  Inc.  and the Waccamaw
Wheel  division  of Red  Bluff  Grain and Farm  Supply,  Inc.,  of Loris,  South
Carolina.  The acquisition was financed  through a combination of the assumption
of  liabilities,  debt,  cash and 45,000 shares of the  Company's  common stock.
Hardee is a  manufacturer  of  equipment  used in highway and park  maintenance,
landscaping  and farming.  Its product line includes  sprayers,  rotary cutters,
discs,  harrows and highway trailers.  Waccamaw Wheel  manufactures solid rubber
tail wheels from recycled  truck and bus tires that are sold to Hardee and other
rotary cutter  manufacturers.  Hardee's and Waccamaw  Wheel's  products are sold
primarily  in  the  southeastern   United  States.  The  Company  completed  the
acquisitions through two newly formed subsidiaries each owned 80% by the Company
and 20% by the seller.

In April 1995 the Company  completed the  acquisition of the business  assets of
Aptek Technologies,  Inc. of Deerfield Beach,  Florida, for $1,400. In June 1995
the  Company  acquired  the land and  building  comprising  the Aptek  operating
facilities  for $4,600.  The $6,000  purchase price was a combination of cash of
$4,200 and Company common stock valued at $1,800 (543,806 shares). Aptek designs
and produces microcircuits,  cable assemblies and other electronic products used
in transportation, telecommunication, computer and medical industries.

In August 1995 the  Company  acquired  substantially  all the assets of Agrotec,
Inc. of Pendleton,  North Carolina, for approximately $500 and the assumption of
certain liabilities.

The  acquisitions  have been accounted for as purchases;  and  accordingly,  the
results of  operations  have been  included in the  Consolidated  Statements  of
Operations from their purchase dates.  The unaudited  results of operations on a
pro forma basis as though the  acquisitions  had  occurred as of October 1, 1994
and 1993 are as follows:

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




Board of Directors
Williams Controls, Inc.
Portland, Oregon

We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Williams
Controls,  Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as of September  30, 1995 and 1994,  and the
related  consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended  September 30, 1995.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of Williams Controls,
Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as of September  30, 1995 and 1994,  and the results of
their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year
period  ended  September  30,  1995,  in  conformity  with  generally   accepted
accounting principles.

                            CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT
                                       OF
                          CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION



         WILLIAMS CONTROLS, INC., a corporation organized and existing under and
by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,

DOES HEREBY CERTIFY THAT:

         FIRST:  That  at a  meeting  of the  Board  of  Directors  of  WILLIAMS
CONTROLS, INC., resolutions were duly adopted setting forth a proposed amendment
of  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  of  said  corporation,  declaring  said
amendment to be advisable,  and to present said  amendment at the annual meeting
of  the  stockholders  of  said  corporation  for  consideration   thereof.  The
resolution setting forth the proposed amendment is as follows:

         RESOLVED,  that  the  present  Article  SEVENTH  of  the  Corporation's
         Certificate of  Incorporation  shall be replaced in its entirety by the
         following:

                  "SEVENTH:  The business and affairs of this corporation  shall
         be managed by or under the  direction  of the Board of  Directors.  The
         Board of Directors  shall consist of one or more members which may from
         time to time be  increased  or  decreased  in such  manner  as shall be
         provided by the Bylaws of this  corporation.  Election of  directors or
         their  appointment need not be by written ballot unless required by the
         Bylaws.  The  requisite  quorum for the  transaction  of  business at a
         meeting of the Board of  Directors  shall  consist of  one-third of the
         total number of directors.

                  At the annual meeting of stockholders at which this Article is
         adopted, the directors shall be divided into three classes,  designated
         Class I,  Class  II,  and  Class  III,  each  director  to serve  for a
         three-year  term and each  class to be as  nearly  equal in  number  as
         possible.  The initial term of office of the Class III directors  shall
         expire at the  corporation's  first subsequent annual meeting following
         adoption of this  Article,  the initial  term of office of the Class II
         directors shall expire at the  corporation's  second  subsequent annual
         meeting following  adoption of this Amendment,  and the initial term of
         office of the Class I directors shall expire at the corporation's third
         subsequent  annual  meeting  following  adoption of this Article.  Upon
         expiration  of these  initial  terms,  directors  elected to succeed to
         those   directors  whose  terms  have  expired  shall  be  elected  for
         three-year terms of office.

                  If the  number  of  directors  is  changed,  any  increase  or
         decrease  shall be  apportioned  among the classes so as to maintain or
         attain,  if  possible,  the equality of the number of directors in each
         class. If such equality is not possible, the increase or decrease shall
         be apportioned among the classes in


<PAGE>

         such a way that the  difference  in the number of  directors in any two
         classes  shall not exceed one. In no case will a decrease in the number
         of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

                  In furtherance  and not in limitation of the powers  conferred
         by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:

                  A. To manage and govern the  corporation  by majority  vote of
         members  present at any  regular  or special  meeting at which a quorum
         shall be present  unless the act of a greater number is required by the
         laws of Delaware,  the  Certificate of  Incorporation  or the Bylaws of
         this corporation.

                  B. To determine from time to time whether,  to what extent, at
         what times and places and under what  conditions  and  regulations  the
         accounts, books and papers of the corporation, or any of them, shall be
         open to the inspection of the  stockholders,  and no stockholder  shall
         have  any  right  to  inspect  any  account,  book or  document  of the
         corporation, except as and to the extent expressly provided by law with
         reference  to the right of  stockholders  to examine  the  original  or
         duplicate  stock  ledger,  or otherwise  expressly  provided by law, or
         except as expressly authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors.

                  C.  Except  to the  extent  prohibited  by law,  the  Board of
         Directors shall have the right (which, to the extent  exercised,  shall
         be  exclusive)  to  establish  the rights,  powers,  duties,  rules and
         procedures  that from time to time shall  govern the Board of Directors
         and each of its members including without  limitation the vote required
         for any  action by the Board of  Directors,  and that from time to time
         shall affect the directors' power to manage the business and affairs of
         the  corporation;  and no Bylaw shall be adopted by stockholders  which
         shall impair or impede the implementation of the foregoing.

                  D.  To adopt, amend, or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation.

         SECOND:  That  at the  annual  meeting  of  the  stockholders  of  said
corporation  duly called and held on February 22, 1995,  the proposed  amendment
was presented to the stockholders  for their approval,  and the necessary number
of shares as required by statute were voted in favor of the amendment.

         THIRD:  That said  amendment  was duly adopted in  accordance  with the
provisions  of  Section  242 of the  General  Corporation  Law of the  State  of
Delaware.


                                                         2

                 POWERS, DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RELATIVE,
                PARTICIPATING, OPTIONAL AND OTHER SPECIAL RIGHTS
                OF THE 10% MANDATORY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
                                       OF
                             WILLIAMS CONTROLS, INC.


         Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of this series shall be
designated as "10% Mandatory Redeemable  Convertible  Preferred Stock" (the "10%
Preferred  Stock") of  Williams  Controls,  Inc.,  a Delaware  corporation  (the
"Corporation") and the number of shares constituting this series shall be 2,000.

         Section 2.  Dividend  Rights.  The holders of the 10%  Preferred  Stock
shall be entitled  to  receive,  out of any funds  legally  available  therefor,
dividends,  payable in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on
shares of the  Corporation's  common stock,  $.01 par value (the "Common Stock")
and in an amount per share of up to $100 annually,  payable  monthly if, as, and
when  dividends are declared by the Board of  Directors.  Such  dividends  shall
accumulate,  without  interest,  to the extent that  dividends are not paid on a
monthly basis.

         Section 3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of a liquidation or winding
up of the Corporation,  the holder of each share of 10% Preferred Stock shall be
entitled  to  receive  a  preferential  amount  equal to $1,000  per share  plus
accumulated,  unpaid dividends before any amount shall be paid to the holders of
shares of the  Corporation's  Common Stock.  In the event that the assets of the
Corporation  are  insufficient  to permit  full  payment  to the  holders of 10%
Preferred  Stock as herein  provided,  then  such  assets  shall be  distributed
ratably  among the  outstanding  10% Preferred  Stock.  After the payment or the
setting  apart  of  payment  to  the  holders  of  10%  Preferred  Stock  of the
preferential  amounts so payable to them,  the  holders of 10%  Preferred  Stock
shall be entitled to no further distribution.

         For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation shall not be deemed to be
occasioned by, or to include, the Corporation's sale of all or substantially all
of its assets of its assets or the  acquisition  of the  Corporation  by another
entity  by way of merger  or  consolidation  resulting  in the  exchange  of the
outstanding shares of the Corporation for securities or consideration issued, or
caused to be issued, by the acquiring Corporation or its subsidiary.

         The per share liquidation  preferences to be paid to the holders of 10%
Preferred  Stock  hereunder  shall  be  subject  to  equitable  adjustment  by a
resolution  of the  Board of  Directors  to  reflect  any  stock  splits,  stock
combinations, or stock subdivisions.

                                        5

         Section 4.  Redemption Rights.

         (A)  Mandatory  Redemption.  In the event the  Corporation  completes a
public  offering  raising  at least  $3,000,000  in net  proceeds  (the  "Public
Offering") and provided  further the Corporation  has available  Sufficient Cash
Flow from  Operations the  Corporation  shall redeem shares of the 10% Preferred
Stock  on a pro rata  basis  which  have a  liquidation  value of not more  than
$1,000,000 (not including  accrued but unpaid dividends) during the four or more
months  immediately  following  the  month  in  which  the  Public  Offering  is
completed.  To the extent the Public  Offering  raises net proceeds in excess of
$3,000,000,  the Corporation shall redeem additional shares of the 10% Preferred
Stock on a dollar-for-dollar basis based on the liquidation value (not including
accrued but unpaid  dividends)  of the shares of 10% Preferred  Stock,  provided
that the Corporation has available  Sufficient Cash Flow from  Operations.  Only
whole shares of 10% Preferred Stock shall be redeemed.  For the purposes of this
Subsection 4(A), the term  "Sufficient  Cash Flow From Operations"  means during
any  accounting  period (which may be monthly,  quarterly,  or yearly):  (i) the
excess of the Corporation's net income from operations  calculated in accordance
with  generally  accepted  accounting   principles  (ii)  over  the  amount  the
Corporation  reasonably  believes  necessary  to  sustain  operations  over  the
subsequent  such  period.  The  Corporation's  belief may be based on  financial
statements  prepared by the  Corporation in the ordinary course of its business,
and such financial statements need not be audited.

         (B) Redemption  Price.  The shares of the 10% Preferred  Stock shall be
redeemed  at a price of $1,000  per share  plus a sum equal to all  accrued  and
unpaid  dividends on such shares to the date set for redemption (the "Redemption
Date").

         (C) Procedure for Redemption. Notice of redemption of the 10% Preferred
Stock shall be mailed to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed,  at
the  stockholder's  address  of  record,  not  less  than 15 days  prior  to the
Redemption  Date.  Redemption  shall be pro rata  among all  holders  of the 10%
Preferred Stock. The notice of redemption shall specify the date, time and place
of redemption,  the redemption  price, the date when the shares of 10% Preferred
Stock cease to be convertible,  and the number of shares thereof which are to be
redeemed.  As described  more fully below,  holders of the 10%  Preferred  Stock
shall have the right to convert shares of the 10% Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock any time prior to the Redemption Date.

                  Unless  default  shall be made in the  payment  in full of the
redemption price and any accrued and unpaid  dividends,  dividends on the shares
called for  redemption  shall cease to accrue on the  Redemption  Date,  and all
rights of the holders of those  shares as  stockholders  of the  Corporation  by
reason of the  ownership  of those shares  shall cease on the  Redemption  Date,
except the right to convert to Common Stock any shares theretofore  tendered for
Conversion and except the right to receive the amount payable upon redemption of
the  shares  on  presentation  and  surrender  of  the  respective  certificates
representing the shares, and the shares shall not after the

                                        6

<PAGE>



Redemption Date be deemed to be  outstanding.  In case fewer than all the shares
represented by any such  certificates are redeemed,  a new certificate  shall be
issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.

                  Any shares of the 10% Preferred  Stock which shall at any time
have been  redeemed,  or which shall have been  converted  pursuant to Section 5
below, shall, after such redemption or conversion, have the status of authorized
but  unissued  shares  of  Preferred  Stock,  without  designation,  and  may be
redesignated and reissued.

         Section  5.  Conversion  Rights.  The  holders of the shares of the 10%
Preferred Stock shall have the right, at their option,  to convert shares of the
10% Preferred  Stock into shares of Common Stock of the  Corporation at any time
before the Redemption Date, upon the following terms:

                  (A) The shares of the 10% Preferred Stock shall be convertible
at the office of the Corporation and at such other office or offices, if any, as
the Board of Directors may designate,  into fully paid and nonassessable  shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation.  Each share of the 10% Preferred Stock shall
be  convertible  into shares of the  Corporation's  Common Stock at a conversion
price of $1.25 per share of Common Stock or 800 shares of Common Stock per share
of 10% Preferred  Stock (the  "Conversion"),  plus the amount of any accrued and
unpaid  dividends  and  subject  to  adjustment  from  time to  time in  certain
instances as hereinafter provided.

                  (B) In order to convert shares of the 10% Preferred Stock into
shares of Common Stock,  the holder thereof shall surrender at the office of the
Corporation,  or at such other office or offices as the Board of  Directors  may
designate,  the  certificate  of  certificates  therefor,  duly  endorsed to the
Corporation  or in blank,  and give written  notice to the  Corporation  at said
office  that the holder  elects to  convert  the shares and the name or names in
which the  certificate  or  certificates  for  shares of Common  Stock are to be
issued. Shares of the 10% Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted
immediately  prior  to the  close  of  business  on the day the  notice  and the
certificate or certificates  representing  shares surrendered for conversion are
received in accordance  with the foregoing  provisions,  and after such time the
person or  persons  entitled  to  receive  the Common  Stock  issuable  upon the
Conversion  shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
such Common Stock (the "Conversion  Date"). As promptly as practicable after the
receipt of the notice and the surrendered  shares as aforesaid,  the Corporation
shall issue and deliver at said office a  certificate  or  certificates  for the
number of full shares of Common Stock issued upon the Conversion,  together with
a cash payment in lieu of any fractional  share as  hereinafter  provided to the
person or persons entitled to receive the same.

                  (C) No  fractional  shares of Common Stock will be issued upon
Conversion,  but any such fractions will be adjusted in cash on the basis of the
then current  market value of the Common Stock,  which shall be deemed to be the
average of

                                        7

<PAGE>



the  reported  last  closing  bid and asked  prices of the  Common  Stock on the
National   Association  of  Securities   Dealers   Automated   Quotation  System
("NASDAQ"),  or  similar  organization  if NASDAQ is no  longer  reporting  such
information,  or (2) if the Common  Stock is listed or  admitted to trading on a
United States securities  exchange  registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934,  the reported  last sale price regular way or, in case no such reported
sale takes place on any day, the average of the  reported  closing bid and asked
prices  regular  way, in either case on the  Composite  Tape,  or, if the Common
Stock is not quoted on the  Composite  Tape, on the  principal  such  securities
exchange  registered on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading.
If on any such date the Common Stock is not quoted by any such organization, the
fair value of such Common Stock on such, as determined by the Board of Directors
shall be used.

                  (D) Adjustments for stock dividends,  stock splits, mergers or
reorganizations, etc.

                  (1) In case prior to the  Conversion  Date as to any shares of
10% Preferred Stock (the "Converted  Shares") the Corporation shall fix a record
date or otherwise  establish a date (the "Record Date") for the determination of
holders  of  Common  Stock  entitled  to  receive  a  stock  dividend  or  other
distribution  payable in shares of Common Stock:  (a) and such dividend or other
distribution is paid prior to the Conversion Date, then upon conversion, holders
of the Converted Shares shall receive such additional number of shares of Common
Stock as they would have been  entitled  to receive had they  converted  the 10%
Preferred  Stock  prior to the Record  Date;  or (b) and such  dividend or other
distribution is paid following the Conversion  Date, then the Corporation  shall
pay additional  shares of Common Stock to the holders of the Converted Shares as
they would have been  entitled to receive had they  converted  the 10% Preferred
Stock prior to the Record Date.

                  (2) In case prior to the  Conversion  Date as to any shares of
10% Preferred Stock the Corporation  shall fix a record date or establish a date
for the  determination  of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive shares of
stock  or other  securities  or  property  in  connection  with  the  merger  or
consolidation  of the  Corporation  with  or  into  another  Corporation  or the
conveyance  of all or  substantially  all of the  assets of the  Corporation  to
another  Corporation,  and such shares of stock or other  securities or property
shall not have been  delivered to the holders of Common Stock on or prior to the
Conversion  Date,  then, in any such event,  the holders of the shares of Common
Stock  issued or  issuable on  Conversion  of the 10%  Preferred  Stock shall be
entitled to receive on the date of delivery of such stock or other securities or
property, that pro rata portion of such stock or other securities or property to
which  such  holder of 10%  Preferred  Stock  would have been  entitled  if such
delivery had been prior to the Conversion Date.

                  (E) The Corporation  will not, by amendment of its Articles of
Incorporation or through any reorganization,  transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger,

                                                         8

dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or
seek to avoid the  observance or  performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed  hereunder by the  Corporation  but will at all times in good faith
assist in the  carrying out of all the  provisions  of this Section 5 and in the
taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the  conversion  rights  of the  holders  of the  10%  Preferred  Stock  against
impairment.

         Section 6. Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise  provided in the General

omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation  of  law,  (iii)  under  Section  174 of the  DGCL,  or  (iv)  for any

the DGCL is  amended  after  approval  by the  stockholders  of this  Article to
authorize   corporate  action  further  eliminating  or  limiting  the  personal
liability of  directors,  then the  liability  of a director of the  corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest  extent  permitted by the DGCL, as
so amended.

         Any  repeal  or  modification   of  the  foregoing   paragraph  by  the
stockholders  of the  corporation  shall  not  adversely  affect  any  right  or
protection of a director of the corporation  existing at the time of such repeal
or modification.

person who is or was a director to the fullest extent provided by law.

law  and  if  provided  by  resolution  of  the  corporation's  stockholders  or
directors, or in a contract.

         The  corporation  may purchase and maintain  insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director,  officer,  employee,  fiduciary or agent of the
corporation and who while a director,  officer, employee,  fiduciary or agent of
the  corporation,  is or was  serving  at the  request of the  corporation  as a
director,  officer, partner, trustee, employee,  fiduciary or agent of any other
foreign or  domestic  corporation,  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust,  other
enterprise or employee  benefit plan against any liability  asserted  against or
incurred  by him in any such  capacity  or  arising  out of his  status as such,
whether or not the  corporation  would have the power to  indemnify  him against
such liability under provisions of the DGCL.

         TENTH:  Whenever a compromise or  arrangement  is proposed  between the
corporation  and  its  creditors  or  any  class  of  them  and/or  between  the
corporation  and its  stockholders  or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction  within the State of Delaware may, on the  application in a summary
way of the  corporation  or of any  creditor  or  stockholder  thereof or on the
application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the corporation under the

be summoned in such  manner as the said court  directs.  If a majority in number
representing  three-fourths  in value of the  creditors  or class of  creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the  corporation,  as the
case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of
the  corporation as a consequence of such  compromise or  arrangement,  the said
compromise or arrangement  and the said  reorganization  shall, if sanctioned by
the court to which the said  application  has been  made,  be binding on all the
creditors  or class of  creditors,  and/or on all the  stockholders  or class of
stockholders,  of  the  corporation,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  also  on the
corporation.

         ELEVENTH:   Subject  to  the   provisions   of  this   Certificate   of

purpose of forming a corporation pursuant to the DGCL, do make this Certificate,
hereby  declaring  and  certifying  that  this is my act and deed and the  facts

                                    GUARANTY


         THIS  GUARANTY is entered into  effective as of October 2, 1995, by and
between  Thomas W.  Itin  ("Itin")  and  Williams  Controls,  Inc.,  a  Delaware
corporation, and its successors and assigns ("Williams").

         A. For its own benefit  and that of its  operating  subsidiaries,  Ajay
Sports,  Inc.  ("Ajay") has obtained  financing of up to $13.5  million  under a
revolving  loan  agreement  dated as of July 25,  1995  between  Ajay and United
States  National  Bank of Oregon ("US  Bank"),  as amended by a First  Amendment
dated as of October 2, 1995 (as amended,  the "Loan  Agreement").  The Ajay Loan
Agreement is guaranteed by each of Ajay's operating  subsidiaries.  Further, the
Ajay Loan  Agreement  is secured by the  inventory  and accounts now existing or
after acquired.

         B. Williams has guaranteed  repayment of the  obligations of Ajay to US
Bank under the Loan Agreement (the "Williams Guaranty").

         C. Itin  previously  delivered to Williams  his guaranty in  connection
with  Williams'  exercise  of stock  options to purchase  4,111,647  shares (the
"Shares") of Ajay common stock for an aggregate  purchase  price of  $1,400,000,
which guaranty is being continued as provided herein.

         D. This Guaranty, when delivered,  shall supersede, in all respects the
previous  guaranty of Itin to Williams and Williams  Controls  Industries,  Inc.
dated as of October 4, 1994.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  Williams'  guaranty  of Ajay's
obligations   under  the  Ajay  Loan  Agreement  and  other  good  and  valuable
consideration,  the adequacy and receipt of which  hereby is  acknowledged,  and
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby covenant and agree as follows:

         1. The Guaranty. Itin hereby absolutely and unconditionally  guarantees
to Williams repayment of any amounts Williams is required to pay to US Bank upon
performance  under  the  Williams  Guaranty,   including,   without  limitation,
principal,  interest and reasonable  collection  costs, and the Market Value (as
hereinafter  defined) of the Shares at not less than  $1,400,000 on the date, if
any, that Itin first becomes  obligated to perform under this  Guaranty,  all of
the foregoing being hereinafter referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations." For
purposes of this  Guaranty,  "Market  Value" shall mean the average  closing bid
price per share of the Ajay  common  stock as  reported  on the NASDAQ  SmallCap
Market or the

3329_2


                                       -1-

<PAGE>



OTC Bulletin Board, or if none, the National Quotation Bureau's "Pink Sheets."

         2.  Application  of  Payments.  Any  payment  made by Itin  under  this
Guaranty  shall be  effective  to  reduce or  discharge  the  liability  of Itin
hereunder without further notice of any kind.

         3.  Continuing  Guaranty.  Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  this
Guaranty shall continue to be in force and be binding upon Itin until terminated
in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 below. If Williams is required to
perform under the Williams Guaranty,  Williams shall give Itin written notice of
its performance thereunder and proceed to enforce this Guaranty.

         4. Termination.  This Guaranty shall terminate (a) if Williams, without
Itin's consent,  amends,  modifies or extends the Williams Guaranty, or (b) when
all of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full and 95 days has elapsed since
the date of full payment and no  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or similar  filing has
occurred with respect to Ajay or Itin.  Upon the  occurrence of any such events,
Williams will furnish Itin written cancellation of this Guaranty and will return
the original of this Guaranty to Itin.

         5.       General Provisions.

                  (a) No delay on the part of  Williams  in the  exercise of any
power or right  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall  any  single or
partial  exercise  of any  power or right  preclude  other or  further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other power or right.

                  (b)      This Guaranty may not be assigned.

                  (c)      This Guaranty is made under and shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Oregon.

                  (d) Notwithstanding  any provision herein to the contrary,  if
Williams is  required  to perform  under the  Williams  Guaranty,  it first will
proceed  against  Ajay and its assets to satisfy the amounts  paid to US Bank by
Williams under the Williams Guaranty.

                  (e) It is the  intention of Williams  that Itin will be called
upon to satisfy this Guaranty only as a last resort after Williams has exhausted
all other remedies available to it.

                  (f) Upon performance of Williams under the Williams  Guaranty,
and the  assignment  to Williams by US Bank of US Bank's  rights in any security
interests granted by Ajay and/or its

subsidiaries  under the Ajay Loan Agreement and documents  filed to perfect such
security  interests,  Williams shall assign to Itin a proportionate  interest in
the same to the extent Itin pays  amounts to Williams to satisfy the  Guaranteed
Obligations.

                                    GUARANTY



         THIS GUARANTY is dated and  delivered  effective as of October 6, 1995,
by Joseph C. Giuffre ("Giuffre"), for the benefit of Ajay Sports, Inc. ("Ajay"),
a Delaware corporation,  Palm Springs Golf, Inc. ("PSG"), a Colorado corporation
wholly  owned  by  Ajay,  Williams  Controls,  Inc.  ("Williams"),   a  Delaware
corporation, and their respective successors and assigns. Ajay and PSG and their
successors and assigns are collectively referred to herein as the "Company."

         A. For its own benefit and that of its operating subsidiaries, Ajay has
obtained financing of up to $13.5 million under a revolving loan agreement dated
as of July 25, 1995 between Ajay and United States  National Bank of Oregon ("US
Bank"), as amended by a First Amendment dated as of October 2, 1995 (as amended,
the "Loan  Agreement").  The Ajay Loan Agreement is guaranteed by each of Ajay's
operating  subsidiaries,  including  PSG.  Further,  the Ajay Loan  Agreement is
secured by the inventory and accounts now existing or after acquired.

         B. Williams has guaranteed  repayment of the  obligations of Ajay to US
Bank under the Loan Agreement (the "Williams/US Bank Guaranty").

         C. Thomas W. Itin,  Chairman of the Board,  Chief Executive Officer and
President of Ajay,  has personally  unconditionally  guaranteed to Williams full
repayment by Ajay of up to $13.5  million to Williams if Williams is required to
perform under its Guaranty of the Ajay Loan Agreement.

         D.  PSG has  entered  into an  Asset  Purchase  Agreement  (the  "Asset
Agreement") with Palm Springs Golf Company, Inc. ("Palm Springs"),  a California
corporation,  under which PSG has purchased  certain assets,  subject to certain
related liabilities, of Palm Springs.

         E. In connection with the Closing held under the Asset  Agreement,  the
Company has repaid all of Palm Springs outstanding  obligations under its credit
facility  with Bank IV Kansas,  N.A. (the "Palm Springs  Credit  Facility"),  of
approximately $3.1 million.

         F.  Giuffre had  personally  guaranteed  repayment  by Palm Springs for
amounts owed under the Palm Springs Credit Facility.

         G. Upon the payoff of the Palm  Springs  Credit  Facility,  Giuffre was
released  from his  obligations  as a guarantor  under the Palm  Springs  Credit
Facility.

         H. As partial  consideration  for the payoff and  resulting  release of
Giuffre  under his  guaranty  to Bank IV,  Giuffre  has agreed to  deliver  this
Guaranty in connection with the Closing under the Asset Agreement.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  Giuffre's  release  from  his
obligations under a guaranty of the Palm Springs Credit Facility,  the extension
of credit by Ajay, either under its Loan Agreement or otherwise,  to PSG for its
operations and expansion of the business,  the Williams/US Bank Garanty, and for
other good and valuable  consideration  the adequacy and receipt of which hereby
is acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, Giuffre hereby covenants and
agrees as follows:

         1. The  Guaranty.  Except as  otherwise  provided in paragraph 2 below,
Giuffre hereby absolutely and  unconditionally  guarantees to Williams repayment
of any amounts Williams is required to pay to to US Bank upon performance  under
the  Williams/US  Bank  Guaranty,  including,  without  limitation,   principal,
interest and reasonable collection costs (the "Guaranteed Obligations").

         2.  Limitation  of  Guaranty.  The  maximum  amount  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations  for which  Giuffre  shall be liable under this  Guaranty  shall not
exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate.

         3.  Application  of Payments.  Any payment  made by Giuffre  under this
Guaranty  shall be  effective to reduce or  discharge  the  liability of Giuffre
hereunder without further notice of any kind.

         4.  Continuing  Guaranty.  Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  this
Guaranty  shall  continue  to be in force  and be  binding  upon  Giuffre  until
terminated in accordance  with the provisions of Section 5 below. If Williams is
required to perform under the  Williams/US  Bank  Guaranty,  Williams shall give
Giuffre written notice of its performance thereunder and proceed to enforce this
Guaranty.

         5.  Termination.  This Guaranty  shall  terminate on the earlier of (a)
January 1, 1998, or (b) when all of the Guaranteed  Obligations are paid in full
and 95 days has  elapsed  since  the  date of full  payment  and no  bankruptcy,
insolvency  or similar  filing has occurred  with  respect to Williams,  Ajay or
Giuffre.  Upon the occurrence of any such events,  Williams will furnish Giuffre
written  cancellation  of this  Guaranty  and will  return the  original of this
Guaranty to Giuffre.

         6.       General Provisions.

                  (a) No delay on the part of  Williams  in the  exercise of any
power or right  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall  any  single or
partial  exercise  of any  power or right  preclude  other or  further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other power or right.
