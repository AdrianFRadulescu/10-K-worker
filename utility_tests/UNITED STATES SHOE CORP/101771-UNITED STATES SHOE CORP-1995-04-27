                                  THE COMPANY

         The United States Shoe Corporation (the "company" or "Corporation") is
a specialty retailing company operating 2,349 retail outlets and leased
departments in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada.  The company's
specialty retailing businesses focus on three major product segments:  women's
apparel, optical and footwear.  The company also manufactures, imports and
wholesales prominent footwear brands, primarily for women, that accounted for
about 17% of the company's net sales for the fiscal year ended January 28, 1995
("fiscal 1994").  The number of stores operated by the company's retailing
businesses at the close of each of its last three fiscal years is as follows:

                        WOMEN'S APPAREL RETAILING GROUP

         The operating divisions constituting the Women's Apparel Retailing
Group, whose stores are located primarily in enclosed malls, are as follows:

         CASUAL CORNER offers wear-to-work fashion apparel for the misses
         customer for her ready-to-wear, sportswear and accessory needs at
         moderate and upper-moderate prices.

         PETITE SOPHISTICATE focuses on wear-to-work and casual fashion apparel
         for women 5'4" and under at moderate and upper-moderate prices.

         AUGUST MAX WOMAN  offers wear-to-work and casual fashion apparel for
         women who wear sizes 14-26 at moderate prices.

         FACTORY OUTLET STORES, operating under the Casual Corner & Co., Casual
         Corner Outlet, Casual Corner Woman Outlet and Petite Sophisticate
         Outlet names, offer misses brand-name fashions at value prices, with
         stores located in factory outlet centers.

         CAPEZIO focuses on moderately priced casual and active apparel in
         updated feminine styles that emphasize color.

                            OPTICAL RETAILING GROUP

         The company's Optical Retailing Group, the largest in the world based
on revenues, includes LensCrafters, an optical superstore chain, LensCrafters
Optique, a high-fashion optical "boutique" chain, and Sight & Save, a value
optical retailing chain.




                                      5
<PAGE>   6

         LENSCRAFTERS operates the largest group of optical superstores in both
the United States and Canada.   Customers can choose from a large selection of
frames and lenses offering superior comfort and fit and can obtain a completed
pair of glasses made in about one hour because of the on-site lens grinding
laboratories.  These stores are located primarily in enclosed malls and strip
centers.  The company acquired Opti-World, Inc., a 59 store optical chain
located primarily in the Southeastern United States, in April 1995.

         LensCrafters also operates EYEXAM2000, a service of independent or
company optometrists who provide eye examinations either in, or in locations
convenient to, the stores.   LensCrafters also provides services under managed
care programs, in which third-party benefit plans cover eyewear purchases from
approved outlets.

         LENSCRAFTERS OPTIQUE, the company's optical boutique chain, targets
consumers interested in high-fashion or high-tech eyewear.  These stores,
located in upscale malls, offer the same services as a LensCrafters superoptical
store but with a broader selection of high-end and designer merchandise.  The
company acquired Tuckerman Optical Company, a 31 store optical chain located
primarily in the Midwestern United States, in July 1994. Of these 31 stores, 30
are now operated under the Optique concept.

         SIGHT & SAVE , the company's value optical retailing business,  offers
everyday low prices and service in one to four days.  As a brand, it is sharply
different from LensCrafters, appealing to a different, but complementary,
customer as a way to broaden the group's reach.  The company operates the Sight
& Save business primarily through leased optical departments in selected Kmart
stores.

                                 FOOTWEAR GROUP
FOOTWEAR RETAILING

         The company's footwear retailing operations include two separate
businesses:  the CONCEPT division, which operates corporately-owned concept shoe
stores primarily under the name EASY SPIRIT; and the SPECIALTY FOOTWEAR
RETAILING division, which operates factory outlet stores and manages leased
footwear departments in Burlington Coat Factory and Steinmart strong-value
stores.  In fiscal 1994, about 12% of the company's wholesale footwear volume
was sold through its footwear retailing operations, which also merchandises
shoes and accessories provided by other manufacturers.

FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING, IMPORTING AND WHOLESALING

         The company manufactures and imports footwear which is sold in medium
and higher price ranges.  The company's brands include AMALFI, BANDOLINO, YFA
BANDOLINO, CAPEZIO, COBBIE, EASY SPIRIT, EVAN-PICONE (under license), JOYCE,
PAPPAGALLO and SELBY.  The company also manufactures and markets Western and
casual boots for men, women and children under the TEXAS BRAND BOOTS, EL DORADO,
J. CHISHOLM and WRANGLER (under license) brand names.

                                    GENERAL

         There have been no significant changes in the kinds of products
manufactured and imported, or services rendered, by the company since January
29, 1994.

         During the last fiscal year, the company's Women's Apparel Retailing
Group purchased merchandise from a substantial number of  domestic and foreign
suppliers.  Approximately  56% of that merchandise was purchased from domestic
suppliers and the remainder was purchased from foreign suppliers.  It is not
practicable for the company to identify separately the domestic and foreign
sources of its domestic purchases.  During fiscal 1994, no single supplier
accounted for more than 6% of the merchandise purchased by the Women's Apparel
Retailing Group.





                                      7
<PAGE>   8

         During  fiscal 1994, the company's Optical Retailing Group purchased
from domestic manufacturers and suppliers.  However, while most of the frames
are purchased from domestic suppliers, they are primarily  manufactured in
foreign countries.  In April 1995, the company entered into agreements with
eight suppliers committing to purchase an aggregate of $31 million of eyeglass
frames from such suppliers during the next twelve months.

         The Footwear Group maintains a policy of  global sourcing which
combines domestic shoe manufacturing capacity with importing capabilities.
Approximately 45% of the company's wholesale footwear volume is accounted for by
imported women's shoes (primarily from South America, the Far East and Europe),
which are designed and manufactured to the company's specifications.

         The most important raw materials used in the manufacture of shoes are
leather, synthetic materials and fabrics, all of which are purchased by the
company in the open market from various suppliers, and all of which have been
available in adequate quantities.  During the past year, the company has
experienced moderate increases in the price of leather, which have generally
been reflected in the selling price of its products.  Synthetic materials and
fabrics have decreased slightly in price, which had no significant impact on the
selling price of the company's products.

         The company has granted licenses in foreign countries for the
manufacture and sale of shoes abroad under various trademarks owned by the
company.  The company also has granted licenses to a number of operators of
domestic shoe stores, including THE COBBIE SHOP, JOYCE-SELBY SHOES, SHOP FOR
PAPPAGALLO and EASY SPIRIT.  Domestic companies also are licensed to manufacture
and market non-footwear products under the company's CAPEZIO and EASY SPIRIT
trademarks.

         No individual patent, license, franchise or concession held or granted
by the company is considered to have been material to its operations during the
last fiscal year.  The company has a number of registered trademarks and
servicemarks, both in the United States and in foreign countries, that are
considered to be of significant value to its business.  The registered
trademarks and servicemarks are subject to periodic renewal.

         The company experiences seasonal fluctuations in components of working
capital.  Inventories of the Women's Apparel Retailing Group are generally at
their highest level at the end of the third quarter prior to the Christmas
holiday season.  The sales volume of the Women's Apparel Retailing Group is
normally highest during the fourth fiscal quarter.  This peak is generally
attributable to the Christmas season and post-holiday promotional activity. The
company maintains lines of credit that are available to finance seasonal
fluctuations in working capital on a short-term basis.

         During fiscal 1994, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of
the company's consolidated net sales.  The company's footwear wholesaling
business sells primarily to independent retailers and department stores across
the United States.  In fiscal 1994, the wholesaling  segment's three largest
customers accounted for 9.2%, 8.8% and 4.5%, respectively, of the segment's net
sales.

         The company's footwear wholesaling business does not have, nor has it
historically had, a significant backlog of noncancelable orders.  Advance orders
are solicited  by the company's sales force four to six times each year with
most of such orders being for the Spring and Fall retail seasons.  These advance
orders are placed by wholesale customers for delivery in up to seven months,
which is greatly influenced by the amount of lead time that customers allow when
placing orders for the forthcoming retail season.  The footwear wholesaling
business also includes substantial sales under various stock programs.  In order
to support these programs, the company maintains stock inventories of certain
high-volume styles that allow customers the ability to replenish fast-moving
items.  Accordingly, management does not believe its fiscal year-end order
backlog is a meaningful indicator of the footwear wholesaling division's future
results.

         The Women's Apparel Retailing, Optical Retailing and Footwear Groups
operate within highly competitive markets.  The company's women's apparel
competitors include national, regional and individual specialty apparel stores,
department stores and direct marketing catalog companies.  The Optical Retailing
Group competes with independent optometrists as well as regional and national
chains of optical superstores.  The footwear manufacturing/wholesaling divisions
compete with other





                                      9
<PAGE>   10

domestic manufacturers and importers of foreign-produced footwear in
medium-to-higher price ranges.  Footwear retailing divisions compete with stores
and leased departments ranging from individual operators to regional and
national chains and department stores.

         The company's investment in research and development during the last
three fiscal years was not significant to the company's consolidated operations.

         The company does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment will
have a significant effect on the company's consolidated operations.

         The company employs approximately 40,000 people.

Item 2.  Properties.

         The company's executive offices and certain offices of the Footwear
Group are located in Cincinnati, Ohio, in a 201,000 square foot building owned
by the company.  Office space occupied by other divisions in various parts of
the United States totaled approximately 506,000 square feet as of January 28,
1995, of which 59% was leased.  The company also had leased approximately 72,000
square feet of office space in various foreign countries as of that date.

         As of January 28, 1995, the Women's Apparel Retailing Group leased one
distribution center/warehouse in Enfield, Connecticut and owned one distribution
center/warehouse in Atlanta, Georgia. Total square footage of these two
distribution centers/warehouses was approximately 471,000.  As of that date, the
Women's Apparel Retailing Group operated 1,351 stores, encompassing about 4.9
million square feet of space, located primarily in enclosed malls in 47 states
and the District of Columbia.

         As of January 28, 1995, the Optical Retailing Group leased two
distribution centers/warehouses, one in Cincinnati, Ohio and one in Toronto,
Ontario.  Total square footage of these locations was approximately 57,000.  On
that date, the group operated 589 stores and leased departments, encompassing
about 2.7 million square feet of space.  These stores are located primarily in
enclosed





                                      10
                                         
<PAGE>   11


malls and strip centers in 45 states (about 2.4 million square feet of space),
Puerto Rico and Canada.  The leased optical departments are primarily located in
selected Kmart stores.

         As of January 28, 1995, the Footwear Group operated nine footwear
manufacturing plants, a product development facility and two component plants,
with an aggregate of approximately 741,000 square feet of space, located in four
states in the Midwestern United States.  One of the manufacturing plants is
leased. The company also leases two component plants, with approximately 93,000
square feet of space, in the Dominican Republic and  leases one component plant,
with approximately 29,000 square feet of space, in Honduras.

         The manufacturing plants have an optimum daily production capacity
(which includes production of shoes utilizing fitted upper component parts
manufactured in the company's component plants) of approximately 47,000 pairs of
shoes and boots.  During fiscal 1994, the company's plants operated at
approximately 87% of optimum production capacity.

         As of January 28, 1995, the group operated four footwear
manufacturing/wholesaling distribution centers, with approximately 934,000
square feet of space, in various parts of the United States.  One of the centers
is owned and is located in the complex with the company's executive offices in
Cincinnati, Ohio.

         The footwear retailing divisions operated 409 shoe stores and leased
shoe departments at January 28, 1995, encompassing about 1.4 million square feet
of space in 43 states.   The shoe stores are located primarily in major shopping
centers and outlet malls.  The leased shoe departments are located in Burlington
Coat Factory and Steinmart strong-value stores.

         The company's operating leases for retail stores expire between 1995
and 2006.  The average remaining terms of existing retail leases are as follows:
women's apparel stores, 4 years; optical stores, 4 years; shoe stores, 5 years;
leased optical departments, 4 years; and leased shoe departments, 1 year.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

         On March 3, 1995, Luxottica Group S.p.A. ("Luxottica") and Luxottica
Acquisition Corp. ("LAC", together with Luxottica and Avant-Garde Optics, Inc.,
the "Luxottica Plaintiffs") commenced an action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division (the "District
Court"), by filing a complaint (the "Luxottica Complaint") against the company,
the Directors of the company, the Commissioner of Securities of Ohio, the
Director of Commerce of Ohio, and the State of Ohio.  The Luxottica Complaint
seeks, among other things, (a) temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief against the enforcement of the Ohio Take-Over Act and a declaratory
judgment that the Take-Over Act is unconstitutional as it may be applied to the
Luxottica tender offer (the "Luxottica Offer"), and (b) preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the company and its Directors from
enforcing and amending the company's Share Purchase Rights Agreement (except to
redeem the Rights) and directing the company and its Directors to redeem the
Rights, and a declaratory judgment declaring that the Rights Agreement and the
Rights are invalid, unlawful, null and void.

         On March 6, 1995, the Luxottica Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint which added Avant-Garde Optics, Inc. ("Avant-Garde") as a Luxottica
Plaintiff and which, in addition, seeks (c) a declaratory judgment that
Directors of the company who are not officers of the company are in breach of
their fiduciary duties under Ohio law for failing to approve the Luxottica Offer
and (d) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the Directors of
the company who are not officers of the company to approve the Luxottica Offer
and thereby render the Rights Agreement inapplicable.  On March 10 and 24, 1995,
respectively, Luxottica filed Second and Third Amended Complaints in the
District Court.  The relief sought includes, among other things, (e) an order
declaring that the Directors of the company have breached their fiduciary duties
by failing to negotiate with Luxottica and by taking certain actions with
respect to the company's compensation and retirement plans, (f) an injunction
prohibiting consummation of the proposed sale of the Footwear Group to Nine West
without a shareholder vote, and (g) an order declaring that certain disclosures
made by the company contain false and misleading statements in violation of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.





                                      12
<PAGE>   13


         On March 22, 1995, the company and all the company's
Directors filed an Answer denying all claims of the Luxottica Plaintiffs, and
the company filed a Counterclaim against the Luxottica Plaintiffs.  The
Counterclaim asserts that the Luxottica Plaintiffs are violating the disclosure
requirements of federal securities law by false and misleading statements and
non-disclosures contained in the Luxottica Offer and in Luxottica's Schedule
14D-1, and that the Luxottica Plaintiffs have not delivered to the company's
shareholders substantial information required by the Ohio Take-Over Act.  The
Counterclaim seeks to declare Luxottica's acquisition of the company's Common
Shares to be in violation of federal and state laws, to restrain further
violations of such laws, to require Luxottica and LAC to withdraw the Luxottica
Offer and to enjoin the Luxottica Offer from being consummated, until such time
as the Luxottica Plaintiffs have complied with applicable laws.

         On March 29, 1995, the company and all the company's Directors filed an
Answer substantially denying all material allegations in the Luxottica Third
Amended Complaint and filed an Amended Counterclaim against the Luxottica
Plaintiffs. The Amended Counterclaim asserts that the Luxottica Plaintiffs are
making false and misleading statements relating to the number of Common Shares
owned by Mellon Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries in Luxottica's proxy
statement filed on March 21, 1995, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         On March 31, 1995, the company filed a motion for a preliminary and
permanent injunction seeking to enjoin the Luxottica Plaintiffs from
distributing false and misleading information in their proxy solicitation
materials in connection with solicitation of Appointments of Designated Agents
to call a special meeting of shareholders.  The company also filed a motion to
dismiss certain counts of Luxottica Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint.

         On April 7, 1995, the company and all of the company's Directors filed
an Amended Answer and a Second Amended Counterclaim.  The Second Amended
Counterclaim generally asserts that the Luxottica Plaintiffs are violating the
disclosure requirements of federal securities law by failing to disclose certain
information and making false and misleading statements in their proxy materials.
On April 10, 1995, the company filed a Notice of Dismissal of Count IX of its
Second Amended Counterclaim which alleged the failure by Luxottica to deliver to
the company's shareholders





                                      13
<PAGE>   14

substantial information required by the Ohio Take-Over Act.  On April 11, 1995,
the Luxottica Plaintiffs filed an Answer to the Company's Second Amended
Counterclaim substantially denying all material allegations.

         On April 14, 1995, the company filed a Motion for Immediate Injunctive
Relief seeking to enjoin Luxottica from making false and misleading statements
in their proxy materials.  On April 17, 1995, the company filed a Third Amended
Counterclaim asserting that the Luxottica Plaintiffs are violating the
disclosure requirements of the federal securities law based on the false and
misleading statements which are the subject of the company's Motion for
Immediate Injunctive Relief filed April 14.

         On April 20, 1995, the District Court entered an Agreed Order pursuant
to which the parties agreed that they were not seeking prompt consideration by
the Court of any pending motion and further agreed that no briefs were required
to be filed in response to any outstanding motions; provided that, by giving
written notice to all other parties and the District Court, any party could
reactivate consideration of the pending motions, in which event, briefs would be
due from the responding parties on the second business day after the day on
which such notice were received.

        On April 21, 1995, the company and Avant-Garde and LAC signed the
Luxottica Merger Agreement.  Pursuant to the Luxottica Merger Agreement, the
parties have agreed, promptly, and in any event not later than April 26, 1995
(unless the Luxottica Merger Agreement has been earlier terminated), to use
their respective best efforts to obtain a dismissal without prejudice of the
claims (with certain limited exceptions) and counterclaims filed, with each
party bearing its own costs and attorneys' fees therefor.

        On April 25, 1995, all parties to the litigation entered into a
Stipulation of Dismissal of Certain Claims whereby the parties agreed to 
dismiss without prejudice all of the plaintiffs' claims (with certain limited
exceptions, such remaining claims to be dismissed without prejudice when
Luxottica's tender offer is consummated) and all counterclaims; such
Stipulation was filed in the District Court on the same date.

OHIO LITIGATION

         On March 7, 1995, several shareholders of the company filed three
separate complaints in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio naming
the company and its Directors as defendants (Allen v. The United States Shoe
Corporation, et. al., Civil Action No. A9501170, Schwartz, et. al. v. Kronick,
et. al., Civil Action No. A9501172, and Freedman, et. al. v. Kronick, et.  al.,
Civil Action No. A9501171).  The relief sought includes, among other things, (a)
class action certification, (b) a declaration that the Directors of the company
have breached their fiduciary duties and an order





                                      14
<PAGE>   15

directing that the Directors of the company carry out their fiduciary duties,
(c) an order that the defendants consider the Luxottica Offer in good faith, (d)
an order that the defendants rescind any transactions that are unfair, (e) an
order enjoining any action by the defendants to change the company's cumulative
voting rules, (f) an order enjoining the transaction complained of in the
complaint or any related transaction, (g) an order that the defendants account
for any profits realized as a result of the transaction complained of in the
complaint, and (h) an award of compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and costs.

Environmental

         The company has been named as a third party defendant, along with
approximately 175 other third party defendants, in connection with a federal
superfund legal action involving a site in Adams County, Pennsylvania.  No
determination of the company's share, if any, of future remediation costs can be
made at this time.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

         The company did not submit any matters to a vote of security holders
during the last quarter of its fiscal year ended January 28, 1995.

and the Pacific Stock Exchange. There were 11,237 shareholders of record of the
company's Common Shares as of April 20, 1995. Fiscal 1994 dividend payments
marked the 63rd consecutive year that the company has paid cash dividends on its
Common Shares. The range of market closing prices and the dividends paid per
share, by quarter, for fiscal 1994 and 1993 were as follows:

      Net sales for fiscal 1994 totaled $2,598 million and the company reported
net earnings of $16.4 million, or $.35 per share.  The company's optical
retailing group continued its strong performance and reported record sales and
operating earnings.  The company's footwear group reported its best operating
earnings in six years.  The company's women's apparel retailing group was unable
to achieve a turnaround of its operations, and the group reported a significant
operating loss for the year.  The strength of the optical retailing and footwear
groups, and the length of time projected to achieve the company's objectives in
the women's apparel retailing group, led the company to evaluate strategic
alternatives, including the sale of the company or one or more of its 
businesses.

     On March 15, 1995, the company entered into the Nine West Agreement with
Nine West and Footwear Acquisition Corp., pursuant to which, on the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, Footwear Acquisition Corp., has agreed to
acquire substantially all of the assets and business, and to 


                                       18
<PAGE>   19
assume substantially all of the liabilities, of the company's Footwear Group
for $560 million in cash, plus warrants to purchase 3.7 million shares of Nine
West's common stock at a price of $35.50 per share at any time during the 8.5
years following the consummation of the sale. The transaction is subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions. A copy of the Nine West Agreement is filed
as Exhibit 10.(u) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing
description of the Nine West Agreement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the text of the Nine West Agreement.

        On April 21, 1995, the company entered into the Luxottica Merger
Agreement with LAC and Avant-Garde Optics, Inc., each indirect subsidiaries of
Luxottica, pursuant to which LAC has agreed to purchase all of the company's
outstanding Common Shares (and associated preference share purchase rights).
The transaction is to be completed through a tender offer by LAC for all of the
company's outstanding Common Shares (and associated preference share purchase   
rights) for $28 per Common Share (and associated preference share purchase
right), which will be followed by a second-step merger in which any of the
company's Common Shares (and associated preference share purchase rights) not
acquired in the tender offer will be cancelled and retired and will be
converted into a right to receive in cash $28 per Common Share (and associated
preference share purchase right). The transaction is subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions. A copy of the Luxottica Merger Agreement is
filed as Exhibit 10.(w) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The
foregoing description of the Luxottica Merger Agreement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the text of the Luxottica Merger Agreement.

NET SALES - The company's net sales for fiscal 1994 decreased 1.1% to $2,598
million from $2,626 million for fiscal 1993.  This decrease reflects a 2.8%
decrease in the average number of stores in operation during the period,
partially offset by a 1.4% increase in comparable store sales.

                                      19


<PAGE>   20
         Net sales for fiscal 1993 decreased 0.9% to $2,626 million from $2,651
million for fiscal 1992.  This decrease was principally due to the sale or
closing of 389 poorly performing stores, primarily in connection with the
divestiture of the Ups 'N Downs and Caren Charles divisions, the effect of which
was partially offset by sales from 158 new stores opened in 1993 and a 0.5%
increase in comparable store sales.

NET EARNINGS - The company reported net earnings of $16.4 million, or $.35 per
share, in 1994 compared with a net loss of $15.8 million, or $.35 per share, in
1993, and net earnings of $4.4 million, or $.10 per share, in 1992.

GROSS PROFIT - The gross profit percentage in 1994 decreased to  46.7% from
47.2% in 1993 and 47.8% in 1992.  The decrease in 1994 reflects the effects of a
lower gross profit percentage in the women's apparel group that resulted from a
higher level of markdown activity throughout the year.  Partially offsetting the
lower women's apparel margins were higher margins in the footwear group and the
effect of the higher margin sales in the optical retailing group representing a
larger percentage of consolidated net sales in 1994.  The improvement in the
footwear group's margins primarily resulted from fewer off-price sales by the
Marx & Newman import divisions as they improved their inventory management
processes.  Fiscal 1994 gross profit included a LIFO credit of $5.7 million
compared with a LIFO credit of $11.3


                                      20
<PAGE>   21

million in 1993 and $3.6 million in 1992.  The 1994 credit primarily resulted
from deflation in apparel and footwear inventory purchases during 1994,  while
the 1993 credit was due to a higher level of markdowns taken against excess
footwear inventories, lower inventory quantities at year-end and low rates of
inflation on the company's inventory purchases during 1993.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES - The company's SG&A
expenses decreased 6.0% in 1994, reflecting lower operating expenses in the
women's apparel and footwear groups that resulted from cost control measures and
a decrease in the average number of women's apparel stores in operation during
the year.  The decreases resulting from these factors were partially offset by
higher expenses in the optical group as a result of operating expenses
associated with 46 additional optical stores and leased departments. Included in
1994 SG&A expenses was a $4.0 million charge related to the planned closing or
conversion of the remaining 14 Pappagallo women's apparel stores and $3.3
million of fees related to the sale of the company's footwear group to Nine West
and evaluation of other strategic alternatives.  Included in 1993 SG&A was a
$10.6 million charge related to the divestiture of the Ups 'N Downs and Caren
Charles divisions, a $5.5 million charge related to the divestiture of optical
retailing operations in the United Kingdom, $6.0 million of costs related to
executive management changes, $15.0 million of costs associated with cost
reduction initiatives, and $2.6 million of costs associated with business
process redesign initiatives.  SG&A comparisons were also affected by a change
in 1994 in the classification of optical coupon discounts from operating
expenses to sales reductions.  Optical coupon discounts totaled $33.9 million
and $19.9 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         SG&A expenses increased 0.3% in 1993.  Lower operating expenses in the
footwear and women's apparel groups, resulting from cost control measures and
the effects of a net reduction of 217 women's apparel stores were more than
offset by the series of charges detailed above.

INTEREST EXPENSE - Net interest expense in 1994 was $11.8 million compared with
$16.0 million in 1993 and $16.9 million in 1992.  The reduction in net interest
expense in 1994 reflects a $42.0 million decrease





                                      21
<PAGE>   22

in average debt outstanding, resulting from scheduled payments and  the
prepayment at par in June 1994 of $50 million of 8% notes that were due to
mature in 1996, and an increase in interest income as average short-term
investments increased 20%.  These factors were partially offset by the effects
of an increase in the effective interest rate on borrowed funds from 8.0% to
9.6%, reflecting the increase in prevailing market rates.

         The decrease in net interest expense in 1993 compared to 1992 was
primarily due to a decrease in the effective interest rate on borrowed funds of
8.0% compared with 8.5% in 1992 and an increase in interest income as average
short-term investments increased 48%, offset by a $23 million increase in the
average outstanding debt balance.

INCOME TAXES - The effective tax rate was 43% in 1994 compared to an effective
tax benefit rate of 30% in 1993 and an effective tax rate of 43% in 1992.  The
low 1993 tax benefit rate  resulted from a lower effective state tax benefit
rate and an increase in the valuation allowance related to certain state
operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards.

         As of the end of fiscal 1994, the company has recorded a $69.6 million
net deferred tax asset that is composed of $91.8 million of deferred tax assets
and $22.2 million of deferred tax liabilities.  The realizability of
approximately 40% of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company
generating future income at levels sufficient to utilize the assets.  Although
the realizability of the deferred tax assets will be evaluated on a quarterly
basis, management believes that sufficient earnings will be generated to ensure
recovery of the net deferred tax assets, particularly considering the long
period of time available to generate the taxable income necessary to utilize the
deferred tax assets related to the accounting for postretirement benefits under
SFAS No. 106 and the expected gain on the sale of the footwear group.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS - The company's 1994 fourth quarter operating results
reflected a $12.7 million LIFO credit, a $4.0 million charge related to the
company's decision to close or convert its Pappagallo women's apparel stores and
$3.3 million of fees related to the sale of the footwear group and evaluation





                                      22
<PAGE>   23

of other strategic alternatives.

         In 1993, the fourth quarter operating results included a $24.0 million
LIFO credit and a $15.0 million charge for costs associated with certain cost
reduction initiatives across all operating groups.  The cost reduction
initiatives included changes in certain business practices (e.g., store labor
scheduling and merchandise return and allowance policies), streamlining field
management and home office operations in all operating groups, early lease
termination and planned shutdown of 11 poorly performing women's apparel stores,
and consolidating Cincinnati Shoe and Banister footwear retail operations.

NET SALES - The women's apparel retailing group's decrease in net sales from
$1,217 million in 1993 to $1,126 million in 1994 resulted from a 5.0% decrease
in comparable store sales.   The decline in comparable store sales was
experienced across all mall-based divisions, as a result of the poor performance
of most merchandise categories.  The group's factory outlet division reported a
significant increase in sales on new store volume (88 stores in operation at the
end of 1994 compared to 26 at the end of 1993) and strong comparable store sales
increases.

         During 1993, the group's net sales decreased 3.6% to $1,217 million,
reflecting a net reduction of 217 stores and a 0.5% decrease in comparable store
sales.  Net sales at the Casual Corner division decreased in 1993 as a result of
a net reduction of 29 stores, the effect of which was partially offset by a
slight increase in comparable store sales.  The Petite Sophisticate division
increased sales on new store volume and an increase in comparable store sales.
Most merchandising categories within the Ups 'N Downs/Capezio and Caren
Charles/Pappagallo divisions performed poorly, resulting in substantial





                                      23
<PAGE>   24

declines in comparable store sales.  In consideration of the continuing poor
performance of these divisions, the company sold or closed its remaining Ups 'N
Downs and Caren Charles stores over the second half of 1993.  The August Max
Woman division experienced a significant decline in comparable store sales
compared to 1992.

OPERATING RESULTS - The group's 1994 operating loss of $49.7 million reflects
the poor sales performance experienced by the mall-based divisions.  Despite a
reduction in per-store operating expenses, weak sales volumes and a high level
of markdowns required to clear poorly performing merchandise resulted in each of
the group's mall-based divisions reporting an operating loss for the year. The
Casual Corner division reported an operating loss significantly higher than
1993.  The Petite Sophisticate division's performance declined dramatically as
they reported a 1994 operating loss compared to strong earnings in 1993.  The
factory outlet division reported a significant increase in operating earnings on
increased sales.  The group's operating loss in 1994 was reduced by a LIFO
credit of $3.6 million (compared with a charge of $0.9 million in 1993 and a
credit of $1.1 million in 1992), which resulted primarily from deflation in the
group's inventory purchases.  1994 operating results also  included a $4.0
million charge related to the planned closing or conversion of the Pappagallo
women's apparel stores.

         The $41.7 million operating loss in 1993 was principally due to the
poor performance of the Casual Corner division in the first half of the year and
operating losses in the Ups 'N Downs/Capezio and Caren Charles/Pappagallo
divisions.  The 1993 results included a $10.6 million charge related to the
divestiture of the Ups 'N Downs and Caren Charles divisions and $14.1 million in
operating losses in these two divisions prior to their sale, $6.7 million of
costs associated with cost reduction initiatives, $3.8 million of severance and
recruitment costs related to executive management changes, and $1.7 million of
costs associated with business process redesign initiatives.

In 1993, Casual Corner recorded an operating loss as earnings generated over the
last half of the year on stronger sales performance and lower operating expenses
were not sufficient to offset operating losses in the first half of the year
that resulted primarily from the poor performance of spring merchandise.  The
Petite Sophisticate division experienced an increase in 1993 earnings on
increased





                                      24
<PAGE>   25

sales, while the Ups 'N Downs/Capezio and Caren Charles/Pappagallo divisions
experienced significant operating losses.  The August Max Woman division
recorded an operating loss for the year compared to operating earnings in 1992.

SOURCING - The group purchases a significant amount (44% in 1994 and 26% in
1993) of its product from the Far East.

</TABLE>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NET SALES - The optical retailing group increased net sales by  $68 million to
$767 million in 1994 as a result of an 11.4% increase in comparable store sales
and new store volume (589 stores and leased departments in operation at the end
of 1994 compared to 543 at the end of 1993).  The comparable store sales
increase reflects  strengthening domestic market fundamentals and favorable
customer response to promotional campaigns run throughout the year.  Total sales
comparisons for the group were affected by a change in 1994 in the
classification of coupon discounts from operating expenses to sales deductions.
Optical coupon discounts totaled $33.9 million and $19.9 million in 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Net sales increased 5.8%  in 1993 as a result of a greater
number of retail locations (543 at the end of 1993 and 511 at the end of 1992)
and a 2.9% increase in comparable store sales.

OPERATING RESULTS - The group increased operating  earnings by 64.7% during 1994
to $71.9 million, primarily reflecting increased domestic sales volume and
effective containment of costs to operate the group's domestic superoptical
stores.  The group's results were negatively impacted by increased operating
losses in the Sight & Save value optical division, which continues to be
affected by the significant costs of establishing and developing the value
optical concept and lower than expected sales





                                      25
<PAGE>   26

levels.  Sight & Save operating losses include $2.1 million of  charges to close
a number of poorly performing locations. Effective cost containment efforts
resulted in an improvement in the operating earnings of LensCrafters Canada on
comparable sales.  The group's operating earnings in 1993 included a $5.5
million charge related to the divestiture of the United Kingdom operations.

         In 1993, the group's earnings from operations increased 7.9% to $43.6
million.  Earnings from the group's domestic operations improved on higher
superoptical sales due to new store volume and increased comparable store sales.
The effects of the increased sales were partially offset by costs associated
with the expansion of the Sight & Save value optical concept. LensCrafters
Canada improved operating earnings on higher sales as a result of new store
volume, including sales at 22 Eyemasters Ltd. superoptical stores acquired in
January 1993, that was partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales.
Canadian operating results were reduced by costs associated with the transition
of the Eyemasters stores to the LensCrafters format.  Operating losses in the
United Kingdom, excluding the $5.5 million charge to divest of the operations,
totaled $1.9 million in 1993 compared to operating losses of $7.0 million in
1992.

NET SALES - The footwear group's net sales decreased $4 million in 1994 to $706
million.  The manufacturing/wholesaling divisions' net sales decreased 4.5% to
$444 million.  The Easy Spirit division experienced strong sales increases,
reflecting the brand's continued growth and well executed promotional programs.
Other manufacturing/wholesaling divisions reported decreased sales; most notably
Joyce and Cobbie, reflecting fewer independent store operators and the
conversion of certain





                                      26
<PAGE>   27

company-owned stores to the Easy Spirit format, and Texas Boot, which continues
to be adversely affected by a soft western boot market.  Sales in the Marx &
Newman import division were comparable to 1993.  Sales in the company's footwear
retail divisions increased to $262 million as a result of a net increase of 21
stores and a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales, primarily increases in
Easy Spirit retail stores.

         In 1993, the manufacturing/wholesaling divisions reported a 1.2%
decrease in net sales to $465 million.  Sales increases in the Easy Spirit
division were offset by decreases in the Texas Boot division and in the Cobbie
division, whose sales were adversely affected by fewer independent store
operators and management's decision to close or convert to the Easy Spirit
concept a majority of company-owned Cobbie retail stores.  Sales in other
manufacturing/wholesaling divisions were generally comparable with the prior
year.  1993 sales in the company's footwear retail divisions declined $12.5
million from 1992 to $245 million as a result of a net reduction of 46 stores
and a 1.4% decline in comparable store sales.   The comparable store sales
decline reflected strong increases in Easy Spirit retail stores that were more
than offset by declines in other divisions.

OPERATING RESULTS - The group's operating earnings increased during 1994 to
$36.2 million, reflecting improved operating results in both the group's
manufacturing/wholesaling and retailing operations.

         In 1994, the Easy Spirit division reported improved operating earnings
on increased sales.  The Marx & Newman import division reported a substantial
improvement in operating results on relatively comparable sales due to improved
margins, attributed in large part to an improvement in inventory management and
favorable foreign currency exchange rates.  These earnings improvements were
partially offset by the declines in operating results experienced by the Joyce,
Cobbie and Texas Boot divisions, which were due primarily to the effects of
lower sales volume.

         Although the group's retailing operations reported an operating loss in
1994, both the Concept and Specialty Footwear Retailing divisions showed
improvement over the prior year.  The Concept division's improved results in
1994 reflect the increased sales volume of the Easy Spirit concept stores and
the effects of the closure or conversion of a majority of the Cobbie and
Joyce-Selby concept stores





                                      27
<PAGE>   28

during 1993.  The Specialty Footwear Retailing division reported a slight
improvement in operating results on a 1.4% increase in sales.

         In 1993, the Easy Spirit for women division generated a substantial
increase in operating earnings as a result of a 12.4% increase in sales, higher
margins and lower operating costs.  The Easy Spirit for men division achieved
near-breakeven results compared to substantial operating losses in 1992 as
margins stabilized and operating expenses were brought in line with the
division's sales level.  The Texas Boot division saw sales and operating
earnings decline in 1993.  The company's import brands continued to perform
poorly as the problems affecting the group continued in 1993.  Despite improved
performance by the Evan-Picone brand over the second half of the year, operating
losses of the group increased in 1993, primarily as a result of increased
markdowns taken to clear excess inventories.

         In 1993, footwear retailing recorded an operating loss compared to
operating earnings in 1992, primarily as a result of a decline in operating
earnings in the Banister division.  Banister experienced further declines in
comparable store sales and margin erosion as promotional activity increased to
generate sales and as markdowns were taken to clear older inventory.  The
Concept division's operating losses increased in 1993 due to the poor
performance of Cobbie and Joyce-Selby concept stores and costs associated with
the closure or conversion of a majority of these stores during the year, the
effects of which were only partially offset by the stronger performance of Easy
Spirit concept stores.  During 1993, the company closed 35 Cobbie and
Joyce-Selby stores and converted 10 stores to the Easy Spirit format, reducing
the number of Cobbie and Joyce-Selby stores in operation at year-end to 14.

         The group's 1994 operating earnings were increased by a $2.7 million
LIFO credit compared with credits of $12.2 million and $2.5 million in 1993 and
1992, respectively.  The 1994 credit resulted primarily from lower inventory
quantities at year-end and 5% deflation in the group's import purchases due to
favorable foreign currency exchange rates, while the higher credit in 1993
resulted from higher levels of markdowns to clear excess inventories, lower
inventory quantities at year-end, a low rate of inflation (1.4%) on the group's
import purchases during 1993 and 4.3% deflation of the costs of inventory
manufactured by the company during 1993.

         The group's 1994 results were affected by a $1.5 million net gain in
connection with the sale of





                                       28
<PAGE>   29

the Beloit, Wisconsin facility and by a $2.1 million reduction in the group's
bad debt reserve, reflecting improved collection experience and a reduction in
the number of independent concept store operators.  In 1993, the group's results
were affected by $7.4 million of costs associated with cost reduction
initiatives, $2.2 million of severance and recruitment costs related to
executive management changes, and $0.9 million of costs associated with business
process redesign initiatives.  In 1992, footwear results included $5.2 million
of costs associated with the establishment of a buying operation in the Far
East, $3.5 million of costs associated with the bankruptcy of an independent
operator of a substantial number of concept stores, the consolidation of Marx &
Newman operations into the Cincinnati, Ohio footwear operations, and $2.8
million of costs associated with the group's business process redesign
initiatives.

OUTLOOK

         Looking forward, performance in the optical retailing group over the
first two months of fiscal 1995 has continued to show strong growth.  However,
results over the same period in the women's apparel and footwear groups have
been below the comparable results in fiscal 1994.  Accordingly, the company
expects first quarter 1995 results to be substantially below the comparable
period in the prior year.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS

         Cash provided by operations decreased $19.8 million to $94.1 million in
1994 as the effects of improved operating results were  offset by a $43.6
million increase in cash used for changes in working capital.  The increase in
cash used for working capital primarily reflects $88.9 million related to an
increase in inventory levels in 1994, due primarily to the earlier receipt of
Spring merchandise in the women's apparel group and a net increase of 112 retail
stores.  In addition, the increase reflects $18.6 million related to an increase
in accounts receivable, due primarily to an increase in footwear wholesale sales
during the last two months of the fiscal year.  Partially offsetting these
factors was  a greater increase in accounts payable related to the increase in
inventories.

         In 1993, cash provided by operations decreased $12.3 million
principally as a result of a $21.7 million decrease in cash generated from net
earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, which was partially offset by an increase
of $3.0 million in cash provided by changes in working capital.  The increase in
cash provided by changes in working capital included $10.2 million related to a
reduction in accounts receivable as a result of improved collection experience
and $18.4 million related to inventories as the company's inventory reduction
efforts and store closing activities led to a greater reduction in inventories
in 1993 compared to 1992.  These and other working capital changes that
increased cash during the year were partially offset by a $34.8 million decrease
in cash that resulted from a reduction in accounts payable related to the
decline in inventories.

         1994 capital expenditures emphasized the expansion of Easy Spirit
footwear retailing stores, LensCrafters optical retailing stores and women's
apparel factory outlet stores.  1994 capital expenditures also emphasized the
upgrading of management information systems at all divisions and the
refurbishment of certain stores, including Casual Corner and LensCrafters.

         In 1994, the company opened or acquired 225 new retail units; 91
optical stores or leased departments, 84 women's apparel stores and 50 footwear
stores or leased departments.  In 1993, the company opened 158 new retail units,
and converted 67 existing units to new formats.  Of the new stores, 50 were
optical stores or leased departments, 57 were women's apparel stores and 51 were
footwear stores or leased departments.

WORKING CAPITAL

         The company's working capital at January 28, 1995 was $240.4 million
compared with $322.6 million at  January 29, 1994.  This decrease reflects a
$42.6 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, due
primarily to the prepayment at par on June 30, 1994 of $50 million of 8% notes
due in 1996; a $50.0 million increase in the current portion of long-term debt
as a result  of scheduled maturities; and a $31.1 million increase in accounts
payable related to, and offset by, a $32.1 million increase in inventory, which
results primarily from the earlier receipt of Spring merchandise in the women's
apparel group and an increase in the number of retail stores.

         During 1993, the company's working capital increased to $322.6 million
from $294.7 million the





                                       31
<PAGE>   32

prior year primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents of
$24.0 million and a $41.2 million reduction in accounts payable.  These
increases were partially offset by a $58.5 million reduction in inventories,
reflecting a net reduction of retail stores, a delay in receipt of Spring
apparel in the women's apparel group, an increase in markdown reserves to adjust
excess footwear inventories to their estimated net realizable value and the
effects of management's continued inventory reduction efforts.  The decline in
accounts payable was directly related to the lower inventory levels.

         The company continues to maintain lines of credit with domestic and
foreign banks.  At January 28, 1995, the company had in place a revolving credit
agreement, with nine participating financial institutions, making available up
to $125 million of credit through February 5, 1996.  The revolving credit
agreement is available to finance working capital needs.  At January 28, 1995
and January 29, 1994, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.

        The company obtained waivers to its revolving credit agreement to
permit the signing of each of the Nine West Agreement and the Luxottica Merger
Agreement (actual consummation of any of those transactions will require the
company to renegotiate or terminate the revolving credit agreement).  The
company also obtained an amendment to the revolving credit agreement primarily
related to the acquisition of Opti-World, Inc. ("Opti-World") and to the 
long-term debt repayment due May 27, 1995.

        In conjunction with the acquisition of Opti-World, a 59 store optical
chain, the company borrowed $50 million under the revolving credit agreement on
April 3, 1995.  The company anticipates significant cash outlays in the first
half of fiscal 1995 related to the acquisition of Opti-World, and the scheduled
repayment of $50 million of debt. In addition, on March 20, 1995, the company
deposited $24.5 million into a trust in accordance with the terms of certain
severance compensation agreements as a result of the Luxottica Offer.  The
company believes that its existing cash balance and lines of credit will be
adequate to fund these cash requirements.

        In addition, upon closing of the sale of the Footwear Group to Nine
West, the company expects to receive $560 million in cash before expenses.  The
Luxottica Merger Agreement provides that the company will not make any
distribution to shareholders of the proceeds received by the company from the
footwear sale.

LONG-TERM CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Long-term debt totaled $77.2 million at year-end 1994, $177.4 million
at year-end 1993 and $179.0 million at year-end 1992.  The lower balance in 1994
resulted from the $50 million debt prepayment on June 30, 1994 and the $50
million increase in the current portion of long-term debt due to scheduled
maturities.

         To balance the company's fixed and variable interest rate risk, as of
January 28, 1995, the company had entered into four $25 million interest rate
swap agreements that mature on various dates through November 1995.  Under the
terms of the agreements, the company receives interest at a fixed rate (5.05%
weighted-average rate as of January 28, 1995) and pays interest at a variable
rate tied to the six-month LIBOR (6.55% weighted-average rate as of January 28,
1995).

         At January 28, 1995, the company's debt-to-capital ratio (long-term
debt including capital lease obligations, as a percentage of the sum of
long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, and shareholders'
investment) was 15.9% compared with 29.1% in 1993 and 28.2% in 1992.  The
decline in the ratio in 1994 resulted primarily from the $50 million debt
prepayment on June 30, 1994 and the $50 million increase in the current portion
of long-term debt due to scheduled maturities.

         The amended revolving credit agreement and the long-term debt
agreements include, among other things, provisions which limit total
consolidated indebtedness, require the maintenance of minimum amounts of working
capital and of certain financial ratios, limit the amount of capital
expenditures, capital stock repurchases and asset sales, and limit the payment
of cash dividends by the company.  Under the most restrictive dividend
provision, approximately $24 million of consolidated retained earnings at
January 28, 1995 is available for payment of cash dividends.  The company's
ability to pay future dividends is, among other things, contingent upon future
operating results or changes to existing borrowing agreements.

         On February 22, 1995, Moody's Investors Service announced that it had
placed under review for a possible downgrade the Baa3 rating on the company's
senior long-term debt and the (P)Baa3 rating on the company's senior unsecured
shelf registration.  Also, on February 22, 1995, Standard & Poor's Ratings





                                      33
<PAGE>   34

Group ("S&P") announced that it had lowered its rating on the company's senior
long-term debt from Triple-B-Minus to Double-B-Plus and removed the debt from
its CreditWatch surveillance list.  Following the announcement of Luxottica's
tender offer, on March 7, 1995, S&P announced that it was returning the
company's senior long-term debt to its CreditWatch surveillance list  with
"developing implications," indicating that the debt rating could be raised or
lowered depending on the outcome of the recently announced developments.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

         The company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with transactions
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily shoe purchases from European
countries.  At January 28, 1995, the company held contracts aggregating
approximately $39.8 million.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

         Overall, the company's sales growth and earnings have not been
materially impacted by inflation over the last three years.

Compliance with Section 16(a) Reporting Requirements

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
company's directors and officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10%
of a registered class of the company's equity securities, to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and with the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges.  Directors, officers and
greater-than-10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish
the company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file.

         Based solely on its review of copies of such reports received by it, or
written representations from certain reporting persons that no such reports were
required for those persons, the company believes that during fiscal year 1994
all filing requirements applicable to its directors, officers and
greater-than-10% beneficial owners were complied with.

         (a)     As of January 28, 1995, the Corporation had 67,985 restricted
Common Shares outstanding with an aggregate value (assuming no restrictions) of
$1,385,194.  The Named Officers' restricted shareholdings (as of that date) are
as follows:  Mr.  Hudson - 25,000 shares/$509,375; Mr. Browne - 7,985
shares/$162,694; Mr. Hord - 20,000 shares/$407,500; and Mr. Somers - 5,000
shares/$101,875.  Dividends are paid to holders of restricted Common Shares.
Pursuant to the terms of the Luxottica Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors
of the Corporation will adopt resolutions to terminate all restrictions on the
restricted Common Shares prior to the Merger (as defined in the Luxottica
Merger Agreement).

         (b)     The Corporation's 1988 Employee Incentive Plan (the "1988
Plan") does not permit grants of stock appreciation rights.  The 1988 Plan (as
well as all of the Corporation's other plans under which stock options have been
awarded) provides for acceleration of exercisability of options granted
thereunder upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, as described in the 1988 Plan.

         (c)     Amounts listed hereunder reflect contributions by the
Corporation made to various retirement and deferred compensation plans in which
the Named Officers have participated, and the dollar value of insurance premiums
paid by the Corporation for the benefit of the Named Officers. Amounts
contributed to the Corporation's Salaried Employees Deferred Compensation Plan
for the benefit of the Named Officers are as follows:  Mr. Hudson - $3,436; Mr.
Browne - $3,696; Mr. Hord - $4,620; and Mr. Somers - $5,025.  The amount
contributed to the LensCrafters Tax Incentive Retirement Savings Plan for the
benefit of Mr. Browne was $7,055.  The dollar amount of insurance premiums paid
for the benefit of the Named Officers are as follows: Mr. Hudson - $3,735; Mr.
Browne - $1,221; Mr. Hord - $2,958; Mr. Searles - $3,306; and Mr. Somers -
$3,306.

         (d)     Messrs. Hord and Searles were first employed by the Corporation
in 1993.

         (e)     For Mr. Searles, such amount includes a guaranteed payment of
$150,000 pursuant to the terms of his employment contract.

         (f)     Shares reflected do not include those shares underlying options
granted to the Named Officers on March 31, 1995, as follows: Mr. Hudson -
40,000; Mr. Browne - 27,000; Mr. Hord - 23,000; Mr. Searles - 20,000; and Mr.
Somers - 18,000.

         (g)     On March 31, 1995, the Board of Directors approved payments to
the Named Officers in accordance with the Total Return to Shareholders Plan. The
payments, relating to the performance period  January 1, 1992 through March 31,
1995, were as follows:  Mr. Hudson - $259,000; Mr. Browne - $107,000; Mr. Hord -
$118,000; Mr. Searles - $130,000; and Mr. Somers - $77,000.  Such payments were
made in restricted shares based upon $26.3125 per share (the average of the
March 30, 1995 high and low prices of the Corporation's Common Shares on the New
York Stock Exchange).  These payments are not included in the above table.

         (h)     The change in control of the Corporation that is anticipated to
occur as a result of the Luxottica Merger Agreement would result in the Named
Officers receiving a prorated portion of awards earned under the Total Return to
Shareholders Plan for performance periods that have not been completed as of the
date of the change in control, as provided in the plan.

         (i)     On March 31, 1995, the Board of Directors approved regular
annual salary increases for 1995, including increases for Mr. Browne, from
$425,000 to $500,000, Mr. Hord, from $515,000 to $540,000, and Mr. Somers, from
$350,000 to $370,000.  The timing of the approval and effectiveness of such
annual salary increases is consistent with the Corporation's practices in prior
years.

         (j)     Such amounts include $250,000 and $150,000 of guaranteed
incentive bonus payments for Messrs. Hord and Searles, respectively, pursuant to
the terms of their employment contracts.

</TABLE>

         (a)     Options granted to the Named Officers were granted on May 26,
1994 and first become exercisable on May 26, 1995.  All options granted are
subject to a vesting schedule, with 25% of the total grant exercisable on the
first anniversary of the grant and the remainder exercisable in 25% increments
at each anniversary of the grant.  In the event of death or disability,
outstanding options may be exercised by the optionee or his or her personal
representative for a period of one year following such event.  In the event of
retirement or any other termination, outstanding options may be exercised for a
period of three months following such event.  All outstanding options
automatically vest and become exercisable in the event of an "Event of
Acceleration" as defined in the plan, which includes the occurrence of certain
events constituting a change of control as described therein.  See footnote (c).
All options were granted at an exercise price equal to the average of the high
and low price on the New York Stock Exchange -- Composite Transactions of the
Corporation's Common Shares on the date of grant.

         (b)     The estimate of grant date present value in the above table is
determined using the Black-Scholes model.  The material assumptions and
adjustments incorporated in the Black-Scholes model in estimating the value of
the options reflected in the above table include the following:  (1) an exercise
price on the options of $19.06, each equal to the fair market value of the
underlying Common Shares on the date of grant; (2) option terms of 10.5 years;
(3) interest rates representing the interest rate on U.S. Treasury securities
with maturity dates corresponding to that of the option term as of the date of
grant; (4) volatility of 38% calculated using daily stock prices for the
one-year period prior to the date of grant; (5) dividends at the rate of $0.32
per share representing the annualized dividends paid with respect to a Common
Share at the date of grant; and (6) a reduction of approximately 19% to reflect
the probability of forfeiture due to termination prior to vesting, and a
reduction of approximately 20% to reflect the probability of a shortened option
term due to termination of employment prior to the option expiration date.  See
footnote (c).

         (c)     Based on Luxottica's $28 per share purchase price, the value of
the options granted to each Named Officer in fiscal year 1994 ($28 per share
purchase price, less the option exercise price) is as follows:  Mr. Hudson -
$357,600; Mr. Browne - $268,200; Mr. Hord - $223,500; Mr. Searles - $223,500;
and Mr. Somers - $178,800.  Pursuant to the terms of the Luxottica Merger
Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the 1988 Plan, all options will
become fully exercisable and vested, and each such option will be cancelled in
exchange for a payment equal to the difference between $28 and the exercise
price of such option.

         (d)     The number of options granted to each Named Officer on March
31, 1995, at an exercise price of $26.25 per share, and the value of such
options based on Luxottica's $28 per share purchase price ($28 per share
purchase price, less the option exercise price) are as follows: Mr. Hudson -
40,000/$70,000; Mr. Browne - 27,000/$47,250; Mr. Hord - 23,000/$40,250; Mr.
Searles - 20,000/$35,000; and Mr. Somers - 18,000/$31,500.  These options were
granted in fiscal year 1995.  Accordingly, the option grants and their related
values are not included in the above table.

Long-Term Incentive Plans - Awards in Last Fiscal Year

         On July 29, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted the
Total Return to Shareholders Plan (the "TRS Plan") to replace the Corporation's
Key Executive Long-Term Incentive Program (the "LTI Program"). Under the TRS
Plan, beginning in 1994 and for each year thereafter, a 39-month performance
period will be established, and for each performance period a target award will
be determined for each participant in the TRS Plan.  The target award generally
will be based upon median competitive levels for long-term incentive
opportunities, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors.  At the end of each 39- month period, the total return for that
period (share price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) for an investment in
Common Shares of the Corporation will be compared with a similar investment in
the shares of a designated peer group of corporations. Awards will then be made
to participants based on the Corporation's ranking in the peer group, ranging
from 50% of the participant's target award if the Corporation is in the 40th
percentile to 200% of a participant's target award if the Corporation is in at
least the 90th percentile.  No awards will be made if the Corporation's ranking
in the peer group is below the 40th percentile. All awards under the TRS Plan
will be in cash or in Common Shares, which will be restricted and subject to
forfeiture if the participant terminates his or her employment during the
three-year period following the award.  The Plan also provides for payouts in
the event of a change in control of the Corporation.  A transition plan is in
effect whereby executives may earn prorated awards based on total share price
appreciation for the 39-month periods ending at the close of the first calendar
quarters in 1995 and 1996.  The LTI Program will be phased out during this
transition period.

         On April 21, 1995, the Board of Directors adopted a restatement of the
TRS Plan that clarified certain of its terms and provisions by the addition of
various details and explanatory material.  In particular, the restatement
included a description of the Compensation Committee's authority to administer
and modify the plan, to select participants and to establish target awards;
definitions of certain key terms used in the plan; a list of the 21 companies
included in the Corporation's peer group (which is the same list used for
purposes of its annual proxy statement); procedures by participants for the
designation of beneficiaries; a designation of dates on which values are to be
determined; an explanation of the consequences of termination of employment
under various circumstances, including normal retirement, disability and death;
automatic adjustment of the number of restricted Common Shares subject to an
award in the case of stock splits, reorganizations and other fundamental changes
in the structure of the Corporation; and reservation of the Corporation's right
to register and/or qualify the Common Shares under federal or state securities
laws if such registration and/or





                                      45
<PAGE>   46

qualification is deemed necessary.  The restatement also made it clear that the
"change in control" definition used in the TRS Plan is similar to those used in
the Corporation's Severance Agreements and in the Corporation's Economic Bridge
Program; that in the event of a change in control as to any participant, such
participant will be entitled to a prorated number of Common Shares or cash
earned under performance periods that have not been completed at the time such
change in control occurs; and that Common Shares previously awarded to that
participant will be unrestricted.

         No payouts were made in fiscal 1994 under the LTI Program.  The
following information relates to long-term incentive awards made to the Named
Officers in fiscal 1994 under the TRS Plan.  See footnote (c) for payments made
to the Named Officers approved on March 31, 1995.

</TABLE>


         (a)     Amounts represent the dollar value of potential target payouts
which, if earned, will be made following the end of the performance period
indicated.  At the end of each performance period, the Compensation Committee
will approve the payout earned for such period, and will make such payout in
cash or the dollar value of the payout will be converted to restricted Common
Shares based upon the average of the high and low price of the Corporation's
Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day preceding the
day of such approval.  All restrictions on such restricted Common Shares will
lapse after three years.  Additionally, the TRS plan provides for payouts in the
event of a change in control.  See footnote (d).

         (b)     In this initial year of transition from the LTI Program to the
TRS Plan, a target award was set for the "initial performance period" (the
performance period ending March 31, 1997) and the two "transitional performance
periods" (the two performance periods ending March 31, 1995 and March 31,
1996), with the target awards for the transitional performance periods being
set at 33% and 67% of the initial performance period target award,
respectively.  The remaining portion of each participant's target award for the
transitional performance periods will be earned in accordance with the LTI
Program, which is being phased out.

         (c)     On March 31, 1995, the Board of Directors approved payments to
the Named Officers in accordance with the Total Return to Shareholders Plan. The
payments, relating to the performance period





                                      46
<PAGE>   47

January 1, 1992 through March 31, 1995, were as follows:  Mr. Hudson - $259,000;
Mr. Browne - $107,000; Mr. Hord - $118,000; Mr.  Searles - $130,000; and Mr.
Somers - $77,000.  Such payments were made in restricted shares based upon
$26.3125 per share (the average of the March 30, 1995 high and low prices of the
Corporation's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange).  Following is the
value of these restricted shares based on Luxottica's $28 per share price:  Mr.
Hudson - $275,000; Mr. Browne - $114,000; Mr.  Hord - $125,000; Mr. Searles -
$138,000; and Mr. Somers - $82,000.

         (d)     The change in control of the Corporation that is anticipated to
occur as a result of the Luxottica Merger Agreement would result in the Named
Officers receiving a prorated portion of awards earned under the Total Return to
Shareholders Plan for performance periods that have not been completed as of the
date of the change in control, as provided in the Plan.


Pension and Retirement Supplemental Income Plans

         For many years the Corporation has maintained several pension and
profit sharing plans for the benefit of its employees.  Prior to 1995, employees
of the Footwear, Optical Retailing and Corporate Center Groups were included in
a traditional defined benefits pension plan which, upon retirement, provided a
monthly benefit based on compensation and years of service. Employees of the
Women's Specialty Retailing Group were covered under a profit sharing plan.

         Beginning in January 1995, the Corporation adopted a single, simplified
pension plan that covers all employees, other than those covered by the hourly
pension plans of the Footwear Group.  Effective January 1, 1995, benefits under
the U.S. Specialty Retailing Division Profit Sharing Plan for eligible employees
of the Women's Specialty Retailing Group were frozen and participants in such
plan became eligible to participate in The United States Shoe Corporation
Pension Plan (formerly the Salaried Employees Pension Plan) (the "Pension
Plan").

         Effective January 1, 1995, the method for calculating benefit accruals
under the Pension Plan was changed from a final average pay formula to a cash
balance formula for eligible associates other than those in the Footwear Group.
Accordingly, the method for calculating benefit accruals for Mr. Hord is a final
average pay formula, whereas the method for the remaining Named Executive
Officers is a cash balance formula.  Under the cash balance formula, each
quarter participants receive a benefit credit equal to a percentage of their
annualized quarterly compensation based upon their years of service as follows:
1 to 4 years of service, 1.375%; 5 to 14 years of service, 1.8125%; and 15 or
more years of service, 2.5%.  The cash balance account also is credited with
assumed "earnings" each quarter at a rate equal to 1% over the average 90-day
Treasury Bill rate.  Each participant's initial cash balance will be equal to
the present value of such participant's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1994.
Participants who have attained age 50 and completed a minimum of 10 years of
service as of January 1, 1995 may receive additional benefit credits based on
the participant's age and years of service with the Corporation.

         The Corporation also provides a non-qualified Supplemental Executive
Salaried Employees Benefit Plan (the "Supplemental Employees Benefit Plan") 
which recognizes retirement benefits for compensation in excess of limits 
imposed under the Pension Plan pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. The
estimated annual benefits (under both plans) payable upon retirement at normal
retirement age (as defined in the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Executive
Salaried Employees Benefit Plan) for each of the Named Officers is as follows:
Mr. Hudson-$240,000; Mr. Browne-$272,000; Mr. Hord-$104,000; Mr.
Searles-$173,000, and Mr. Somers-$211,000. On April 21, 1995, the Board of
Directors adopted amendments to the Supplemental Employees Benefit Plan to
provide, in the case of active or retired Corporate Center Group employees
(including Mr. Hudson and Mr. Somers), for a lump sum payout of the present
value of each such employee's accrued benefit under the Supplemental Employees
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Merger.

Director Compensation

         Directors who are not employees of the Corporation ("Outside
Directors") are paid directors' fees for their services at the rate of 
$25,000 per year each, as well as attendance fees of $750 per meeting for 
service on certain committees. Directors who chair committees receive an 
additional annual fee of $3,000. Total payments to such directors for the 
Corporation's last fiscal year amounted to $288,000. The Corporation has 
agreed to pay Charles S. Mechem, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Directors, 
$125,000 annually for his services as a part-time employee in lieu of his 
annual retainer.

         In addition to such payments, since 1985, Outside Directors have
received stock options under the 1985 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan (the
"1985 Director Plan"), which terminated on May 31, 1990, and under the 1991
Outside Directors Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Director Plan").  Mr. Mechem is
not eligible to participate in the 1991 Director Plan because of his part-time
employee status with the Corporation.

Under the 1991 Director Plan an option is granted automatically on each annual
meeting date, as long as the Plan is in effect, to each Outside Director who
continues in office after such annual meeting, to purchase 2,000 Common Shares
(subject to adjustment as described below); such grants are further subject to
the limit on the maximum number of Common Shares that can be issued or
transferred pursuant to the exercise of options under the 1991 Director Plan.   
In no event will an Outside Director be granted options to purchase, in
the aggregate, more than 20,000 Common Shares under the 1991 Director Plan
(subject to adjustment for changes in the Corporation's capitalization, such as
a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, consolidation or similar
change that affects equity interests in the Corporation).

        Each option granted to an Outside Director under the 1991 Director Plan
has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares subject to
the option (determined at the time the option is granted). Options may be
exercised by payment to the Corporation of the exercise price in cash or in
Common Shares already owned by the optionee. No stock option granted under the
1991 Director Plan may be exercised more than ten years from the date the
option is granted. Each option granted to an Outside Director will be
exercisable for one-third of the shares subject to the option after one year
from the date of grant and for an additional one-third of the shares after each
successive one-year period. Such right to exercise is cumulative. A Director
to whom an option is granted under the 1991 Director Plan may not, during his
or her lifetime, transfer the option to any other person. The 1991 Director
Plan also provides that upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a
change in control, as defined in the 1991 Director Plan, any unexercised or
partially exercised options will become immediately exercisable, and will
remain exercisable for as long as they would be otherwise exercisable. The 1985
Director Plan was substantially similar to the 1991 Director Plan, and options
granted under the 1985 Director Plan are subject to similar terms and
conditions as those granted under the 1991 Director Plan. Pursuant to the terms
of the Luxottica Merger Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the
plans, all options will become fully exercisable and vested, and each such
option will be cancelled in exchange for a payment equal to the difference, if
any, between $28 and the exercise price of such option.

         During the Corporation's last fiscal year, options to purchase 18,000
shares were granted to Outside Directors at an exercise price of $19.06 under
the 1991 Director Plan. During fiscal 1994, 6,000 options were exercised under
the 1985 Director Plan and 3,999 shares were exercised under the 1991 Director
Plan.  Options to purchase 105,326 shares currently are exercisable under the
1985 Director Plan and the 1991 Director Plan.

        On February 2, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a
new retirement plan for Directors who are not employees of the Corporation (the
"Retirement Plan for Outside Directors"). Under this Plan, a member of the
Board of Directors who retires with five or more years of service as a director
will receive a quarterly retirement benefit commencing at age 72 (or if later,
when such Director retires) and payable for life equal to the quarterly
retainer paid to Outside Directors immediately prior to the retirement of the
Director. Payments under this Plan terminate upon the death of the Director. On
April 21, 1995, the Board of Directors (including by the unanimous vote of the
Directors who are not eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan for
Outside Directors) approved amendments to the Plan to provide for its
termination immediately prior to the Merger and the payment of a lump sum to
each participant in such Plan which is the actuarial equivalent of such
participant's accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan for Outside Directors.


                                       48
<PAGE>   49
        Mr. Mechem, the Chairman of the Board of the Corporation, is not
eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan for Outside Directors or in the
1991 Director Plan because of his part-time employee status with the
Corporation.  However, as a part-time employee, Mr. Mechem was granted options
(i) on April 23, 1993 under The United States Shoe Corporation 1983 Key
Personnel Stock Option Plan to purchase 10,000 Common Shares at an exercise
price of $10.56 per Common Share, (ii) on May 26, 1994 under the 1988 Plan to
purchase 10,000 Common Shares at an exercise price of $19.06 per Common Share,
and (iii) on March 31, 1995 under the 1988 Plan to purchase 10,000 Common
Shares at an exercise price of $26.25 per Common Share.

        The Corporation also maintains The United States Shoe Corporation
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Management Directors (the "Deferred
Compensation Plan"). Pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, a
Director may elect to defer payment of his or her directors' fees.  Upon a
Director's termination of service, the Corporation will distribute to such
Director the deferred compensation to which he or she is entitled in cash in a
lump sum or, at the Director's election, in quarterly installments, the amount
payable to be based on sums available from assumed investments in Common
Shares, other securities or cash. On April 21, 1995, the Board of Directors
took action to terminate the Deferred Compensation Plan effective upon the
Merger. Upon termination of the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Corporation
will, pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, distribute the
deferred compensation account balances to Mr. Anderer and Mr. Kellar, the two
Directors on behalf of whom such accounts are currently maintained.

Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change in Control
Arrangements

The Corporation has entered into employment contracts with certain of its
executives, including all of the Named Officers. Generally, such contracts have
terms of three to five years (with automatic renewals) and require the payment
of salaries at certain minimum levels during their respective terms. The Named
Officers' current annual salaries are set forth in the Summary Compensation     
Table above. Some of the contracts also provide for front-end payments of cash,
options and/or restricted stock.

         The employment contracts permit either the officer or the Corporation
to terminate the employment relationship by providing written notice of
termination not less than a specified time prior to the respective contract's
automatic renewal date -- generally, six months.  The contracts also permit the
individual officers to terminate their respective contracts upon shorter notice
under certain circumstances -- generally, if the Corporation changes the
officer's assignment to a position of lesser responsibility or if the
Corporation experiences a "change of control."  In any such event the
Corporation has agreed to pay a termination payment equivalent to the officer's
current annual salary, payable in monthly installments over a one-year period
(in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the payment is equivalent to twice
his current salary, payable over a two-year period).  If the officer dies or
becomes disabled while employed under the contract, the Corporation will pay him
or his beneficiary twice the amount of his then current salary in monthly
installments over a ten-year period.

         The Named Officers' employment contracts have current terms ending on
the following dates and require payment of the minimum annual salaries
indicated:  Mr. Hudson, July 31, 1998, $650,000; Mr. Browne, December 31, 1996,
$425,000; Mr. Hord, May 31, 1997, $450,000; Mr. Searles, March 31, 1996,
$500,000; and Mr. Somers, March 31, 1996, $280,000.  Mr. Hord's employment
contract provides for annual incentive payments in fiscal years 1993 through
1996 in an amount equal to 1.5% of the annual operating income (after capital
costs) of the Footwear Group with a minimum payment of $250,000 in each of the
fiscal years 1993 through 1995.  Mr.  Searles' employment contract provides for
annual incentive payments in fiscal years 1993 through 1995 in an amount equal
to 0.7% of the annual operating income (after capital costs) of the Women's
Apparel Retailing Group with a minimum payment of $150,000 in each of the fiscal
years 1993 and 1994.

                                       49
<PAGE>   50
         The Corporation also has provided Severance Compensation Agreements to
seventeen of its present senior executives, including all of the Named Officers.
On September 23, 1994, the Board of Directors approved the entry by the
Corporation into Amended and Restated Severance Compensation Agreements (each, a
"Severance Compensation Agreement") with the senior executives of the
Corporation for the stated purpose of reinforcing and encouraging the continued
attention and dedication of members of the Corporation's management to their
assigned duties in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Severance
Compensation Agreements) of the Corporation.  The terms of all such agreements,
as amended, are identical.

         The Severance Compensation Agreements provide certain payments and
benefits to executives whose employment is terminated within two years after a
Change in Control.  No payments or benefits will be made if the termination
occurs for cause or is due to the executive's retirement, death, or disability.
In the event of a compensated termination of an executive before the expiration
of two years following a Change in Control, the executive will be paid the
following: (i) all salary due to the date of termination; (ii) unused vacation
pay; (iii) a prorated share of the executive's Annual Bonus Target (as defined
in the Severance Compensation Agreements) under the Corporation's annual
incentive cash bonus plan; (iv) a prorated share of the executive's TRS Bonus
Target (as defined in the Severance Compensation Agreements) under the Total
Return to Shareholders Plan; and (v) an amount equal to three times the sum of
the executive's annualized base salary and Annual Bonus Target, reduced by
amounts payable to the executive under clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above and
provided further that the amounts described above would be further reduced if
the Net After Tax Amount (as defined in the Severance Agreements) received by
the executive would be increased by such a reduction because  such reduced
amounts would not be subject to the excise tax on "excess parachute payments"
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Such amount will
be paid in a lump sum on the 10th day after the date of termination.

         In addition to the payments described, the Corporation also has agreed
to maintain for the Named Officers all medical, health and accident, and life
insurance, as well as any disability plans, to which he or she was entitled
immediately prior to termination. The coverage will remain in effect for the
earlier of two years after termination or until the executive begins full- time
employment with a new employer. The executive has no obligation to mitigate
benefits or payments owed by the Corporation by seeking employment before the
end of the two-year period.

         The Severance Compensation Agreements do not reduce any other 
contractual rights an executive may have under the Corporation's Economic 
Bridge Program (as defined below), but payments under the Severance 
Compensation Agreements are in lieu of, and not in addition to, any payments 
to which an executive would be entitled under the Economic Bridge Program. 
Any successor to or assignee of the Corporation will be required to assume 
the obligations of the Severance Compensation Agreements, including the 
payment of all legal fees and expenses incurred by executives as a result of 
the Corporation contesting certain aspects of the Agreements.

         Trusts formed for the purpose of ensuring payment of all amounts due
under the Severance Compensation Agreements have been implemented with PNC Bank,
Ohio, National Association, Cincinnati, Ohio, serving as Trustee.  An amount
equal to the aggregate amount payable under each of the Severance Compensation
Agreements has been paid into the corresponding trust as a result of the tender
offer by Luxottica Group S.p.A. on March 3, 1995.

         On February 2, 1995, the Board of Directors adopted revisions to The
United States Shoe Corporation Economic Bridge Program for employees of the
Corporation (as supplemented and amended, the "Economic Bridge Program"). The
Economic Bridge Program provides a salary bridge benefit and continuation of
group medical, dental and life insurance benefits upon an involuntary
termination of employment under stated circumstances, or upon voluntary
termination of employment after a "change in control" (as defined in the
Economic Bridge Program) if the covered employee is not offered comparable
employment and coverage under a comparable economic bridge program after the
change in control. The amount of the salary bridge benefits for


                                      50
<PAGE>   51
executive officers generally is equal to 36 weeks of base salary plus one week
of base salary for each year of service with the Corporation plus one week of
base salary for each year of age over age 40, not to exceed 64 weeks total.  If
an eligible employee's employment ends at or within two years after a change in
control has occurred, the amount of the salary bridge benefits for executive
generally is equal to 48 weeks of base salary plus two weeks of base salary for
each year of service with the Corporation plus one week of base salary for each
year of age over age 40, not to exceed 78 weeks total. Group medical, dental
and life insurance benefits are provided for the number of weeks for which
salary bridge benefits are payable. Individuals with Severance Compensation
Agreements are subject to provisions in such agreements which provide that any
payments under the Severance Compensation Agreements will be in lieu of and not
in addition to any payment to which the individual would otherwise be entitled
under the Economic Bridge Program in the event of a change in control, as
defined in the Economic Bridge Program.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OVERVIEW AND PHILOSOPHY

         The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee")
is responsible for developing principles, policies and programs relating to the
compensation of the Corporation's executives and recommending such principles,
policies and programs to the Board of Directors. In addition, the Committee
recommends to the Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to the Chief
Executive Officer and, with advice from the Chief Executive Officer, to each of
the other executive officers of the Corporation, including the officers named in
the Summary Compensation Table (the "Named Officers"). The Corporation's
executive compensation program is designed to:

- --       Provide compensation arrangements that will assist the Corporation in
         attracting, retaining and motivating better- performing executives.

- --       Provide a direct link between executive compensation and the interests
         of the Corporation's shareholders by tying a significant portion of
         each executive's compensation to the performance of that executive's
         business group and to the price performance of the Corporation's Common
         Shares.

- --       Provide top performers with opportunities to earn compensation at
         levels within the top quartile of ranges offered by companies of
         similar size, business characteristics and complexity, and with which
         the Corporation competes for executive talent (the "Comparison
         Framework").

- --       Assist executives in achieving and maintaining desired levels of Common
         Share ownership through stock option and restricted share awards.
         Desired levels of Common Share ownership are the following amounts
         (based on market value of the Common Shares):  Chief Executive Officer,
         three times annual salary; senior executives, two times annual salary;
         and other executives of the Corporation, same as annual salary.

         The Committee strives to establish total compensation levels that are
competitive with companies in the Comparison Framework. When establishing total
compensation levels, the Committee examines the practices of those companies
included in the Corporation's "peer group" for stock price performance and the
practices of other retailing and specialty retailing companies. In addition,
the Committee works with compensation consultants to ensure that the Committee's
analysis of compensation levels is supported by survey data and other indicia of
comparability.

                                      51
<PAGE>   52

         The Committee is composed of four non-employee directors of the
Corporation. No member of the Committee has any insider or interlocking
relationship with the Corporation, as those terms are defined by applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

        Compensation packages include base salaries, annual incentive cash      
bonuses, stock option awards, restricted share awards and long- term incentive
payouts. Incentive compensation includes bonuses, stock options, restricted
share awards and long-term incentive payouts and may represent between
one-third and two-thirds of an executive officer's potential annual
compensation, depending upon the executive's position. The portion of an
executive officer's total compensation that is incentive compensation increases
with the level of responsibility of the executive officer.

BASE SALARIES

         The Committee generally seeks to establish base salaries at levels that
are competitive with the median levels of base salaries for executives with
similar roles and responsibilities at companies within the Comparison Framework.
In making salary increase decisions each year, the Committee primarily considers
(a) each executive's individual performance compared with the Committee's
expectations regarding that performance and (b) each executive's salary relative
to the mid-point of that executive's salary range, which represents the median
salary level of executives with similar roles and responsibilities at companies
within the Comparison Framework.  All of the Named Officers have written
employment agreements with terms of three to five years, subject to extension
by agreement of the parties.  See "Employment Contracts, Termination of
Employment and Change in Control Arrangements."  Such agreements establish
minimum base salaries. 

         In fiscal 1994, David M. Browne, President of the Optical Retailing
Group, received a salary increase from $325,000 to $425,000, Noel Hord,
President of the Footwear Group, received a salary increase from $450,000 to
$515,000, and K. Brent Somers, Chief Financial Officer, received a salary
increase from $280,000 to $350,000.  These salary increases were based on each
executive's strong individual performance compared with the Committee's
expectations.  Additionally, the Committee's recommendations with respect to
Messrs. Browne and Somers were intended to adjust their respective salaries to
levels competitive with those of executives with similar roles and
responsibilities at companies within the Comparison Framework.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE CASH BONUSES

         The Committee administers an annual incentive cash bonus program for
executive officers, as well as for other management employees.  Each year the
Committee recommends to the Board of Directors individual and aggregate target
cash bonus amounts for executive officers that reflect approximate median levels
of bonuses for executives with similar roles and responsibilities at companies
within the Comparison Framework.  The program is structured to pay minimum
bonuses if the pertinent business group (or groups) meets its threshold annual
operating income goal.  Median bonuses are paid if the business group (or
groups) meets its targeted operating income goal, and larger bonuses are paid if
the business group (or groups) exceeds its operating income goal. Generally,
bonuses are not paid if the business group (or groups) fails to achieve its
threshold operating income goal;  however, the Committee retains discretion to
award annual incentive cash bonuses based on exceptional individual performance
that is related to performance considerations other than financial.

         In fiscal 1994, an incentive award formula was established at the
beginning of the year for each business group within the Corporation based on
the operating income results of such business group; that formula included
threshold, target and maximum levels.  A similar incentive award formula, which
also included threshold, target and maximum levels, was established for
individuals in the Corporate Center





                                       52
<PAGE>   53

Group based on the operating income results of each of the Corporation's three
business groups.  In fiscal 1994, Mr. Browne received a cash bonus above his
target award amount reflecting the facts that the Optical Retailing Group
significantly exceeded its targeted operating income goal and reflecting his
strong individual performance.  Mr. Somers received a cash bonus in fiscal 1994
above his target award amount reflecting the fact that the Optical Retailing
Group significantly exceeded its target operating income results and the
Footwear Group met its target operating income and reflecting his strong
individual performance.

         Pursuant to the terms of his employment contract, Mr. Hord received an
incentive cash bonus based upon 1.5% of the operating income (after capital
costs) of the Footwear Group and his strong individual performance.  Based on
the financial performance of the Women's Specialty Retailing Group, Mr. Searles
did not receive a performance based incentive bonus; he did, however, receive a
guaranteed payment of $150,000 pursuant to the terms of his employment contract.

OPTION GRANTS AND RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS

         Grants of options and awards of restricted shares are made to executive
officers pursuant to The United States Shoe Corporation 1988 Employee Incentive
Plan (the "1988 Plan").  Option grants are designed to align the long-term
interests of the Corporation's executives with those of the Corporation's
shareholders. Additionally, option grants provide a favorable mechanism through
which the Corporation's executives can achieve equity ownership in the
Corporation.

         The size of an option grant is based on the executive's level of
responsibility and the Committee's expectations regarding the executive's future
contribution to the Corporation.  The size of the grant, when combined with the
executive's Total Return to Shareholders Plan and Key Executive Long-Term
Incentive Plan opportunity, as set forth below, is designed to provide a median
level of long-term incentive opportunity when compared to such opportunities for
executives with similar roles and responsibilities at companies within the
Comparison Framework.  Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the
average of the high and low stock price of the Corporation's Common Shares on
the date of grant.  Options have a 10.5-year term with vesting occurring in
equal increments over the first four years of that term.  Options are forfeited
three months after the recipient leaves the employ of the Corporation and expire
one year after retirement, death or disability of the recipient.

          It has been the Committee's practice to award stock options to
executive officers early each fiscal year to provide competitive compensation
opportunities.  In fiscal 1994, the Committee granted options to each of the
Named Officers based on the level of responsibility of each and the Committee's
expectation of that officer's future contribution to the Corporation.

         The Committee also recommends awards of restricted Common Shares under
the 1988 Plan.  Such awards are made to executives who demonstrate superior
performance or potential.  The restrictions on such shares lapse on the basis of
continued employment of the executive by the Corporation.  No restricted shares
were awarded to any Named Executive Officer in fiscal 1994.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

         On July 29, 1994, the Board of Directors adopted the Total Return to
Shareholders Plan (the "TRS Plan") to replace the Corporation's Key Executive
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTI Plan").  Beginning in 1994, a thirty-nine
month performance period will be established each year under the TRS Plan, and
for each performance period a target award will be determined for each
participant in the TRS Plan.  Generally, such target awards are based upon
median long-term incentive opportunities at companies within the Comparison
Framework.  At the end of each performance period the total return during that
period (share price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) on a hypothetical
investment in Common Shares will be compared





                                       53
<PAGE>   54

with a similar investment in the shares of companies in the "peer group," as set
forth in "Shareholder Return Performance Information."  Awards will be made to
participants based on the Corporation's ranking in the "peer group", ranging
from 50% of a participant's target award if the Corporation is at the 40th
percentile to 200% of a participant's target award if the Corporation is at or
above the 90th percentile.  No awards will be made if the Corporation's ranking
is below the 40th percentile.  All awards under the TRS Plan, as determined by
the Committee, will be in cash or in Common Shares, which will be restricted and
subject to forfeiture if the participant terminates employment during the
three-year period following the award.  The TRS Plan also provides for the
payout of awards in the event of a change in control.

         A transition plan is in effect whereby executives may earn prorated
awards based on total share price appreciation for the performance periods
covering January 1, 1992 through March 31, 1995, and January 1, 1993 through
March 31, 1996.  The LTI Plan will be phased out during this transition period.

         In fiscal 1994, target awards were determined for each of the Named
Officers for the performance periods covering January 1, 1992 through March 31,
1995, January 1, 1993 through March 31, 1996, and January 1, 1994 through March
31, 1997.  No awards were made under the Corporation's LTI Plan in fiscal 1994.

COMMITTEE'S POLICY ON SECTION 162(M)

         It is the policy of the Corporation to structure its executive
compensation plans in a manner intended to enhance shareholder value.  Whenever
possible, implementation of this strategy will include taking advantage of
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including Section 162(m),
regarding deductible compensation expenses.  However, the Compensation Committee
recognizes the need to retain discretion to compensate executives in a manner
that is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders, even if
that practice results in a nondeductible expense.  In fiscal 1994 tax deductions
lost by the Corporation by reason of Section 162(m) were not material.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

         Mr. Hudson's compensation is recommended by the Committee to the Board
of Directors.  In fiscal 1993, the Committee did not increase Mr. Hudson's base
salary and, in early fiscal 1994, delayed consideration of a salary increase to
Mr. Hudson until the results of the Corporation's organization restructuring
were better known.  In November 1994, the Committee awarded a salary increase to
Mr. Hudson, from $580,000 to $650,000, based on the Corporation's improved
performance and Mr. Hudson's individual performance, as determined by the
Committee, in comparison with the Committee's expectations.  Mr. Hudson received
a bonus for fiscal 1994, above his target award amount, based on the
Corporation's improved operating income and stock price performance and the
Board's assessment of Mr. Hudson's individual performance.  The Committee
awarded stock options to Mr. Hudson based on the Committee's expectation of Mr.
Hudson's continued and future contribution to the Corporation.  Additionally, in
fiscal 1994, Mr.  Hudson's target awards were determined pursuant to the terms
of the TRS Plan.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders and Directors of
The United States Shoe Corporation:

         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of THE
UNITED STATES SHOE CORPORATION (an Ohio corporation) and subsidiaries as of
January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994, and the related consolidated statements
of operations and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended January 28, 1995.  These consolidated financial statements
and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The United States
Shoe Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 28, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

         Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in the accompanying
index is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.  This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

The United States Shoe Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The United States Shoe Corporation ("the company") is a specialty retailing
company operating 2,349 retail stores and leased departments located throughout
the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. The company's specialty retailing
businesses focus on three major product segments: women's apparel, optical and
footwear. The company also manufactures, wholesales and imports footwear which
is sold in the medium and higher price ranges. See Note 12 for financial
information on each of the company's business segments.

As of January 28, 1995, the women's apparel segment operated 1,351 stores
located primarily in enclosed malls in 47 states and the District of Columbia.
As of the same date, the optical retailing group operated 589 stores and leased
departments located primarily in enclosed malls and strip centers in 45 states,
Puerto Rico and Canada. The leased optical departments are located in select
Kmart stores. The footwear retailing divisions operated 409 stores and leased
shoe departments at January 28, 1995 in 43 states. The shoe stores are located
primarily in major shopping malls and outlet centers while the leased shoe
departments are located in strong-value stores.

In fiscal 1994, approximately 44% of women's apparel merchandise was purchased
from foreign suppliers and approximately 45% of wholesale footwear was imported
from foreign manufacturers (located primarily in South America, the Far East and
Europe.)

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION-- The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.

FISCAL YEAR-- The company's fiscal year is the 52-53 week period ending on the
Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 each consisted
of 52 weeks and ended on January 28, 1995, January 29, 1994 and January 30,
1993, respectively.


ESTIMATES-- In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, management has made, where
necessary, estimates and judgements based on currently available information
that affect certain of the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS-- Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
demand deposits and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS-- Short-term investments are stated at cost and are
comprised of high investment grade commercial paper with original terms of three
to six months.

INVENTORIES-- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, principally using the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. The company valued 85% and 90% of
its inventories using the LIFO method at January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994,
respectively. Consolidated inventories, if stated at FIFO, would have exceeded
the reported inventory values by approximately $31.2 million at January 28, 1995
and $36.9 million at January 29, 1994.

During fiscal 1993, inventory quantities were reduced, which resulted in a
liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower costs that prevailed in
prior years. The effect of this liquidation was to increase net income by $5.5
million ($.12 per share). The LIFO effects of inventory reductions were not
material in 1994 and 1992.

Inventories consisted of the following:

                                     =========     =========
</TABLE>

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION-- Depreciation and amortization of property, plant
and equipment are provided using principally the straight-line method at rates
designed to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment over their
estimated useful lives. The useful lives are generally 10 years for land
improvements, 20-40 years for buildings, 3-10 years for furniture, fixtures and
machinery, and the remaining lease term, which includes certain renewal periods,
for leasehold improvements.

EXCESS OF COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED-- These amounts are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over various periods, not exceeding 40 years.
Accumulated amortization was $8.5 million and $6.8 million at January 28, 1995
and January 29, 1994, respectively.

OPENING AND CLOSING COSTS-- Store opening costs are charged to operations as
incurred. The costs associated with closing stores or facilities are accrued
when the decision is made to close the location.

The United States Shoe Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(continued)


FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION-- Assets and liabilities of the company's foreign
operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance
sheet date and results of operations are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate
component of shareholders' investment.

INCOME TAXES-- Deferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences
between financial and tax reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related
asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax asset or liability
that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting is
classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-- The company utilizes derivative financial
instruments to manage well-defined foreign currency exchange rate and interest
rate risks and does not use them for trading purposes.

Foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the risk of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates associated with transactions denominated in foreign
currencies, primarily footwear purchases from European countries. Any gain or
loss upon settlement of such contracts is included in the cost of the related
purchases. At January 28, 1995, the company had contracts maturing on various
dates between February 9, 1995 and August 22, 1995 to purchase foreign currency
(27,617 million Italian lire and 3,000 million Spanish pesetas) for $39.8
million.

To balance the company's fixed and variable interest rate risk, as of January
28, 1995, the company had entered into four interest rate swap agreements with
notional amounts of $25 million each that mature on various dates through
November 1995. Under the terms of the agreements, the company receives interest
at a fixed rate (5.05% weighted-average rate as of January 28, 1995) and pays
interest at a variable rate tied to the six-month LIBOR (6.55% weighted-average
rate as of January 28, 1995). The differential to be paid or received under the
agreements is accrued and is charged or credited to interest expense over the
life of the agreements. The company monitors the risk of default by the swap
counterparties and does not anticipate nonperformance.

EARNINGS PER SHARE-- Earnings (loss) per share are based on the weighted-average
number of common shares and equivalents outstanding during each year. Common
share equivalents represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock
options which would have a dilutive effect in years where there are earnings.
Common share equivalents had no material effect in 1994, 1993 or 1992.

RECLASSIFICATIONS-- Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years'
financial statements to conform with the 1994 presentation.

(2) ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective February 2, 1992, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This change did not
have a material effect on the company's financial statements.

The company adopted the LIFO method of determining inventory values for its
optical retailing inventories effective March 1, 1992. Management believes the
LIFO method is preferable because it more closely matches revenues and expenses.
There was no significant effect on 1992 net earnings from this change in
accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change on retained earnings
at February 2, 1992 was not determinable, nor were the pro forma effects of
retroactive application of LIFO to prior years.

Effective January 30, 1994, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." This change did not have a material effect on the company's financial
statements.

(3) ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

On July 7, 1994, the company acquired for cash the assets of Tuckerman Optical
Company, a chain of 31 optical stores located primarily in the Midwestern United
States. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The excess of the cost of the net assets acquired over their fair
values has been recorded as goodwill.

On January 27, 1993, the company acquired for cash 100% of the stock of
Eyemasters Ltd., a Canadian chain of 22 optical superstores. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The excess of the cost of
the net assets acquired over their fair values has been recorded as goodwill.

During 1993, the company sold the assets of its optical retailing operations in
the United Kingdom. A $5.5 million charge was recorded in 1993 in conjunction

                                       72

(continued)

with the divestiture. Operating losses recognized from operations in the United
Kingdom prior to the sale were $1.9 million in 1993 (excluding the charge to
divest the business) and $7.0 million in 1992.

Also during 1993, the company sold 61 Ups `N Downs and 124 Caren Charles stores.
The sale completed the company's divestiture of these divisions. A $10.6 million
charge was recorded in 1993 in conjunction with the divestiture. Operating
earnings (losses) recognized from the Ups `N Downs and Caren Charles divisions
prior to the sale and transfer of these stores were $(14.1) million in 1993
(excluding the charge to divest the stores) and $1.4 million in 1992.

(4) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The company's footwear wholesaling business sells primarily to independent
retailers and department stores across the United States. Receivables arising
from these sales are not collateralized. Credit risk is affected by conditions
or occurrences within the economy and the retail industry. The company
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the company's receivables
balance as of January 28, 1995.

(5) NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT

The company maintains lines of credit through both formal and informal credit
arrangements with domestic and foreign banks. At January 28, 1995, the company
had in place an amended revolving credit agreement, with nine participating
financial institutions, making available up to $125 million of credit through
February 5, 1996. The revolving credit agreement is maintained to finance
working capital. Borrowing rates are based on prime rates and Eurodollar loan
rates. At January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994, there were no borrowings
outstanding under this facility. Commitment fees of .25% to .50% per annum are
payable on the company's available and unused portion of its committed credit
facilities (.275% at January 28, 1995).

The company also has letter of credit facilities to support the purchase of
inventories. At January 28, 1995, the company had letter of credit facilities
totaling $149 million, of which $70 million in letter of credit commitments were
outstanding.


Long-term debt consisted of the following:

At January 28, 1995, the company was authorized to issue an additional $25
million of debt under a shelf registration filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in August 1992.

The company has zero coupon notes, payable in 2013, that had an aggregate face
value of $15.6 million at January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994, and are stated
net of the unamortized discount of $14.1 million at January 28, 1995 and $14.3
million at January 29, 1994, with an imputed interest rate of 13%.

The aggregate payments required on long-term debt during the next five fiscal
years are as follows:

The amended revolving credit agreement and the long-term debt agreements
include, among other things, provisions which limit total consolidated
indebtedness, require the maintenance of minimum amounts of working capital and
of certain financial ratios, limit the amount of capital expenditures, capital
stock repurchases and asset sales, and limit the payment of cash dividends by
the company. Under the most restrictive dividend provision, approximately $24
million of consolidated retained earnings at January 28, 1995 is available for
payment of cash dividends. See Note 13.

</TABLE>

The company's Executive Committee of its Board of Directors, in 1987, authorized
the open market purchase of up to two million of its outstanding common shares.
As of January 28, 1995, the total shares repurchased under this authorization
was approximately 450,000.

During 1994 and 1993, the company issued 167,485 and 194,147, respectively,
previously unissued common shares in connection with the company's tax incentive
savings plans. During 1993 and 1992, the company also issued 68,210 and 198,240,
respectively, common shares out of treasury stock in connection with these
plans. See Note 8 for further discussion of these plans.

During 1994, the company adopted, and reserved 500,000 common shares for
issuance under, The United States Shoe Corporation Associates' Discounted Stock
Purchase Plan. Under the Plan, associates may purchase previously unissued
common shares of the company at 85% of the shares' fair market value at the date
of purchase. During 1994, 36,491 shares were issued in connection with the Plan.

The company has a Share Purchase Rights Plan adopted in 1986 and amended in
March 1988. Under the Plan, shareholders of record on April 14, 1986 received,
in connection with each common share owned, the right to purchase one
one-hundredth of a Series A Preference Share ("Preference Share") at an exercise
price of $200, subject to adjustment (collectively, the "Rights"). As a result
of the payment by the company of a 100% common share dividend in June 1986,
one-half of a Right is now attached to each outstanding common share of the
company. The Rights are exercisable for Preference Shares following (i) the
public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or has obtained the
right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the company's
outstanding common shares, or (ii) ten days following the commencement of, 
or public announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange 
offer if, upon consummation, such person or group would be the beneficial 
owner of 30% or more of the outstanding common shares and if the company's 
Board of Directors does not delay the exercisability of the Rights. The Rights 
do not have any voting rights and are not entitled to dividends.

Additionally, if any person or group acquires 20% or more of the company's
outstanding common shares, the Rights would entitle the holder to purchase
common shares (or other securities or property of the company) in lieu of the
Preference Shares at half the market value. Such purchase rights for common
shares will not be triggered if the 20% acquisition is made pursuant to a tender
or exchange offer for all outstanding common shares which the directors of the
company who are not officers deem to be in the best interests of the company and
its shareholders (a "Permitted Offer").

Upon the occurrence of certain other events (including a merger in which the
company's common shares are exchanged or 50% or more of the company's assets or
earning power is sold or transferred), the Rights would entitle the holder to
purchase common stock in the acquiring entity at half its market value, except
in connection with certain transactions following a Permitted Offer.

All of the Rights may be redeemed by the company at a price of $.05 per Right
until a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
outstanding common shares. After a person or group acquires 20% or more of the
common shares, the company may not redeem the Rights, except in certain limited
circumstances. The Rights also may be redeemed in connection with certain
negotiated transactions. The Rights will expire on April 14, 1996. See Note 13.

(8) BENEFIT PLANS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS-- The company has several noncontributory retirement plans
which provide for pension benefits to eligible employees upon retirement.
Pension benefits are based on length of service and compensation, under career
average or final average formulas. The company's funding policy is in accordance
with minimum funding requirements. Net periodic pension cost includes the
following components:

The weighted-average discount rates used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligations were 8% and 7.5% at January 1, 1995
and 1994, respectively. The assumed rate of increase in future compensation
levels used to measure the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligations was 5.5% at January 1, 1995 and 1994. The expected long-term rate of
return on assets used in determining pension costs was 8.5% and 9% at January 1,
1995 and 1994, respectively. The impact of the change in the discount rate
assumption was to decrease the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligations by $10.6 million at January 1, 1995.

Effective January 1, 1995, The United States Shoe Corporation Pension Plan for
salaried employees ("Salaried Pension Plan") was amended to allow women's
apparel retailing group associates to participate in the Plan. The net periodic
pension expense related to these associates is estimated at $4.3 million for

1995. Additionally, during 1994 the Salaried Pension Plan was amended, effective
January 1, 1995, for associates of the corporate services, optical retailing and
women's apparel retailing groups to change the benefit formula to a cash balance
formula. The amendment will result in affected participants accruing an annual
benefit at a percentage determined based upon their years of service and their
annual compensation. The amendment resulted in a decrease of approximately $6.8
million in the projected benefit obligation at January 1, 1995.

The company maintains an unfunded supplemental retirement plan for participants
of its Salaried Pension Plan to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted
under the provisions of prevailing tax law. Additionally, the company provides
supplemental retirement benefits to certain retired executives in accordance
with individual retirement agreements. The pension liability associated with
these plans is accrued using the same actuarial methods and assumptions as those
used for the company's qualified plans. See Note 13.

Net periodic pension cost for these supplemental plans includes the following
components:

On February 2, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of The United
States Shoe Corporation Retirement Plan for Outside Directors. Under the Plan,
directors retiring with five or more years of service as an outside director
(i.e., directors who are not employees of the company or its subsidiaries) will
receive a lifetime quarterly retirement benefit commencing at the later of age
72 or retirement. The annual benefit payment will be equal to the retainer
received by the director immediately prior to retirement and will terminate upon
death. The present value of the Plan's accumulated benefit obligation at the
date of approval is estimated to approximate $1.0 million. See Note 13.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS-- The company provides retirement benefits to
eligible employees of some divisions through a noncontributory profit sharing
plan. Company contributions are determined by a formula based upon participants'
compensation and profits of the divisions, as defined in the plan. The company's
provision for such contributions was $0.2 million in 1994, $1.6 million in 1993
and $1.7 million in 1992. In connection with the previously mentioned amendment
to the Salaried Pension Plan, no additional company contributions will be made
to this plan subsequent to January 28, 1995.

The company also sponsors three tax incentive savings plans, as well as a
non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Eligible employees may contribute or
defer a portion of their compensation to these plans. The company makes
quarterly contributions of its common stock to the plans based on a percentage
of employees' contributions or deferrals, as appropriate. The provision for
these stock contributions was $4.3 million in 1994, $3.3 million in 1993 and
$3.2 million in 1992. Effective January 1, 1995, the three tax incentive savings
plans were merged into a single plan. See Note 13.

HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS-- The company partially subsidizes health care benefits for
eligible retirees. Net periodic cost of these benefits included the following
components:

For 1994, a 12% (13% for 1993) increase in the cost of covered health care
benefits was assumed. This rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 7% for 2001
and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption
has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, a 1% increase in
the health care trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $0.8 million as of January 28, 1995 and the net periodic cost by
$0.1 million for the year then ended. The weighted-average discount rates used
in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were 8% and
7.5% at January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994, respectively. The company funds
these benefits as claims are incurred.

In 1993, the company changed the formula for cost sharing with retirees which
resulted in an unrecognized reduction in prior service cost of approximately
$6.6 million.

The valuation allowance relates to state, local and foreign tax assets and
operating loss carryforwards that may expire before the company can utilize
them. Realization of the company's $69.6 million net deferred tax asset is
dependent upon the company generating sufficient future taxable income.

At January 28, 1995, the company had state net operating loss carryforwards
totaling between $30.0 million and $70.0 million, depending upon taxing
jurisdiction, expiring between 1997 to 2009; foreign net operating loss
carryforwards totaling $4.3 million, expiring in 2000 and 2001; and U.S. foreign
tax credit carryforwards totaling $1.5 million, expiring in 1997.

CONTINGENCIES-- The company is contingently liable as a guarantor of 337 leases
in 33 states, the District of Columbia and the United Kingdom relating to
customer facilities and certain leases that were assigned in connection with
various dispositions. Leases guaranteed by the company expire between 1995 and
2017 and minimum rentals aggregate $61.0 million for the twenty-three-year
period. The company does not hold security for these guarantees. As of January
28, 1995, approximately 57% of the guaranteed aggregate minimum rentals were
concentrated with two primary obligors.

The company has entered into severance compensation agreements with certain of
its executives. Such agreements provide for payments to these executives of
amounts up to three times their base salary plus bonus potential, plus
continuation of certain benefits, if a change in control (as defined) is
followed within two years by a termination (as defined) of employment. The
maximum contingent liability of the company pursuant to all such agreements is
approximately $25 million at January 28, 1995. See Note 13.

COMMITMENTS-- In April 1995, the company entered into agreements with eight
suppliers committing to purchase an aggregate of $31 million of eyeglass frames
from such suppliers during the next twelve months.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-- Litigation is instituted from time to time against the
company which involves routine matters incident to the company's business. In
the opinion of management and legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of such
litigation will not have a material effect upon the company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations. See Note 13.

(11) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Following are the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
the company's financial instruments (amounts in thousands):

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS-- Approximate the carrying amounts reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets because of the liquidity and short-term nature of
these instruments.

LONG-TERM DEBT-- Based on current rates offered to the company for debt of the
same remaining maturities. The carrying amounts and fair values were $127,342
and $123,019, respectively, at January 28, 1995; and $177,596 and $186,260,
respectively, at January 29, 1994.


FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS-- Based on current foreign exchange contract rates
offered to the company for similar contracts of the same remaining maturities.
The fair values were $39,657 at January 28, 1995; and $21,551 at January 29,
1994.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS-- Based on the amount that the company would (pay)
receive to terminate the agreements. The fair values were $(1,973) at January
28, 1995; and $1,403 at January 29, 1994.

LEASE GUARANTEES-- Not practicable to estimate since quoted prices are not
readily available and valuation techniques would not be practicable due to the
number of primary obligors, inherent differences in the primary obligors' credit
risk and the varying lease terms.

(13) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

ACQUISITION OF OPTI-WORLD, INC.-- On April 3, 1995, the company acquired 100% of
the stock of Opti-World, Inc. ("Opti-World"), a chain of 59 optical stores
located primarily in the Southeastern United States.

SALE OF FOOTWEAR GROUP-- On March 15, 1995, the company entered into a
definitive agreement for the sale of the footwear group to Nine West Group Inc.
("Nine West"). In exchange for the net assets of the footwear group, the
company will receive $560 million in cash, plus warrants to purchase 3.7
million shares of Nine West common stock at $35.50 per share at any time during
the 8.5 years following the consummation of the sale. The sale is subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions.

In 1994, the footwear group accounted for $706.1 million, or 27.2%, of the
company's net sales and generated $36.2 million of earnings from operations.

AGREEMENT WITH LUXOTTICA GROUP-- On April 21, 1995, the company entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which Luxottica Acquisition Corp.
("LAC"), an indirect subsidiary of Luxottica Group S.p.A. ("Luxottica"), will
purchase all of the company's outstanding common shares (and associated Rights).
The transaction is to be completed through a tender offer by LAC for all of the
company's outstanding common shares (and associated Rights) for $28 per common
share (and associated Right), which will be followed by a second-step merger in
which any of the company's common shares (and associated Rights) not acquired in
the tender offer will be cancelled and retired and will be converted into a
right to receive in cash $28 per common share (and associated Right). The
transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The
consummation of the transaction will result in (a) the cancellation of all 
outstanding stock options and, for each such option, payment to the holders 
thereof of an amount equal to the excess of $28 over the exercise price of 
the option, (b) the termination of all restrictions on outstanding shares of
restricted stock, (c) the payment of liabilities to participating employees of
the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans, (d) the payment of
liabilities to certain participating employees of the company's Supplemental
Executive Salaried Employees Benefit Plan, and (e) the payment of liabilities
under the company's Retirement Plan for Outside Directors. As a result of
Luxottica's tender offer, the company deposited $24.5 million into a trust in
accordance with the terms of certain severance compensation agreements
described in Note 10.


LITIGATION-- On March 3, 1995, Luxottica commenced an action in U.S. District
Court by filing a complaint against the company, its Directors, the Commissioner
of Securities of Ohio, the Director of Commerce of Ohio, and the State of Ohio
(the "Luxottica Action"). Luxottica seeks, among other things, (a) injunctive
relief against enforcement of the Ohio Take-Over Act and a declaratory judgement
that the Take-Over Act is unconstitutional as it may be applied to the Luxottica
Offer, and (b) injunctive relief prohibiting the company and its Directors from
enforcing its Share Purchase Rights Agreement, and a declaratory judgement
declaring that Agreement and the Rights are null and void.

On March 6, 10 and 24, 1995, Luxottica filed Amended Complaints which added
Avant-Garde Optics, Inc. as a Plaintiff and which, in addition, seek (c)
declaratory judgement that the Directors of the Company are in breach of their
fiduciary duties for failing to approve the Luxottica Offer, (d) injunctive
relief requiring the Directors to approve the Luxottica Offer, (e) an injunction
prohibiting consummation of the proposed sale of the footwear group to Nine West
without a shareholder vote, and (f) an order declaring that certain disclosures
made by the company contain false and misleading statements in violation of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

On April 21, 1995, the company and Avant-Garde Optics, Inc. and Luxottica
Acquisition Corp. signed an agreement and plan of merger ("Agreement"). Pursuant
to the Agreement, the parties have agreed, promptly, and in any event not later
than April 26, 1995 (unless the Agreement has been earlier terminated), to use
their respective best efforts to obtain a dismissal without prejudice of the
Luxottica Action (with certain limited exceptions), with each party bearing 
its own costs and attorneys' fees therefor.

On March 7, 1995, several shareholders of the company filed three complaints in
the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio naming the company and its
Directors as defendants. The relief sought includes, among other things, (a)
class action certification, (b) a declaration that the Directors have breached
their fiduciary duties and an order directing that they carry out their such
duties, (c) an order that the defendants consider the Luxottica Offer in good
faith, (d) an order that the defendants rescind any transactions that are
unfair, (e) an order enjoining any action by the defendants to change the
company's cumulative voting

rules, (f) an order enjoining the transaction complained of in the complaint or
any related transaction, (g) accounting for any profits realized as a result of
the transaction complained of, and (h) damages, attorneys' fees and costs.

AMENDMENTS TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT-- The company obtained waivers to
its revolving credit agreement to permit the signing of the company's agreements
with Nine West and Luxottica (actual consummation of any of those transactions 
will require the company to renegotiate or terminate the revolving credit 
agreement). The company also obtained an amendment to the revolving credit 
agreement primarily related to the acquisition of Opti-World and to the 
long-term debt repayment due May 27, 1995. In conjunction with the Opti-World 
acquisition, the company borrowed $50 million under the revolving credit

long as he remains an Employee and until his Plan Accounts have been fully

         3.3     Eligibility Service.  Each Employee who completes at least

"Eligibility Service" as of the last day of such 12-month period.  Each
Employee who fails to complete at least 1,000 Hours of Service during the
12-month period commencing on the day he first performs an Hour of Service
shall be credited with one year of "Eligibility Service" as of the last day of
the first Plan Year (commencing on or after the day he first performs an Hour
of Service) during which he completes at least 1,000 Hours of Service.  For
purposes of this Section 3.3, an Employee's "Hours of Service" shall be
computed as follows (subject to the rules contained in 29 CFR Section
2530.200b-2(b) and (c), which are incorporated herein by reference):

                 3.3.1      One Hour of Service shall be credited for each hour
for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance of
duties for an Affiliated Employer during the applicable computation period.

                 3.3.2      One Hour of Service shall be credited for each hour
for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to payment, by an Affiliated
Employer on account of a period of  time during which no duties are performed
(irrespective of whether the employment relationship has terminated) due to
vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury
duty, military duty or leave of absence.  Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence:

                            (a)   No more than 501 Hours of Service are
required to be credited under this Section 3.3.2 to an Employee on account of
any single continuous period during which the Employee performs no duties
(whether or not such period occurs in a single computation period);

                            (b)   An hour for which an Employee is directly or
indirectly paid, or entitled to payment, on account of a period during which no
duties are performed is not required to be credited to the Employee if such
payment is made or due under a plan maintained solely for the purpose of
complying with applicable workmen's compensation, unemployment compensation or
disability insurance laws; and

                            (c)   Hours of Service are not required to be
credited for a payment which solely reimburses an Employee for medical or
medically related expenses incurred by the Employee.

For purposes of this Section 3.3.2, a payment shall be deemed to be made by or
due from an Affiliated Employer regardless of whether such payment is made by
or due from the Affiliated Employer directly, or indirectly through, among
others, a trust fund, or insurer, to which the Affiliated Employer contributes
or pays premiums and regardless of whether contributions made





                                       5
<PAGE>   9
or due to the trust fund, insurer or other entity are for the benefit of
particular Employees or are on behalf of a group of Employees in the aggregate.

                 3.3.3      One Hour of Service shall be credited for each hour
for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or
agreed to by an Affiliated Employer.  The same hours of service shall not be
credited both under Section 3.3.1 or Section 3.3.2, as the case may be, and
under this Section 3.3.3.  Crediting of Hours of Service for back pay awarded
or agreed to with respect to periods described in Section 3.3.2 shall be
subject to the limitations set forth in that Section.


                                   SECTION 4

          SALARY DEFERRALS; COMPANY MATCH; DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION

         4.1     Salary Deferrals.  A Participant may elect to defer up to 25%
of his Annual Compensation for each Plan Year.  Furthermore, subject to such
rules as the Committee may prescribe, a Participant may elect to defer up to
100% of his Annual Bonus for each Plan Year.

                 4.1.1      A Participant who has elected to defer a portion of
his Annual Compensation and/or Annual Bonus may change the amount of his
deferrals from one permissible amount to another, effective as of any Entry
Date, by completing the procedure prescribed by the Committee.

         4.2     Company Match.  For each calendar quarter, the Company shall
credit an amount, on behalf of each Participant who is an Employee on the last
day of such quarter or who ceased to be an Employee during such quarter by
reason of his retirement (on or after attaining age 65 or, in the case of a
Participant who has completed ten years of service with the Company, on or
after attaining age 55) or death, to the Participant's bookkeeping account
under Section 5.2.  To the extent that the Participant's aggregate non-deferred
Annual Compensation and Annual Bonus for the calendar year through the end of
the applicable calendar quarter exceed $150,000 or such aggregate non-deferred
Annual Compensation and annual bonus was not matched under The United States
Shoe Corporation Tax Incentive Savings Plan, the amount to be credited to the
bookkeeping account under Section 5.2 for such a Participant for any calendar
quarter will be equal to 100% of the Participant's Base Salary Deferrals for
the calendar quarter.  For purposes of the Plan, "Base Salary Deferrals" means,
with respect to any period, that portion of the Participant's Annual
Compensation and Annual Bonus payable for such period which he has elected to
defer under Section 4.1 and which is not in excess of 3% of the Participant's
Annual Compensation and Annual Bonus payable for such period.

         4.3     Discretionary Contribution.  For each calendar year, the
Company shall credit an amount to Participants' bookkeeping accounts under
Section 5.3.  To the extent that a Participant's aggregate non-deferred Annual
Compensation and Annual Bonus for the calendar year exceeds





                                       6
<PAGE>   10
$150,000 or such aggregate non-deferred Annual Compensation and annual bonus
was not matched under The United States Shoe Corporation Tax Incentive Savings
Plan, the amount to be credited to the bookkeeping account under Section 5.3
for a Participant for any calendar year shall be equal to a percentage of such
Participant's Base Salary Deferrals for the calendar year, such percentage to
be determined each year by the Company.  Only those Participants who are
Employees on the date the Company determines the percentage of Base Salary
Deferrals to be contributed under the Plan or who ceased to be Employees prior
to such date by reason of their retirement (on or after attaining age 65 or, in
the case of Participants who have completed ten years of service with the
Company, on or after attaining age 55) or death shall be entitled to such
discretionary contribution.


                                   SECTION 5

                                    ACCOUNTS

         5.1     Salary Deferral Accounts.  A separate bookkeeping Salary
Deferral Account shall be established and maintained for each Participant who
has elected salary deferrals which shall reflect the amounts deferred by the
Participant under Section 4.1 and the assumed investment thereof.  Subject to
such rules as the Committee may prescribe, the amounts deferred by a
Participant with respect to any month shall be credited to the Participant's
Salary Deferral Account as soon as administratively practical and shall be
assumed to have been invested in the investment designated by the Participant
in a form provided by and filed with the Committee.

         5.2     Company Matching Accounts.  A separate bookkeeping Company
Matching Account shall be established and maintained for each Participant which
shall reflect the Company Match to be credited to the Participant under Section
4.2 and the assumed investment thereof.  The amount of the Company Match with
respect to any calendar quarter shall be credited to the Participant's Company
Matching Account as soon as administratively practical.  Amounts credited to a
Participant's Company Matching Account prior to January 1, 1995 shall be
assumed to have been invested exclusively in common shares of the Company.
Amounts credited to a Participant's Company Matching Account on or after
January 1, 1995 shall be assumed to have been invested in the investment
designated by the Participant.

amount of the Company Discretionary Contribution with respect to any calendar
year shall be credited to the Participant's Discretionary Contribution Account

</TABLE>

A Participant employed prior to January 1, 1995 shall be 100% vested in his
Company Matching Account and Discretionary Contribution Account.

         5.5     Dividends.  With respect to the portion of a Participant's
Plan Accounts which are assumed to be invested in common shares of the Company,
whenever any cash dividends are paid with respect to common shares of the
Company, additional amounts shall be credited to the applicable Plan Account of
the Participant as of the dividend payment date.  The additional amount to be
credited to such account shall be determined by multiplying the per share cash
dividend paid with respect to the common shares of the Company on the dividend
payment date times the number of assumed common shares of the Company credited
to such account(s) on the record date.  Such additional amount credited to the
applicable account(s) of the Participant shall be assumed to have been invested
in additional common shares of the Company on the day on which such dividends
were paid.

         5.6     Valuation.  Each calendar quarter, the Company shall furnish
each Participant or, in the event of his death, his Beneficiary, a statement as
of the end of such calendar quarter showing the then balance of the
Participant's Plan Accounts, the total credits to such accounts during the
preceding quarter and, if amounts credited to any such account are assumed to
have been invested in securities, a description of such securities including
the number of shares assumed to have been purchased by the amounts credited to
such Accounts.


                                   SECTION 6

                                    PAYMENTS

         6.1     General.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, no
amount shall be paid with respect to a Participant's Plan Accounts while he
remains an Employee.

<PAGE>   12
         6.2     Termination of Employment.  If a Participant ceases to be an
Employee for any reason other than his death, the Company shall pay to the
Participant the amounts credited to the Participant's Plan Accounts in one lump
sum as of the first day of the first calendar quarter following the calendar
quarter in which he ceases to be an Employee.

         6.3     Death.  If a Participant ceases to be an Employee by reason of
his death, or if a Participant dies after ceasing to be an Employee but before
his Plan Accounts have been distributed, the Company shall pay to the
Participant's estate the amounts credited to the Participant's Plan Accounts in
one lump sum as of the first day of the first calendar quarter following the
calendar quarter in which the Participant's death occurred.

         6.4     Change in Control.  If a Change in Control of the Company
occurs, each Participant's Plan Accounts shall be paid to him in one lump sum
as of the day next following the date on which such Change in Control occurred
and the Plan shall thereupon terminate.

         6.5     Form of Payment.  Payments with respect to all Plan Accounts
shall be made in cash.


                                   SECTION 7

                           ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         7.1     Appointment of Committee.  The general administration of the
Plan and the responsibility for carrying out its provisions shall be placed in
a Committee of such number of members as may be fixed by the Company who shall
be appointed from time to time by and serve at the pleasure of the Company.
Any person who is appointed as a member of the Committee shall signify his
acceptance by filing a written acceptance with the Company.  A member of the
Committee may resign by delivering his written resignation to the Company and
such resignation shall become effective upon the date specified therein or the
date of receipt, whichever is later.

         7.2     Compensation of Committee.  The members of the Committee shall
not receive compensation for their services as such, and, except as required by
law, no bond or other security need be required of them in such capacity in any
jurisdiction.

         7.3     Rules of Plan.  Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the
Committee may, from time to time, establish rules for the administration of the
Plan and the transaction of its business.  The Committee may correct errors,
however arising, and, as far as possible, adjust any benefit payments
accordingly.  The determination of the Committee as to the interpretation of
the provisions of the Plan or any disputed question shall be conclusive upon
all interested parties.

         7.4     Agents and Employees.  The Committee may authorize one or more
agents to execute or deliver any instrument.  The Committee may appoint or
employ such agents, counsel





                                       9
<PAGE>   13
(including counsel of any Affiliated Employer), auditors (including auditors of
any Affiliated Employer), clerical help and actuaries as in the Committee's
judgment may seem reasonable or necessary for the proper administration of the
Plan.

         7.5     Records.  The Committee shall maintain accounts showing the
fiscal transactions of the Plan and shall keep, in convenient form, such data
as may be necessary for valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Plan.
The Committee shall prepare and submit annually to the Company a report setting
forth the amount of contributions required to be made to the Plan and in
conformity with applicable law, showing in reasonable detail the assets and
liabilities of the Plan, and giving a brief account of the operation of the
Plan for each Plan Year.

         7.6     Delegation of Authority.  With the consent of the Company the
Committee may, by resolution, delegate to any person or persons any or all of
its rights and duties hereunder.  Any such delegation shall be valid and
binding on all persons, and the person or persons to whom authority has been
delegated shall, upon written acceptance of such authority, have full power to
act in all matters so delegated until the authority expires by its terms or is
revoked by the Committee.

         7.7     Eligibility.  The members of the Committee shall not be
precluded from becoming Participants in the Plan if they are otherwise
eligible.

         7.8     Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify each member of
the Committee for all expenses and liabilities (including reasonable attorney's
fees) arising out of the administration of the Plan, other than any expenses or
liabilities resulting from the Committee's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  The foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition to any
other rights to which the members of the Committee may be entitled as a matter
of law.


                                   SECTION 8

                               FUNDING OBLIGATION

         The Company shall have no obligation to fund, either by the purchase
of common shares of the Company or the investment in any account or by any
other means, its obligation to Participants hereunder.  If, however, the
Company does elect to allocate assets to provide for any such obligation, the
assets allocated for such purpose shall be assets of the Company subject to
claims against the Company, including claims of the Company's creditors, to the
same extent as are other corporate assets, and the Participants shall have no
right or claim against the assets so allocated, other than as general creditors
of the Company.

                                   SECTION 9

                           AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         The Company may without the consent of any Participant or Beneficiary
amend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided that no amendment shall be
made or act of termination taken which divests any Participant of the right to
receive payments under the Plan with respect to amounts theretofore credited to
the Participant's Plan Accounts.


                                   SECTION 10

                           NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS

         No Participant or Beneficiary shall commute, encumber, pledge or
dispose of the right to receive the payments required to be made by the Company
hereunder, which payments and the right to receive them are expressly declared
to be nonassignable and nontransferable.  In the event of any attempt to assign
or transfer any such payments or the right to receive them, the Company shall
have no further obligation to make any payments otherwise required of it
hereunder.


                                   SECTION 11

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1    Adjustments in Common Shares.  If there is any change in the
common shares of the Company through the declaration of a stock dividend or a
stock split or through a recapitalization resulting in a stock split, or a
combination or a change of shares, the number of shares assumed to have been
purchased hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted.

         11.2    Valuation of Common Shares.  Whenever the common shares of the
Company are to be valued for the purpose of determining the amount to be
distributed from a Participant's Company Matching Account, the value of each
such share shall be taken as the closing price of a common share of the Company
on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day preceding the date as
of which the distribution is made.

         11.3    Delegation.  Any matter or thing to be done by the Company
shall be done by its Board of Directors or the Executive Committee thereof,
except that, from time to time, the Board or Executive Committee by resolution
may delegate to any person or committee certain of its rights and duties
hereunder.  Any such delegation shall be valid and binding on all persons and
the person or committee to whom or which authority is delegated shall have full
power to act in all matters so delegated until the authority expires by its
terms or is revoked by the Board or the Executive Committee, as the case may
be.

         11.4    Applicable Law.  The Plan shall be governed by applicable
federal law and, to the extent not preempted by applicable federal law, the
laws of the State of Ohio.

         11.5    Separability of Provisions.  If any provision of the Plan is
held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced
as if such provision had not been included.

         11.6    Headings.  Headings used throughout the Plan are for
convenience only and shall not be given legal significance.

         11.7    Counterparts.  The Plan may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.  All counterparts
shall constitute one and the same instrument, which shall be sufficiently
evidenced by any one thereof.

immediately available funds to an account designated by the Seller (or other
means acceptable to the Seller).

                          (b)  Warrants.  Parent shall issue to the Seller

the Chief Financial Officer of the Seller and in any event not to exceed
$6,100,000.

                 Section 2.3  Post-Closing Adjustment.

                          (a)  Within 45 days following the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall provide to the Seller an unaudited combined balance sheet of
the Footwear Business as of the Closing Date, but without giving effect to the
Closing, prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles and on a basis consistent with the Footwear Business
Balance Sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet").  The Seller shall cooperate fully
in good faith with the Purchaser in the preparation of the Closing Balance
Sheet, such cooperation to include, without limitation, full access to the
books and records of the Seller Related to the Footwear Business for such
purpose.

                          (b)  The Seller shall have 25 days following receipt
of the Closing Balance Sheet to notify the Purchaser of any dispute with the
Closing Balance Sheet.  In order to facilitate the Seller's review of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Purchaser shall cooperate fully in good faith with
the Seller, such cooperation to include, without limitation, full access to the
Purchaser's work papers relating to the Closing Balance Sheet.  If the Seller
fails to notify the Purchaser of any such dispute within such 25-day period,
or, prior to the expiration thereof, notifies the Purchaser in writing that no
such dispute exists, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed to be the "Final
Balance Sheet."  In the event that the Seller shall so notify the Purchaser of
any dispute, the Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable.  In the event that the Seller
and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute within 20 days of the
Seller's delivery of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the New
York office of KPMG Peat Marwick or another accounting firm acceptable to the
Seller and the Purchaser (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), with any fees
being paid 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Purchaser.  The determination of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding.  The Closing
Balance Sheet, as it may be modified by resolution of any disputes by the
Seller and the Purchaser or by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant hereto,
shall be the "Final Bal-





                                       16

ance Sheet."

                          (c)  In the event that the Closing Net Worth (as
defined below) as reflected on the Final Balance Sheet is less than $247.8
million (the "Required Net Worth"), then the Seller shall transfer to the
Purchaser a cash amount equal to the amount by which the Closing Net Worth is
less than the Required Net Worth.  In the event that the Closing Net Worth is
more than the Required Net Worth, then the Purchaser shall transfer to the
Seller a cash amount equal to the amount by which the Closing Net Worth is more
than the Required Net Worth.  Such transfers shall be made to the account
designated in writing for such purpose within two business days after delivery
of the Final Balance Sheet by wire transfer in immediately available funds of
the amount of such differences as determined pursuant to the preceding
sentences, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of
payment calculated based on the thirty-day AA composite commercial paper rate
(as last published by the Federal Reserve prior to the Closing Date).  For
purposes of this Section 2.3, "Closing Net Worth" shall equal the amount,
determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, by which the total Acquired Assets on
the Final Balance Sheet (excluding for such purposes the rights relating to the
Severance Trusts), plus the cash on hand in the stores included in the Acquired
Assets at the time of the Closing, exceed the total Assumed Liabilities on the
Final Balance Sheet.

The Seller and each of the Footwear Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be

heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the charter
and regulations or comparable organizational documents, each as amended to

regulations are in full force and effect.  Neither the Seller nor any of the
Footwear Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its charter,

Footwear Business.  All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Footwear Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, and such shares are owned by the Seller or its nominees free and
clear of any liens, claims, charges, security interests, encumbrances or other
rights of third parties ("Liens").  Upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Purchaser will acquire all of the Seller's and its
nominees' interests in the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Transferred Subsidiary, free and clear of any adverse claims (within the
meaning of Section 8-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the
State of New York).

Business consist, and on the Closing Date will consist, of items of a quantity
and quality historically useable or saleable in the ordinary course of the
Footwear Business consistent with past practice.  The inventories included in
the Footwear Business are reflected on the Footwear Business Balance Sheet and
in the books and records of the Seller in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with past practice, with
inventory recorded at a lower of cost (determined on a LIFO basis) or market.

                          (d)  Except as set forth in Section 3.6(d) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, on the Closing Date neither the Seller nor any of
the Retained Subsidiaries will use in the conduct of its business or own or
have rights to use any assets or property, whether tangible, intangible or

agreements with suppliers entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and (v) Liens listed in Section 3.6(e) of the

the United States Internal Revenue Service (the "Service"), and the Seller is
not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter.  Neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that

either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which
would have a material adverse effect on the Seller.  Neither the Seller nor any
ERISA Affiliate has contributed or been required to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan (as defined in ERISA).

                                   ARTICLE IV

           REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND THE PURCHASER

                 Parent and the Purchaser jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Seller as follows:

                 Section 4.1  Organization.  Each of Parent and the Purchaser
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted except where the failure to be so organized, existing
and in good standing or to have such power and authority would not have a
"material adverse effect on Parent" (as defined





                                       36
<PAGE>   45

below).  Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be
so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not in the aggregate
have a material adverse effect on Parent.  Parent has heretofore made available
to the Seller a complete and correct copy of the charter and by-laws, each as
amended to date, of Parent and the Purchaser.  Such charters and by-laws are in
full force and effect.  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any provision of its charter, by-laws or comparable organizational
documents, except for such violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Parent.  As used in this
Agreement, any reference to any event, change or effect having a "material
adverse effect on Parent" means such event, change or effect which is
materially adverse to (A) the business, properties, assets, results of
operations or financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) the ability of Parent and the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                 Section 4.2  Capitalization.  As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of Parent consists of:  (i) 100,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock of which, as of December 31, 1994, 34,608,545 shares were
issued and outstanding and no shares were held in treasury, and (ii) 25,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of which no shares were
issued and outstanding or held in treasury.  Since December 31, 1994 and prior
to the date hereof, no shares of Parent Common Stock have been issued except
issuances of shares upon exercise of employee stock options.  All the
outstanding shares of Parent's capital stock are, and all of (i) the Parent
Warrants which are to be issued pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the shares
of Parent Common Stock which will be issuable upon exercise of the Parent
Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
in the case of the Parent Warrants, and the Warrant Agreement or the terms of
the Parent Warrants, in the case of the shares of Parent Common Stock which
will be issuable upon exercise of the Parent Warrants, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and





                                       37
<PAGE>   46

non-assessable and free of any Liens (except Permitted Liens) and any
preemptive rights in respect thereto.

                 Section 4.3  Authority.  Each of Parent and the Purchaser has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Purchaser Documents (to the extent it will be a party
thereto) and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Purchaser
Documents by Parent and the Purchaser (to the extent it will be a party
thereto) and the consummation by Parent and the Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by the Boards of
Directors of Parent and the Purchaser and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent and the Purchaser are necessary to authorize this Agreement and
the Purchaser Documents (to the extent it will be a party thereto) or for
Parent and the Purchaser to consummate the transactions so contemplated.  This
Agreement has been, and each of the Purchaser Documents will be, duly executed
and delivered by Parent and the Purchaser (to the extent it will be a party
thereto) and constitutes or (to the extent such agreement is not being entered
into as of the date hereof) will constitute a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and the Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and the Purchaser in
accordance with its terms.

                 Section 4.4  Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

                          (a)  Except as set forth in Section 4.4(a) of the
disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Seller on or prior to the date
hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), and except for such filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under, and
other applicable requirements of, the HSR Act, neither the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement by Parent or the Purchaser nor the
consummation by either of them of the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the Purchaser Documents nor compliance by Parent or the Purchaser with any of
the provisions hereof or thereof will (i) conflict with or result in any breach
of any provision of the charter or by-laws of Parent or the Purchaser, (ii)
require any filing by Parent or its Subsidiaries with, or any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity to be obtained
by





                                       38
<PAGE>   47

Parent or its Subsidiaries (except where the failure to obtain such permits,
authorizations, consents or approvals or to make such filings would not have a
material adverse effect on Parent), (iii) result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement, franchise, permit, concession
or other instrument, obligation, understanding, commitment or other arrangement
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
or any of their properties or assets may be bound or affected, or (iv) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clauses
(iii) or (iv), for violations, breaches or defaults which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Parent.

                          (b)  Except as set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement, franchise, permit, concession
or other instrument, obligation, understanding, commitment or other arrangement
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
or any of their properties or assets may be bound or affected, except for any
such conflicts, defaults or violations which have not had and are not likely to
have a material adverse effect on Parent.

                 Section 4.5  SEC Reports and Financial Statements.  Parent has
timely filed with the SEC, and has heretofore made available to the Seller true
and complete copies of, all forms, reports and other documents required to be
filed by it since January 1, 1992 under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act
(as such documents have been amended since the time of their filing,
collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents").  The Parent SEC Documents,
including, without limitation, any financial statements or schedules included
therein, at the time filed, (a) did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the





                                       39
<PAGE>   48

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (b) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be.
The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly
present in all material respects (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments which are not material in
amount) the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.

                 Section 4.6  Litigation.  Except as set forth in Section 4.6
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding

is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree, domestic or
foreign, which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent or relates to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  For the purposes of this
Agreement, "Parent's Knowledge" shall mean the actual knowledge, after
reasonable inquiry, of the officers of Parent listed in Section 4.6 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule.

                 Section 4.7  Absence of Certain Changes or Events; Material

provisions of any Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party.

Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, or, to
Parent's Knowledge, is under investigation with respect to or has been given
notice or been charged by any Governmental Entity with any violation of, any
law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment (including,
without limitation, any applicable environmental law, ordinance or regulation)
of any Governmental Entity, except for violations which, in the aggregate, do
not have a material adverse effect on Parent.

                          (a)  From time to time, each of the parties hereto
will execute and deliver such further instruments and will take such other
actions as Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, may reasonably request in order to
effectuate the purposes of this Agreement and to carry out the terms hereof;
provided, however, that the Seller shall not agree to amend or otherwise modify
any Contract constituting a part of the Acquired Assets in connection with the
obtaining of any such consent in any manner which would place any additional
restraints or requirements on the Purchaser or Parent or which would increase
any of the payments to be made by the Purchaser thereunder without the written
consent of the Purchaser.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at
any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, (i) at the request of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the Seller and its Subsidiaries will execute
and deliver such other instruments of transfer, and take such action as Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries may reasonably deem necessary in order to
effectively





                                       46
<PAGE>   55

transfer, convey and assign to the Purchaser all of the Acquired Assets, to put
the Purchaser in actual possession and operating control thereof and to permit
the Purchaser to exercise all rights with respect thereto (including, without
limitation, rights under Contracts and other arrangements as to which the
consent of any third party to the transfer thereof shall not have previously
been obtained) and to properly assume and discharge the related Assumed
Liabilities, and (ii) at the request of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
the Purchaser, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries will execute and
deliver such other instruments and agreements, and take such action, as the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries may reasonably deem necessary in order
effectively to assume from the Seller all of the Assumed Liabilities and to
confirm the Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Retained Assets.

                          (b)  The Seller will use all reasonable efforts and
Parent will reasonably cooperate with the Seller to obtain any consents
required to transfer and assign to the Purchaser all Contracts, Licenses and
other rights of any nature whatsoever relating to or constituting a part of the
Acquired Assets, it being understood that neither the Seller nor Parent shall
be obligated to make payments to third parties in order to obtain consents.  In
the event and to the extent that at the Closing the Seller is unable to obtain
any such required consents, (i) the Seller shall continue to be bound thereby,
(ii) the Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge fully all of the
obligations of such entity thereunder from and after the Closing Date, and
(iii) the Seller shall, for a period continuing through December 31, 1995,
continue to use all reasonable efforts to obtain such consent at the earliest
practicable date following the Closing Date.  The Seller shall, without further
consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to the Purchaser promptly all
monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such performance.
The Seller shall exercise or exploit the rights and options under all such
Contracts, Licenses and other rights and commitments referred to in this
Sections 6.3(b) only as reasonably directed in writing by the Purchaser and at
the Purchaser's expense and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the
Purchaser against any Third-Party Claims (as defined in Section 7.1(b)) arising
out of, resulting from or relating to any actions taken by the Seller or its
Subsidiaries in con-





                                       47
<PAGE>   56

nection with such Contracts, Licenses and other rights and commitments which
the Purchaser did not so direct.  Except with respect to the exercise or
exploitation of the rights and options under the non-assignable Contracts,
Licenses and other rights and commitments as contemplated under this Section
6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c), the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have no
obligation hereunder to pay, perform or discharge any obligations under any
such non-assignable Contract, License or other right relating to the Acquired
Assets after the Closing, and Parent and the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller and its Subsidiaries from any Third-Party Claims relating
thereto and from Third-Party Claims arising out of, resulting from or relating
to any actions taken by the Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with such
Contracts, Licenses and other rights and commitments which the Purchaser
directed the Seller or its Subsidiaries to take or which were reasonably taken
if directions were requested by the Seller in writing and not forthcoming from
Parent or the Purchaser within a reasonable period of time.  If and when any
such consent shall be obtained or such Contract, License or other right shall
otherwise become assignable, the Seller or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall promptly assign all its rights and obligations thereunder to the
Purchaser without payment of further consideration and the Purchaser shall,
without the payment of any further consideration therefor, assume such rights
and obligations.

                          (c)  In the event that (i) any landlord under any of
the store leases constituting Contracts takes legal action alleging that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a breach of such lease
or (ii) as of December 31, 1995, the Seller shall have failed to obtain and
provide to the Purchaser any required consents to the assignment to the
Purchaser of any of such store leases, the Purchaser may elect by written
notice to the Seller, which in the case of clause (ii) shall be provided not
later than January 15, 1996, to terminate the operating arrangement provided
for in Section 6.2(b) with respect to any or all such leases and vacate any or
all such stores within a commercially reasonable period thereafter.  In the
event that the Purchaser makes any such election, such termination and
agreement to vacate shall become effective on the tenth business day following
the receipt by the Seller of such





                                       48
<PAGE>   57

notice other than as to any such stores for which the Seller provides a
satisfactory undertaking to Parent and the Purchaser to indemnify and hold
Parent and the Purchaser harmless from any damages or other costs, including
without limitation any litigation costs, relating to claims that the related
lease had been breached.  In the event that the Seller shall not provide such
undertaking as to any lease, the Seller shall retain responsibility for, and
indemnify Parent and the Purchaser against, any and all obligations or other
liabilities relating to such lease other than rental payments through the date
of the Purchaser's vacating of the related store and the Seller shall pay to
the Purchaser at the time of such vacating as liquidated damages (the
"Liquidated Damages") for the Seller's failure to deliver such lease as an
Acquired Asset an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the net asset value as
reflected on the most recently available balance sheet of the Footwear Business
of the leasehold improvements as in existence on the Closing Date relating to
such store not reasonably removable by the Purchaser when vacating such store
and (ii) the amount indicated as liquidated damages for such store in Section
6.3(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

                 Section 6.4  Use of Names.  Following the Closing Date and
except as otherwise provided in the Other Acquired Intellectual Property
Licenses and the Capezio License, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have the
sole and exclusive ownership of and right to use, as between Parent and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, each of the names included in the Acquired Intellectual Property
(the "Footwear Names").  The Footwear Names shall not include the Capezio Name
and the Corporate Names.  Following the Closing Date and except as otherwise
provided in the Intellectual Property Assignments or the Other Acquired
Intellectual Property Licenses, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and other affiliates to, take all action necessary to cease using,
and change as promptly as practicable (including by amending any charter
documents), any corporate or other names which are the same as or confusingly
similar to any of the Footwear Names.  Following the Closing, Parent and the
Purchaser shall take all action necessary to cause the Footwear Business to
cease the use of the Corporate Names.

                 Section 6.5  Non-Solicitation.

                          (a)  The Seller agrees that, for a period of two
years following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Parent
or the Purchaser, it will not, whether directly or indirectly, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, solicit the employment of or employ any
employee of the Footwear Business who has merchandising or management decision
making responsibilities who was an employee as of the date of this Agreement or
as of any date during the period of one year prior thereto unless such
employee's employment was terminated by the Purchaser or Parent.

                          (b)  Parent and the Purchaser agree that, for a
period of two years following the Closing Date, without the prior written
consent of the Seller, they will not, whether directly or indirectly, and will
not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, solicit the employment of or employ
any employee of the Seller who has merchandising or management decision making
responsibilities, who is not a Transferred Employee who accepted the
Purchaser's offer of employment and who was an employee as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any date during the period of one year prior thereto unless
such employee's employment was terminated by the Seller.

                 Section 6.6  Employee Matters; Employee Benefit Plans.

                          (a)(i) Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall offer employment to each person who is an active employee of
the Footwear Business immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) effective
as of the date on which a person who is an inactive employee of the Footwear
Business immediately prior to the Closing Date and who is ready to return in a
timely manner from sick leave, disability leave, furlough, layoff, approved
leave of absence or any other leave covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act
or any comparable applicable law (the "Return Date"), the Purchaser shall offer
employment to such employee (each such person, upon receipt of such offer, a
"Transferred Employee," and  all such persons, upon receipt of such offers,
"Transferred Employees").  The foregoing shall not be construed to require the
Purchaser to continue the employment of any Transferred





                                       50
<PAGE>   59

Employee for any period following the Closing Date or the applicable Return
Date, as the case may be.

                          (b)  As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary and appropriate to establish a
defined benefit pension plan and trust intended to qualify under Sections
401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively (the "Purchaser Pension Plan").  As
soon as practicable following receipt by the Seller of written evidence of the
establishment of the Purchaser Pension Plan and the trust thereunder by the
Purchaser (the "Transfer Date"), the Seller shall cause the trustees of the
Salaried Employees Pension Plan (the "Seller Pension Plan") to transfer from
the trust under the Seller Pension Plan to the trust under the Purchaser
Pension Plan an amount equal to the product of (i) the fair market value of all
of the assets held under the Seller Pension Plan as of the Closing Date and
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the present value of all
the accrued benefits under the Seller Pension Plan as of the Closing Date in
respect of all Transferred Employees and the denominator of which shall equal
the present value of all accrued benefits under the Seller Pension Plan as of
the Closing Date; provided, however, that the amount transferred shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect any appreciation or depreciation in the value of
the assets and any benefit distributions that occur between the Closing Date
and the last day of the calendar month which precedes the Transfer Date.  The
calculation of the amount to be transferred pursuant to this Section 6.6(b)
shall be determined on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the standards of
Section 414(l) of the Code, jointly by the certified actuary of the Seller
Pension Plan (the "Seller Actuary") and a certified actuary selected by the
Purchaser (the "Purchaser Actuary").  If the Seller Actuary and the Purchaser
Actuary cannot agree on the amount to be transferred hereunder, the dispute
shall be settled by a third-party certified actuarial firm mutually agreed
upon by the Purchaser Actuary and the Seller Actuary, with any fees being paid
50% by the Seller and 50% by the Purchaser.  The decision of the third-party
certified actuarial firm shall be final and binding on the parties.

                          (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Purchaser nor the Purchaser Pension Plan
shall be deemed to have





                                       51
<PAGE>   60

assumed any liability concerning the Seller Pension Plan until the date of
transfer of the amount pursuant to Section 6.6(b), at which time the Purchaser
Pension Plan shall assume all liabilities for the accrued benefits of the
Transferred Employees under the Seller Pension Plan.  All remaining liabilities
with respect to the Seller Pension Plan shall remain with the Seller.

                          (d)  The Purchaser and the Seller shall provide each
other with such records and information as may be necessary or appropriate to
carry out their obligations under Section 6.6(b) or for the purpose of
administration of the Purchaser Pension Plan, and shall cooperate in the filing
of documents required by the transfer of assets and liabilities described
therein.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.6 to the
contrary, no transfer of funds between the Seller Pension Plan and the
Purchaser Pension Plan shall occur until thirty-one days following the filing
of all required Forms 5310-A in connection therewith.

                 Section 6.7  Exclusivity.  Until the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the Seller will not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, agent or otherwise, initiate, solicit,
encourage, negotiate or discuss with any third party (including by way of
furnishing non-public information concerning the Seller or its businesses,
assets or properties), or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries
with respect to or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Transaction.  For purposes
hereof, the term "Competing Transaction" shall mean any proposal with respect
to the acquisition of any of the Acquired Assets other than as contemplated by
this Agreement.

                 Section 6.8  Fees and Expenses.  Whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, except as
otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

                 Section 6.9  Notification of Certain Matters.  The Seller
shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Seller, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence,
or non-occurrence, of which would be reasonably likely to cause (i) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in any
material respect and (b) any failure of the Seller, the Purchaser or Parent, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder in any material respect;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

                 Section 6.10  Settlements for Cash Collections and
Disbursements.  For each calendar month commencing with the month in which the
Closing Date occurs and continuing until reasonably determined by the parties
no longer to be necessary, the Purchaser and the Seller shall cause all cash
collections and cash disbursements received or made by the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Seller and its Subsidiaries or by the
Seller and its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries during the relevant month to be remitted or reimbursed, as the
case may be, to the party entitled to the benefit thereof as promptly as
possible but in any case within 15 days after the receipt thereof or request
for reimbursement thereof, as the case may be.

                 Section 6.11  Insurance.  The Seller will continue to carry
and maintain in full force and effect the insurance policies listed on Section
3.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or policies with comparable coverage,
to the Closing Date, and will reasonably cooperate with Parent in Parent's
efforts to obtain insurance coverage for the Footwear Business from and after
the Closing.

                 Section 6.12     Transition Services; Interim Leases.

                 (a)  Transition Services to Seller.  On the Closing Date, upon
the request of the Seller, the Seller and the Purchaser shall enter into a
Services Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6.12(a) (the
"Purchaser Services Agreement"), pursuant to which the Purchaser will agree to
provide to the Seller, at the Seller's election, certain data processing,
payroll, financial, tax, accounting, insurance, banking, cash management,
personnel, payables collection, employee benefits, management information
systems, communications and similar services (collectively, the "Purchaser
Services") presently being provided by the Footwear Business to the businesses
of the Seller other than the Footwear Business, in accordance with the terms
and for the time period set forth in the Purchaser Services Agreement.

                 (b)  Transition Services to the Purchaser.  On the Closing
Date, upon the request of the Purchaser, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
enter into a Services Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6.12(b)
(the "Seller Services Agree- ment"), pursuant to which the Seller will agree to
provide to the Purchaser, at the Purchaser's election, certain data processing,
payroll, financial, tax, accounting, insurance, banking, cash management,
personnel, payables collection, employee benefits, management information
systems, communications and similar services (collectively, the "Seller
Services") presently being provided by the Seller to the Footwear Business, in
accordance with the terms and for the time period set forth in the Seller
Services Agreement.

                 (c)  Interim Leases.  On the Closing Date, upon the request of
the Seller, the Seller and the Purchaser shall enter into Interim Lease
Agreements in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit 6.12(c) (the "Interim
Leases") for the lease and occupancy by the Seller of certain executive office
space in the headquarters building of the Footwear Business located at One
Eastwood Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio, and certain additional office space in New
York City in accordance with the terms and for the time periods set forth in
the respective Interim Leases.

                 Section 6.13  Purchase Price Allocation for Tax Purposes.
Pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder
and any analogous provisions of state, local or foreign law, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall prepare and file "asset acquisition statements" with the
Service and other taxing authorities as required by applicable law with respect
to the acquisition of the Acquired Assets and the non-competition agreement
provided for in Section 6.27.  The asset acquisition statements shall be filed
in the time and manner set forth in Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations thereunder, and any analogous provisions of state, local or foreign
law, and shall allocate the total consideration to be paid by the Purchaser
(including the Assumed Liabilities) to the Acquired Assets and the
non-competition agreement provided for in Section 6.27 in conformance with the
methods prescribed therein.  For these purposes, within 60 days following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a tentative
asset acquisition statement that shall be binding on the Seller unless the
Seller notifies the Purchaser within 60 days of its receipt of the tentative
asset acquisition statement that it disputes the allocations contained therein
and such notice sets forth in detail the nature of and basis for its dispute.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fair market value of the Parent Warrants to
be reflected in the tentative asset acquisition statement shall be calculated
based upon the average of the closing prices of the Parent Warrants on the
principal stock exchange or quotation system on which the Parent Warrants are
then listed or quoted for trading for the five trading days immediately
following the tenth trading day after the distribution of the Parent Warrants
by the Seller to its stockholders.  In the event that the Seller shall so
notify the Purchaser of any dispute, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable.  In
the event that the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any such
dispute within 30 days of the Seller's delivery of such notice, such dispute
shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, with any fees being paid
50% by the Seller and 50% by the Purchaser.  The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding.  The Purchaser and the
Seller shall be bound to and take positions on their respective Tax Returns
consistent with the final asset acquisition statements determined in compliance
with this Section 6.13.

                 6.14  Certain Environmental Matters.

                          (a) Parent and the Seller will jointly (i) promptly
arrange for "Phase I" investigations of a reasonable scope to be undertaken by
a firm of environmental consultants identified in Section 6.14(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the "Environmental Consultant") as to each of the
facilities identified in Section 6.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the
"Facilities"), and (ii) instruct the Environmental Consultant to consult with
both the Seller and Parent and to address its Phase I Report(s) to both the
Seller and Parent.  In the event that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Environmental Consultant, any of the Phase I investigations identifies as to
any Facility any condition, including off-site conditions, which requires
further investigation or which may reasonably likely require Remedial
Activities (as defined below) ("Identified Environmental Conditions"), Parent
and the Seller will jointly (i) promptly arrange for further reasonable
investigations, which may include, without limitation, soil and ground water
sampling and testing (provided, however, soil and ground water testing will not
be conducted on off-site properties), review of relevant files held by
Governmental Entities and discussions with representatives of Governmental
Entities, to be undertaken by the Environmental Consultant as to each such
Identified Environmental Condition ("Phase II Investigations"), and (ii)
instruct the Environmental Consultant to consult with both the Seller and
Parent and to address its Phase II Report(s), including laboratory reports, to
both the Seller and the Parent.  The Seller agrees to cooperate with and upon
reasonable notice to the Seller provide the Environmental Consultant and
representatives of Parent reasonable access to the Facilities and the Seller's
employees and representatives to conduct such investigations.  The parties
agree that the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the retention of
the Environmental Consultant, the environmental investigations and the
preparation of the environmental reports contemplated by this Section 6.14(a)
(exclusive of any legal fees and expenses incurred by Parent) shall be paid by
the Seller.  The parties agree to conduct the environmental investigations in a
timely, commercially reasonable and cost-effective manner and to use
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with or impairment of the
regular conduct of the Footwear Business, and to provide to the Seller and
Parent an opportunity to





                                       56
<PAGE>   65

comment on any plans for the sampling and testing of soil and ground water.

                          (b)  If the Phase I investigations or, if applicable,
any further investigations conducted by the Environmental Consultant reveal
Identified Environmental Conditions that would in the reasonable judgment of
the Environmental Consultant require Remedial Activities, the Environmental
Consultant shall develop an estimate of the reasonable aggregate most likely
costs and expenses (i.e., the most likely cost estimate for the Remedial
Activity or part thereof that reasonably may be incurred by a party to this
transaction) of such Remedial Activities (the "Remediation Estimate").  The
Environmental Consultant shall base the Remediation Estimate as appropriate on
requirements of Environmental Laws and what Governmental Entities of the States
within which the Facilities or off-site properties are located reasonably might
require.

                          (c)  With respect to the environmental investigation
contemplated herein, the Seller shall initiate contact with appropriate
Governmental Entities in any matter that involves a legal proceeding to which
the Seller is or expects imminently to become a party before such Governmental
Entity and which concerns or relates to the Seller's obligations or liabilities
arising from or related to Environmental Laws.  The Seller shall afford the
Environmental Consultant an opportunity to be present during such contacts with
Governmental Entities for the purpose of performing the environmental
investigation contemplated herein.  Except as may be required by law, the
Environmental Consultant and Parent shall not have independent contact or
communications with any such Governmental Entity without the prior consent of
the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                          (d)  In the event that the total Remediation Estimate
exceeds $10,000,000, the Seller shall have the right (the "Environmental
Right") to elect to reimburse Parent for the full amount of such excess
pursuant to Section 6.14(e); provided, however, in the event that the Seller
fails to exercise the Environmental Right, this Agreement may be terminated by
Parent in accordance with Section 9.1(e).  The Seller shall have the right to
exercise the Environmental Right during the





                                       57
<PAGE>   66

seven business day period following receipt by the Seller of the Remediation
Estimate by sending a notice by personal delivery or telecopy to Parent
pursuant to Section 10.3.

                          (e)  Subject to the terms and conditions of Section
7.8(c), upon receipt by the Seller of invoices for the costs of Remedial
Activities incurred by Parent in respect of Identified Environmental
Conditions, the Seller shall reimburse Parent for such costs; provided,
however, that Parent and the Seller agree that the first $2 million of costs
for such Remedial Activities shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Seller.
Parent agrees to conduct the Remedial Activities at any Facility in a
commercially reasonable and cost-effective manner.  Any contract for such
Remedial Activities in excess of $30,000 shall be put out for competitive
bidding.  Parent shall provide the Seller with prior notice and an opportunity
to comment on Parent's plans to implement Remedial Activities.

                          (f)  Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections
7.8 and 7.9, the Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the
Purchaser and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages and
reasonable expenses of any kind or character (whether or not known or asserted
prior to the date of this Agreement), including, without limitation, any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any claims or actions, whether or not resulting in any liability
("Environmental Loss") incurred by, imposed or asserted against any of them
arising or resulting from (i) any breach of the agreement to reimburse Parent
for the costs of implementing Remedial Activities as set forth in Section
6.14(e), and (ii) Third-Party Claims arising from or related to Identified
Environmental Conditions but exclusive of such claims arising from or related
to Parent's negligent or reckless or willful misconduct in the course of
implementation of Remedial Activities.

                          (g)  As used in this Section 6.14, the following
terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

                          (i)  "Environmental Law."  The term Environmental
         Law shall mean any law, statute, order,





                                       58
<PAGE>   67

         rule, regulation, ordinance or final judgment of any Governmental
         Entity and any binding judicial or administrative interpretation
         thereof, including any judicial or administrative order, consent
         decree or judgment, and any common law, relating to human health,
         occupational safety, pollution or the environment, including, without
         limitation, laws relating to emissions, discharges, releases, natural
         resource damages or otherwise relating to treatment, storage,
         disposal, generation, transport or shipment of Hazardous Materials, in
         each case as in effect as of the Closing Date, including Environmental

satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII, neither

deemed to have been amended or supplemented from the form in which it was
delivered on the date of this Agreement.

                 Section 6.16  Tax Returns.  The Purchaser agrees to prepare
IRS Form 5471 for the taxable year which includes the Closing Date, if
applicable, for any Transferred Subsidiaries on behalf of the Seller and the
Purchaser and to prepare all other required Tax Returns for any Transferred
Subsidiaries for the taxable year which includes but does not end on the
Closing Date in a manner consistent with applicable Tax laws.  Such Tax Returns
shall be submitted to the Seller for review at least 30 days prior to the due
date.  The Purchaser agrees to provide the Seller with copies of such Tax
Returns as filed.  The Seller will prepare all Tax Returns for any Transferred
Subsidiaries for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date on a basis
consistent with past practice.  The Purchaser will provide the Seller with
appropriate powers of attorney to enable the Seller to sign and file such
returns.  The Seller agrees to provide the Purchaser with copies of such Tax
Returns as filed.  Any disputes with respect to such Tax Returns shall be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, or such other independent expert
as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, whose determination shall be
binding on the parties.

                 Section 6.17  Section 338 Elections; Procedures.  In the event
that the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, elects to purchase the capital
stock of one or more of the Footwear Subsidiaries, each of which shall





                                       60
<PAGE>   69

become a Transferred Subsidiary, and to make the elections provided for in
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the Acquired Assets and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, then:

                          (a)  With respect to the Purchaser's acquisition of
the capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiaries hereunder and with respect to
the capital stock of any other corporation acquired by the Purchaser hereunder
that is a "target affiliate" of the Transferred Subsidiaries (as such term is
defined in section 338(h)(6) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) (a "Target Affiliate"), the Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly
make all available Section 338(h)(10) Elections in accordance with applicable
Tax laws of the United States and any state or other political subdivision
thereof and as set forth herein.  The Purchaser and the Seller agree to report
the transfers under this Agreement consistent with the Section 338 Elections,
and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by
applicable Tax laws pursuant to a Determination.

                          (b)  The Seller shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of all Section 338 Forms in accordance with applicable
Tax laws of the United States and of any state or other political subdivision
thereof and the terms of this Agreement.  The Purchaser shall execute and
deliver to the Seller such documents or forms as are requested by the Seller
and are required by any Tax laws of the United States and of any state or other
political subdivision thereof properly to complete the Section 338 Forms, at
least 20 days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms are required to be
filed.

                          (c)  The Purchaser and the Seller agree that they
shall use all reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement (the "Allocation
Agreement") as soon as practicable after the Closing Date concerning the
computation of the Modified Aggregate Deemed Sale Price (as defined under
applicable Treasury Regulations) of the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries
and any Target Affiliates and the allocation of such Modified Aggregate Deemed
Sale Price among such assets (including the non-competition covenant provided
for in Section 6.27 hereof), and the allocation of the Purchase Price among the
Acquired Assets other than the Transferred Subsidiaries





                                       61
<PAGE>   70

and any Target Affiliates.  In furtherance of this effort, the Purchaser and
the Seller agree that they shall use all reasonable efforts to agree on the
formula for allocating the Modified Aggregate Deemed Sale Price among each of
the Transferred Subsidiaries and each group of Acquired Assets before the
Closing (it being agreed and understood that such agreement is not a condition
to the Closing).  The Purchaser and the Seller agree that they shall use all
reasonable efforts to revise the Allocation Agreement to the extent necessary
no later than 60 days before the last date on which the Section 338(h)(10)
Election may be filed.  If 60 days before the last date on which the Section
338(h)(10) Election may be filed, the Purchaser and the Seller have not adopted
or revised the Allocation Agreement as described above, any disputed aspects of
the Allocation Agreement or such revision shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm (or such other independent valuation firm as may be mutually
agreed upon by the parties) before the last date on which the Section
338(h)(10) Election may be filed.  The costs, expenses and fees of the
Independent Accounting Firm (or any other agreed upon firm) shall be borne
equally by the Purchaser and the Seller.  The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
act in accordance with the allocations contained in the Allocation Agreement in
any relevant Tax Returns or similar filings.

                          (d)  The Seller reserves the right, on or prior to
the Closing Date, to cause any or all of the Acquired Assets to be transferred
to The Shops for Pappagallo Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Pappagallo"), or to a
newly-formed subsidiary of Pappagallo, which in such event would be a
Transferred Subsidiary (the "338(h) Subsidiary").  The Seller agrees to give
Parent not less than ten days' prior written notice of the details of any such
transfer and to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election in connection with such
Transferred Subsidiary.  Parent and the Purchaser agree to liquidate or merge
out of existence, or cause to be liquidated or merged out of existence, on or
prior to December 31, 1995, the 338(h) Subsidiary.

                 Section 6.18  Allocation of Certain Taxes.

                          (a)  The Purchaser and the Seller agree that if any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries is permitted but not required under applicable
state, local or foreign





                                       62

Purchaser and the Seller shall treat such day as the last day of a taxable
period.

                          (b)  Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning on or
before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date with respect to the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall be apportioned for purposes of Section
1.2(b)(ii)(B) based on actual operations of the Transferred Subsidiaries during
the portion of such period ending at the consummation of the Closing on the
Closing Date and the portion of such period beginning on the day following the
Closing Date; provided, however, that any Taxes (such as real estate taxes)
that are measured by the passage of time (rather than by reference to income,
profits or results of operations) shall be apportioned between the Seller and
the Purchaser based on the number of days elapsed in the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date and the number of days in the portion of such period
beginning on the day following the Closing Date.

                          (c)  Any disputes with respect to the allocation of
Taxes pursuant to this Section 6.18 shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm (or such other independent valuation firm as may be mutually
agreed upon by the parties) whose determination shall be binding on both
parties.

                 Section 6.19  Carrybacks.  The Purchaser shall be entitled to
all refunds or credits of Taxes resulting from a carryback of any loss or
similar tax benefit of a Transferred Subsidiary from a period beginning after
the Closing Date (a "Carryback Benefit").  The Seller agrees to cooperate with
the Purchaser to enable the Purchaser to receive any such Carryback Benefits.
The Seller shall be entitled to any and all other claims of the Seller, of any
Retained Subsidiary or of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries for refunds or
credits in connection with any Taxes arising in a period before the Closing
Date.  The Purchaser agrees to cooperate with the Seller to enable the Seller
to receive any such benefits.

                 Section 6.20  Cooperation.  The Purchaser and the Seller and
their respective affiliates shall cooperate in the preparation of all Tax
Returns relating in whole or in part to taxable periods ending on or before

Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, furnishing prior years'
Tax Returns or return preparation packages illustrating previous reporting

such Tax Returns, and furnishing such other information within such party's
possession requested by the party filing such Tax Returns as is relevant to
their preparation.  In the case of any state, local or foreign joint,
consolidated, combined, unitary or group relief system Tax Returns, such
cooperation shall also relate to any other taxable periods in which one party
could reasonably require the assistance of the other party in obtaining any
necessary information.

provided, however, that, in the event that counsel to Parent has determined in
good faith and provided to the Seller its written opinion to the effect that
(A) the filing of the Registration Statement or the compliance by Parent with
its disclosure obligations in connection with the Registration Statement would

<PAGE>   77

require the disclosure of material information which Parent has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential, or (B) Parent is unable to

financial statements contained therein) and to such other effects as may
reasonably be requested by the Seller, and (B) a letter dated such date from
the independent public accountants retained by Parent, addressed to the Seller,
stating that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that, in the opinion of such accountants, the financial
statements of Parent included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
or any amendment or supplement thereof, comply as to form with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Securities Act, and such letter shall
additionally cover such other financial matters in respect of the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus or any





                                       69

amendment or supplement thereof as the Seller may reasonably request.

                          (b)  The Seller agrees that, notwithstanding anything
in the Warrant Agreement to the contrary, (i) it will not dispose of the Parent
Warrants or any shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof
other than pursuant to a distribution in full to its stockholders following the

event that the Registration Statement has not been declared effective prior to
the first anniversary of the written request of the Seller pursuant to Section
6.26(a), or in the event that the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
has not been maintained for a period of 180 consecutive calendar days, the
Seller will be free to dispose of the Parent Warrants or any shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof in any lawful manner, and (ii) the
Parent Warrants and any shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon exercise
thereof will contain a legend regarding such transfer restriction, to the
extent such restriction remains in effect, and the unregistered status of such
securities until such time as the Registration Statement has been declared

occurrence of a Delay Period or the happening of any event as a result of which
the Prospectus as then in effect includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, to cease using the Prospectus until it is

Statement, other than as to inaccuracies or omissions which relate solely to
information provided to Parent by the Seller in respect of the Seller or the
Footwear Business, as to which the Seller will indemnify and hold harmless
Parent.

                          (a)  For a period of two years following the Closing
Date, the Seller hereby covenants and agrees that it will not, and it will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, through officers,
directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, other business arrangements or
otherwise, (i) manufacture, import, market, sell, distribute, provide, promote,
develop, license or sublicense, except for the Capezio License, in any manner
whatsoever, any women's footwear on either a wholesale or retail basis (a
"Competitive Business"), or (ii) own an interest in, manage, operate, join,
control, or participate in or be connected with, as a partner, stockholder,
consultant or otherwise, any corporation, partnership, firm, association or
other entity that engages in a Competitive Business; provided, however, that
the Seller shall have the right to own up to 5% of any class of equity
securities of a publicly traded company.

                          (b)  Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.5(a) to
the contrary, the Seller shall not be deemed to have violated the restrictions
contained in Section 6.5(a) in the event that (i) the Seller manufactures,
imports, markets or sells women's footwear as an accessory item in the Seller's
retail clothing stores and less than 25% of the revenues of the Seller from
each store in which such footwear is sold are derived from such footwear sales,
or (ii) as a result of any acquisition, merger or other business combination
with a third party, the Seller or the surviving entity in such transaction
becomes engaged in a Competitive Business as a result of such third party's
business activities.

                          (c)  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Section 6.27, in whole or by virtue of the following sentence
in part, shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
of this Section 6.27 or of any other provision of this Agreement, all of which
shall to the full extent consistent with applicable law continue in full force
and effect.  In addition, if any provision of Section 6.27(a) shall be adjudged
to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or
subject, the parties intend that such provision shall be deemed modified to the
minimum degree necessary to make such provision valid and





                                       72

enforceable under applicable law and that such modified provision shall
thereafter be enforced to the fullest extent possible.

         there is an arguable defense to such Third-Party Claim, such
         proceeding prior to any judgment or decision thereon.

                          (f)  Claim Notice.  The term "Claim Notice" shall

                                       77
<PAGE>   86

                          (b)  Late Delivery of Claim Notice.  If, in the case
of a Third-Party Claim, a Claim Notice is not given by the Indemnitee within
the Notice Period as set forth in Section 7.4(a), the Indemnitee shall
nevertheless be entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII:

                                  (i)  if the Indemnitee can establish that the
         time elapsed between the end of the Notice Period and the giving of
         the Claim Notice is reasonable; and

                                  (ii)  to the extent that the Indemnitee can
         establish that the Indemnitor has not been prejudiced by such time
         elapsed.

                          (c)  Paid or Settled Claims.  If a Claim Notice is
not given by the Indemnitee prior to the payment or settlement of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified under this Article
VII only to the extent that the Indemnitee can establish that the Indemnitor
has not been prejudiced by such payment or settlement.

                 Section 7.5  Defense of Claims.  Upon receipt of a Claim
Notice from an Indemnitee with respect to any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor
may assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnitee and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in
such defense.  The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any action or claim and to participate in the defense thereof, provided that
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee shall be at the
expense of the Indemnitor only if such counsel is retained pursuant to either
of the following two sentences or if the employment of such counsel has been
specifically authorized by the Indemnitor.  If the Indemnitor does not notify
the Indemnitee within sixty days after receipt of the Claim Notice that it
elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
defend the claim with counsel of its choosing reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitor, subject to the right of the Indemnitor to assume the defense of any
claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.5, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ sepa-





                                       78
<PAGE>   87

rate counsel if, under applicable standards of professional conduct (as advised
by counsel to the Indemnitee), a conflict of interest on any issue between the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor exists in respect of a Third-Party Claim.  The
Indemnitee shall send a written notice to the Indemnitor of any proposed
settlement of any claim, which settlement the Indemnitor may reject, in its
reasonable judgment, within thirty days of receipt of such notice.  Failure to
reject such notice within such thirty day period shall be deemed an acceptance
of such notice.

                 Section 7.6  Access and Cooperation.  After the Closing Date,
Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand and the Seller on the other hand,
shall (i) each cooperate fully with the others as to all Third-Party Claims,
shall make available to the others, as reasonably requested, all information,
records and documents relating to all Third-Party Claims and shall preserve all
such information, records and documents until the termination of any
Third-Party Claim and (ii) make available to the others, as reasonably
requested, personnel (including technical and scientific), agents and other
representatives who are responsible for preparing or maintaining information,
records or other documents, or who may have particular knowledge with respect
to any Third-Party Claim.

                 Section 7.7  Assessment of Claims.  In the event that any of
the Losses for which an Indemnitor is responsible or allegedly responsible
pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3 are recoverable or potentially recoverable
against any third party at the time when payment is due hereunder, following
payment by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee for such Losses the Indemnitee
shall assign any and all rights that it may have to recover such Losses to the
Indemnitor, or, if such rights are not assignable under applicable law or
otherwise, the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to collect any and all
Losses on account thereof from such third party for the benefit of, and at the
expense and direction of, the Indemnitor.

                 Section 7.8  Limits on Indemnification.

                          (a)  Small Claims Threshold.  The Seller and the
other Indemnitees under Section 7.3 shall not be entitled to seek
indemnification, and Parent and the





                                       79
<PAGE>   88

other Indemnitees under Section 7.2 shall not be entitled to seek
indemnification, in respect of Third-Party Claims unless the amount of Losses
incurred by the Indemnitee in respect of such Third-Party Claims exceeds
$10,000, and then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek indemnification to
the full extent of such Losses.

                          (b)  Indemnity Basket.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Section 7.8(a), the Seller shall only be obligated to
indemnify Parent and the other Indemnitees under Sections 7.2(c) and 7.2(e) to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all Losses under Sections 7.2(c) and
7.2(e) exceeds $2 million, as reduced by any amounts paid by Parent pursuant to
the proviso in Section 6.14(e), and Parent and the Purchaser shall only be
obligated to indemnify the Seller and the other Indemnitees under Section
7.3(c) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Losses under Section
7.3(c) exceeds $2 million.

                          (c)  Limit of Liability.  Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Article VII to the contrary, (i) the Seller shall have no
reimbursement obligation under Section 6.14(e) or indemnification obligation
under Sections 6.14(f), 7.2(c) and 7.2(d) to the extent such costs and Losses
are not indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (after giving effect
to the application of Sections 7.8(a) and 7.8(b)) exceed $25 million in the
aggregate (the "Indemnification Cap"), as reduced by (x) any amounts not
reimbursed to the Seller pursuant to Section 7.8(c)(ii) and (y) any Liquidated
Damages paid under Section 6.3(c), and (ii) Parent and the Purchaser shall have
no reimbursement obligation under Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) in respect of
Assumed Liabilities or Third Party Claims to the extent that the existence of
such Assumed Liability or Third Party Claim would have constituted a breach of
a representation or warranty of the Seller at the Closing Date, the existence
of such Assumed Liability or Third Party Claim becomes known prior to the end
of the relevant survival period provided for in Section 7.9 and the amount of
such liability so unreimbursed, together with the amount of all such other
liabilities so unreimbursed, does not exceed the difference between $25,000,000
and the aggregate amount of reimbursement and indemnification theretofore
provided by the Seller pursuant to Section 6.14(e), 6.14(f), 7.2(c)





                                       80

or 7.2(d) and any Liquidated Damages paid pursuant to Section 6.3(c).

                 Section 7.9  Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement,
the Seller Documents or the Purchaser Documents, each and every one of which
representations and warranties is strictly relied upon by the parties to whom
they are made, shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force
and effect thereafter, regardless of any investigation made or to be made by or
on behalf of any party hereto, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the
first anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) August 31, 1996, except for the
representations and warranties of the Seller provided for in Section 3.12
(which shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and
effect thereafter, regardless of any investigation made or to be made by or on
behalf of any party hereto, for the relevant statutes of limitations including
any extension or waiver thereof regarding the filing of Tax Returns and the
payment of Taxes).  Except as set forth in this Section 7.9, after the end of
such period, an Indemnitor's obligation to an Indemnitee under this Article VII
(i) with respect to such representations and warranties and (ii) with respect
to environmental matters under Section 7.2(d) shall expire except with respect
to a matter set forth in a Claim Notice theretofore delivered to an Indemnitee;
provided, that the expiration of indemnification obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.9 shall in no way constitute an assumption by the Purchaser, Parent
or any of their respective successors or related Indemnitees of any liabilities
of the Seller other than Assumed Liabilities or a waiver by the Purchaser or
Parent or any of their respective successors of any other legal remedies they
may have to seek from the Seller or its successor reimbursement or contribution
for amounts paid or payable in respect of Retained Liabilities.  It is further
agreed that Parent's rights to indemnification set forth in Sections 7.2(a) and
7.2(b) and the Seller's rights to indemnification set forth in Sections 7.3(a)
and 7.3(b) shall remain in full force and effect indefinitely.

and warranties, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this
clause (i), the accuracy of any representation or warranty which speaks as of
the date of this Agreement or another date prior to the Closing Date shall be
determined solely as of the date of this Agreement or such other date and not
as of the Closing Date) does not and will not have a material adverse effect on
the Parent, and (ii) the representations and warranties of Parent and the
Purchaser contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.7 shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date hereof, and, except to the

<PAGE>   94

                          (b)  by either Parent or the Seller if the Closing
shall not have occurred before September 30, 1995 (unless the failure to so
consummate the Closing by such date shall be due to the action or failure to
act of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement, which action or failure
to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement);

                          (c)  by Parent if (i) there has been a breach on the
part of the Seller in the representations, warranties or covenants of the

satisfied on or prior to August 31, 1995, or (ii) the Seller takes any action
that would be prohibited by Section 6.7;

                          (d)  by the Seller if there has been a breach on the
part of Parent or the Purchaser in the representations, warranties or covenants
of Parent or the Purchaser set forth herein, or any failure on the part of
Parent to comply with its obligations hereunder, such that, in any such case,
any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.3 hereof
could not be satisfied on or prior to August 31, 1995; or

                          (e)  by Parent if the amount of the Remediation
Estimate exceeds $10,000,000 and the Seller fails to exercise the Environmental
Right pursuant to the terms of Section 6.14(d).

                 Section 9.2  Effect of Termination.  In the event of a
termination of this Agreement by either the Seller or Parent as provided in
Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Purchaser or the Seller or
their affiliates or respective officers or directors, other than the provisions
of Section 6.8; provided, however, that any such termination shall not relieve
any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

                         FORM OF LENSCRAFTERS GUARANTY


                 GUARANTY, dated _____________, 1995, by LensCrafters, Inc., an
Ohio corporation (the "Guarantor").

                             W I T N E S S E T H :

                 WHEREAS, 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Guarantor are directly owned by The United States Shoe Corporation, an Ohio
corporation (the "Seller");

                 WHEREAS, the Seller, Nine West Group Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and Footwear Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the "Purchaser"), are parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of March
15, 1995 (the "Agreement");

                 WHEREAS, the Seller will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (which
benefits are hereby acknowledged).

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce Parent and the Purchaser to
consummate the transactions consummated by the Agreement and in consideration
thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

                 1.       Definitions.  All terms capitalized herein which are
not otherwise defined shall have the meanings attributed thereto in the
Agreement.

                 2.       Guaranty of Obligations.  The Guarantor hereby
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor and
not merely as a surety, to Parent and the Purchaser and each of their permitted
successors and assigns (each, a "Beneficiary" and, collectively, the
"Beneficiaries"), as their respective interests may appear, the due and
punctual payment by the Seller of any and all amounts (without duplication)
that are or may become due and payable by the Seller to any Beneficiary
pursuant to Sections 6.3(c), 6.14(e), 6.14(f) and 7.2 of the Agreement, whether
such obligations now
<PAGE>   101

exist or arise hereafter, as and when the same shall become due and payable in
accordance with the terms thereof, including money damage claims and collection
costs (such obligations, "Obligations").  The Guarantor hereby further agrees
that if the Seller shall fail to pay or perform when due any of the
Obligations, the Guarantor will promptly pay or perform the same.  All payments
by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars.  This is a guaranty
of payment and performance, not collection.

                 This Guaranty and all covenants and agreements of the
Guarantor contained herein shall continue in full force and effect and shall
not be discharged until such time as all of the Obligations shall be paid and
performed in full and all of the agreements of the Guarantor hereunder shall
have been duly performed.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this Section
2 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason
any payment to any Beneficiary by or on behalf of the Seller, in respect of the
Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by such Beneficiary,
whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or
otherwise, and the Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify each Beneficiary on
demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses of counsel) incurred by such Beneficiary in connection
with its compliance with or reasonable resistance (if requested by the
Guarantor) to any such rescission or restoration.   Notwithstanding the
generality of the foregoing, if the Agreement shall be terminated as a result
of the rejection or disaffirmance thereof by any trustee, receiver, liquidator,
agent or other representative of the Seller or any of its respective properties
in any assignment for the benefit of creditors or in any bankruptcy,
insolvency, dissolution or similar proceeding, or the exercise of any of the
rights or remedies under the Agreement is stayed, enjoined or prohibited in any
such assignment or proceeding, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall
continue to the same extent as if the Agreement had not been so rejected or
disaffirmed and as if such exercise had not been so stayed, enjoined and
prohibited.  The Guarantor shall and does hereby waive all rights and benefits
that might accrue to it by reason of any such assignment or proceeding, and the
Guarantor agrees that it shall be liable for the full amount of the Obliga-

                                       2
<PAGE>   102

tions, irrespective of and without regard to any modification, limitation or
discharge of liability of the Seller that may result from or in connection with
any such assignment or proceeding.

                 3.       Nature of the Guarantor's Obligations.  The Guarantor
guarantees that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation
or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such
terms or the rights of the Beneficiaries with respect thereto.  The liability
of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be subject to any counterclaim,
setoff, deduction, release, recoupment or defense and shall remain in full
force and effect and shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of any lack of value, genuineness, validity, legality, regularity
or enforceability of the Agreement or any part of the Obligations or any
agreement or instrument relating to the Obligations, or any substitution,
release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the
Obligations, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable laws, statutes,
orders, rules, regulations, ordinances or judgments of any Governmental Entity
("Applicable Laws"), irrespective of any other circumstances whatsoever that
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 3 that the obligations
of the Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and
all circumstances.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
agreed that the occurrence or existence of any one or more of the following
shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, affect the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder:

                          (i)  at any time or from time to time, without notice
to the Guarantor, the time, manner or place for any performance of or
compliance with any of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance
or compliance shall be waived;

                          (ii)  any of the acts mentioned in any of the
provisions of the Agreement shall be done or omitted;

                          (iii)  any of the Obligations shall be modified,
supplemented, amended or compromised in any re-

                                       3
<PAGE>   103

spect, or any right under the Agreement shall be waived in whole or in part or
otherwise dealt with (except in accordance with Section 8.4 of the Agreement);

<PAGE>   104
                          (xiv)  any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with
respect to the Seller or any of its properties, or any action taken by any

                          (xv)  any pursuit of or failure by the Beneficiaries
to pursue remedies against the Seller for the Obligations.

                 4.       Waiver.  The Guarantor hereby waives expressly and
unconditionally (a) acceptance of this Guaranty and proof of reliance by any
Beneficiary hereon, (b) notice of any of the matters referred to above, (c) all
notices that may be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise, now or
hereinafter in effect, to preserve intact any right against the Guarantor,
including, without limitation, any demand for payment or performance,
diligence, presentment, protest and dishonor, proof of notice of nonpayment
under the Agreement, and notice of default or notice of any failure on the part
of the Seller to perform and comply with any covenant, agreement, term or
condition of the Agreement, (d) any requirement of any Beneficiary to take any
action whatsoever to exhaust any remedies under the Agreement and (e) any other
circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge, release or defense of a guarantor or surety, or that might otherwise
limit recourse against the Guarantor.

                 5.       Waiver of Subrogation.  The Guarantor irrevocably
waives, disclaims and relinquishes all claims against the Seller which the
Guarantor has or would have by virtue of having executed this Guaranty or
otherwise, whether at law or in equity, and, specifically including, but not
limited to, all rights of indemnity, reimbursement, contribution or
exoneration.

                 6.       Rights to Setoff.  In addition to all rights to
setoff against the moneys, securities or other property of the Guarantor given
to Beneficiaries by law, each Beneficiary and each affiliate thereof shall have
a right of setoff on account of amounts due by the Guarantor to such
Beneficiary against all moneys, securities and other property of the Guarantor
and the Seller now or hereafter in the possession of or on deposit with such





                                       5
<PAGE>   105
Beneficiary or affiliate, whether held in a general or special account or
deposit, or for safekeeping or otherwise; and every such right of setoff may be
exercised without demand upon or notice to the Guarantor, except that any
Beneficiary exercising such right of setoff shall promptly after the exercise
thereof give notice thereof to the Guarantor.  No right of setoff shall be
deemed to have been waived by any act or conduct on the part of any Beneficiary
or by any neglect to exercise such right of setoff, or by any delay in so
doing; and every right of setoff shall continue in full force and effect until
specifically waived or released by an instrument in writing executed by each
Beneficiary.

                 7.       Covenants.  The Guarantor hereby agrees and covenants
as follows:

                          (i)  at its own expense to promptly and duly execute
and deliver to each Beneficiary such further documents and assurances and to
take such further action as any Beneficiary may from time to time reasonably
request in order to more effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this
Guaranty and to establish and protect the rights and remedies created or
intended to be created in favor of the Beneficiaries hereunder;

                          (ii)  this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment or discharge of
any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the
Beneficiaries upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Seller
or the Guarantor or otherwise, as though such payment or discharge had not been
made;

                          (iii)  the Guarantor shall pay all expenses incurred
by the Beneficiaries in enforcing this Guaranty and the Obligations (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses); and

                          (iv)  the Guarantor assumes the responsibility for
being and keeping informed of the financial condition of the Seller and of all
other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations
which diligent inquiry would reveal, and agrees that no Beneficiary shall have
the duty to advise the Guarantor of information known to it regarding such
condition or any such circumstances.

                 8.       Representations.  The Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants to each Beneficiary as follows:

                          (i)  the Guarantor is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio and
has all requisite corporate power and authority to deliver this Guaranty and to
perform its obligations hereunder;

                          (ii)  the execution, delivery and performance by the
Guarantor of this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Guarantor, do not require any stockholder approval,
or approval or consent of any trustee or holders of any indebtedness or
obligations of the Guarantor except such as have been duly obtained, and none
of the execution, delivery or performance hereof contravenes any Applicable
Laws applicable to or binding on the Guarantor or the charter documents of the
Guarantor or contravenes the provisions of, or constitutes a default under, or
results in the creation of any Lien upon the property of the Guarantor under,
any Contract to which the Guarantor is a party or by which it or its properties
may be bound or affected;

                          (iii)  there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the Guarantor's knowledge, threatened, against or
affecting the Guarantor before any Governmental Entity which relates to the
Agreement or this Guaranty, or which, if adversely determined, would have a
material adverse effect on the Guarantor;

                          (iv)  the execution, delivery and performance by the
Guarantor of this Guaranty will not require any filing by the Guarantor with,
or any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, or exemption by, or the
giving of notice to, or the registration with or the taking of any other action
in respect of, any Governmental Entity, and no filing, recording or
registration in any public office or any other place is required on behalf of
the Guarantor to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Guaranty, except as has been duly obtained or effected;

                          (v)  the Seller owns directly 100% of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Guarantor; and





                                       7
<PAGE>   107

                          (vi)  this Guaranty has been duly executed and
delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar laws of general application affecting the rights
of creditors and by general equitable principles.

                 9.       Assignment.  This Guaranty shall be binding upon the
Guarantor and its permitted successors and assigns and shall inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Beneficiaries and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.  Each Beneficiary and its permitted
successors and assigns may assign this Guaranty or any of its rights and powers
hereunder (but only to any person to whom its respective rights under the
Agreement are assigned as permitted by the Agreement), and in such event the
assignee shall have the same rights and remedies as if originally named herein
in place of such Beneficiary.  The Guarantor may not assign this Guaranty or
any of its obligations, rights or powers hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Beneficiaries and may not transfer its assets substantially as
an entirety to any one or more entities without having first made provisions
for such entity or entities becoming a co-obligor of the Guarantor's obigations
under this Guaranty pursuant to an instrument in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Purchaser.

                 10.      Rights to Deal with the Seller.  At any time and from
time to time, without terminating, affecting or impairing the validity of this
Guaranty or the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder, any Beneficiary may
deal with the Seller in the same manner and as fully as if this Guaranty did
not exist and shall be entitled, among other things, to grant the Seller such
extension or extensions of time to perform, or to waive any obligation of the
Seller to perform, any act or acts as may to such Beneficiary be deemed
advisable, and no such waiver or extension shall in any way limit or otherwise
affect any of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

                 11.      Addresses for Notices.  All notices, demands or other
communications to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of
this Guaranty shall be given (i) if to Parent or the Purchaser, to the





                                       8
<PAGE>   108

address specified for them in Section 10.3 of the Agreement, or (ii) if to the
Guarantor, to LensCrafters, Inc., [address], [telephone], [telefax], in either
case in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

                 12.      No Waiver; Remedies; No Inquiry.  No failure on the
part of the Beneficiaries to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law, and
the rights of Beneficiaries herein are supplemental to, and not in lieu of, any
rights of Beneficiaries under the Agreement.  It is not and shall not be
necessary for Beneficiaries to inquire into the powers of the Seller or the
officers or agents acting or purporting to act on the Seller's behalf and any
obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be governed hereunder.

                 13.      Effectiveness; Continuing Guaranty.  The obligations
of the Guarantor hereunder shall become effective (the "Effective Date") upon,
and only upon, the consummation of any transaction which results either in the
Seller no longer owning greater than 80% of the outstanding capital stock of
the Guarantor or in the Guarantor disposing of its assets substantially as an
entirety to one or more entities.  This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and
shall remain in full force and effect commencing on the Effective Date and
continuing until payment and performance in full of the Obligations.

                 14.      Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each and all of the Beneficiaries, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given.

                 15.      Governing Law.  This Guaranty shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without
regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles.

                 16.      Headings.  Headings of the sections of this Guaranty
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Guaranty.

                 17.      Jurisdiction; Service: Etc.  The Guarantor hereby
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New
York located in the County of New York and the federal courts of the United
States of America located in such State and County in respect to the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions hereof, and hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof, that it is not subject thereto or that
such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in
said courts or that this Guaranty may not be enforced in or by said courts or
that its property is exempt or immune from execution, that the suit, action or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the suit,
action or proceeding is improper.  The Guarantor agrees that service of process
may be made upon it by service upon (the office of its General Counsel at
[address]) in any action, suit or proceeding against the Guarantor with respect
to this Guaranty or any of the documents referred to herein, and hereby
irrevocably designates and appoints the Seller as its agent upon which process
may be served in any action, suit or proceeding, it being understood that such
appointment and designation shall become effective without any further action
on the part of the Guarantor or the Seller.  Final judgment against the
Guarantor in any action, suit or proceeding shall conclusively determine the
fact and amount of indebtedness arising from such judgment, a certified copy of
which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of indebtedness
arising from such judgment.

                 18.      Severability.  Any provision of this Guaranty which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforce-ability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Guarantor hereby waives any provision
of law which renders any





                                       10
<PAGE>   110

provision of this Guaranty prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

                 19.      Entire Agreement.  This Guaranty constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Guarantor and the Beneficiaries with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

                 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to
be signed and delivered by its officers thereunto duly authorized as of the
date first above written.

                                                           Exhibit 2.1(b)(ii)(B)




                 WARRANT AGREEMENT dated as of ______ __, 1995, between Nine
West Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and [name of Warrant
Agent], a [New York banking] corporation, as Warrant Agent (the "Warrant
Agent").

                 WHEREAS, the Company proposes to issue warrants to purchase an
aggregate of 3,700,000 shares of its Common Stock, par value $.01 per share
(such 3,700,000 shares being hereinafter referred to as the "Shares" and where
appropriate such term shall also mean the other securities or property
purchasable upon the exercise of a warrant as provided for herein upon the
happening of certain events; such Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as
the "Common Stock;" and such warrants being hereinafter referred to as the
"Warrants" and the certificates evidencing the Warrants being hereinafter
referred to as the "Warrant Certificates"); and

                 WHEREAS, the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on
behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing so to act, in
connection with the issuance of Warrant Certificates and other matters as
provided herein;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                 SECTION 1.  Appointment of Warrant Agent.  The Company hereby
appoints the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with
the instructions set forth hereinafter in this Agreement, and the Warrant Agent
hereby accepts such appointment.

                 SECTION 2.  Form of Warrant Certificates.  The Warrant
Certificates to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in registered
form only and shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A
attached hereto.
<PAGE>   112

                 SECTION 3.  Execution of Warrant Certificates.  The Warrant
Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the
Board, Co-Chairman of the Board and President or a Vice President and by its
Secretary or an Assistant Secre- tary under its corporate seal.  Each such
signature upon the Warrant Certificates may be in the form of a facsimile
signature of the present or any future Chairman of the Board, Co-Chairman of
the Board and President, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary and
may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates and for
that purpose the Company may adopt and use the facsimile signature of any
person who shall have been Chairman of the Board, Co-Chairman of the Board and
President, a Vice President, Secretary or an Assistant Secretary
notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Warrant Certificates shall be
countersigned and delivered or disposed of he or she shall have ceased to hold
such office.  The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile thereof
and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant
Certificates.

                 In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any
of the Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such officer before the Warrant
Certificates so signed shall have been countersigned by the Warrant Agent
pursuant to Section 4, or disposed of by the Company, such Warrant Certificates
nevertheless may be countersigned and delivered or disposed of as though such
person had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Warrant
Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the
actual date of the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper
officer of the Company to sign such Warrant Certificate, although at the date
of the execution of this Warrant Agreement any such person was not such
officer.

                 Warrant Certificates shall be dated the date of
countersignature by the Warrant Agent pursuant to Section 4.

                 SECTION 4.  Registration and Countersignature.  Warrant
Certificates shall be manually countersigned by the Warrant Agent and shall not
be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned.  Warrant Certificates
distributed as provided in Section 11 shall be registered in the




                                       2
<PAGE>   113

names of the record holders of the Warrant Certificates to whom they are to be
distributed.

                 The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the
registered holder of a Warrant Certificate as the absolute owner thereof
(notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by
anyone), for the purpose of any exercise thereof and any distribution to the
holder thereof and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the
Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

                 SECTION 5.  Registration of Transfers and Exchanges.  The
Warrant Agent shall from time to time register the transfer of any outstanding
Warrant Certificates upon the records to be maintained by it for that purpose,
upon surrender thereof accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in one
of the forms of assignment appearing at the end of the form of the Warrant
Certificate attached as Exhibit A hereto, duly executed by the registered
holder or holders thereof or by the duly appointed legal representative thereof
or by a duly authorized attorney.  Upon any such registration of transfer, a
new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing in the aggregate a like
number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee and the surrendered
Warrant Certificate shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent.

                 Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at the option of the
holders thereof, when surrendered to the Warrant Agent at its office maintained
for the purpose of exchanging, transferring or exercising the Warrants in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, State of New York (the "Warrant
Agent Office"), for another Warrant Certificate or other Warrant Certificates
of like tenor and representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants.
Warrant Certificates surrendered for exchange, transfer or exercise shall be
cancelled by the Warrant Agent.  Warrant Certificates cancelled as provided in
this Section 5 shall then be disposed of by the Warrant Agent in a manner
satisfactory to the Company.

                 The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign, in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5 and of Section 4, the new
Warrant Certificates required pursuant to the provisions of this Section, and





                                       3
<PAGE>   114
for the purpose of any distribution of Warrant Certificates contemplated by
Section 11.

                 SECTION 6.  Duration and Exercise of Warrants.  (a)  The
Warrants shall expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on ____________, 200_
[date to be the date eight and one-half years following the Closing Date] (such
date of termination being herein referred to as the "Termination Date").  On
and after the date of this Agreement, each Warrant may be exercised on any
business day prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Termination Date.

                          (b)  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
including Section 11, on or after the date of this Agreement the holder of each
Warrant shall have the right to purchase from the Company (and the Company
shall issue and sell to such holder) one fully paid and non-assessable Share at
the initial exercise price of $35.50 (the "Exercise Price") upon the surrender
on any business day prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Termination
Date to the Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agent Office of the Warrant
Certificate evidencing such Warrant, with the form of election to purchase on
the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed, and upon payment of the Exercise
Price in lawful money of the United States of America or in the manner provided
in Section 6(c).  The Warrants evidenced by a Warrant Certificate shall be
exercisable prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Termination Date, at
the election of the registered holder thereof, either as an entirety or from
time to time for part of the number of Warrants specified in the Warrant
Certificate.  In the event that less than all of the Warrants evidenced by a
Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of Warrants are exercised at
any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Termination Date, a new
Warrant Certificate or Certificates will be issued for the remaining number of
Warrants evidenced by the Warrant Certificate so surrendered.  No adjustments
shall be made for any cash dividends on Shares issuable on the exercise of a
Warrant.

                          (c)  Upon any exercise of a Warrant, the holder
thereof may, at its option, instruct the Company, by written notice
accompanying the surrender of the Warrant Certificate evidencing the Warrant at
the time of such exercise, to apply to the payment of the Exercise





                                       4
<PAGE>   115
Price such number of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to such
holder upon such exercise as shall be specified in such notice, in which case
an amount equal to the excess of the aggregate current market price (as defined
in Section 11(c)) of such specified number of shares on the date of exercise
over the portion of the aggregate Exercise Price attributable to such shares
shall be deemed to have been paid to the Company and the number of shares
issuable upon such exercise shall be reduced by such specified number.

                          (d)  Subject to Section 7, upon such surrender of a
Warrant Certificate and payment of the Exercise Price, the Warrant Agent shall
cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the written order of the registered
holder of such Warrant Certificate and in such name or names as such registered
holder may designate, a certificate for the Share or Shares issuable upon the
exercise of the Warrant or Warrants evidenced by such Warrant Certificate.
Such certificate shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so
designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become the holder of
record of such Share or Shares as of the date of the surrender of such properly
completed and duly executed Warrant Certificate and the payment of the Exercise
Price.  The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign any required new
Warrant Certificate or Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Section
6 and of Section 5.

                 SECTION 7.  Payment of Taxes.  The Company will pay all
documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of Shares upon the
exercise of Warrants prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Termination
Date; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax
or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issuance of any Warrant Certificates or any certificates for Shares in a name
other than that of the registered holder of a Warrant Certificate surrendered
upon the exercise of a Warrant, and the Company shall not be required to issue
or deliver such Warrant Certificates or certificates for Shares unless or until
the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the
Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Company that such tax has been paid.

                 SECTION 8.  Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates.  In
case any Warrant Certificate shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Company may in its discretion issue, and the Warrant Agent shall countersign,
in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant
Certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost,
stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing
an equivalent number of Warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent of such mutilation, loss,
theft or destruction of such Warrant Certificate and indemnity or bond, if
requested, also reasonably satisfactory to them.  Applicants for such
substitute Warrant Certificates shall also comply with such other reasonable
regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the Company or the Warrant
Agent may prescribe.

                 SECTION 9.  Reservation of Shares.  The Company will at all
times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the
aggregate of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of
enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue Shares upon exercise of
Warrants, through the Termination Date, the number of Shares deliverable upon
the exercise of all outstanding Warrants, and the Transfer Agent for such
Common Stock is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to
reserve such number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock as shall
be required for such purpose.  The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement
on file with such Transfer Agent.  The Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably
authorized to requisition from time to time from such Transfer Agent stock
certificates issuable upon exercise of outstanding Warrants, and the Company
will supply such Transfer Agent with duly executed stock certificates for such
purpose.

                 Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
pursuant to Section 11 reducing the Exercise Price below the then par value of
the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the Company will take any
corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in
order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable Shares at the Exercise Price as so adjusted.

                 The Company represents, warrants and covenants that all Shares
issued upon exercise of the Warrants will, upon issuance in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, be fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear
from all liens, claims, charges, security interests, encumbrances or other
rights of third parties created by the Company with respect to the issuance
thereof.

                 SECTION 10.  Obtaining of Governmental Approvals and Stock
Exchange Listings.  The Company from time to time will (a) obtain and keep
effective any and all permits, consents and approvals of governmental agencies
and authorities and make any necessary filings under federal or state
securities laws, which may become requisite in connection with the issuance,
sale, transfer and delivery of the Warrant Certificates, the exercise of the
Warrants and the issuance, sale, transfer and delivery of the Shares issued
upon exercise of the Warrants, and (b) cause the Shares, upon their issuance
upon the exercise of Warrants, to be listed on the principal securities
exchange within the United States of America on which the Common Stock is then
listed.

                  SECTION 11.  Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of
Shares Purchasable or Number of Warrants. The Exercise Price, the number of
Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant and the number of Warrants
outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of
the events enumerated in this Section 11.

                          (a)     In case the Company shall at any time after
March 15, 1995 (i) declare a dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine the
outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issue any
shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock
(including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or
merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation), the Exercise Price
in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective
date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and/or the number
and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date shall be
proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Warrant exercised after such
time shall be





                                       7
<PAGE>   118
entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock
which, if such Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such date, he or
she would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue
of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification.  Such
adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall
occur.

                          (b)     In case the Company shall at any time after
the date of this Agreement fix a record date for the making of a distribution
to all holders of Common Stock (other than any such distribution made in a
dissolution or liquidation but including any such distribution made in
connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the
continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (including
securities, but excluding any distribution referred to in Section 11(a) and
regular periodic cash dividends publicly announced as such by the Board of
Directors of the Company), the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record
date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined in
Section 11(c)) on such record date, less the fair market value (as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company and described in a
statement filed with the Warrant Agent) of the portion of evidences of
indebtedness or assets to be so distributed applicable to one share of Common
Stock and the denominator of which shall be such current market price per share
of Common Stock; provided, however, that, if such fair market value equals or
exceeds such current market price, in lieu of such adjustment of the Exercise
Price, the Company shall cause to be distributed to each holder of any Warrants
the amount of such indebtedness or assets which would have been distributable
in respect of the Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of such Warrants.
Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is
fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise
Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in
effect if such record date had not been fixed.

                          (c)     For the purpose of any computation under
Section 6(c) or Section 11(b), the current market price per share of Common
Stock on any date shall be





                                       8
<PAGE>   119
deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices of the Common Stock for
the 30 consecutive trading days on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the
Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on such exchange, on the
principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or
admitted to trading, or if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to
trading on any national securities exchange, the average of the highest
reported bid and lowest reported asked prices for such 30 consecutive trading
day period as furnished by the National Association of Securities Dealers (the
"NASD") or similar organization if the NASD is no longer reporting such
information, commencing 45 trading days before such date.  The closing price
for each day shall be the last sale price regular way.

                          (d)     No adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be
required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at
least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason
of this Section 11(d) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this
Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of
a share, as the case may be.

                          (e)     In the event that at any time, as a result of
an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a), the holder of any Warrant
thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any share of capital
stock of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, thereafter the number
of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Warrant shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Shares
contained in Sections 11(a) and (b), and the provisions of Sections 6, 7, 9,
10, 11 and 12 with respect to the Shares shall apply on like terms to any such
other shares.

                          (f)     In any case in which this Section 11 shall
require that an adjustment in the Exercise Price be made effective as of a
record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the
occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any Warrant exercised
after such record date the Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if
any, issuable upon such





                                       9
<PAGE>   120
exercise over and above the Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if
any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Exercise Price in effect
prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to
such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's
right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event
requiring such adjustment.

                          (g)     Unless the Company shall have exercised its
election as provided in Section 11(h), upon each adjustment of the Exercise
Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(a) or (b), each
Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall
thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price, that
number of Shares (calculated to the nearest hundredth) obtained by (A)
multiplying the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant
immediately prior to such adjustment by the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment of the Exercise Price and (B) dividing the
product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such
adjustment of the Exercise Price.

                          (h)     The Company may elect on or after the date of
any adjustment of the Exercise Price to adjust the number of Warrants, in
substitution for an adjustment in the number of Shares purchasable upon the
exercise of a Warrant as provided in Section 11(g).  In such event, the Company
will cause to be distributed to registered holders of Warrant Certificates
either Warrant Certificates representing the additional Warrants issuable
pursuant to the adjustment, or substitute Warrant Certificates to replace all
outstanding Warrant Certificates.

                          (i)     In case of any capital reorganization of the
Company, or of any reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a change in
par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par
value, or as a result of subdivision or combination), or in the case of
consolidation of the Company with or the merger of the Company into any other
corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the
continuing corporation) or of the sale of the properties and assets of the
Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other corporation, each
Warrant shall after such reorganization, reclassification, consolida-





                                       10
<PAGE>   121
tion, merger or sale be exercisable, upon the terms and conditions specified in
this Agreement, for the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property to which a holder of the number of Shares purchasable (at the time of
such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale) upon
exercise of such Warrant would have been entitled upon such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale; and in any such case, if
necessary, the provisions set forth in this Section 11 with respect to the
rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Warrants shall be
appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be,
to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable
on the exercise of the Warrants.  The subdivision or combination of shares of
Common Stock at any time outstanding into a greater or lesser number of shares
shall not be deemed to be a reclassification of the Common Stock for the
purposes of this Section 11(i).  The Company shall not effect any such
consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to or simultaneously with the
consummation thereof the successor corporation (if other than the Company)
resulting from such consolidation or merger or the corporation purchasing such
assets or such other appropriate corporation or entity shall assume, by written
instrument executed and delivered to the Warrant Agent, the obligation to
deliver to the holder of each Warrant such shares of stock, securities or
assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holders may be
entitled to purchase and the other obligations under this Agreement.  If the
holders of Common Stock may elect to choose the kind or amount of stock or
other securities or property receivable upon consummation of such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, then for the
purpose of this Section 11(i) the kind and amount of stock or other securities
or property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger or sale shall be deemed to be whatever choice is made by
a plurality of the holders of Common Stock not affiliated with the Company or
the other party to such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger
or sale or, if no such holders exist, as specified by the Board of Directors of
the Company in good faith.  No dividends or other distributions declared or
made or interest amounts paid prior to the exercise of a Warrant with respect
to the stock or other securities or property receivable pursuant to this
Section 11(i) upon exercise





                                       11
<PAGE>   122
of a Warrant as a result of the consummation of a reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale shall be made or paid upon
exercise of a Warrant following the consummation of any such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale.

                 SECTION 12.  Fractional Warrants and Fractional Shares.  (a)
Notwithstanding an adjustment pursuant to Section 11(g) in the number of Shares
purchasable upon the exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall not be required
to issue fractions of Shares upon exercise of the Warrants or to distribute
certificates which evidence fractional Shares.  In lieu of fractional Shares,
there shall be paid to the registered holders of Warrant Certificates at the
time the Warrants represented thereby are exercised as herein provided an
amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a
share of Common Stock.  For purposes of this Section 12(a), the current market
value of a share of Common Stock shall be the closing price of a share of
Common Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(c)) for the trading day
immediately prior to the date of such exercise.

                 (b)  The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of
Warrants on any distribution of Warrants to holders of Warrant Certificates
pursuant to Section 11(h) or to distribute Warrant Certificates which evidence
fractional Warrants.  In lieu of such fractional Warrants there shall be paid
to the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates with regard to which such
fractional Warrants would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the
same fraction of the current market value of a full Warrant.  For purposes of
this Section 12(b), the current market value of a Warrant shall be the closing
price of the Warrant (as determined pursuant to Section 11(c)) for the trading
day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Warrant would have
been otherwise issuable.

                 SECTION 13.  Notice to Warrantholders.  (a)  Upon any
adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 11, the Company within 20
calendar days thereafter shall (i) cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent a
certificate of a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing
selected by the Board of Directors of the Company (who may be the regular
auditors of the





                                       12
<PAGE>   123
Company) setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting
forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which
such calculations are based and setting forth the number of Shares purchasable
upon exercise of a Warrant after such adjustment in the Exercise Price, which
certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the matters set
forth therein and (ii) cause to be given to each of the registered holders of
the Warrant Certificates at such holder's address appearing on the Warrant
register written notice of such adjustments by first-class mail, postage
prepaid.  Where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included
as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of
this Section 13.

                 (b)  In the event:

                          (i)    the Company shall fix a record date for the
making of a distribution to all holders of Common Stock (other than any such
distribution made in a dissolution or liquidation but including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Company is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets
(including securities, but excluding any distribution referred to in Section
11(a) and cash dividends or cash distributions); or

                          (ii)   of any capital reorganization of the Company,
or of any reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a change in par
value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or
as a result of subdivision or combination), or in the case of consolidation of
the Company with or the merger of the Company into any other corporation (other
than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing
corporation) or of the sale of the properties and assets of the Company as, or
substantially as, an entirety to any other corporation; or

                          (iii)  of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Company;

then the Company shall cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent and shall cause
to be given to each of the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates at
his or her address appearing on the Warrant register, at least 10





                                       13
<PAGE>   124
calendar days prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, by
first class mail, postage prepaid, a written notice stating (i) the date as of
which the holders of record of shares of Common Stock to be entitled to receive
any such distribution are to be determined or (ii) the date on which any such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of
which it is expected that holders of record of shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to exchange such shares for securities or other property, if any,
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.  The failure to give the notice
required by this Section 13 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality
or validity of any reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up or the vote upon any action.

                 Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any of the Warrant
Certificates shall be construed as conferring upon the holders thereof the
right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of
the meetings of shareholders or the election of directors of the Company or any
other matter, or any rights whatsoever as shareholders of the Company.

                 SECTION 14.  Merger, Consolidation or Change of Name of
Warrant Agent.  Any corporation into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall
be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of
the Warrant Agent, shall be the successor to the Warrant Agent hereunder
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be eligible for
appointment as a successor Warrant Agent under the provisions of Section 17.
In case at the time such successor to the Warrant Agent shall succeed to the
agency created by this Agreement, and in case at that time any of the Warrant
Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such
successor to the Warrant Agent may adopt the countersignature of the original
Warrant Agent; and in case at that time any of the Warrant Cer-





                                       14
<PAGE>   125
tificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor to the Warrant Agent
may countersign such Warrant Certificates either in the name of the predecessor
Warrant Agent or in the name of the successor Warrant Agent; and in all such
cases such Warrant Certificates shall have the full force provided in the
Warrant Certificates and in this Agreement.

                 In case at any time the name of the Warrant Agent shall be
changed and at such time any of the Warrant Certificates shall have been
countersigned but not delivered, the Warrant Agent whose name has changed may
adopt the countersignature under its prior name; and in case at that time any
of the Warrant Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Warrant
Agent may countersign such Warrant Certificates either in its prior name or in
its changed name; and in all such cases such Warrant Certificates shall have
the full force provided in the Warrant Certificates and in this Agreement.

                 SECTION 15.  Warrant Agent.  The Warrant Agent undertakes the
duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms and
conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Warrants, by their
acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

                          (a)     The statements contained herein and in the
Warrant Certificates shall be taken as statements of the Company and the
Warrant Agent assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the same
except such as describe the Warrant Agent or action taken or to be taken by it.
The Warrant Agent assumes no responsibility with respect to the distribution of
the Warrant Certificates except as otherwise provided herein.

                          (b)     The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible
for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants contained in
this Agreement or in the Warrant Certificates to be complied with by the
Company.

                          (c)     The Warrant Agent may consult at any time
with counsel satisfactory to it (who may be counsel for the Company) and the
Warrant Agent shall incur no liability or responsibility to the Company or to
any holder of any Warrant Certificate in respect of any action taken, suffered
or omitted by it hereunder in good





                                       15
<PAGE>   126

faith and in accordance with the opinion or the advice of such counsel.

                          (d)     The Warrant Agent shall incur no liability or
responsibility to the Company or to any holder of any Warrant Certificate for
any action taken in reliance on any notice, resolution, waiver, consent, order,
certificate, or other paper, document or instrument believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party or
parties.

                          (e)     The Company agrees to pay to the Warrant
Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by the Warrant Agent in
connection with this Agreement, to reimburse the Warrant Agent for all
expenses, taxes and governmental charges and other charges of any kind and
nature incurred by the Warrant Agent in connection with this Agreement and to
indemnify the Warrant Agent and save it harmless against any and all
liabilities, including judgments, costs and counsel fees, for anything done or
omitted by the Warrant Agent in connection with this Agreement except as a
result of its negligence or bad faith.

                          (f)     The Warrant Agent shall be under no
obligation to institute any action, suit or legal proceeding or to take any
other action likely to involve expense unless the Company or one or more
registered holders of Warrant Certificates shall furnish the Warrant Agent with
reasonable security and indemnity for any costs and expenses which may be
incurred by it, but this provision shall not affect the power of the Warrant
Agent to take such action as it may consider proper, whether with or without
any such security or indemnity.  All rights of action under this Agreement or
under any of the Warrants may be enforced by the Warrant Agent without the
possession of any of the Warrant Certificates or the production thereof at any
trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such action, suit or
proceeding instituted by the Warrant Agent shall be brought in its name as
Warrant Agent, and any recovery or judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of
the registered holders of the Warrants, as their respective rights or interests
may appear.

                          (g)     The Warrant Agent, and any stockholder,
director, officer or employee thereof, may buy, sell





                                       16
<PAGE>   127

or deal in any of the Warrants or other securities of the Company or become
pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be
interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as
fully and freely as though it were not Warrant Agent under this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall preclude the Warrant Agent from acting in any other
capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.

                          (h)     The Warrant Agent shall act hereunder solely
as agent for the Company, and its duties shall be determined solely by the
provisions hereof.  The Warrant Agent shall not be liable for anything which it
may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement except for its
own negligence or bad faith.

                 SECTION 16.  Disposition of Proceeds of Exercise of Warrants.
The Warrant Agent shall account promptly to the Company with respect to
Warrants exercised and concurrently pay to the Company all moneys received by
the Warrant Agent on the purchase of Shares through the exercise of Warrants.

                 SECTION 17.  Change of Warrant Agent.  If the Warrant Agent
shall become incapable of acting as Warrant Agent, the Company shall appoint a
successor.  If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period
of 30 days after it has been notified in writing of such incapacity by the
incapacitated Warrant Agent or by the registered holder of a Warrant
Certificate, then the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate may apply to
any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor to the
incapacitated Warrant Agent.  Pending appointment of a successor to the Warrant
Agent, either by the Company or by such a court, the duties of the Warrant
Agent shall be carried out by the Company.  Any successor warrant agent whether
appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a bank or trust company,
in good standing, incorporated under the laws of the State of New York or of
the United States of America, and having its principal office in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, State of New York and must have at the time of
its appointment as warrant agent a combined capital and surplus of at least one
hundred million dollars.  After appointment the successor warrant agent shall
be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it
had been originally





                                       17
<PAGE>   128

named as Warrant Agent without further act or deed; but the former Warrant
Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor warrant agent any property at
the time held by it hereunder and execute and deliver any further assurance,
conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Failure to give any notice
provided for in this Section 17, however, or any defect therein, shall not
affect the legality or validity of the removal of the Warrant Agent or the
appointment of a successor warrant agent as the case may be.

                 SECTION 18.  Notices to Company and Warrant Agent.  Any notice
or demand authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the Warrant Agent
or by the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate to or on the Company
shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by mail, first class or registered,
postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing by the
Company with the Warrant Agent), as follows:

                                  Nine West Group Inc.
                                  9 West Broad Street
                                  Stamford, Connecticut 06902
                                  Attn:  General Counsel

                 In case the Company shall fail to maintain such office or
shall fail to give such notice of any change in the location thereof,

                              NINE WEST GROUP INC.


                 The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of
a duly authorized issue of Warrants expiring at 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on ___________, 200_ (the "Termination Date"), to purchase ____________ Shares
and are issued or to be issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement which is
hereby incorporated by reference in and made a part of this instrument and is
hereby referred to for a description of the rights, limitation of rights,
obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company
and the holders (the words "holders" or "holder" meaning the registered holders
or registered holder) of the Warrants.

                 Warrants may be exercised to purchase Shares from the Company
on or after ____________, 1995 and on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the Termination Date, at the Exercise Price set forth on the face hereof,
subject to adjustment, as hereinafter referred to.  The holder of Warrants
evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise them by surrendering this
Warrant Certificate, with the form of election to purchase set forth hereon
properly completed and executed, together with payment of the Exercised Price
at the Warrant Agent Office.  In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants
evidenced hereby the number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total
number of Warrants evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof
or his assignee a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not
exercised.  No adjustment shall be made for any cash dividends on any Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

                 The Warrant Agreement provides that, upon the occurrence of
certain events, the Exercise Price set forth on the face hereof may, subject to
certain conditions, be adjusted.  If the Exercise Price is adjusted, the
Warrant Agreement provides that, at the election of the Company, either (i) the
number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant shall be
adjusted, or (ii) each outstanding Warrant shall be adjusted to become a
differ-





                                       23

ent number of Warrants.  In the latter event, the Company will cause to be
distributed to registered holders of Warrant Certificates either Warrant
Certificates representing the additional Warrants issuable pursuant to the
adjustment, or substitute Warrant Certificates to replace all outstanding
Warrant Certificates.

                 The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of
Warrants or fractions of Shares or any certificates which evidence fractional
Warrants or fractional Shares.  In lieu of such fractional Warrants and
fractional Shares there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Warrant
Certificates with regard to which such fractional Warrants or fractional Shares
would other- wise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of
the current market value (as determined pursuant to the Warrant Agreement) of a
full Warrant or a full Share, as the case may be.

                 Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the Warrant Agent
Office, by the registered holder thereof in person or by a duly appointed legal
representative or a duly authorized attorney, may be exchanged, in the manner
and subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, but without
payment of any service charge, for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant
Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate a like number of
Warrants.

                 Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this
Warrant Certificate at the Warrant Agent Office, a new Warrant Certificate or
Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like
number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee in exchange for this
Warrant Certificate, subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant
Agreement, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge
imposed in connection therewith.

                 The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the
registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Warrant Certificate
(notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by
anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof and for all other purposes, and
neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary.

                                    ARTICLE I

                                THE TENDER OFFER

                 1.1 The Offer. (a) Purchaser will, and Parent will
cause Purchaser to, amend and supplement its outstanding tender offer for any
and all outstanding common shares, without par value (the "Common Shares")
(including the associated preference share purchase rights (the "Rights"),

and pay for Common Shares (including the associated Rights) tendered pursuant to
the Offer will be subject only to the conditions (A) that the control share

Corporation Law (the "GCL") by Purchaser (the "Control Share Acquisition") will
be authorized by the holders of Common Shares pursuant to Section 1701.831 at a
special meeting of the holders of Common Shares duly and validly called and held

<PAGE>   8


"Control Share Condition"), (B) that the number of Common Shares being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date provided in the Offer,

that are set forth in Annex A hereto, and (iii) the expiration date of the Offer
will be extended until the later of (A) midnight on the tenth business day

(y) midnight on the second business day next succeeding the date of the 831
Meeting (as hereinafter defined). Any such condition other than the Minimum
Share Condition and the Control Share Condition may be waived by Purchaser in
its sole discretion. Purchaser will accept for payment all Common Shares
(including the associated Rights) validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the Offer as soon as legally
permissible, and pay for all such Common Shares (including the associated
Rights) as promptly as practicable thereafter, in each case subject only to the
conditions referred to above in this Section 1.1(a). Without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser will not (u) reduce the number of Common
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (v) reduce the purchase price offered
pursuant to the Offer, (w) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those
set forth on Annex A, (x) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
(y) otherwise amend the Offer (other than amendments which are not adverse to
the Company or its shareholders) or (z) extend the time of the expiration of the
Offer if all conditions to the Offer are then, as provided in the Offer,
satisfied or waived.

                 (b) As soon as practicable on the date of the amendment of the
Offer, Luxottica Group S.p.A., a corporation organized under the laws of the
Republic of Italy ("Luxottica Group") and Purchaser will file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an amendment to their

supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-1") with respect to the Offer, which will
contain or incorporate by reference an amendment and supplement to the offer to
purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any related summary
advertisement (such Schedule 14D-1 and such other documents, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company and its
counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents and
all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing with the Commission
or dissemination to holders of Common Shares. If required, immediately prior to
the amendment of the Offer,

effected by irrevocable action), may be withdrawn, modified or amended if and to
the extent legally required for the discharge by the Company's directors of
their fiduciary duties as advised by independent legal counsel, who may be the
Company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel (a "Director Duty").

their filing with the Commission or dissemination to the holders of Common
Shares. The Company will furnish to Parent and Purchaser, upon request, a copy

                 1.3 831 Meeting. The parties acknowledge that a special
meeting of the holders of Common Shares for the purpose of voting to authorize
the Control Share Acquisition of Common Shares by Purchaser pursuant to Section
1701.831 of the GCL was called for April 21, 1995 (the "Original 831 Meeting")
and adjourned to May 5, 1995 (the "Rescheduled 831 Meeting"). In the event that
the 831 Proxy Statement has not been circulated for a sufficient period of days
by the date of the Rescheduled 831 Meeting, Parent, Purchaser and the Company
(without affecting the Company's right to withdraw its Recommendation referred
to in Section 1.2(d) pursuant to a Director Duty) will use their respective best
efforts to adjourn the Rescheduled 831 Meeting to such other date as the Company
and Purchaser may mutually determine from time to time in accordance with the
GCL (the adjourned meeting at which the Control Share Acquisition is submitted
for a vote to the holders of Common Shares is herein referred to as the "831
Meeting").

                 1.4 Board of Directors of the Company. If requested by
Parent, the Company will, promptly following the acceptance for payment of the
Common Shares to be purchased pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time
thereafter, take all action necessary to cause at least two-thirds of the number
of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, of the Company to be persons
designated by Parent (whether, at the request of Parent, by increasing the size
of the number of directors of the Company or by seeking the resignation of
directors and causing Parent's designees to be elected to fill the vacancies so
created) as will give Parent representation on the Board of Directors of the
Company equal to the product of the number of directors of the Company and the
percentage that such number of Common Shares so purchased bears to the number of
Common Shares outstanding. At such time, the Company also will take all action
permitted by law to cause persons designated by Parent to constitute at least
the same percentage as is on the Company's Board of Directors of (a) each
committee of the Company's Board of Directors, (b) the board of directors of
each subsidiary of the Company, and (c) each committee, if any, of each such
board of directors. The Company's obligation to cause designees of Parent to be
so elected or appointed as directors of the Company will be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14(f)-1 promulgated thereunder. Parent will
supply to the Company in writing and will be solely responsible for any
information with respect to it and its designees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, and the Company will
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information as is required under Section
14(f) and Rule 14(f)-1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time
(as hereinafter defined), the Company will use its best efforts to assure that
the Company's Board of Directors has at least three directors who are directors
on the date hereof (the "Continuing Directors"); provided further, that, in such
event, if the number

                                        4


<PAGE>   11



of Continuing Directors is reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, any
remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there is only one
remaining) will be entitled to designate three persons to fill such vacancies
who will be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement or,
if no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors will designate three
persons to fill such vacancies who are not shareholders, affiliates or
associates of Parent or Purchaser and such persons will be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. The Company will use its
best efforts to cause the person(s) so designated by the Continuing Directors to
be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE MERGER

                 2.1  Merger.

                 2.1.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, (a) Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser will thereupon cease in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the GCL and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL") and (b) each of the Company, Purchaser and Parent will use its best
efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated as soon as practicable following
the expiration of the Offer.

                 2.1.2 Effective Time. As soon as practicable following
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions specified in Article VI hereof, and
provided that this Agreement has not been terminated or abandoned pursuant to
Section 7.1 hereof, the Company and Purchaser (the "Constituent Corporations")
will cause a duly executed certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
to be filed with the Secretary of State of Ohio as provided in Section 1701.81
of the GCL and with the Secretary of State of Delaware as provided in Section
252 of the DGCL (or, if permitted, Section 253 of the DGCL). The Merger will
become effective (the "Effective Time") on the date on which the later of the
following actions will have been completed: (a) the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of Ohio and (b) the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

                 2.1.3 Effect of Merger. The Company will be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation") and will continue to be governed by the laws of the
State of Ohio, and the separate corporate existence of Purchaser will cease. The
Merger will have the effects specified in the GCL and the DGCL. The Articles of
Incorporation (the "Articles") and the Code of Regulations


                                        5
<PAGE>   12



(the "Code of Regulations") of the Company in effect at the Effective Time will
be the Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving
Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with their terms and the GCL. The
directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company
at the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation,
to serve in accordance with the Code of Regulations, from and after the
Effective Time, until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the terms of the Surviving Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and Code
of Regulations and the GCL.

                 2.1.4 Conversion of Common Shares. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Purchaser, Parent or the holders of any of the following securities, (a) each
then-outstanding Common Share not owned by Luxottica Group, Parent, Purchaser or
any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent (other than those Common
Shares held in the treasury of the Company or held by any subsidiary of the
Company and the Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) (including the
associated Rights) will be cancelled and retired and be converted into a right
to receive in cash an amount per Common Share equal to the highest price per
Common Share paid for a Common Share by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the
"Merger Price"), (b) each then-outstanding Common Share (including the
associated Rights) owned by Luxottica Group, Parent, Purchaser or any other
direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent will be cancelled and retired, and no
payment will be made with respect thereto, (c) each Common Share issued and held
in the Company's treasury or held by any subsidiary of the Company will be
cancelled and retired, and no payment will be made with respect thereto, and (d)
each common share of Purchaser will be converted into and become 500,000 common
shares of the Surviving Corporation, which thereafter will constitute all of the
issued and outstanding common shares of the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section to the contrary, Parent
may elect, at any time prior to the fifth business day immediately preceding the
date on which the Proxy Statement (as provided for in Section 5.6) is initially
to be mailed to the Company's shareholders (or, if the Merger is to be effected
without a meeting of holders of Common Shares, in accordance with Section
1701.801 of the GCL and Section 253 of the DGCL, at any time prior thereto),
that, instead of merging Purchaser into the Company, the Company merge with and
into Purchaser or another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Luxottica Group. In such event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing, and to provide
that Purchaser or such other subsidiary will be the Surviving Corporation and
will continue under the name "The United States Shoe Corporation"; provided,



                                        6
<PAGE>   13

however, that if such amendment would otherwise cause any representation or
warranty of the Company hereunder no longer to be true or correct in any respect
or would otherwise cause the Company to be in breach or to have failed to comply
in any respect with any of its obligations hereunder, no such failure of any
representation or warranty to be true or correct or breach or failure to comply
shall give either Parent, Purchaser or Luxottica Group any rights under this
Agreement or under the Offer.

                 2.2 Meeting of Holders of Common Shares. The Company
will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and its
Articles and Code of Regulations to convene a meeting of the holders of Common
Shares promptly after the purchase of Common Shares pursuant to the Offer to
consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger, if such approval is required
by applicable law. At any such meeting, Parent and Purchaser will vote all of
the Common Shares then beneficially owned by them in favor of the Merger. The
Board of Directors of the Company will recommend that the holders of Common
Shares approve the Merger if such approval is required pursuant to the GCL or
otherwise; provided that any such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or
amended in accordance with a Director Duty. Prior to any such meeting, in the
event that Parent and Purchaser acquire beneficial ownership of at least 90% of
the outstanding Common Shares, the parties will take all action necessary to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of holders of Common Shares, in accordance with
Section 1701.801 of the GCL and Section 253 of the DGCL.

                 2.3 Consummation of the Merger. The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place (a) at the offices of Winston & Strawn,
175 Water Street, New York, New York as promptly as practicable after the later
of (i) the day of (and immediately following) the receipt of approval of the
Merger by the holders of the Common Shares if such approval is required, or as
soon as practicable after completion of the Offer if such approval by the
holders of the Common Shares is not required, and (ii) the day on which the last
of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof is satisfied or duly waived, or
(b) at such other time and place and on such other date as Purchaser and the
Company may agree in writing executed by both parties.

                 2.4 Payment for Common Shares. Purchaser will authorize
the depositary for the Offer (or one or more commercial banks organized under
the laws of the United States or any state thereof with capital, surplus and
undivided profits of at least $100,000,000) to act as Paying Agent hereunder
with respect to the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). Each holder (other than
Luxottica Group, Parent, Purchaser or any subsidiary of Parent, the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company) of a certificate or


                                        7
<PAGE>   14



certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common
Shares (the "Certificates") will be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of such Certificates for cancellation and subject to any required
withholding of taxes, the aggregate amount of cash into which the Common Shares
previously represented by such Certificates will have been converted in the
Merger. On or before the Effective Time, Purchaser will make available to the
Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to the preceding
sentence. Pending payment of such funds to the holders of Common Shares, such
funds will be held and invested by the Paying Agent as Parent directs. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will
be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent
will promptly replace any monies lost through any investment made pursuant to
this Section 2.4. Until surrendered to the Paying Agent, each Certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares (other than
Common Shares owned by Luxottica Group, Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent, or treasury shares held by the Company or Common
Shares held by any subsidiary of the Company and Dissenting Shares) will be
deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive upon
such surrender the aggregate amount of cash into which the Common Shares
represented thereby will have been converted, subject to any required
withholding of taxes. No interest will be paid on the cash payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. Any cash delivered or made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.4 and not exchanged for Certificates
within six months after the Effective Time will be returned by the Paying Agent
to the Surviving Corporation, which thereafter will act as Paying Agent, subject
to the rights of holders of non-surrendered Certificates under this Article II
and any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with the instructions for exchanging their Certificates representing Common
Shares, who will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of their claim for the consideration set forth in Section 2.1, without any
interest thereon, but will have no greater rights against the Surviving
Corporation (or either Constituent Corporation) than may be accorded to general
unsecured creditors thereof under applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto will be liable to a holder of
Common Shares for any cash or interest thereon delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent will mail to each record holder of Common Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal (the
"Transmittal Letter") and instructions for use thereof in surrendering the
Certificates previously representing such Common Shares which will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will
pass, only upon proper delivery of the


                                        8
<PAGE>   15



Certificates to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of delivery
specified in the Transmittal Letter and instructions for use thereof in
surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Price for each Common
Share previously represented thereby.

                 2.5 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and no
transfer of Common Shares will thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled,
retired and exchanged for cash as provided in Section 2.4 hereof, subject to
applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

                 2.6 The Company Stock Options and Related Matters. (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company will (i)
adopt such resolutions and approve such amendments, if any, as are necessary to
provide for the cancellation of all stock options (the "Options") to purchase
Common Shares granted pursuant to the Company's 1978 Key Personnel Stock Option
Plan, 1983 Key Personnel Stock Option Plan, 1985 Outside Directors Stock Option
Plan, 1991 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan and 1988 Employee Incentive Plan
(all such plans collectively referred to as the "Stock Plans"), effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) promptly furnish Parent and
Purchaser a copy of such resolutions certified by an appropriate officer of the
Company. If necessary or appropriate, the Company will, upon the request of
Purchaser, (x) use its best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgment of each
holder of an Option that the payment of the amount of cash referred to below
will satisfy the Company's obligation to such holder pursuant to such Option and
(y) take such other action as is necessary or appropriate to effect the
provisions of this Section 2.6(a). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Option which is not then exercisable or vested will become fully exercisable and
vested, and each such Option and all other Options will be cancelled, effective
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, in exchange for a payment by the
Company or the Surviving Corporation of an amount, payable within three business
days after the Effective Time, equal to the product of (A) the total number of
Common Shares subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Price over the exercise price per Common Share subject to such Option, subject
to any required withholding of taxes. Payments made pursuant to this Section
2.6(a) represent and will be characterized and reported by the Surviving
Corporation as additional compensation expense.

                 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company will adopt appropriate resolutions to provide for the termination of all
restrictions on the Common Shares ("Restricted Shares"), if any, which have been
distributed to employees pursuant to the 1988 Employee Incentive Plan and



                                        9
<PAGE>   16



will promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser a copy of such resolutions certified
by an appropriate officer of the Company.

                 (c) Subject to the payment by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation of all amounts required to be paid by them pursuant to Section
2.6(a), at and after the Effective Date, no option, convertible security,
warrant, subscription or other claim, right to-acquire or commitment of any sort
previously existing in respect of one or more whole and/or fractional shares of
any class of securities of the Company shall represent an option, convertible
security, warrant, subscription or other claim, right-to-acquire or commitment 
of any sort in respect of whole and/or fractional shares of any class of 
securities of the Surviving Corporation.

                 2.7 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any Common Shares which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of Common Shares who shall not have voted such Common Shares in favor of
the adoption of the Merger and who shall have timely delivered a written demand
for the payment of the fair cash value of such Common Shares in the manner
provided in Section 1701.85 of the GCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted as described in Section 2.1.4 hereof but shall become the right to
receive payment of the fair cash value of such Common Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the GCL; provided, however, that (i) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall subsequently withdraw such holder's demand for
payment of the fair cash value of such Common Shares (with the consent of the
Surviving Corporation by its directors), (ii) if any holder fails to comply with
such Section 1701.85 (unless the Surviving Corporation by its directors waives
such failure), (iii) if the Purchaser abandons or is finally enjoined or
prevented from carrying out, or the holders of Common Shares rescind their
adoption of, the Merger or (iv) if the Surviving Corporation and any holder of
Dissenting Shares will not have come to an agreement as to the fair cash value
of such holder's Dissenting Shares, and neither such holder of Dissenting Shares
nor the Surviving Corporation has filed or joined in a petition demanding a
determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the period provided
in Section 1701.85 of the GCL, the right and obligation of such holder or
holders (as the case may be) to receive such fair cash value and to sell such
Common Shares shall terminate, and such Common Shares shall thereupon be deemed
to have been extinguished and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time
of the Merger, into the right to receive the Merger Price, without interest.
Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to Dissenting Shares as
aforesaid shall not be paid by the Surviving Corporation as provided in this
Agreement and shall have only such rights as are provided by Section 1701.85 of
the GCL with respect to such Common Shares.

                                   ARTICLE III

         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

                 Parent and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company that:

                 3.1 Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and
Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its respective
properties and assets and to carry on its respective businesses as they are now
being conducted. Parent beneficially owns all of the outstanding capital stock
of Purchaser.

                 3.2 Authority. Each of Parent and Purchaser has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly approved by the respective Boards of Directors of Parent
and Purchaser and by Parent and one or more of its direct and/or indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries as the sole shareholders of Purchaser and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to consummate the
transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Purchaser and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each of Parent
and Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

                 3.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser nor the
consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of their
respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable governing
instruments), (b) violate, conflict with, constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under,
or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any lien or other encumbrance (except as contemplated
by the financing transaction provided for in the Commitment Letter (as
hereinafter defined)) upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or any such subsidiary is a party or to
which they or any of their respective properties or assets are subject, except
for such violations, conflicts, breaches,



                                       11
<PAGE>   18

defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of liens or other
encumbrances, which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, the effect of preventing or materially delaying Parent and
Purchaser from performing their respective obligations under this Agreement, or
(c) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of or from, or filing
with or notification to, any court, governmental authority or other regulatory
or administrative agency or commission, domestic or foreign ("Governmental
Entity"), except (i) pursuant to the Exchange Act, (ii) the filing of
certificates of merger pursuant to the GCL, the DGCL and the laws of any other
state, (iii) filings required under the securities or blue sky laws of the
various states, or (iv) consents, approvals, authorizations, permits, filings or
notifications which if not obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, the effect of preventing or materially
delaying Parent and Purchaser from performing their respective obligations under
this Agreement. Neither Parent, Purchaser nor any of their respective affiliates
is, or at any time in the three years prior to the date hereof has been, an
"interested shareholder" as defined in Section 1704.01 of the GCL.

                 3.4 Financing. Purchaser has delivered to the Company
with its Amendment No. 18 to its Schedule 14D-1 a commitment letter, dated April
19, 1995 (the "Commitment Letter") from Credit Suisse (the "Bank"), on the terms
and subject to the conditions of which the Bank has committed to lend funds 
which, together with other cash funds presently available to Purchaser, are 
sufficient to consummate the Offer and the Merger, to perform all the 
obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement and to pay all 
related fees and expenses. The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect.

                 3.5 Solvency. The Surviving Corporation will not be
immediately after the Effective Time (and after giving effect to the financing
for the Offer and the Merger and the use of the proceeds therefrom) unable to
pay its obligations as they become due in the usual course of its affairs.

                 3.6 Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement.
Neither the Offer Documents nor any of the information supplied by Parent or
Purchaser in writing specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at
the respective times the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are filed with
the Commission and first published, sent or given to the Company's shareholders,
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. None of the information to be supplied by Parent or Purchaser in
writing specifically for inclusion in a proxy or information statement of the
Company required to be mailed to the Company's shareholders


                                       12

<PAGE>   19

in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement"), or in any amendments or
supplements thereto will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
Company's shareholders and at the time of the shareholders' meeting in
connection with the Merger, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein made, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Offer Documents complied and the Offer
Documents and the Proxy Statement, if any, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Parent and Purchaser will promptly correct any
information provided by them in writing specifically for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such
information will have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent
and Purchaser will promptly correct any statements in the Offer Documents that
have become false or misleading in any material respect and take all steps
necessary to cause such Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the
Commission and disseminated to holders of Common Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable law.

                 3.7 Acquiring Person Statement. The acquiring person
statement delivered to the Company on March 3, 1995 by Luxottica Group and
Purchaser relating to the purchase of Common Shares by the Purchaser (the
"Acquiring Person Statement") is a valid acquiring person statement under
Section 1701.831 of the GCL with respect to the purchase of Common Shares by the
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer as amended in accordance herewith and the
Merger. The Acquiring Person Statement complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the GCL and did not, at the time of
first mailing thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein made, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

                 3.8 831 Proxy Statement. The proxy statement filed by
Purchaser and Luxottica Group relating to the Original 831 Meeting, as such
meeting may be adjourned (together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the "831 Proxy Statement") complied and will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and did not and will not, at the time of the first
mailing thereof and at the time of the 831 Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with



                                       13


<PAGE>   20



respect to information supplied by the Company in writing specifically for
inclusion in the 831 Proxy Statement.

                 3.9 Fees. Except for the fees payable to CS First
Boston Corporation, neither Parent nor Purchaser nor any of Parent's other
subsidiaries has paid or become obligated to pay any fee or commission to any
investment banker, broker, finder or intermediary in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE IV

              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                 The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent
and Purchaser that:

                 4.1 Corporate Organization. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective country or state of incorporation and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where failure
to so qualify or be in good standing is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect"). The Company and each of its subsidiaries
has the requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its respective
properties and assets and to carry on its respective businesses as they are now
being conducted. The Company has furnished Parent true and correct copies of its
Articles and Code of Regulations, as amended to the date hereof. The Company's
Articles and Code of Regulations as so delivered are in full force and effect.
The Company has made available to Parent true and correct copies of the articles
of incorporation and code of regulations (or comparable governing instruments)
of each of its subsidiaries, each of which, as so made available, is in full
force and effect.

                 4.2 Authority. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, except for any
required approval of the holders of Common Shares, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions so contemplated, subject only to approval, if
necessary, by the holders of the Common Shares. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid


                                       14
<PAGE>   21


and binding obligation of, the Company, enforceable against the Company in 
accordance with its terms.

                 4.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or
result in any breach of, any provision of its Articles or Code of Regulations,

notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in
the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any lien or other encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any such
subsidiary is a party or to which they or any of their respective properties or
assets are subject, except for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or creations of liens or other encumbrances as may
arise in the absence of an appropriate consent or waiver under the agreements or

                 4.5 Commission Filings. The Company has heretofore
filed all reports with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder since January 1, 1994 and
has made available to Parent true and correct copies of all such reports,
including without limitation each registration statement, Current Report on Form
8-K, proxy or information statement, Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q filed during such period (in the case of each such report,
including all exhibits thereto) (the "SEC Documents"). Each SEC Document
complied as of its respective filing date in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The SEC Documents did not (as of their respective filing dates)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents (including the
notes and schedules thereto, "Company's Financial Statements") comply as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present in all
material respects (subject, in the case of the unaudited



                                       17
<PAGE>   24

statements, to normal audit adjustments) the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended.

                 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in
the SEC Documents or as disclosed to Parent by the Company or as otherwise
publicly disclosed by the Company, in each case, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, since October 31, 1994 there has not been (a) any change in the
business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or
otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which has
resulted in a Material Adverse Effect except for changes arising out of
industry-wide conditions or resulting from the Offer, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) in the case of the Company, any
declaration, setting aside or, payment of any dividend or other distribution
with respect to its capital stock, other than the regular quarterly cash
dividends on Common Shares in the amount of $0.08 per Common Share, (c) any
material change by the Company in accounting principles or practices, (d) any
entry into any agreement, commitment or transaction by the Company which is
material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than in
the ordinary course of business, or (e) any entry into any employment agreement
with, or any increase in the rate or terms of compensation payable by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to their respective directors, officers or
employees, other than increases made in the ordinary course of business.

                 4.7 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule 4.7 contains a
complete and accurate list of all existing bonus, deferred compensation,
pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership,
stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, severance, welfare
and fringe benefit plans, employment or severance agreements and all similar
arrangements in which any employee or former employee or director or former
director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Employees")
participates or to which any such Employees are a party or which are applicable
to any of them (the "Plans"). The SEC Documents and/or Schedule 4.7 identifies
each such Plan containing a "change of control" provision. Except as set forth
in the SEC Documents and/or on Schedule 4.7, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any formal commitment, whether legally binding or not, to
create any additional Plan or to modify or change in any material respect any
existing Plan that would affect any Employee.

                 (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7, each Plan has been
operated and administered in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). Each


                                       18
<PAGE>   25

Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter for
"TRA" (as defined in Rev. Proc. 93-39) from the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") or has filed for such a determination letter within the remedial
amendment period. There is no material pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Company, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the Plans. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any plan trustee employed by the
Company or its subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date hereof, could subject the Company or any of its subsidiaries to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in
an amount which would be material.

                 (c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any subsidiary with respect to any
ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them,
or any single-employer plan of any entity (an "ERISA Affiliate") which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). The Company and its subsidiaries
have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with
respect to a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA)
under Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an
ERISA Affiliate) or any material liability in connection with the
reorganization, insolvency or termination of any multiemployer plan. No notice
of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which
the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be
filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
"PBGC") has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or ERISA
Affiliate Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted.

                 (d) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan have been timely made or adequate reserves in
respect thereof have been established on the books of the Company. Neither any
Pension Plan nor any ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments to the PBGC with respect
to each Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or before their
due dates. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries has provided, or is required
to provide, security to

                                       19
<PAGE>   26

any Pension Plan or to any ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) 
of the Code.

                 (e) With respect to each Pension Plan which is a
single-employer plan covered under Title IV of ERISA and each ERISA Affiliate
Plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date
hereof, the actuarily determined present value of all benefit liabilities (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the plans'
most recent actuarial valuation) did not exceed the then current value of the
assets of such Plan, and (i) there has not been an adverse change in the
financial condition of such Plan(s) which would have caused a material change in
the funded status of such Plan(s) and (ii) there have not been amendments to
such Plans that materially increase the present value of such benefit
liabilities under such Plans. The withdrawal liability of the Company and the
subsidiaries under each Plan which is a multiemployer plan to which the Company,
any of its subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate has contributed during the
preceding 12 months, determined as if a "complete withdrawal" (within the
meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA) has occurred as of the date hereof would not
be material.

                 (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7, neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations to provide retiree health and
life benefits under any Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of
the Code. Schedule 4.7 also sets forth the amount of accrued post-retirement
benefits as of the most recent valuation, and there have not been amendments or
other changes that materially increase the amount of such accrued benefits since
the date of such valuation.

                 (g) To the knowledge of the Company, all Plans covering foreign
Employees comply in all material respects with applicable local law. The Company
and its subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any
Pension Plan which covers foreign Employees.

                 (h) With respect to each Plan, the Company has provided or made
available to Purchaser, if applicable, true and complete copies of: (s) all Plan
documents and all amendments thereto; (t) all trust instruments and insurance
contracts; (u) the last two Forms 5500 filed with the IRS; (v) the most recent
actuarial report and financial statement; (w) the most recent summary plan
description; (x) any and all forms filed with the PBGC; (y) the most recent
determination letter issued by the IRS; and (z) any Forms 5310 or 5330 filed
with the IRS.

                 (i) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7 or in the SEC
Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not directly (or indirectly upon a termination of employment): (i) entitle
any Employee to


                                       20
<PAGE>   27

severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment or (ii) accelerate
the timing of any payment or the vesting of any rights or increase the amount of
any compensation due any Employee.

                 (j) The aggregate amount that will be payable upon and as a
result solely of the consummation of the Offer to all officers, directors,
employees and agents of the Company and of its subsidiaries solely by virtue of
the change in control provisions of the Nonqualified Retirement Plans (as such
term is defined in Schedule 4.7(a)) will not exceed the amount set forth on
Schedule 4.7(j).

                 4.8 Taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries have timely
filed all material federal, state, local and foreign tax returns and reports
required to be filed by them through the date hereof and will timely file all
material returns and reports required on or before the Effective Time. Such
reports and returns are and will be true, correct and complete. The Company and
its subsidiaries have paid and discharged all federal, state, local and material
foreign taxes due from them, other than such taxes that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and are adequately reserved as shown in
the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated January 29, 1994 in
the SEC Documents (the "Company Balance Sheet") and its most recent quarterly
financial statements. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.8, neither the IRS nor
any other taxing authority or agency, domestic or foreign, is now asserting or,
to the best knowledge of the Company, threatening to assert against the Company
or any of its subsidiaries any deficiency or claim for additional taxes or
interest thereon or penalties in connection therewith. The accruals and reserves
for taxes (including interest and penalties, if any, thereon) reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet and the most recent quarterly financial statements are
adequate in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company and its subsidiaries have withheld or collected and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authorities or are properly holding for such payment
all material taxes required by law to be withheld or collected. There are no
liens for taxes upon the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries other
than liens for current taxes not yet due and payable and liens for taxes that
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has agreed to or is required to make any
adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code. Except for
agreements relating to acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or equity
securities thereof, there is no contract, agreement or intercompany account
system in existence under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has, or
to the knowledge of the Company, may have in the future, an obligation to
contribute to the payment of any


                                       21
<PAGE>   28

portion of a tax (or pay any amount calculated with reference to any portion of
a tax) of any group of corporations of which the Company or its subsidiaries is
or was a part. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.8, there are no agreements in
effect to extend the period of limitations for the assessment or collection of
any tax for which the Company or any of its subsidiaries may be liable.

                 4.9 Proxy Statement; Schedule 14D-9; Offer Documents.
Neither the Schedule 14D-9 nor any of the information supplied by the Company or
its subsidiaries in writing specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents

to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company will promptly
correct any information provided by it in writing specifically for inclusion in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information will have become
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company will promptly correct
any statements in the Schedule 14D- 9 and the Proxy Statement that have become
false or misleading and take all steps necessary to cause such Schedule 14D-9
and Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the Commission and
disseminated to holders of Common Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by Parent or
Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates or representatives in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement.

                 4.10 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders

                 4.11 831 Proxy Statement. None of the information to be

                 4.12 Company Notice and Statement. The Company's notice
of the 831 Meeting and the Company's statement contemplated by Section
1701.831(D)(2) of the GCL, and all amendments and supplements thereto, complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements, if any, of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and did not, at the

notice or statement which Parent or Purchaser stated in writing was provided
expressly for such inclusion.

                 4.13 Fees. Except for the fees payable to James D.

SEC Documents prior to the date hereof, the Company and each of its subsidiaries
is in compliance with all applicable statutes, regulations, orders of, and all
applicable restrictions imposed by, all governmental bodies, domestic or
foreign, in respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership of its
property (including applicable statutes, regulations, orders and restrictions
relating to environmental standards and controls), except where the failure to

has taken all necessary action under the Rights Agreement


                                       23
<PAGE>   30

Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will cause the Distribution
Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur or the Rights to become
exercisable.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                    COVENANTS

                 5.1 No Solicitation and Other Actions. (a) Except as
set forth in subsection (b) of this Section 5.1, neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries will, and the Company will direct and use all reasonable
efforts to cause the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors
and other representatives of the Company or its subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate any proposals or
offers from any person relating to any Competing Transaction (as hereinafter
defined) or (ii) furnish to any other person any information or access to such

or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited proposal to
acquire the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, sale of all or substantially all the assets, tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, if, and only to the extent (A) a
Director Duty requires it to do so, and (B) that, prior to furnishing such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person
or entity, the Company receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms not more favorable to such person or entity
than the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated March 31, 1995
among the Company, Purchaser and Luxottica Group (the

"Confidentiality Agreement"); (ii) complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2

                 and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, conduct their
                 respective businesses only in, and not take any action except
                 in, the ordinary and usual course of business or in accordance
                 with a Director Duty in the event of a circumstance covered by
                 Section 5.1(b). The Company will use reasonable efforts to

                 in Section 2.6 or 5.8 hereof or this Section 5.2.5 or as set
                 forth on Schedule 4.7, and except for normal increases in the
                 ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
                 that, in the aggregate, do not result in a material increase in

                 Company will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries

                 do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that, as soon as
                 reasonably practicable, the Company will, subject to the prior
                 approval of Parent, take all necessary actions to assure that
                 all of the Company tax-qualified retirement plans which invest
                 in or hold Common Shares permit the participants in such plans
                 to direct the trustees of such plans in a timely and
                 confidential manner whether to tender the Common Shares

                 wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, or (b) incur or assume
                 any indebtedness for borrowed money; provided that the Company
                 and its subsidiaries will not incur or assume any indebtedness

                 aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of the Company and
                 its subsidiaries for borrowed money except to the extent
                 required for working capital needs and, in any event, the
                 Company and its subsidiaries may, with the prior written
                 consent of Parent and Purchaser, which shall not be
                 unreasonably withheld, refinance any existing indebtedness for

                 compromise any material claims or litigation or, except in the
                 ordinary course of business, modify, amend or terminate any of
                 its material contracts or waive, release or assign any material
                 rights or claims, or make any payment, direct or indirect, of

                 consistent with past practice


                                       27

                 payable payee to be cancelled or terminated without notice to
                 Parent and Purchaser, except in the ordinary course of
                 business.

                          5.2.11 Business Combination. Neither the
                 Company nor any of its subsidiaries will (i) make any

                 Company will not amend the Rights Agreement, except as
                 expressly contemplated by this Agreement or in accordance with

                 Agreement unless and until this Agreement has been terminated
                 in accordance with its terms or otherwise if required to do so
                 by a Director Duty.

                 Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof or as modified

                 reasonable efforts necessary to permit the transactions
                 contemplated by the Nine West Agreement to be consummated for
                 the purchase price specified in the Nine West Purchase
                 Agreement. In the event that the closing under the Nine West
                 Agreement occurs prior to the expiration of this covenant, the
                 Company will not make any distribution to its shareholders of
                 any of the purchase price received by the Company in accordance

(including tax returns and work papers of the Company's independent auditors),
properties, personnel and to such other information, will deliver written

reasonably requests, upon reasonable notice and in such a manner as will not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
information to which Parent and its subsidiaries' officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and other representatives may have access in
accordance with the preceding sentence include (a) copies of the portions

conditions herein provided and except in accordance with a Director Duty in the
event of a circumstance covered by Section 5.1(b), each of the parties hereto

including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or
non-actions, extensions, waivers, consents and approvals from all applicable

required vote of the holders of Common Shares. If, at any time after the

deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations acquired

Corporations or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of the
Constituent Corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may

and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

                 5.5 State Takeover Statutes. Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company will, upon the
request of Purchaser, take all reasonable steps to (a) exempt the Company, the
Offer and the Merger from the requirements of the GCL, by action of the
Company's Board of Directors or otherwise and (b) assist Purchaser in complying
with, or in challenging the validity or applicability of, any state takeover law
to the Offer or the Merger.

                 5.6 Proxy Statement. As soon as practicable after the
consummation of the Offer, the Company will, if required by applicable law in
order to consummate the Merger, prepare the Proxy Statement, file it with the
Commission, and cause it to be mailed to all holders of record of Common Shares.
Parent, Purchaser and the Company will cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement; without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Purchaser will furnish to the Company the information
relating to Parent and Purchaser required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement.

revised 831 Proxy Statement as contemplated by Section 1.3 as promptly as

Company will furnish to Parent and Purchaser the information relating to the
Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the 831 Proxy Statement.

                 5.8 Indemnification, Insurance and Certain Other
Employee-Related Matters. (a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and
its subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") after the Effective Time against
all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (whether or not arising from any
third party claims) (including and collectively, "Losses") arising out of
actions or omissions occurring on, prior to or after the Effective Time
(individually and collectively, "Losses") to the full extent provided under Ohio
law and the Company's Code of Regulations in effect at the date hereof,
including without limitation provisions relating to advances of expenses
incurred in the defense of any action or suit (including without limitation
attorneys' fees of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation); provided that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct
complies with the standards set forth under Ohio law and the Company's Code of
Regulations will be made by independent counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation; and provided
further that in the event of any claim that is asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim will
continue until final disposition thereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 5.7(a), upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right from and after the purchase of Common
Shares pursuant to the Offer, to assume the defense thereof and neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of separate counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that
such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ and be reimbursed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for the legal expenses of separate counsel
if, under applicable standards of professional conduct (as advised by counsel to
such Indemnified Party) a conflict of interest on any issue between such
Indemnified Party and Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected
without Parent's prior written consent; and provided further that, except with
respect to the advancement to an Indemnified Party of expenses incurred in the
defense of any


                                       31
<PAGE>   38

action or suit in accordance with the terms of this Section (subject to
reimbursement by such Indemnified Party in the event of a final determination by
a court of competent jurisdiction that such advances were unlawful and must be
reimbursed to Parent or the Surviving Corporation), neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine,
and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable
law.

                 (b) On or before the business day which is no later than five
business days before the expiration date of the Offer, Parent will cause there
to be in full force and effect from and after the time Purchaser first accepts
for payment Common Shares pursuant to the Offer for the Company and the
Surviving Corporation a policy or policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance (the "New Coverage") covering those persons (the "Insured Persons")
who are currently covered on the date of this Agreement by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage (the "Current Coverage"),
which New Coverage will (i) be in the same form and provide at least the same
coverage and limits, containing terms which are no less advantageous to the
Insured Persons than those provided in the Current Coverage, (ii) be effective
so that there will not result any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) with respect to the
first $20,000,000 of coverage, be issued by an insurance carrier or carriers
which are at least as highly rated by A.M. Best & Co. as Federal Insurance
Company. From and after the date of this Agreement, and so long as Parent is in
compliance with this clause (b), Parent shall have the sole right to seek the
New Coverage and the Company shall not engage in such activity. The Company
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall, regardless of whether or not the Merger
is consummated, and for six years after the Effective Time maintain in effect
the New Coverage; provided, however, that (A) the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for the New Coverage such policy or policies providing at least the
same coverage and containing terms which are no less advantageous to the Insured
Persons if such substitution is effective so that there does not result any gaps
or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) the insurance carrier or carriers issuing such policy or policies
with respect to the first $20,000,000 of coverage are at least as highly rated
by A.M. Best & Co. as Federal Insurance Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if by the date which is five business days prior to the expiration date of the
Offer Parent has failed to cause the New Coverage to be in full force and effect
as required in the first sentence of this clause (b), without waiving any other
rights which it may have pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall have the
right to cause the New


                                       32
<PAGE>   39

Coverage to be in full force and effect as provided in the first sentence of
this clause (b).

                 (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or, consolidates with or merges into any
other person or entity and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.8.

                 (d) For a period of two years following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to continue the (i) employee benefit
plans (including without limitation all employee benefit plans within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), practices and policies which provide employee
benefits to officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and (ii) subject to Section 4.7 hereof, compensation arrangements,
programs and plans providing employee or executive officer compensation or
benefits, to employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided,
however, that (A) the Surviving Corporation may replace the Company's Economic
Bridge Program (as such term is defined in Schedule 5.8(d)) with any other plan
or plans providing, in the aggregate, for comparable compensation or benefits,
recognizing all prior service for eligibility and vesting purposes of the
officers, directors or employees with the Company and any of its subsidiaries as
service under such Plan, (B) the Surviving Corporation may replace any plan or
plans with another plan or plans providing, in the aggregate, for comparable
compensation or benefits, as the case may be and recognizing all prior service
of the officers, directors or employees with the Company and any of its
subsidiaries as service for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for
benefit accrual purposes, under any such plans; (C) it is understood that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will have any obligation to
continue or provide comparable benefits for (x) any stock option or other plan
involving the issuance of securities of the Company or any other company, and
(y) the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans (except to the
extent of amounts deferred pursuant to such plan prior to the Effective Time,
which amounts will be administered in accordance with the terms of said plan);
and (D) the expiration of the two year period following the Effective Time will
not affect any rights or obligations under any such plan, practice policy,
arrangement or program.

                 (e) Parent agrees that the Company will honor and, on and after
the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor,
without offset, deduction, counterclaims, interruptions or deferment (other than
withholdings under



                                       33

applicable law), all employment, severance, termination, consulting and
retirement agreements or arrangements (including the Company's Economic Bridge
Plan) to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is presently a party, all
of which are disclosed on Schedule 4.7.

                 (f) Parent currently intends to cause the Surviving Corporation
to offer employment immediately following the Effective Time to all employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries on terms and conditions comparable to those
presently in effect at the Company or its subsidiaries. It is understood and
agreed that the foregoing shall not constitute any commitment, contract,
understanding or guarantee (express or implied) on the part of the Parent or
Surviving Corporation of a post-Effective Time employment relationship of any
term or duration or on any terms other than those the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may establish; accepted employment with the Surviving Corporation is
"at will" and may be terminated by the Surviving Corporation at any time for any
reason (subject to any legally binding agreement or an applicable collective
bargaining agreement or any arrangement or commitment identified on Schedule
4.7).

                 5.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company will
give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser will give
prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause (i)
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in any material
respect, and (b) any failure of the Company or Parent and Purchaser, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 will not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

                 5.10 Compliance with Antitrust Laws. Each of Parent and
the Company will use its best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, which
may be asserted with respect to the Offer or the Merger under the antitrust
laws. In the event a suit is instituted challenging the Offer or the Merger as
violative of the antitrust laws, each of Parent and the Company will use their
best efforts to resist or resolve such suit. Parent and the Company will use
their best efforts to take such action as may be required (a) by the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or any
foreign government or agency thereof, in order to resolve such objections as any
of them may have to the Offer or the Merger under applicable antitrust laws, or
(b) by any federal or state



                                       34
<PAGE>   41

court of the United States or any comparable court of Canada or any province
thereof, in any suit brought by a private party or Governmental Entity
challenging the Offer or the Merger as violative of the antitrust laws, in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order which has the effect of preventing
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

                 5.11 Publicity. The initial press release announcing
this Agreement will be a joint press release, to be issued only with the prior
consent of each party, and thereafter the Company and Parent will consult with
each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and in making
any filings with any Governmental Entity or with any national securities
exchange with respect thereto.

                 5.12 Disposition of Litigation. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agree, promptly, and in no event later than two
business days after the amendment to the Offer contemplated hereby (unless this
Agreement has been earlier terminated), to use its best efforts to obtain a
dismissal without prejudice of Luxottica Group S.p.A., et al. v. The United
States Shoe Corporation, et al., Civil Action No. C-2-95-244 (the "Ohio
Litigation") with each party bearing its own costs and attorneys' fees therefor.

                 5.13 Proxy Contests. Parent and Purchaser hereby agree
to withdraw and rescind on behalf of themselves and their affiliates and shall
promptly cause to be withdrawn and rescinded all notices and the Schedule 14A
filed with the Commission, in each case, relating to the calling of a special
meeting for the removal of the directors of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                 Shares will have duly approved the Merger and adopted this
                 Agreement, if and as required by applicable law.

                          6.1.2 Purchase of Shares. Purchaser will have accepted
                 for payment and purchased all Common Shares validly tendered
                 and not withdrawn pursuant to the


                                       35
<PAGE>   42



                 Offer; provided that this condition will be deemed to have been
                 satisfied if Purchaser fails to accept for payment or pay for
                 Common Shares pursuant to the Offer in breach of the terms
                 hereof or thereof.

                          6.1.3 Injunctions; Illegality. The consummation of the
                 Merger will not be prohibited by any order, injunction, decree
                 or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction or any
                 Governmental Entity (each party agreeing to use its best
                 efforts to rectify any such occurrence), and there will not
                 have been any action taken or any statute, rule or regulation
                 enacted, promulgated or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
                 Governmental Entity which would prevent the consummation of the
                 Merger.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned, notwithstanding any prior
approval hereof or of the Merger by the holders of the Common Shares, (a) by the
mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and (by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors) the Company; (b) by
Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, if the
Offer expires or is terminated or withdrawn without any Common Shares being
purchased thereunder; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) will not be available to any party who
is (or would, by virtue of such termination, be) in breach of this Agreement;
(c) by the Company, if Parent or Purchaser breaches any of the covenants
contained in this Agreement, except where any such breaches (i) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair or delay the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the Offer or Parent, Purchaser or the Company to effect
the Merger, or (ii) have been caused by or result from a breach by the Company
of any covenant in this Agreement; (d) by either Parent and Purchaser, on the
one hand, or the Company (by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Continuing Directors), on the other hand, if the Merger is not consummated prior
to the sixtieth calendar day following the expiration date of the Offer;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(d) will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date; (e) by either
Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, if
either one (or any permitted assignee hereunder) is precluded by an order or
injunction (other than an order or injunction issued


                                       36
<PAGE>   43

on a preliminary basis) of a court of competent jurisdiction from consummating
the Merger and all means of appeal and all appeals from such order or injunction
have been finally exhausted; and (f) by either Parent and Purchaser, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, if the Board of Directors of the
Company (i) shall have withdrawn its recommendation, consent to or approval of
the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, or (ii) determined to recommend to
holders of the Common Shares or approve a Competing Transaction in the exercise
of its Director Duty; provided, however, that the Company shall notify Parent
and Purchaser promptly of any determination by its Board of Directors to
recommend such Competing Transaction to the holders of the Common Shares or to
approve such Competing Transaction, which notice shall in any such event be
given: (A) not less than 24 hours prior to the Company's termination of this
Agreement under this clause (ii); and (B) not later than substantially
simultaneously with the first public announcement of such recommendation or
approval. In the event of any termination and abandonment pursuant to this
Section 7.1, no party hereto (or any of its directors or officers) will have any
liability or further obligation to any other party to this Agreement, except for
obligations under Section 7.10 and pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement and
except that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any breach
of this Agreement.

                 7.2 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.
The representations and warranties or agreements in this Agreement will
terminate at the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be; provided, however, that if the
Merger is consummated, Sections 2.4, 2.6 and 5.8 hereof will survive the
Effective Time to the extent contemplated by such Sections; and provided
further, that Sections 1.2(a), (f) and (g), 4.16, 5.2.12 and 7.10 will in all
events survive any termination of this Agreement.
        
                 7.3 Waiver and Amendment. Subject to the applicable
provisions of the GCL, any provision of this Agreement may be waived at any time
by the party which is, or whose shareholders are, entitled to the benefits
thereof, and this Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time, provided
that no amendment will be made after any shareholder approval of the Merger
which reduces the Merger Price without further shareholder approval, and
provided further that any action by the Company to waive or amend any provision
of this Agreement will require the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors. No such waiver, amendment or supplement will be effective unless in a
writing which makes express reference to this Section 7.3 and is signed by the
party or parties sought to be bound thereby.

                 7.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all Schedules
and Exhibits hereto, contains the entire agreement

                 7.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by

                 7.11 Obligation of Parent. Whenever this Agreement

requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to take such action.

         contained in the Merger Agreement, which is qualified as to
         materiality, shall not be true and correct, or any such representation
         or warranty that is not so qualified, shall not be true and correct in
         any respect which is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
         effect on the business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or
         condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole, in each case either as of when made or as of such

                 (f)  the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant 
         to its terms; or

                 (g) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have amended,

         recommendation that the holders of Common Shares authorize the purchase
         of Common Shares by the Purchaser for purposes of Section 831, (v)
         recommendation of acceptance of the Offer, the tender of Common Shares
         pursuant to the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement and
         the Merger by the holders of Common Shares, (vi) actions taken as
         contemplated by Section 1704.02(A) of the Ohio Revised Code in order to

         in the Rights Agreement) for purposes of the Rights Agreement (the
         "Recommendation") or shall have failed to publicly reconfirm such
         Recommendation upon the request of Luxottica Group or the Purchaser,
         which is reasonable in the circumstances, or shall have approved or
         recommended any of the following involving the Company or any of it
         subsidiaries: (A) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
         combination or other similar transaction; (B) any sale, lease,
         exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
         the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
         single transaction or series of transactions (except in respect of the
         sale of the Company's Footwear Group to Footwear Acquisition Corp.,
         pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 15, 1995,
         among the Company, Nine West Group Inc. and Footwear Acquisition
         Corp.); or (C) any tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of
         the shares of capital stock of the Company or the filing of a
         registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection
         with any such exchange offer; or shall have resolved to do any of the
         foregoing;

which, in the good faith sole judgment of Luxottica Group or the Purchaser, in
any such case and regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such
condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or such acceptance for
payment or purchase of or payment for any of the Shares.

         The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Luxottica Group
and the Purchaser. The foregoing conditions, other than the Minimum Share
Condition and the Control Share


                                       A-3

Condition, may be waived by the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time in its sole judgment. The failure of Luxottica Group or the
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
