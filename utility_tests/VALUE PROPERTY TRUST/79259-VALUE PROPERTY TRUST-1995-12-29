ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

                                   GENERAL

     Value Property Trust (the "Trust") is a Maryland real estate investment
trust (a "REIT") engaged in the business of managing its portfolio of
mortgage loans and real estate investments.  The Trust was organized in 1970
as PNB Mortgage and Realty Investors.  In 1984, the Trust changed its name to
Mortgage and Realty Trust.  In October 1995, the Trust changed its name to
Value Property Trust.  The Trust is organized under an Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust dated September 29, 1995 and as amended through October
26, 1995 (the "Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust"), and conducts its
business in such a fashion as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

     As of September 30, 1995, the Trust had:  (1) cash and cash equivalents
of $16.8 million; and (2) invested assets consisting of 31 mortgage loans and
38 investments in real estate owned.  Based upon the amounts of the Trust's
investments as of September 30, 1995, approximately 51% of the Trust's
portfolio was in investments in California, 18% in Pennsylvania and 12% in
New England states.  Nationally, 38% of the amounts of its investments are in
industrial or research and development properties, 19% in office buildings,
32% in shopping centers, 10% in apartments and 1% in other types of real
estate investments.

     PREVIOUS CHAPTER 11 CASE AND 1991 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     On April 12, 1990, the Trust filed a voluntary petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Central District of California (the "Bankruptcy Court"), commencing a
bankruptcy case, Bankruptcy Case No. LA 90-08976-SB (the "Prior Bankruptcy
Case").  On November 21, 1990, a Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "1991
Plan") proposed by the Trust, the creditors' committee and the equity
committee was filed with the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to section 1121 of the
Bankruptcy Code.  The 1991 Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court by an
order entered February 27, 1991.  The Prior Bankruptcy Case was closed on
November 4, 1994, pursuant to a final order of the Bankruptcy Court.

     The 1991 Plan provided that the holders of outstanding indebtedness were
to receive payments in installments over a period ending on June 30, 1995,
with the right of the Trust to defer payment of certain amounts for up to
twenty-four months or until December 31, 1995, when all deferred payments
would be due. Interest was payable initially at Bank of America N.T. & S.A.'s
reference rate plus one percent, increasing by 0.25% every six months, with
interest on deferred amounts accruing at the adjusted rate plus two percent.
The 1991 Plan also included certain financial, affirmative and negative
covenants.  The forecast upon which the 1991 Plan was based assumed that the
real estate markets would begin to improve in fiscal 1992.  However, the
markets continued to deteriorate materially.  Despite these conditions, the
Trust was able to make all required interest payments and to exceed the
required amortization payments through December 31, 1991.  These results were
achieved through liquidating Trust assets at substantial discounts from their
acquisition cost.  However, due to the continued deterioration of the real
estate markets, the Trust could not meet the amortization payment at June 30,
1992, which required the Trust to reduce the debt to $291,250,000, taking
into account deferrals permitted under the 1991 Plan.  This deterioration
also precluded the Trust from maintaining compliance with the financial
covenants of the 1991 Plan.  Thus, the Trust determined that it was necessary
to defer a portion of the principal payments on the outstanding debt and
limit certain future cash interest payments to allow sufficient time for
liquidity to return to the United States real estate market. Such deferral
was accomplished by an out-of-court modification to the 1991 Plan (the "1992
Restructuring").

     THE 1992 RESTRUCTURING

     Pursuant to the Trust's negotiations with the creditors' committee, on
June 15, 1992, the Trust commenced a solicitation of acceptances to certain
modifications (the "1992 Modifications") to the outstanding debt obligations
of the Trust and to a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the "Proposed 1992
Plan") to effect the 1992 Modifications.  The 1992 Modifications to the
outstanding debt obligations provided, among other things, for (i) an
increased amount of required principal payments that could be deferred (while
retaining the final payment date for deferred payments at December 31, 1995),
(ii) an extension of the permitted repayment period of such deferred amounts
from 24 months to 30 months from the date a deferral is utilized, (iii) the
establishment of a limit on the maximum rate of interest to be paid in cash
on a current basis at 9% through June 30, 1994, with any excess being accrued
and paid at December 31, 1995, (iv) changes in certain required financial
covenants to reflect the then-existing financial condition of the Trust and
the then-existing real estate market, (v) with the approval of the holders of
66-2/3% of the outstanding debt obligations, the release of collateral for
certain financings by the Trust, and (vi) the payment of additional
consideration to the holders of the outstanding debt obligations equal to one
percent of the principal amount of the outstanding debt obligations, payable
in four semi-annual installments commencing on the date the 1992
Restructuring became effective.  The Trust received 100% acceptance of the
1992 Modifications and, on July 15, 1992, the Trust successfully restructured
its outstanding debt by issuance of new notes in accordance with the proposed
1992 Modifications (the "Old Notes") and entered into an indenture (the "Old
Note Indenture") with Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee (the "Old Note
Trustee"), entered into a second amendment to the Trust's then outstanding
Collateral and Security Agreement dated as of February 21, 1991 (as amended,
the "Old Collateral Agreement") and amended the 1991 Plan (as amended
pursuant to the 1992 Restructuring, the "Prior Plan").

     RECENT CHAPTER 11 CASE AND 1995 PREPACKAGED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     The financial projections upon which the 1992 Restructuring was based
assumed that the real estate markets would stop or slow their decline by 1993
with some improvement in 1994.  Instead, after the effective date of the 1992
Restructuring, these markets failed to improve materially.  The Trust's
business operations, including its ongoing efforts to refinance and sell
property, did not generate cash flow sufficient to service the Old Notes
during the fiscal years ended September 30, 1993 and 1994.  Because its
operating income had declined due to the continued deterioration of the real
estate markets, the Trust was not able to meet its scheduled June 30, 1993
principal payment on the Old Notes of $20,000,000, and subsequently the Trust
also failed to make additional principal payments, constituting events of
default under the Old Note Indenture.  The Trust also failed to make interest
payments on the Old Notes. In addition, the Trust failed to meet certain
ratios set forth in the financial covenants of the Old Note Indenture which
constituted additional events of default under the Old Note Indenture.

     Throughout the second and third quarters of fiscal 1994, the Trust's
management and advisors continued discussions with certain principal holders
of the Old Notes and their representatives to explore various alternatives
for restructuring the Old Notes.  In March 1994, the principal holders
requested that the Trust agree to pay certain fees and expenses of legal
counsel to the principal holders.  The Trust agreed, and in March 1994, the
principal holders retained counsel to advise them in the Trust's financial
restructuring. Thereafter, in June 1994, the principal holders requested and
the Trust agreed to pay certain fees and expenses of a new financial advisor
to the principal holders.  The negotiations among the Trust, the various
creditor constituencies and other interested parties in the Trust's financial
restructuring continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994.

     On November 17, 1994, the Trust announced that it had reached a
non-binding agreement in principle with the Old Note holders to restructure
the indebtedness represented by the Old Notes (the "1995 Restructuring").

     Under the 1995 Restructuring, the Trust and the Board of Trustees
recommended to the Old Note holders that the Trust utilize a "prepackaged
plan" of reorganization (the "Prepackaged Plan") governed by Chapter 11 title
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (the "Bankruptcy Code").
The use of the Prepackaged Plan allowed the Trust, the Board of Trustees and
holders of the Old Notes to agree in advance on the method and course

                                      - 2 -

<PAGE>

of restructuring prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition in Chapter
11. To this end, the Trust and certain holders who had acquired a significant
portion of the Old Notes entered into an agreement of understanding (the
"Agreement of Understanding") pursuant to which the Trust agreed to
distribute to the holders of the Old Notes $25 million in cash prior to the
Prepackaged Plan's petition date.  Under this agreement, the principal
holders (who held in excess of 80% of the Old Notes), among other things,
agreed to vote in favor of the Prepackaged Plan when solicited.  On April 11,
1995, the Trust paid $25.0 million pursuant to the Agreement of
Understanding, with such payment to be credited against the cash payment of
at least $50.0 million to be made to the holders of the Old Notes pursuant to
the Prepackaged Plan.

     On July 12, 1995, the Trust mailed to each holder of Old Notes,
outstanding common shares, other secured claims and unsecured claims
(collectively, the "Holders") as of the close of business on July 7, 1995
(the "Record Date"), a copy of the Disclosure Statement and Proxy Statement
for the Solicitation of Votes for the Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization (the
"Disclosure Statement").

     Pursuant to the Disclosure Statement, the solicitation of ballots in
favor of the Prepackaged Plan expired at midnight (New York time) on August
17, 1995. On August 18, 1995, the Trust filed a voluntary petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court commencing a
bankruptcy case, Bankruptcy Case No. LA 95-31101-SB.  The Prepackaged Plan
was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court by an order entered September 22, 1995.
The Trust entered into an amended and restated indenture (the "New
Indenture") with Wilmington Trust Company as trustee, an amended and restated
collateral and security agreement (the "New Security Agreement"), a pledge
agreement (the "Pledge Agreement"), and a registration rights agreement (the
"Registration Rights Agreement").  The Prepackaged Plan became effective
September 29, 1995 (the "Effective Date") and provided for, among other
things, (i) a 1 for 33.33 reverse stock split of the outstanding common
shares affecting the shareholders of record as of September 29, 1995, and
(ii) the issuance to holders of the Trust's debt securities:  (a)
$110,000,000 principal amount of newly issued 11-1/8% Senior Secured Notes
due 2002 (the "Senior Notes"), (b) $71,000,000 in cash and (c) approximately
10,889,430 new common shares, par value $1.00 per share, representing, in the
aggregate, approximately 97% of the common shares outstanding after the
Effective Date (all common shares outstanding after the Effective Date
hereinafter referred to as the "Common Shares").

     BUSINESS PLAN

     Since emerging from bankruptcy on September 29, 1995, the Trust has not
yet formulated a long-term strategic plan.  The Trust's current plan is to
evaluate each of its assets and identify, over the next one to two years, a
core portfolio of properties to retain and operate or to offer for sale, with
a view to maximizing the Trust's overall return to investors.

     The Trust's core portfolio may focus on one or more property types or on
specific geographical regions, in each case where the Trust believes
opportunities for appreciation exist.  It may seek to make improvements to
such properties in order to maximize their value, or may hold properties when
it believes them to be undervalued.

     Management may from time to time determine to sell one or more
properties consistent with the Trust's goal of focusing its holdings on a
core portfolio. In addition, the Trust may receive unsolicited bids for one
or more properties and will consider such bids in light of management's
assessment of such factors as the price offered for the properties, their
possibility for future appreciation and/or the current return to the Trust
from operating such properties, and the fit of such properties with the
Trust's remaining portfolio of core properties.

     The Trust may also, from time to time, identify new properties for
acquisition or make investments as opportunities arise, in each case
consistent with the Trust's definition of its core portfolio.

     In addition to reviewing each of its properties, the Trust is currently
assessing its mortgage loan portfolio, with a view to identifying and
formulating a plan of action with respect to non-performing loans and loans
that are unlikely to be collected in a timely manner.  Performing loans may
be retained by the Trust for their current yield

                                      - 3 -

<PAGE>

and the Trust may, from time to time, solicit bulk sale bids for some or all
of its non-performing and/or performing loans.

     As of September 30, 1995 the Trust had cash and marketable securities
valued at approximately $16.8 million.  The Trust intends to use such funds,
together with funds from operations and net proceeds from the sale of assets,
to make appropriate capital and tenant improvements to its properties and to
make acquisitions of new properties from time to time as described above.
Pending such use, the Trust will use its funds to reduce leverage by
repaying, redeeming or repurchasing its indebtedness or to make other
investments (including investments in the Trust's Common Shares), subject to
the terms of its debt instruments as in effect from time to time.

     COMPETITION, REGULATION, AND OTHER FACTORS

     The success of the Trust depends upon, among other factors, general
economic conditions and trends, including real estate trends, interest rates,
government regulations and legislation, income tax laws and zoning laws.

     The Trust's real estate investments are located in markets in which they
face significant competition.  Many of the Trust's investments, particularly
the office buildings, are located in markets which have an over-supply of
available space, resulting in intense competition for tenants and low rents.

     GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

     The Trust's properties are subject to various federal, state and local
regulatory requirements such as local building codes and other similar
regulations.  The Trust believes that the properties are currently in
substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, although
expenditures at properties owned by the Trust may be required to comply with
changes in these laws.  No material expenditures are contemplated at this
time in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

     The Trust believes that it is in compliance in all material respects
with all federal, state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic
substances, and the Trust has not been notified by any governmental authority
of any noncompliance or other claim in connection with any of its present or
former properties.  To date, compliance with federal, state and local
environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect upon the
Trust.

     OTHER INFORMATION

     As of September 30, 1995, the Trust employed 25 people.  The Trust is
currently in the process of assessing and redeploying its employees.  As
such, the number of employees of the Trust will be fluctuating for the first
quarter of fiscal 1996.  The Trust's current business constitutes a single
business segment.  The Trust is not dependent upon a single tenant or a
limited number of tenants.

     The Trust's principal offices are currently located at 120 Albany
Street, 8th Floor, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901 and 22120 Clarendon
Street, Suite 230, Woodland Hills, California 91367; the Trust's telephone
numbers are (908) 296-3080 and (818) 594-8586, respectively.

INVESTMENTS

     Although the Trust has continued to fund previously existing investment
commitments and to fund limited tenant improvements and similar investments
necessary to retain or obtain tenants, the Trust has not made any new
investments in loans or properties since its Prior Bankruptcy Case filing,
but it has continued to manage its investment portfolio.

     Loans are secured by first or junior mortgages as well as mortgages
secured by leaseholds.  Loans made by the Trust are secured by mortgages on
income-producing properties, including office buildings, shopping centers,

                                      - 4 -

<PAGE>

industrial projects, apartments and condominium projects.  When the Trust
made investments, it abided by various restrictions consisting principally of
loan-to-value ratios, investment ranges and percentage of total assets
invested in loans to a single borrower.

     The Trust's investments are primarily located in major metropolitan
areas throughout the United States.  As of September 30, 1995, the Trust held
investments in mortgage loans, investments in real estate and other interests
in real properties located in 18 states.

     The following pages contain summaries of the Trust's investments at
September 30, 1995.

FRESH START REPORTING

     In connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings, the Trust
implemented Fresh Start Reporting as provided in Statement of Position 90-7,
"Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code"
("Fresh Start Reporting").  As a result, as of September 30, 1995 all assets
were recorded at reorganization value and all liabilities were recorded to
reflect their fair value.  For additional information on this reporting
method, see Note 1 - "Basis of Financial Information and Plan of
Reorganization" in the Notes to the Financial Statements.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.

INVESTED ASSETS

     The Trust has 69 assets under management consisting of 31 loans and 38
real estate investments.  At September 30, 1995, as a result of the approval
of the Trust's Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, the carrying amount of all
assets have been restated in accordance with Fresh Start Reporting.  The
Trust has classified these assets as follows:

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     A discussion of events surrounding the Trust's Prior Bankruptcy Case and
an explanation of the material terms of the Trust's reorganization under the
1991 Plan are set forth in the section entitled "Previous Chapter 11 Case and
1991 Plan of Reorganization" under Item 1 above.  The Prior Bankruptcy Case
was closed on November 4, 1994 pursuant to a final order of the Bankruptcy
Court.

     A discussion of events surrounding the Trust's 1995 prepackaged bankruptcy
filing and an explanation of the material terms of the Trust's reorganization
under the Prepackaged Plan are set forth in the section entitled

                                      - 8 -

<PAGE>

"Recent Chapter 11 Case and 1995 Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization" under
Item 1 above. Notwithstanding the confirmation of the Trust's Prepackaged
Plan, as of September 29, 1995, the bankruptcy court continued to have
jurisdiction among other things, to resolve disputes that may arise under the
Prepackaged Plan.

     A third party has alleged the existence of a purchase contract with
respect to one of the Trust's properties which the Trust disputes.  This
dispute may lead to litigation, but the Trust believes that any such
litigation would not have a material effect on earnings or business prospects
of the Trust.

ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     On July 12, 1995 the Disclosure Statement was mailed to the shareholders
of the Trust pursuant to a consent solicitation for votes for the Prepackaged
Plan. The Disclosure Statement described the 1995 Restructuring pursuant to
the Prepackaged Plan.

     The consent solicitation expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time,
on August 17, 1995.  The following is a summary of the results of the ballots
received from the classes that were solicited: (i) Class 2 - Claims of
holders of Old Notes - 24 out of 24 claims voted in favor of the Prepackaged
Plan; (ii) Class 4 - Unsecured Claims - the entire $368,561.67 amount of
claims was voted in favor of the Prepackaged Plan; and (iii) Class 5 -
Interest of holders of outstanding common shares - 5,384,146 out of
10,260,215 of the outstanding common shares were voted, 5,221,355 in favor
and 162,791 against the Prepackaged Plan.

     On or about October 5, 1995, in response to a mailing of consent
requests on or about October 4, 1995 to the holders of approximately 97% of
the Trust's outstanding Common Shares, the Trust had received the written
consent of 85.29% of the Trust's outstanding Common Shares approving an
amendment to the Trust's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust changing
the Trust's name to "Value Property Trust."  Subsequently, on or about
October 6, 1995, the Trust mailed a 14-C Information Statement describing
this vote to all of the holders of the Trust's outstanding Common Shares.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON SHARES AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS.

     (a)  MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDENDS

     The Trust's Common Shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "VLP", and until October 27, 1995 they were traded
under the symbol "MRT".  No dividends have been declared by the Trust in the
past two years.  The following table shows the high and low sales prices for
each fiscal quarter during the past two years:

                                         High       Low
                                         ----       ---

               Second Quarter . . . . .   3/8       3/16
               Third Quarter  . . . . . 11/32       7/32
               Fourth Quarter . . . . . 11/32       9/32
          1994
               First Quarter  . . . . . $ 5/8      $ 3/8
               Second Quarter . . . . .   5/8        3/8
               Third Quarter  . . . . .   1/2        3/8
               Fourth Quarter . . . . .   1/2        1/4

On October 2, 1995, pursuant to the conditions of the Prepackaged Plan, the
Trust directed the New York Stock Exchange to effectuate a 1 for 33.33
reverse stock split of the Trust's outstanding common shares which resulted
in a reduction of the Trust's outstanding common shares from approximately
11,226,215 to approximately 336,820.  Simultaneously, and also pursuant to
the conditions of the Prepackaged Plan in exchange for the release of certain
debt by the Trust's noteholders, the Trust directed the New York Stock
Exchange to issue approximately 10,890,180 new Common Shares.  The combined
result of these actions by the Trust on the New York Stock Exchange is that,
as of October 2, 1995, substantially the same amount of Common Shares are
authorized and outstanding as before the reverse stock split and issuance of
new Common Shares and on October 2, 1995 the Trust's Common Shares were
trading at $10 1/2.

     The Trust incurred net operating losses ("NOLs") of $35 million, $38
million, $31 million and $12 million for tax purposes in fiscal 1994, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.  The Trust estimates a net operating loss before
cancellation of indebtedness ("COD") income for tax purposes of approximately
$41 million for fiscal 1995.  Beginning with fiscal 1996, NOLs available to
offset taxable income in future years will be approximately $82 million after
the recognition for tax purposes of the COD income of approximately $75
million. These NOLs will be subject to the Code Section 382 annual
limitations on the use of the NOLs.  The Trust estimates this annual
limitation to be approximately $6 million with any portion of the Section 382
limitation not used in any taxable year carried forward up to fifteen years.

     After the recognition of the COD income, the remaining NOLs available
will be $9 million, $38 million and $35 million from fiscal 1992, 1993 and
1994, respectively.

     (b)  HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES

     There were approximately 4,700 record holders of the Trust's Common
Shares at December 20, 1995.

     (c)  The Trust did not declare or pay any dividends during either the
fiscal year ended September 30, 1995 or the fiscal year ended September 30,
1994.  In addition, the New Indenture governing the New Notes

                                      - 10 -

<PAGE>

prohibits the Trust from declaring or making any dividends to shareholders
other than dividends required for the Trust to maintain its REIT status
unless the Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the New Indenture) of the
Trust at the time of such payment and after giving effect thereto is at least
$50 million; provided, however, that the Trust shall in no event declare or
make any such payment or other distribution if a Default or Event of Default
(as defined in the New Indenture) has occurred and is continuing under the
New Indenture.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

     Value Property Trust is a Maryland REIT engaged in the business of
managing its portfolio of mortgage loans and real estate investments.  On
October 26, 1995, the Trust's name was changed from Mortgage and Realty Trust
to Value Property Trust.  On September 29, 1995, the Trust's Prepackaged Plan
of Reorganization was declared effective by the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Central District of California.

     Under the Prepackaged Plan, holders of the Trust's $290,000,000
principal amount of Old Notes received:  (i) $110,000,000 principal amount of
newly issued Senior Notes; (ii) $71,000,000 in cash; and (iii) approximately
10,889,430 new Common Shares representing in the aggregate approximately 97%
of the Common Shares outstanding after the Effective Date.  In connection
with the Prepackaged Plan, the Trust effected a 1 for 33.33 reverse stock
split of its outstanding common shares.

     In connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings, the Trust
implemented Fresh Start Reporting as of September 30, 1995.  Fresh Start
Reporting was required because:  (1) the reorganization value of the Trust's
assets immediately before the date of confirmation was less than the total of
all post-petition liabilities; (2) there was more than a 50% change in the
ownership of the Trust; and (3) there was a permanent and substantive loss of
control by existing shareholders.  As a result, all assets and liabilities
were restated to reflect their appropriate carrying value.  The September 30,
1995 balance sheet amounts have been segregated by a black line in order to
signify that the balance sheet is that of a new reporting entity and has been
prepared on a basis not comparable to the pre-confirmation balance sheets.
(See "Note 1, Notes to Financial Statements" for additional information
concerning Fresh Start Reporting).

     The following section includes a discussion and analysis of the results
of operations on a pre-confirmation basis, for the years ended September 30,
1995, 1994 and 1993.  The Trust has, for the past several years, reported
significant net losses.  As a result of the restructuring, past results
should not be indicative of future operating performance.  Future results of
operations of the Trust will not be comparable to the historical operating
performance.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Trust reported a net loss for fiscal 1995 of $20.0 million.  The
loss includes:  (1) reorganization items for professional fees, interest
income and an adjustment that reduced invested assets by $66.6 million as a
result of adopting Fresh Start Reporting; and (2) an extraordinary item of
$75.3 million reflecting the gain on extinguishment of debt.  The Trust's
loss from operations before the reorganization items and the extraordinary
item was $23.0 million. The 1995 loss includes a provision for losses of $3.0
million and interest expense accrued of $35.9 million.  The Trust reported a
net loss for fiscal 1994 of $21.6 million compared to a net loss of $54.0
million for fiscal 1993.  The 1994 loss includes a provision for losses of
$2.0 million compared to a provision for losses of $37.0 million in 1993.
Reorganization expense was $2.4 million in 1994 compared to $5.8 million in
1993.

     Interest and fee income on mortgage loans was $9.4 million for fiscal
1995 compared to $14.7 million in fiscal 1994.  The decrease results
primarily from a reduction in earning mortgage loans which averaged $97.8
million for fiscal 1995 compared to $131.4 million for fiscal 1994.  During
fiscal 1995, mortgage loans of approximately $10.9 million were transferred
to real estate and $22.7 million have been repaid.  Interest and fee income
decreased from $19.0 million in 1993 to $14.7 million in fiscal 1994.  The
decrease resulted primarily from repayment of mortgage loans which totalled
$25.5 million and the transfer of $13.1 million of loans to real estate owned.

     Rental income was $24.6 million for fiscal 1995 compared to $18.5
million for fiscal 1994 and $17.4 million for fiscal 1993.  In addition to
rental income, the Trust received reimbursement of certain operating expenses
totalling $2.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.  Operating expenses and depreciation and amortization
on rental properties increased to $19.0 million in fiscal 1995 compared to
$15.7 million for both fiscal 1994 and 1993.  The increases in income and
expenses on rental properties results from continued acquisition of real
estate properties and improvement in occupancy levels.

     Interest on short-term investments was $3.5 million in 1995 compared to
$1.2 million and $.2 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The increase in fiscal 1995 was due to the continuing accumulation of
available cash.  Available cash averaged $57.6 million for fiscal 1995
compared to $32 million and $8.6 million in fiscal years 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The increase results from the fact that the Trust made no
payment (interest or principal) on the Old Notes since September 30, 1993.
On April 11, 1995 the Trust made a $25.0 million payment and on September 29,
1995 an additional $46 million payment was made to Old Note holders.  At
September 30, 1995 cash and cash equivalents were $16.8 million, including
restricted cash for borrowers deposits and the Trust's termination pay plan.

     Interest expense accrued for fiscal 1995 totalled $35.9 million compared
to $33.0 million and $28.5 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The Trust's average borrowing rate for fiscal 1995 was 13.3%
compared to 10.7% and 9.2% for fiscal years 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
unamortized cost of restructuring of Old Notes totalling $3.4 million was
charged off during fiscal 1993 as a result of the monetary default.

     As a result of implementing Fresh Start Reporting, the Trust wrote down
its real estate investments by $66.6 million to reorganization value.  In
addition, net reorganization expenses incurred by the Trust were $5.8 million
in fiscal 1995, compared to $2.4 million and $5.8 million in fiscal years
1994 and 1993, respectively.

     The Trust recorded a $75.3 million extraordinary item-gain on
extinguishment of debt against interest and principal due of $331.4 million
on the Old Notes.

     Other operating expenses declined to $4.5 million for fiscal 1995 from
$4.8 million and $5.3 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and
expenses.

     A $3.0 million provision for losses was established in the current
fiscal year compared to a provision of $2.0 million in 1994 and $37.0 million
in 1993. The Trustees review the investment portfolio quarterly using current
estimates and assumptions to determine the adequacy of the allowance for
losses.  The estimates and assumptions used in the valuation process are
subject to changes which may be material.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Prior to its 1995 Restructuring, the Trust faced significant liquidity
problems.  The Trust did not generate sufficient cash flow from normal
operations and was not able to liquidate mortgage loans and real estate
investments in order to meet scheduled amortization on its Old Notes.  As a
result of the 1995 Restructuring, the Trust should no longer have the
liquidity problems that it faced in the past years.  Funds from operations
should be sufficient to meet minimum debt service requirements.  In the near
term, capital expenditure needs will be met through liquidation of existing
assets and the cash available at September 30, 1995.  The Trust may, in the
future, seek to raise additional capital through issuance of equity
securities and/or the incurring of additional indebtedness for the purpose of
meeting additional capital expenditures or retiring the New Notes.

     The New Indenture restricts the payment of dividends, other than such
declaration and making of dividend payments that the Trust deems necessary to
preserve its status as a REIT, unless the Consolidated Net Worth (as defined
in the New Indenture) of the Trust at the time of such payment and after
giving effect thereto is at least $50 million; provided, however, that the
Trust shall in no event declare or make any such dividend payment or other

                                      - 14 -

<PAGE>

distribution if a Default or Event of Default (as defined in the New
Indenture) has occurred and is continuing.  Under the Code, the Trust must
distribute 95% of its "REIT taxable income" to its shareholders to continue
to qualify as a REIT.

     Taxable income required to be distributed will be less than financial
reporting under generally accepted accounting principles due to differences
related to depreciation, use of NOLs (subject to the Code Section 382
limitations) and timing differences related to bad debt deductions.

     The New Indenture contains various affirmative, negative and financial
covenants including limitations on investments.

ITEM 11.  TRUSTEE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

     COMPENSATION OF FORMER NON-OFFICER TRUSTEES

     During the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995, the Trustees received as
compensation for their services as Trustees an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
$800 for each regular monthly Trustee meeting attended in person or conducted by
telephone conference; $600 for each committee meeting attended in person; and
$400 for any Trustee or committee meeting, other than the regular, monthly
Trustee meeting, convened by telephone conference; except that no additional
compensation was paid for attendance at any committee meeting held on the same
day as any Trustee meeting.  An additional $100 fee was payable per meeting to
the chairman of any committee.

     On September 20, 1989, the Trustees adopted the Pension Plan for Trustees,
effective October 1, 1989.  Trustees become eligible for plan benefits upon
completion of five years of service as Trustee, including years served prior to
the plan's effective date.  Under the plan, each eligible Trustee will be
entitled to a normal retirement benefit equal to the annual retainer for
Trustees at the rate in effect on the Trustee's normal retirement date or, if
earlier, the Trustee's last day of Board membership.  On April 5, 1995, the
Board of Trustees amended the pension plan for Trustees to provide that should
any Trustee's service terminate for any reason within one year after the
Effective Date of the Prepackaged Plan, such terminated Trustee shall receive a
one-time single-sum cash payment equal in amount to the net present value of the
maximum aggregate projected benefit obligation of the Trust to that Trustee.  No
other death benefits became payable on behalf of any Trustee under the plan.
All former Trustees received lump sum distributions in connection with the
termination of their service under the Prepackaged Plan.

<PAGE>

     COMPENSATION OF CURRENT NON-OFFICER TRUSTEES

     Current Trustees receive $750 for each meeting and, in lieu of an annual
retainer, the Trustees will be granted options to purchase Common Shares under
the proposed 1995 Common Share Option Plan, as described in "1995 Common Share
Option Plan".  The Pension Plan for the Trustees, as currently in effect, would
provide no retirement benefits for the current Trustees because they receive no
annual retainer.

     The following table provides information about the compensation for the
Chief Executive Officers and the four other most highly compensated officers of
the Trust for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995, 1994, 1993
(collectively, the "Named Executive Officers").

     YEAR 1995 AND FISCAL YEAR-END 1995 OPTION VALUES

     All options outstanding at the time of the Effective Date of the
Prepackaged Plan were cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Prepackaged Plan,
and no options were granted or exercised in fiscal year 1995.

     EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLAN

     On September 20, 1989, the Trustees adopted an Employees' Retirement Plan
effective September 30, 1989.  On December 16, 1992, the Trustees amended and
restated the Employees' Retirement Plan effective January 1, 1992 (as amended on
July 20, 1994, and effective January 1, 1994 and as may be further amended, the
"Retirement Plan").  All employees are eligible to participate in the Retirement
Plan provided that they are at least 21 years of age and have been employed for
twelve consecutive months, during which period the employee has completed at
least 1000 hours of service.  Under the Retirement Plan, each eligible employee
after completing five years of vesting service becomes 100% vested and entitled
to a retirement pension.  Benefits can be paid as a lump sum or as an annual
retirement income for life equal to the greater of (a) the sum of (i) 1.3% of
the highest five-year average annual base salary, multiplied by the number of
years of credited service up to and including 35 thereof and (ii) 0.4% of the
highest five-year average annual base salary in excess of Social Security
covered compensation (as adjusted every five years), multiplied by the number of
years of credited service up to and including 35 thereof or (b) the sum of (i)
1.3% of the highest five-year average annual base salary, multiplied by the
number of credited service up to and including 15 thereof; (ii) 1.5% of the
highest five-year average annual base salary, multiplied by the number of years
of credited service from 16 to 25 years inclusive; (iii) 0.5% of the highest
five-year average annual base salary, multiplied by the number of years of
credited service from 26 to 35 years inclusive; and (iv) 0.4% of the highest
five-year average annual base salary in excess of Social Security covered
compensation (as adjusted every five years), multiplied by the number of years
of credited service up to and including 25 thereof.

     In November 1995, the Trustees amended the Retirement Plan effective
January 1, 1996 to switch from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest
rate used for valuing lump sum distributions to the new General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade interest rate and mortality table for valuing lump sum
distributions.  As a result of this amendment, the current market value of
Retirement Plan assets approximates the current aggregate lump sum amounts due
to participants.

     Unreduced retirement benefits may begin to be paid at normal retirement
(age 65 and five years of participation in the Retirement Plan), late
retirement, or five years prior to Social Security retirement age with 20 years
of service.

     The table below shows the estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement
under the Trust's Retirement Plan.  Retirement benefits shown are based upon
retirement at age 65 and the payment of a straight life annuity to the employee.
The annual benefit under the Retirement Plan will not exceed the lesser of
$112,221 or 100% of the participant's average compensation for three consecutive
Fiscal Years (as defined in the Retirement Plan) in which such eligible employee
is an active participant in the Retirement Plan.

     For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995, the base salary for purposes
of the Retirement Plan for Named Executive Officers is set forth in the salary
column of the Summary Compensation Table.  The Named Executive Officers were
credited with years of service under the Retirement Plan as follows:  Mr.
Dalton, 13 years; Mr. Hennessey, 24 years; Mr. Burnes, 6 years; and Mr.
Zoffinger 0 years.  Mr. Strong and Mr. Schlesinger did not participate in the
Retirement Plan.

     The benefits listed in the Pension Plan Table are not subject to reduction
for Social Security or other offset amounts.

     SAVINGS INCENTIVE PLAN

     On September 20, 1989, the Trustees adopted a Savings Incentive Plan
effective September 30, 1989, to provide retirement benefits for eligible
employees of the Trust.  On December 16, 1992, the Trustees amended and restated
the Savings Incentive Plan effective January 1, 1992 and the current Board of
Trustees further amended the Plan on October 2, 1995 (as amended, the "Savings
Plan").  As of October 2, 1995, all other employees of the Trust are eligible to
participate in the Savings Plan immediately upon employment.  Under the Savings
Plan, each eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions of not less than
1% nor more than 15% of the employee's earnings before bonus income, not to
exceed the dollar limit permissible under the Code ($9,240 in 1995).  The Trust
will match each employee's contribution for the payroll period, subject to a
limitation of 6% of the employee's compensation for the payroll period, with the
maximum amount of contribution by the Trust in any year being $3,000.

     Benefits will be paid to terminating participants as soon as possible
following the participant's date of termination.  Participants have a 100%
nonforfeitable right to their contributions to the Savings Plan and the Trust's
matching contributions vest at the rate of 20% for each year of service, but
will, in any event, be 100% vested at the later of age 65 or after five years of
participation in the Savings Plan, or in the event of disability or death.
Subject to certain limitations, hardship distributions of a participant's fully
vested account balance are permitted on account of a demonstrable, immediate and
heavy financial need.

     EMPLOYEE RETENTION PLAN

     The Trustees adopted an Employee Retention Plan as amended, dated
October 17, 1990, as amended January 16, 1991 and March 20, 1991 (the "Retention
Plan"), designed to provide a financial incentive for key employees to
successfully restructure the Trust and maximize the net worth of the Trust.  The
Retention Plan was approved by the Bankruptcy Court by order dated February 26,
1991.

     The Retention Plan is administered by the Compensation and Nominating
Committee which determines the allocation of amounts among the participants.
Victor H. Schlesinger, former Chairman, and C.W. Strong, Jr., former Chief
Executive Officer, did not participate in the Retention Plan.

     Two portions of the Retention Plan as originally adopted remain in place.
The first portion of the Retention Plan provides for a termination pay plan (the
"Termination Pay Plan") that will remain in effect during the period ending on
the later of (i) the
                                      - 20-
<PAGE>
date that the obligations (including, without limitation,
interest accrued from and after January 31, 1991) payable by the Trust to or for
the benefit of any creditor holding a "Class 3 Claim" under the 1992 amendment
to the Trust's 1991 Plan are no longer outstanding (the "Original Effective
Period"), (ii) the maturity date of the Trust's New Notes, or (iii) the date on
which the New Notes are repaid in full (periods set forth in (i)-(iii),
collectively, are referred to as the "Effective Period").  Any eligible employee
who is terminated without Cause (as defined in the Retention Plan) during the
Effective Period will be entitled to termination pay of not less than 12 weeks
and not more than 18 months salary depending on the employee's years of
employment and position with the Trust.  The number of months salary for Messrs.
Dalton, Hennessey and Burnes are 18, 18 and 12, respectively.  Medical and
dental coverage will be continued during any termination pay period.

     On September 30, 1995, the Trust expensed the $1.3 million representing the
cost of the Termination Pay Plan.  After fiscal year end, the majority of
existing employees were terminated and the Trust commenced payments to such
employees.

     The second portion of the Retention Plan is an incentive program which may
provide total incentive payments during the Original Effective Period of not
more than $1,250,000.  On September 16, 1992, the Compensation and Nominating
Committee approved a continuation of the incentive program for calendar year
1993 based on a formula for reducing the Trust's outstanding indebtedness.
Under this incentive program, because the Trust's outstanding indebtedness was
no greater than $290,000,000 at December 31, 1992, $125,000 was deposited in the
pool.  Similarly, $125,000 was deposited in the pool at December 31, 1993 and
December 31, 1994.  The amounts paid from the pool to the Named Executive
Officers for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are
included in the Summary Compensation Table.

     1995 COMMON SHARE OPTION PLAN

     The Board of Trustees has adopted the 1995 Common Share Option Plan (the
"1995 Plan") for Trustees, officers, employees and other key persons of the
Trust and its subsidiaries, subject to the approval of the 1995 Plan by the
shareholders.  The Board of Trustees believes that Common Share options and
other Common Share-based incentive awards can play an important role in the
success of the Trust by encouraging and enabling the officers and other
employees of the Trust and its subsidiaries upon whose judgment, initiative and
efforts the Trust largely depends for the successful conduct of its business to
acquire a proprietary interest in the Trust.  The Board of Trustees anticipates
that providing such persons with a direct stake in the Trust will assure a
closer identification of the interests of participants in the 1995 Plan with
those of the Trust, thereby stimulating their efforts on the Trust's behalf and
strengthening their desire to remain with the Trust.  The Board of Trustees
believes that the proposed 1995 Plan will help the Trust to achieve its goals by
keeping the Trust's incentive compensation program dynamic and competitive with
those of other companies.

          NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO THE 1995 PLAN.  The 1995 Plan
provides for the grant of options to purchase up to 870,000 Common Shares,
subject to adjustment for share splits, share dividends and similar events.  To
the extent that awards under the 1995 Plan do not vest or otherwise revert to
the Trust, the Common Shares represented by such awards may be the subject of
subsequent awards.

          NATURE OF OPTIONS.  The 1995 Plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options ("Incentive Options") which qualify under Section 422 of the Code
and nonqualified stock options ("Non-Qualified Options").  Holders of options
also receive dividend equivalent rights.

          1995 PLAN ADMINISTRATION.  The 1995 Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee.  It is the intention of the Trust that all members of
the Compensation Committee be "disinterested persons" as that term is defined
under the rules promulgated by the SEC.

          ELIGIBILITY.  The Compensation Committee has full power to select,
from among the employees eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards
will be granted, to make any combination of awards to participants, and to
determine the specific terms and conditions of each award, subject to the
provisions of the 1995 Plan.  Incentive Options may be granted only to officers
and other full-time employees of the Trust or its subsidiaries.  Non-qualified
Options may be granted to officers, employees and other key persons of the Trust
or its subsidiaries.  Trustees of the Trust who are not employed by the Trust or
its subsidiaries ("Independent Trustees") will also be eligible for certain
awards under the 1995 Plan, as described below.

                                      - 21 -

<PAGE>
          COMMON SHARE OPTIONS GRANTED TO INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  The 1995 Plan
provides that each person who was a non-employee member of the Board of Trustees
on October 5, 1995 shall automatically be granted on such date a Non-qualified
Option to purchase 35,000 Common Shares and each person who first becomes a non-
employee member of the Board of Trustees after October 5, 1995 shall
automatically be granted, upon the date such person first becomes a Trustee, a
Non-qualified Option to purchase 10,000 shares.  All of these options granted
have an exercise price set at the fair market value on the date of grant.

          OTHER OPTION TERMS.  The option exercise price of each option will be
determined by the Compensation Committee but may not be less than 100% of the
fair market value of the Common Shares.  The term of each option will be fixed
by the Compensation Committee and may not exceed ten years from date of grant.
The Compensation Committee will determine at what time or times each option may
be exercised and, subject to the provisions of the 1995 Plan, the period of
time, if any, after retirement or termination of employment for any reason
during which options may be exercised.  Options may be made exercisable in
installments and the exercisability of options may be accelerated by the
Compensation Committee.  The Plan provides that in the event of a "Change of
Control" (as defined in the 1995 Plan) of the Trust, all options shall
automatically become fully exercisable.  Upon exercise of options, the option
exercise price must be paid in full either in cash, check or other instrument
acceptable to the Compensation Committee or, if the Compensation Committee so
permits, by delivery of Common Shares already owned by the optionee.  The
exercise price may also be delivered to the Trust by a broker pursuant to
irrevocable instructions to the broker from the optionee.  No options shall be
transferable by the optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution, and options may be exercised during the optionee's lifetime only
by the optionee, his or her guardian or legal representative.

          DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS.  Each option granted under the 1995 Plan
shall also generate dividend equivalent rights ("DERs") which shall entitle the
optionee to receive an additional Common Share for each DER received upon the
exercise of the option, at no additional cost, based on the following formula:
As of the last business day of each such calendar quarter, the amount of cash
dividends paid by the Trust on each Common Share with respect to that quarter
shall be divided by the fair market value per Common Share as of the last
business day of each calendar quarter to determine the actual number of DERs
accruing on each Common Share subject to the option.  Such amount of DERs shall
be applied against the number of shares covered by the option to determine the
number of DERs which accrued during such quarter.

          ADJUSTMENTS FOR COMMON SHARE DIVIDENDS, MERGERS, ETC.  The
Compensation Committee will make appropriate adjustments as to the number and
kind of shares and the per share exercise prices to reflect share dividends,
share splits and similar events.  In the event of a merger, liquidation, sale of
the Trust or similar event, the 1995 Plan and the options shall terminate,
unless provision is made in connection with such transaction for the assumption
of options granted, or the substitution for such options of new options of the
successor entity, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of
shares and the per share exercise prices.  In the event of such a termination,
all outstanding options shall be exercisable in full for at least fifteen days
prior to the date of such termination whether or not otherwise exercisable
during such period.

          TAX WITHHOLDING.  Optionees are responsible for the payment of any
federal, state or local taxes that the Trust is required by law to withhold upon
the exercise of any option granted by the 1995 Plan.  Optionees may elect to
have such tax withholding obligations satisfied either by authorizing the Trust
to withhold Common Shares to be issued pursuant to an option exercise or by
transferring to the Common Shares having a value equal to the amount of such
taxes.  Such an election is subject to certain limitations for participants
subject to the requirements of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

          AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION.  The Board of Trustees may at any time
amend the 1995 Plan.  However, no amendment shall be effective unless approved
by the shareholders at an annual meeting or a special meeting held within twelve
months before or after the date of adoption of such amendment, where such
amendment increases the number of Common Shares issuable under the 1995 Plan,
effects any substantive change in the eligibility provisions of the 1995 Plan,
reduces the minimum option price, or materially increases benefits accruing to
participants under the 1995 Plan.

          EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1995 PLAN.  The 1995 Plan will become effective upon
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Common Shares
present or represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders.  Subject to such approval of shareholders and to the requirement
that no Common Shares may be issued prior to such approval, options


                                      - 22 -

<PAGE>
may be granted on and after adoption of the 1995 Plan by the Board of Trustees.
No option may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of
the 1995 Plan.

     COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Messrs. Bucher, Colwell, Gassaway, Krout and Rostvold served as members of
the Trust's former Compensation Committee during the Trust's fiscal year ended
September 30, 1995.  None of such individuals was, during such fiscal year, an
officer or employee of the Trust, or formerly an officer of the Trust or had any
relationship requiring disclosure by the Trust under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

     COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Trust's executive officers
and Trustees, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the
Trust's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.
Officers, Trustees and greater than 10% shareholders are required by Securities
and Exchange Commission regulation to furnish the Trust with copies for all
Section 16(a) forms they file.  To the Trust's knowledge, based solely on review
of the copies of such reports furnished to the Trust and written representations
that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended September 30,
1995, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its executive
officers, Trustees and greater than 10% beneficial owners were satisfied.

     CONTROL SHARE STATUTE AND ITS EFFECT ON BENEFICIAL OWNERS

     Subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the
"Maryland Control Share Statute") generally excludes from shares entitled to
vote "control shares" (as described below) of a Maryland corporation acquired
pursuant to a "control share acquisition" (as described below), unless voting
rights for such shares have been approved by the shareholders of the corporation
by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast (other
than "interested shares", as described below) or, among other exceptions, such
acquisition of shares is made pursuant to a merger agreement with the
corporation or the corporation's charter or by-laws are amended to permit the
acquisition of such shares prior to the acquiring person's acquisition thereof.


     "Control shares" generally means shares of a corporation acquired by a
person within any of the following ranges of voting power:  (i) one-fifth or
more, but less than one-third of all voting power; (ii) one-third or more, but
less than a majority of all voting power; or (iii) a majority or more of all
voting power.  Generally, only those shares acquired in the transaction that
causes a shareholder to own in excess of 20% of the voting common shares of a
corporation that is subject to the Maryland Control Share Statute and the voting
common shares thereafter acquired are precluded from voting under such statute.
"Control share acquisition" generally means the acquisition of ownership of, or

the right to direct the exercise of voting power with respect to, issued and
outstanding control shares, but does not include the acquisition of shares in a
merger, consolidation or share exchange to which the corporation is a party.
"Interested shares" generally means shares of a corporation in respect of which
an acquiring person, an officer of the corporation or an employee of the
corporation who is also a director or trustee of the corporation is entitled to
exercise voting power.

     Certain entities related to Intermarket Corporation (the "Intermarket
Entities") may be deemed to own "control shares" under clause (i) of the
foregoing definition, and certain entities related to Mutual Series Fund Inc.
(the "Mutual Entities") may be deemed to own "control shares" under clause (ii)
of the foregoing definition.  The Trust believes, based on information provided
to it by the Mutual Entities and the Intermarket Entities, that all of the
Common Shares held by the Mutual Entities and the Intermarket Entities were
received pursuant to the Trust's Prepackaged Plan.  All of the Common Shares
owned by the Mutual Entities and the Intermarket Entities may therefore be
precluded from voting under the Maryland Control Share Statute.  While the
language of the Control Share Acquisition Statute is not completely clear, the
Trust believes that Common Shares held by the Mutual Entities and the
Intermarket Entities are not covered by, and therefore have not lost their
voting power under, the Maryland Control Share Statute.  (All references to
"corporations" in this section also refer to Maryland REITs.)

     As stated above, the Maryland Control Share Statute provides a procedure by
which the voting rights for control shares may be approved by the shareholders
of the Trust.  Such vote may either be requested by any shareholder who owns
control shares, in which case the Trust must present the issue for consideration
by its shareholders, or the Trust may, on its own volition, present the issue
for consideration by its shareholders and may call a meeting of shareholders
specifically for such purpose.  The Board of Trustees did not intend, and
believes that the shareholders of the Trust who ratified the Trust's Prepackaged
Plan did not intend, to preclude the Mutual Entities and the Intermarket
Entities from voting any of their Common Shares.  Moreover, the Board of
Trustees believes that it is in the best interests of the Trust that its
shareholders with the majority of the Trust's economic interest have the
corresponding voting power.  The Board of Trustees has therefor resolved to
propose to the shareholders of the Trust at the Trust's upcoming annual meeting
that the voting power of the Common Shares held by the Mutual Entities and the
Intermarket Entities be approved.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Trustees and Shareholders
Value Property Trust


     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Value Property Trust
(formerly Mortgage and Realty Trust) at September 30, 1995 and 1994 and the
related statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1995.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules referenced at Item 14(a).  These
financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Trust's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, on
September 22, 1995, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Trust's plan of
reorganization which was consummated on September 29, 1995 permitting the Trust
to emerge from proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code.  The Trust implemented the
guidance as to the accounting for entities emerging from Chapter 11 set forth in
Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization
under the Bankruptcy Code" ("Fresh Start Reporting") as of September 30, 1995.
Due to the reorganization and the implementation of Fresh Start Reporting,
assets were recorded at reorganization value, liabilities were recorded at fair
values and outstanding obligations were discharged primarily in exchange for
cash, new indebtedness and equity.  As a result, the balance sheet at September
30, 1995 reflects a new basis of accounting and, accordingly, is not comparable
to balance sheets prior to that date.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Value Property Trust, at
September 30, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
aspects the information set forth therein.

                        NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   BASIS OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     On September 29, 1995, the Trust's Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization was
declared effective by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California.

     Under the Prepackaged Plan, holders of the Trust's $290,000,000 principal
amount of Senior Secured Uncertificated Notes due 1995 received (i) $110,000,000
principal amount of newly issued 11-1/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2002, (ii)
$71,000,000 ($25,000,000 paid in April 1993) in cash and (iii) approximately
10,889,430 new Common Shares representing in the aggregate approximately 97% of
the Common Shares outstanding after the effective date.  In connection with the
Prepackaged Plan, the Trust effected a 1 for 33.33 for one reverse stock split
of its outstanding Common Shares.

     In connection with its emergence from the Chapter 11 proceeding, the Trust
implemented Fresh Start Reporting as of September 30, 1995, as set forth in
Statement of Position 90-7 "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization
Under the Bankruptcy Code."  Fresh Start Reporting was required because (i) the
reorganization value of the Trust's assets immediately before the date of
confirmation was less than the total of all post-petition liabilities, (2) there
was more than a 50% change in the ownership of the Trust, and (3) there was a
permanent and substantive loss of control by existing shareholders.  As a
result, all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their respective
reorganization values or fair value.  The September 30, 1995 balance sheet
amounts have been segregated by a black line in order to signify that the 1995
balance sheet is that of a new reporting entity and has been prepared on a basis
not comparable to the pre-confirmation balance sheet.

     The Trust based the reorganization value of assets on the mid-point of the
range of values prepared by independent specialists in the field of real estate
valuation.  The valuation of its real estate investments was prepared as of
March 31, 1995 and adjusted to September 30, 1995 for various accounts such as
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable.

     The Trust's liabilities are stated at their fair value.  The difference
between reorganization value of the assets and the fair value of the liabilities
is recorded as shareholders' equity with the accumulated deficit restated to
zero.

     The real estate valuation analysis reflects the selection of 26 assets
representing 81% of the Trust's book value at March 31, 1995.  The selection was
divided between east coast and west coast assets and generally represented the
highest dollar values in the portfolio.

     The analysis factored in, among other things, (i) the most recent property
cash flow projections for the properties selected, (ii) where applicable, the
most recent operating rent roll and other financial information relative to the
assets selected, (iii) the most recent third party, independent appraisals,
where applicable and available, (iv) discussions with the respective asset
managers to determine loan status, property characteristics, current occupancy,
existing market rental rates, new leases, current payoff discussions and asset
sales, and (v) a review of limited market information for the properties.

     The valuation of the asset portfolio assumed continued operation of the
portfolio for several years.  Sales and pay-offs of certain assets occurred
throughout the analysis period (six years) and no additional investments were
made.  Property cash flows, loan payments and pay-offs, and reversion amounts
(based on normalized capital expenditures in the reversion year) were discounted
to present value at 12 percent per year.  Amounts do not include extraordinary
expenses for reorganization or litigation.

     The going concern value was reduced by other operating expenses that would
be incurred over a six year period.  The present value of expenses was
calculated by applying a capitalization rate of 10 percent to Year 6 stabilized
other expenses and discounting both the capitalized, stabilized Year 6 expenses
and the annual expenses at 12 percent.  The net present value of operating
expenses was $27.3 million.

     The effect of the Fresh Start Reporting on the Trust's historical cost
balance sheet at September 30, 1995 is as follows:

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain amounts in the September 30, 1994 pre-confirmation balance sheet
     have been reclassified to conform with the September 30, 1995 post-
     confirmation balance sheet.


     INCOME TAXES

     The Trust is a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") that has elected to
     be taxed under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended.  Accordingly, no provision has been made for income taxes in the
     financial statements.

     For the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, there were
     significant differences between taxable net loss and net loss as reported
     in the financial statements.  The differences were related to the
     recognition of bad debt deductions and accounting for reorganization costs
     and Fresh Start Reporting.  For financial accounting purposes, these items
     are expensed currently, while for tax purposes some portion of these items
     may be deferred to future periods or may not be deductible.  In addition,
     the Fresh Start Reporting discussed in Note 1 is not recognized for tax
     purposes, and will result in future years book/tax differences.

     The Trust incurred net operating losses ("NOLs") of $35 million, $38
     million $31 million and $12 million for tax purposes in fiscal 1994, 1993,
     1992 and 1991, respectively.  The Trust estimates a net operating loss
     before Cancellation of Indebtedness ("COD") income for tax purposes of
     approximately $41 million for fiscal 1995.  Beginning with fiscal 1996,
     NOLs available to offset taxable income in future years will be
     approximately $82 million after the recognition for tax purposes of the COD
     income of approximately $75 million.  These NOLs will be subject to
     Internal Revenue Code Section 382 annual limitations on the use of the
     NOLs.  The Trust estimates this annual limitation to be approximately $6
     million with any portion of the Section 382 limitation not used in any
     taxable year carried forward up to fifteen years.

     After the recognition of the COD income, the remaining NOLs available will
     be $9 million, $38 million and $35 million from fiscal 1992, 1993 and 1994,
     respectively.

     The New Indenture restricts the payment of dividends, other than such
     declaration and making of dividend payments that the Trust deems necessary
     to preserve its status as a REIT, unless the consolidated net worth of the
     Trust at the time of such payment and after giving effect thereto is at
     least $50 million; provided, however, that the Trust shall in no event
     declare or make any such dividend payment or other distribution if a
     default or event of default under the New Indenture has occurred and is
     continuing.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, the Trust must distribute 95%
     of its "REIT taxable income" to its shareholders to continue to qualify as
     a REIT.

     INTEREST INCOME

     Interest income on each loan is recorded as earned.  Interest income is not
     recognized if, in the opinion of the Trustees, collection is doubtful.  The
     Trust generally considers loans as delinquent if payment of interest and/or
     principal, as required by the terms of the note, is more than 60 days past
     due.  Accrual of interest income is generally terminated and foreclosure
     proceedings are started if payment is more than 60 days past due.

     ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

     Prior to the implementation of Fresh Start Reporting, the allowance for
     losses on mortgage loans and related investments was determined in
     accordance with The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
     Statement of Position on Accounting Practices of Real Estate Investment
     Trusts 75-2 ("SOP 75-2"), as amended.  This statement requires adjustment
     of the carrying value of mortgage loans to the lower of their carrying
     value or estimated net realizable value.  Estimated net realizable value is
     the estimated selling price of a property offered for sale in the open
     market allowing a reasonable time to find a buyer, reduced by the estimated
     cost to complete and hold the property (including the estimated cost of
     capital), net of estimated cash income.

     With the implementation of Fresh Start Reporting, as of September 30, 1995,
     the allowance for losses was reset to zero.  Further provisions for losses
     on mortgage loans and related investments in accordance with SOP 75-2 may
     be necessary if there is deterioration in real estate markets, or there is
     a significant increase in the Trust's cost of capital.


     NET LOSS PER SHARE

     Net loss per share for all pre-confirmation periods is not presented
     because this information is not meaningful as a result of the
     Reorganization and "Fresh Start Reporting".


     DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

     Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over
     an estimated useful life of 40 years for buildings and three to five years
     for other property and lease commissions.  Real estate held for investment
     will be depreciated on a straight line method over the remaining life of
     the asset.


     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash include short-term
     investments (high grade commercial paper carried at a cost of $11.0 million
     at September 30, 1995) with maturities ranging from 5 to 33 days.

     The Trust adjusted the balance of allowance for losses at September 30,
     1995 as part of "Fresh Start Reporting" (See Note 1).

5.   BORROWINGS

     MORTGAGE PAYABLE

     The Trust has a mortgage payable of $17,535,000 outstanding at September
     30, 1995.  The contractual interest rate on this loan at September 30, 1995
     was 10.75% (Prime + 2%, floor of 8.5%) and the loan was to mature on
     December 5, 1995.  In October 1995, the Trust made a paydown of $3.5
     million, reducing the balance outstanding to $14 million and extending the
     maturity date to December 20, 1996.

     SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2002

     The 11-1/8% Senior Secured Notes (the "Notes") are secured obligations
     (secured by a first priority lien on all of the Trust's collateral)
     governed by the New Indenture between the Trust and Wilmington Trust Co.,
     as Trustee, dated as of the effective date (September 29, 1995).  Interest
     on these Notes accrues at 11-1/8% per annum and is payable semi-annually in
     arrears on each June 30 and December 31.  The Trust is not required to make
     mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments other than with
     respect to Asset Sale Proceeds (as defined in the New Indenture).  If at
     any time the aggregate amount of Asset Sale Proceeds exceeds $10 million,
     the Trust is required to make an offer to all holders of Notes to purchase
     the maximum principal amount of Notes that, together with accrued and
     unpaid interest thereon, may be purchased with 80% of any such asset sale
     proceeds or 100% of net cash proceeds of Indebtedness incurred as permitted
     under the New Indenture.  The Trust has the option to redeem the Notes, in
     whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
     interest.  The New Indenture includes affirmative covenants, negative
     covenants and financial covenants.  See Note 2 - Income Taxes - regarding
     restrictions on dividend payments.

6.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 107--Disclosure of
     Fair Value of Financial Statements ("SFAS 107") requires disclosure of fair
     value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in
     the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value.  In
     cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based
     on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those
     techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including
     the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  In that regard, the
     derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
     independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in


                                    -41-
<PAGE>

     immediate settlement of the instrument.  SFAS 107 excludes certain
     financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure
     requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do
     not represent the underlying value of the Trust.

     The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their fair
     value because of the liquidity and short-term maturities of these
     instruments.

     The mortgage payable is a variable rate loan that reprices frequently, thus
     fair value is based on the carrying amount of the loan.

7.   SHARE OPTION PLAN

     1984 SHARE OPTION PLAN

     As part of the Plan of Reorganization, all options outstanding pursuant to
     the 1984 Share Option Plan (348,500) were canceled.


     1995 SHARE OPTION PLAN

     On October 2, 1995, the Board of Trustees adopted a 1995 Share Option Plan
     (the "1995 Plan") for Trustees, officers, employees and other key persons
     of the Trust, subject to the approval of the 1995 Plan by the Trust's
     shareholders.

     The 1995 Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase up to 870,000
     Common Shares at not less than 100% of the fair market value of the
     Common Shares, subject to adjustment for share splits, share dividends and
     similar events.  To the extent that awards under the 1995 Plan do not vest
     or otherwise revert to the Trust, the Common Shares represented by such
     awards may be the subject of subsequent awards.

     The 1995 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options ("Incentive
     Options") which qualify under Section 422 of the Code and nonqualified
     stock options ("Non-Qualified Options").  Holders of options also receive
     dividend equivalent rights.

8.   PENSION PLANS

     On September 20, 1989, the Trustees adopted an Employees' Retirement Plan
     effective September 30, 1989.  On December 16, 1992, the Trustees amended
     and restated the Employees' Retirement Plan effective January 1, 1992 (as
     amended on July 20, 1994, and effective January 1, 1994 and as may be
     further amended, the "Retirement Plan").  All employees are eligible to
     participate in the Retirement Plan provided that they are at least 21 years
     of age and have been employed for twelve consecutive months, during which
     period the employee has completed at least 1000 hours of service.  Under
     the Retirement Plan, each eligible employee after completing five years of
     vesting service becomes 100% vested and entitled to a retirement pension.
     Benefits can be paid as a lump sum or as an annual retirement income for
     life equal to the greater of (a) the sum of (i) 1.3% of the highest five-
     year average annual base salary, multiplied by the number of years of
     credited service up to and including 35 thereof and (ii) 0.4% of the
     highest five-year average annual base salary in excess of Social Security
     covered compensation (as adjusted every five years), multiplied by the
     number of years of credited service up to and including 35 thereof or
     (b) the sum of (i) 1.3% of the highest five-year average annual base
     salary, multiplied by the number of credited service up to and including 15
     thereof; (ii) 1.5% of the highest five-year average annual base salary,
     multiplied by the number of years of credited service from 16 to 25 years
     inclusive; (iii) 0.5% of the highest five-year average annual base salary,
     multiplied by the number of years of credited service from 26 to 35 years
     inclusive; and (iv) 0.4% of the highest five-year average annual base
     salary in excess of Social Security covered compensation (as adjusted every
     five years), multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to
     and including 25 thereof.

                                    -42-

<PAGE>

     In November 1995, the Trustees amended the Retirement Plan effective
     January 1, 1996 to switch from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
     interest rate used for valuing lump sum distributions to the new General
     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade interest rate and mortality table for
     valuing lump sum distributions.  As a result of this amendment, the current
     market value of Retirement Plan assets approximates the current aggregate
     lump sum amounts due to participants.

     The Trust also maintains a 401(k) profit and sharing plan and trust.
     Employer contributions are limited to 6% of participant's compensation,
     with a maximum per year of $3,000 per participant.  Profit sharing expense
     was $72,000, $61,000 and $65,000 for years ended September 30, 1995, 1994
     and 1993, respectively.

9.   EMPLOYEE TERMINATION PLAN

     A termination pay plan has been established to cover termination of
     employment without cause during the period that the Notes, as defined, are
     outstanding.  Employees are entitled to compensation ranging from a minimum
     of twelve weeks to a maximum of eighteen months pay.  In addition, certain
     health benefits will continue to be paid by the Trust over a period of time
     equal to the period used in calculating severance pay.  At September 30,
     1995, the Trust accrued the $1.3 million cost of the Termination Pay Plan.
     After fiscal year end, the majority of existing employees were terminated
     and the Trust commenced payments to those employees.

   PROVISIONS RELATING TO REDEMPTION AND PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF SHARES.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     THE SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT
TO RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TRUST'S
MAINTENANCE OF ITS STATUS AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST UNDER THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE "CODE"). SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
PROVISIONS OF THE TRUST'S DECLARATION OF TRUST, NO PERSON MAY (A)
BENEFICIALLY OWN SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK IN EXCESS OF THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT
UNLESS SUCH PERSON IS AN EXISTING HOLDER (IN WHICH CASE, THE EXISTING HOLDER
LIMIT SHALL BE APPLICABLE); (B) TRANSFER SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK IF SUCH
TRANSFER WOULD RESULT IN THE SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK BEING OWNED BENEFICIALLY
BY FEWER THAN 100 PERSONS; (C) BENEFICIALLY OWN OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES
OF CAPITAL STOCK WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE TRUST BEING "CLOSELY HELD" UNDER
SECTION 856(H) OF THE CODE OR (D) CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK
IN EXCESS OF 9.9% OF THE VALUE OF THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF THE TRUST
(UNLESS SUCH PERSON IS AN EXISTING CONSTRUCTIVE HOLDER). ANY PERSON WHO
ATTEMPTS TO BENEFICIALLY OWN OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK IN
EXCESS OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE TRUST. FOR
PURPOSES OF THE OWNERSHIP RESTRICTION DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE (A) ABOVE, THE
"OWNERSHIP LIMIT" MEANS 9.9% OF THE VALUE OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF
CAPITAL STOCK OF THE TRUST. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS NOT INVOLVING THE DIRECT
TRANSFER OF CAPITAL STOCK OF THE TRUST MAY RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE
RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE. ALL DEFINED TERMS IN THIS LEGEND HAVE THE
MEANINGS DEFINED IN THE TRUST'S DECLARATION OF TRUST, AS THE SAME MAY BE
AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, A COPY OF WHICH, INCLUDING THE RESTRICTIONS ON
TRANSFER, WILL BE SENT WITHOUT CHARGE TO EACH SHAREHOLDER WHO SO REQUESTS IN
WRITING WITHIN FIVE (5) DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THE WRITTEN REQUEST. IF THE
RESTRICTIONS ABOVE ARE VIOLATED, THE SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK REPRESENTED
HEREBY WILL BE TRANSFERRED AUTOMATICALLY AND BY OPERATION OF LAW TO A SPECIAL
TRUST AND SHALL BE DESIGNATED SHARES-IN-TRUST.
