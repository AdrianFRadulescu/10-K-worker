                                   PART I
Item 1.  Business.

         (a)      General Description of Business
         Valmont Industries, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, (together with
its subsidiaries the "Company") is engaged in industrial products and
irrigation products businesses.  The Industrial Products segment involves
the manufacture and distribution of engineered metal structures and other
fabricated products for industrial and commercial applications.  The
Irrigation Products segment involves the manufacture and distribution of
agricultural irrigation equipment and related products.  The description
of Valmont's businesses set forth on pages 6 through 11 of the Company's
Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.
         The Company entered the Irrigation Products market in 1953 from
its manufacturing location in Valley, Nebraska.  The Industrial Products
segment began producing and marketing engineered metal structures as a
result of manufacturing support efforts for the irrigation business.
         Valmont has grown internally and by acquisition.  Valmont has
also divested certain businesses.  Valmont's acquisitions include (i) an
expansion into the French steel and aluminum structures market in 1989
with the acquisition of Sermeto, (ii) the acquisition in 1991 of Valmont
Nederland B.V. (formerly Nolte Mastenfabriek B.V.), a Dutch
manufacturer of steel poles structures, (iii) the acquisition in 1991
of an 80% interest in Lampadaires Feralux, Inc., a Canadian producer of
aluminum pole structures, (iv) the acquisition in 1994 of the assets of
Energy Steel Corporation of Tulsa, Oklahoma, a manufacturer of utility
products, and (v) the acquisition of Microflect Company, Inc. in 1995, a
manufacturer and installer of microwave communication structures.
Divestitures include (i) the sale in 1994 of the assets of Good-All
Electric, Inc., a Colorado producer of cathodic protection rectifiers,
(ii) the 1993 sale of its investment in Inacom Corp., a national
microcomputer reseller business initially established as a division of
the Company, (iii) the 1993 exit of the Gate City Steel steel reinforcing
bar business, and (iv) the 1989 divestiture of the Gate City Steel service
center business.

         (b)       Industry Segments
         The Company classifies its operations into two business segments:
         Industrial Products - The manufacture and distribution  of
engineered metal structures and other fabricated products.
         Irrigation Products - The manufacture and distribution of
agricultural irrigation equipment and related products.
         The amounts of revenues, operating income and identifiable assets 
attributable to each segment for each of the last three years are set forth 
on page 30 of the Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference.
         (c)     Narrative Description of Business
         Principal Products Produced and Services Rendered.
         --------------------------------------------------
         The information called for by this item is hereby incorporated by
reference to pages 6 through 11 in the Company's Annual Report.
                                                                         2
         Suppliers and Availability of Raw Materials.
         --------------------------------------------
         Hot rolled steel coil and other carbon steel products are the
primary raw materials utilized in the manufacture of finished products for
the Industrial Products and Irrigation Products segments.  These essential
items are purchased from steel mills and steel service centers and are
readily available.  In addition to steel, key elements of the ballast
manufacturing process are copper and aluminum wire.  These items are
obtained from wire mills and are also readily available.  It is not likely
that key raw materials would be unavailable for extended periods.

         Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions.
         ----------------------------------------------
         Valmont has a number of patents for its irrigation and ballast
designs.  The Company also has a number of registered trademarks.
Management believes the loss of any individual patent would not have a 
material adverse affect on the financial condition of the Company.

         Seasonal Factors in Business.
         -----------------------------
         Sales in the Company's irrigation segment can be somewhat seasonal
based upon the agricultural growing season.
         Customers.
         ----------
         The Company is not dependent for a material part of its business
upon a single customer, or upon very few customers, the loss of any one of
which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of
the Company.
         Backlog.
         --------
         The backlog of orders for the principal products manufactured and
marketed was approximately $109.6 million at the end of the 1995 fiscal
year and $111.1 million at the close of 1994.  It is anticipated that most of
the backlog of orders will be filled during fiscal year 1996.  At year end, 
the backlog by segment was as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

                                  Dec. 30,          Dec. 31,
                                   1995               1994
                                 ---------         ---------
         Industrial Products       $84.3              87.8
         Irrigation Products        25.3              23.3
                                 ---------         ---------
                                  $109.6             111.1
                                  ======            ======
         Competitive Conditions.
         -----------------------
         In the Industrial Products segment, Valmont is a major
manufacturer and supplier of engineered metal structures to the lighting, 
utility and communication industries; the Company delivers a broad line of 
custom steel tubing products and manufactures and distributes lighting 
ballasts, fasteners and grating.  The Irrigation Products segment involves 
the manufacture and distribution of mechanized irrigation equipment for both 
the U.S. and international markets.  The Company believes it is the world's 
leading manufacturer of mechanized irrigation systems.  The key competitive
strategy used by the Company in each segment is one of high quality and
service. 
                                                                         3

         --------------------
         At December 30, 1995, the number of employees was 4,166.

Item 2.  Properties.
         The Company's primary plant and offices are located on a 352 acre
site near Valley, Nebraska, which is approximately twenty miles west of Omaha,
Nebraska.  336 of the acres are owned in fee.  The other 16 acres are leased 
on a yearly basis  from the Union Pacific Railroad Company, which serves the 
Company's primary plant, and which is entitled to terminate the lease on a 
one-year notice in the event that the land is required for railroad 
operations.  The Valley, Nebraska location is used in common as the primary 
facilities by Irrigation Products and certain Industrial Products 
administrative and operating personnel.  The Industrial Products segment's
other significant properties are three locations in France, a newly
constructed plant in Shanghai, China, and two locations for Valmont Electric.  
Valmont Electric leases plant and office facilities in El Paso, Texas under a 
long-term agreement.  Valmont Electric also owns a plant and office 
facilities in Juarez, Mexico which are located on land held in trust under

Item 3.  Pending Legal Proceedings.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Valmont Industries, Inc.:


Under date of February 16, 1996, we reported on the consolidated balance
sheets of Valmont Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 30, 1995
and December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 30, 1995, as contained in the 1995
Annual Report to Shareholders.  These consolidated financial statements and
our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year 1995.  In connection with our audits of the
aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
related supplementary notes and consolidated financial statement schedules
as listed in the accompanying index.  These supplementary notes and
consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
supplementary notes and consolidated financial statement schedules based on
our audits.

In our opinion, such supplementary notes and consolidated financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, in fiscal 1993.

"Plan") is hereby further amended as follows:

     A.   Section 3.3 is amended by adding the following sentences
immediately preceding the last sentence of Section 3.3:

     In addition, each director who is not an Employee of the
     Company shall receive a non-discretionary award of a
     Nonqualified Stock Option for 2,000 shares of Company
     Stock exercisable at the closing price of the Company's
     common stock on the date of grant; such award shall be
     made (i) on the third business day following the public
     release by the Company of its quarterly earnings for the
     second quarter of fiscal 1995, and (ii) annually
     thereafter on the date of and following completion of the
     Company's annual stockholders' meeting (commencing with
     the 1996 annual stockholders' meeting). The number of
     nonqualified options awarded to a director shall be
     appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock changes
     as described in Article XI.

     B.   This Fourth Amendment to the Plan shall be effective upon
its approval by the stockholders of the Company, and any grant of
Nonqualified Stock Options pursuant to the Fourth Amendment shall
be expressly conditioned upon such stockholder approval.
                                                                       15

                     POWERS OF THE COMMITTEE

     4.1  Power to Grant.  The Committee shall determine the
Participants to whom Awards shall be granted, the type or types of
Awards to be granted, and the terms and conditions of any and all
such Awards. The Committee may establish different terms and conditions 
for different types of Awards, for different Participants receiving the 
same type of Awards, and for the same Participant for each Award such 
Participant may receive, whether or not granted at different times.

     4.2  Administration.  The Committee shall be responsible for
the administration of the Plan. The Committee, by majority action
thereof, is authorized to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, to provide for conditions deemed
necessary or advisable to protect the interests of the Company, and
to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the
administration and interpretation of the Plan in order to carry out
its provisions and purposes. Determinations, interpretations, or
other actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the
provisions of the Plan shall be final, binding, and conclusive for
all purposes and upon all persons. Notwithstanding anything else
contained in the Plan to the contrary, neither the Committee nor
the Board shall have any discretion regarding whether an Eligible
Director receives a Director Award pursuant to Section 7.1 or
regarding the terms of any such Director Award, including, without
limitation, the number of shares subject to any such Director
Award.
                                                                        18
                            SECTION 5

                      STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN

     5.1  Number.  Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, the
number of shares of Stock subject to Awards (including Director
Awards) under the Plan may not exceed 800,000 shares of Stock. The
shares to be delivered under the Plan may consist, in whole or in
part, of treasury Stock or authorized but unissued Stock, not
reserved for any other purpose. The maximum number of shares of
Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted to any one Employee 
under the Plan is 40% of the aggregate number of shares of
Stock available for Awards under Section 5.1.

     5.2  Cancelled, Terminated or Forfeited Awards.  Any shares of
Stock subject to an Award which for any reason are cancelled, terminated 
or otherwise settled without the issuance of any Stock shall again be 
available for Awards under the Plan.  

     5.3  Adjustment in Capitalization. In the event of any Stock
dividend or Stock split, recapitalization (including, without
limitation, the payment of an extraordinary dividend), merger,
consolidation, combination, spin-off, distribution of assets to
stockholders, exchange of shares, or other similar corporate change, 
(i) the aggregate number of shares of Stock available for Awards under 
Section 5.1 and (ii) the number of shares and exercise price with respect 
to Options and the number, prices and dollar value of other Awards, may 
be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination shall 
be conclusive. If, pursuant to the preceding sentence, an adjustment is 
made to the number of shares of Stock authorized for issuance under the 
Plan, a corresponding adjustment shall be made with respect to Director
Awards granted pursuant to Section 7.1.


                            SECTION 6

                          STOCK OPTIONS

     6.1  Grant of Options.  Options may be granted to Participants
at such time or times as shall be determined by the Committee.
Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive
Stock Options and (ii) Nonstatutory Stock Options. The Committee
shall have complete discretion in determining the number of
Options, if any, to be granted to a Participant. Each Option shall
be evidenced by an Option agreement that shall specify the type of
Option granted, the exercise price, the duration of the Option, the
number of shares of Stock to which the Option pertains, the
exercisability (if any) of the Option in the event of death,
retirement, disability or termination of employment, and such other
terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee 
shall determine.
                                                                        19
     6.2  Option Price.  Nonstatutory Stock Options and Incentive
Stock Options granted pursuant to the Plan shall have an exercise
price which is not less than the Fair Market Value on the date the
Option is granted.

     6.3  Exercise of Options.  Options awarded to a Participant
under the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and shall be
subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee may
impose, subject to the Committee's right to accelerate the
exercisability of such Option in its discretion.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Option shall be exercisable for more than ten
years after the date on which it is granted.

     6.4  Payment.  The Committee shall establish procedures
governing the exercise of Options, which shall require that written
notice of exercise be given and that the Option price be paid in
full in cash or cash equivalents, including by personal check, at
the time of exercise or pursuant to any arrangement that the
Committee shall approve. The Committee may, in its discretion,
permit a Participant to make payment (i) in Stock already owned by
the Participant valued at its Fair Market Value on the date of
exercise (if such Stock has been owned by the Participant for at
least six months) or (ii) by electing to have the Company retain
Stock which would otherwise be issued on exercise of the Option,
valued at its Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. As soon as
practicable after receipt of a written exercise notice and full
payment  of the exercise price, the Company shall deliver to the
Participant a certificate or certificates representing the acquired
shares of Stock.

     6.5  Incentive Stock Options.  Notwithstanding anything in the
Plan to the contrary, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive
Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall
any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be so exercised,
so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code, or,
without the consent of any Participant affected thereby, to cause
any Incentive Stock Option previously granted to fail to qualify
for the Federal income tax treatment afforded under Section 421 of
the Code.  In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) the aggregate Fair
Market Value of shares of Stock (determined at the time of grant of
each Option) with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
exercisable for the first time by an Employee during any calendar
year shall not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may be
required by the Code, (ii) an Incentive Stock Option may not be
exercised more than three months following termination of employment 
(except as the Committee may otherwise determine in the
event of death or disability), and (iii) if the Employee receiving
an Incentive Stock Option owns Stock possessing more than 10% of
the total combined voting power of all classes of Stock of the
Company, the exercise price of the Option shall be at least 110% of
Fair Market Value and the Option shall not be exercisable after the
expiration of five years from the date of grant.
                                                                        20
     6.6  Replacement Options.  The Committee may grant a
replacement option (a "Replacement Option") to any Employee who
exercises all or part of an option granted under this Plan using
Qualifying Stock (as herein defined) as payment for the purchase
price.  A Replacement Option shall grant to the Employee the right
to purchase, at the Fair Market Value as of the date of said
exercise and grant, the number of shares of stock equal to the sum
of the number of whole shares (i) used by the Employee in payment
of the purchase price for the option which was exercised and (ii)
used by the Employee in connection with applicable withholding
taxes on such transaction.  A Replacement Option may not be
exercised for six months following the date of grant, and shall
expire on the same date as the option which it replaces.
Qualifying Stock is stock which has been owned by the Employee for
at least six months prior to the date of exercise and has not been
used in a stock-for-stock swap transaction within the preceding six
months.


                            SECTION 7

                         DIRECTOR AWARDS

    7.1  Amount of Award.  Each Eligible Director shall receive a
non-discretionary Award of 1,000 shares of stock each year; such
Award shall be made annually on the date of and following
completion of the Company's annual stockholders' meeting
(commencing with the 1996 annual stockholders' meeting).  Each
Eligible Director shall be issued a common stock certificate for
such number of shares. Termination of the director's services for
any reason other than (i) death, (ii) retirement from the Board at
mandatory retirement age, or (iii) resignation or failure to stand
for re-election, in any such case with the prior approval of the
Board, will result in forfeiture of the Stock. If the Stock is
forfeited, the director shall return the number of forfeited
shares of Stock, or equivalent value, to the Company. The number
of shares of Stock awarded to an Eligible Director annually shall
be appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock changes as
described in Section 5.3. In addition, each Eligible Director
shall receive a non-discretionary Award of a Nonqualified Stock
Option for 2,000 shares of Stock exercisable at the Fair Market
Value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant; such
Award shall be made annually on the date of and following completion 
of the Company's annual stockholders' meeting (commencing with the 
1996 annual stockholders' meeting). The number of nonqualified 
options awarded to a director shall be appropriately adjusted in 
the event of any stock changes as described in Section 5.3.

    7.2  No Other Awards.  An Eligible Director shall not receive
any other Award under the Plan.
                                                                        21

                    STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

    8.1  SAR's In Tandem with Options.  Stock Appreciation Rights
may be granted to Participants in tandem with any Option granted
under the Plan, either at or after the time of the grant of such
Option, subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine.
Each Stock Appreciation Right shall only be exercisable to the
extent that the corresponding Option is exercisable, and shall
terminate upon termination or exercise of the corresponding
Option.  Upon the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right, the
corresponding Option shall terminate.

    8.2  Other Stock Appreciation Rights.  Stock Appreciation
Rights may also be granted to Participants separately from any
Option, subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine.


                            SECTION 9

                        RESTRICTED STOCK

    9.1  Grant of Restricted Stock.  The Committee may grant
Restricted Stock to Participants at such times and in such
amounts, and subject to such other terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as it shall determine.  Each grant of
Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions, which may
relate to continued employment with the Company, performance of
the Company, or other restrictions, as the Committee may
determine. Each grant of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by a
written agreement setting forth the terms of such Award.

    9.2  Removal of Restrictions.  The Committee may accelerate or
waive such restrictions in whole or in part at any time in its
discretion.


                           SECTION 10

        AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

    11.1 General.  The Board may from time to time amend, modify
or terminate any or all of the provisions of the Plan, subject to
the provisions of this Section 11.1.  The Board may not change the
Plan in a manner which would prevent outstanding Incentive Stock
Options granted under the Plan from being Incentive Stock Options
without the consent of the optionees concerned. Furthermore, the
Board may not make any amendment which would (i) materially modify
the requirements for participation in the Plan, (ii) increase the
number of shares of Stock subject to Awards under the Plan pursuant 
to Section 5.1, (iii) materially increase the benefits accruing to 
Participants under the Plan, or (iv) make any other
amendments which would cause the Plan not to comply with Rule 16b-
3 under the Act, in each case without the approval of the Company's 
stockholders.  No amendment or modification shall affect the rights 
of any Employee with respect to a previously granted Award, nor shall 
any amendment or modification affect the rights of any Eligible 
Director pursuant to a previously granted Director Award.

    11.2 Termination of Plan.  No further Options shall be granted
under the Plan subsequent to December 31, 2005, or such earlier
date as may be determined by the Board.


                           SECTION 12

                    MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

    12.1 Nontransferability of Awards.  No Awards granted under
the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise
alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution.  All rights with respect to Awards 
granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable
during the Participant's lifetime only by such Participant and all
rights with respect to any Director Awards granted to an Eligible
Director shall be exercisable during the Director's lifetime only
by such Eligible Director.

    12.2 Beneficiary Designation.  Each Participant under the Plan
may from time to time name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who
may be named contingent or successively) to whom any benefit under
the Plan is to be paid or by whom any right under the Plan is to
be exercised in case of his death. Each designation will revoke
all prior designations by the same Participant shall be in a form
prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when filed
in writing with the Company.  In the absence of any such
designation, Awards outstanding at death may be exercised by the
Participant's surviving spouse, if any, or otherwise by his estate.
                                                                        23
    12.3 No  Guarantee of Employment or Participation.  Nothing in
the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the
Company or any Subsidiary to terminate any Participant's
employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right
to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.  No
Employee shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or,
having been so selected, to receive any future Awards.

    12.4 Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the power to
withhold, or require a Participant or Eligible Director to remit
to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state,
and local withholding tax requirements on any Award under the
Plan, and the Company may defer issuance of Stock until such
requirements are satisfied. The Committee may, in its discretion,
permit a Participant to elect, subject to such conditions as the
Committee shall impose, (i) to have shares of Stock otherwise
issuable under the Plan withheld by the Company or (ii) to deliver
to the Company previously acquired shares of Stock, in each case
having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy all or part of
the Participant's estimated total federal, state and local tax
obligation associated with the transaction.

    12.5 Change of Control.  On the date of a Change of Control,
all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights shall become
immediately exercisable and all restrictions with respect to Restricted

         person, entity or "group", within the meaning of Section

         under the Act) of 50% or more of either the then
         outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting
         power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities
         entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or

    (ii) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the
         Board (as of the date hereof the "Incumbent Board") cease
         for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
         Board, provided that any person becoming a director 
         subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination 
         for the election by the Company's stockholders, was approved 
         by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising 
         the Incumbent Board shall be, for purposes of this Plan, considered 
         as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; or

   (iii) Approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
         reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case,
         with respect to which persons who were the stockholders
         of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization,
         merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter,
         own more than 50% of the combined voting power entitled
         to vote generally in the election of directors of the
         reorganized, merged or consolidated company's then outstanding

                VALMONT EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN


     1.   Purpose. The principal purpose of the Valmont Industries,
Inc. Executive Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to provide incentives
to executive officers of Valmont ("Valmont") who have significant
responsibility for the success and growth of Valmont and to assist
Valmont in attracting, motivating and retaining executive officers
on a competitive basis.

     2.   Administration of the Plan.  The Plan shall be
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors (the "Committee").  The Committee shall have the sole
discretion to interpret the Plan; approve a pre-established
objective performance measure or measures annually; certify the
level to which each performance measure was attained prior to any
payment under the Plan; approve the amount of awards made under the
Plan; and determine who shall receive any payment under the Plan.

     The Committee shall have full power and authority to
administer and interpret the Plan and to adopt such rules,
regulations and guidelines for the administration of the Plan and
for the conduct of its business as the Committee deems necessary or
advisable.  The Committee's interpretations of the Plan, and all
actions taken and determinations made by the Committee pursuant to
the powers vested in it hereunder, shall be conclusive and binding
on all parties concerned, including Valmont, its stockholders and
any person receiving an award under the Plan.

     3.   Eligibility.  Executive officers and other key management
personnel of Valmont shall be eligible to receive awards under the
Plan. The Committee shall designate the executive officers and
other key management personnel who will participate in the Plan
each year.

     4.   Awards.  The Committee shall establish annual and/or
long-term incentive award targets for participants. If an
individual becomes an executive officer during the year, such
individual may be granted eligibility for an incentive award for
that year upon such individual becoming an executive officer.

     The Committee shall also establish annual and/or long-term
performance targets which must be achieved in order for an award to
be earned under the Plan.  Such targets shall be based on earnings,
earnings per share, growth in earnings per share, achievement of
annual operating profit plans, return on equity performance, or
similar financial performance measures as may be determined by the
Committee. The specific performance targets for each participant
shall be established in writing by the Committee within ninety days
after the commencement of the fiscal year (or within such other
time period as may be required by Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code) to which the performance target relates.  The performance 
target shall be established in such a manner than a third party 
having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether the 
performance goal has been met.
                                                                       26
     Awards shall be payable following the completion of the
applicable fiscal year upon certification by the Committee that
Valmont achieved the specified performance target established for
the participant.  Notwithstanding the attainment by Valmont of the
specified performance targets, the Committee has the discretion,
for each participant, to reduce some or all of an award that would
otherwise be paid. However, in no event may a participant receive
an award of more than 400% of such participant's base salary under
the Plan in any fiscal year; for this purpose, a participant's base
salary shall be the base salary in effect at the time the Committee
establishes the performance targets for a fiscal year or period.

     5.   Miscellaneous Provisions.  Valmont shall have the right
to deduct from all awards hereunder paid in cash any federal,
state, local or foreign taxes required by law to be withheld with
respect to such awards. Neither the Plan nor any action taken
hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee any right to be
retained in the employ of Valmont.  The costs and expenses of
administering the Plan shall be borne by Valmont and shall not be
charged to any award or to any participant receiving an award.

     6.   Effective Date, Amendments and Termination.  The Plan
shall become effective on December 19, 1995 subject to approval by
the stockholders of Valmont at the 1996 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. The Committee may at any time terminate or from time
to time amend the Plan in whole or in part, but no such action
shall adversely affect any rights or obligations with respect to
any awards theretofore made under the Plan.  However, unless the
stockholders of Valmont shall have first approved thereof, no
amendment of the Plan shall be effective which would increase the
maximum amount which can be paid to any one executive officer under
the Plan in any fiscal year, which would change the specified
performance goals for payment of awards, or which would modify the
requirement as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.
                                                                       27

THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of
Valmont Industries.  Following World War II, a former Marine named Robert B.
Daugherty took his life savings and started a small farm equipment
manufacturing company just west of Omaha.  The company soon began to grow and
prosper, adding new products and developing innovative manufacturing
techniques. 
        Through the years, Valmont has taken new ideas and turned them into
products that meet the growing needs of its customers.  The most revolutionary
of these ideas was the center pivot irrigation system, a mechanized system to
irrigate crops that forever changed agriculture.  From this small acorn, a
mighty oak has grown.  Because the center pivot required a great deal of pipe,
the Company began to manufacture its own.  This, in turn, led Valmont into the
tapered pole business, which now supports markets in lighting, traffic signals,
electrical transmission and distribution, and wireless communication.
        Today, Valmont sells its mechanized irrigation systems and engineered
metal structures across the United States and around the world.  During its
first five decades, the Company continuously sought the best ways to apply
advancing technology to products and processes alike.  And, at each step along
the way, it was Valmont's people that made the difference . . . a team of smart,
hard working pioneers in the truest sense of the word . . . dedicated to helping
improve life around the globe.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

RECORD YEAR

     1995 was a record year.  Net earnings hit an all-time high of $24.8
million, topping 1994 earnings by 31.1%.  Earnings per share were $1.80, also a
Valmont record.  Sales for the year climbed to $545 million, an 8.6% increase
over the previous year.

STICKING TO BASICS
     1995 was a year in which our business strategy was further focused and
refined.  Valmont operates inside two world economies:  infrastructure
development and food production.  Within these very large economies, we have
carved out leadership positions in specific markets.
     In infrastructure development, we have focused our efforts on highly
engineered structures that are used in a wide variety of applications.  We are
the single, largest worldwide supplier with a full product line.  We design and
produce steel and aluminum poles for use in lighting, traffic signals and
signs, as well as transmission and distribution of electrical power.  We also
have established a significant presence by producing metal poles and towers for
the wireless communication industry.  These markets will continue to expand as
the industrialized world upgrades its infrastructure and emerging countries
develop theirs.
     Within food production, our focus is on mechanized irrigation for
agriculture.  Over the next 35 years, the world must more than double its food
production to satisfy the need for better diets for a growing global
population.  In meeting this major global challenge, there are two primary
issues that must be resolved:  crop yields and effective management of limited
fresh water supplies.  For the producer, these are very real challenges; for
Valmont, they represent the markets of tomorrow. Our center pivot and linear
move irrigation systems provide solutions for these issues.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
     The industrial products segment reported a 52.0% increase in operating
income, from $23.6 million in 1994 to $35.9 million in 1995, on a 13.1%
increase in revenues.  The strongest revenue gains came from the sale of metal
poles to the lighting markets in Europe and North America and products for the
wireless communication markets in the United States.  Operating income grew as
a result of this volume increase and excellent cost reductions and productivity
improvements in our ballast operations.
     During 1995, we acquired the Microflect Company of Salem, Oregon.  Because
we had already created an important market position in the fast growing
communication market, we felt this acquisition would be a perfect fit...and it
is.  Microflect brought additional high-quality product lines, such as towers
and components, which complemented our existing products.  We are extremely
pleased Microflect is a part of the Valmont team.
     To meet growing demand for our engineered poles and towers, we
substantially increased our manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe
during 1995 and made our first investment in Asia with the construction of a
new plant in Shanghai, China. We selected China because it is the largest and
fastest growing economy in Asia. A key to doing well in China is "staying
power" and a total commitment to success. We have made that commitment and we
believe China represents an excellent long-term investment with tremendous
potential.

     While we are still not satisfied with the returns on our investment in the
ballast operation, we are delighted with the improvements made in 1995.  We
focused on quality, manufacturing techniques that resulted in this business now
operating at a profit.
     The future demand for our engineered poles and structures looks excellent
in the U.S. and solid overseas.  Lifestyles continue to improve around the
world.  Safety and quality of life upgrades remain a top priority for
governments and the people they serve.  We believe these trends will continue
well into the future.

                                  (PICTURE)

IRRIGATION PRODUCTS
     Operating income in this segment was up 5.6% for the year.  Sales finished
about equal to 1994's record performance in spite of a very wet spring and
early summer in North America. Stronger international sales nearly made up for
the shortfall in North America.
     Valmont has been the leader in mechanized irrigation for agriculture for
over 40 years.  We have set the industry standard and will continue to do so as
we move into the next century.  To meet the world's food production
requirements in the years ahead, growers must use limited water resources very
efficiently.  Water conservation and the need to eliminate contaminating runoff
will cause producers to practice "precision farming," the practice of applying
water and chemicals only where and when needed. We intend to be a major player
in the development and introduction of this technology to irrigated
agriculture.
     Our mechanized irrigation systems can also increase crop yields, reduce
labor costs and energy consumption, and are environmentally sensitive.  It is
not uncommon for a grower to see a complete payback on the cost of a new center
pivot irrigation system in two to three growing seasons.  The conversion from
less efficient forms of irrigation to center pivots continues to grow as does
the replacement of older systems that were installed 15-20 years ago.
     The outlook for U. S. and world agriculture is good.  Feed grain
inventories are at an all time low.  Demand for farm products remains high and
is accelerating as people around the world improve their diets....a situation
not likely to change for some time.

STAYING FOCUSED
     We will remain focused on what we do best not only in our day-to-day
operations but also in our approach to growing the business.  We will leverage
technology we know and understand into new markets or we will expand present
markets by bringing in new technology.
     We see ample opportunities to expand our businesses in North America and,
over time, we expect our investments around the world to further accelerate our
growth.
     Looking toward the future, the drivers for our core businesses remain
strong. This, together with our significant investments in our people,
production equipment, and manufacturing processes, should enable us to continue
our progress in 1996.
     Our performance is the direct result of the skills and dedication of each
member of the Valmont team and we thank them for their contributions to our
Company.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECORD SALES

     Valmont designs and manufactures quality engineered metal structures and
other fabricated products with high performance coatings for a wide range of
industrial and commercial applications. The success of this business unit is
built upon its commitment to top quality production through the use of the
latest engineering and manufacturing technology. From its automated high-speed
production equipment to its computer-linked distribution network, the Valmont
team has the talent and skill necessary to satisfy the most demanding customer
requirements.
     The customer is always the top priority and, whether the order is for
standard or a custom-designed product, Valmont is committed to just-in-time
delivery of properly designed, quality products.

COMMUNICATION TOWERS
     The rapidly growing use of cellular phones, together with other forms of
wireless communication, has created one of Valmont's most exciting
opportunities. At the end of 1995, it was estimated that cellular companies
were adding new subscribers at the rate of over 30,000 each day... which
translates into a growing demand for new communication towers.
     This business is expected to continue to be Valmont's fastest growing
product line. The 1995 acquisition of Microflect means Valmont has become a
single-source supplier for communication structures, passive repeaters, wave
guide supporting systems, components, installation, engineering, technical
services, and maintenance. Internationally, the Company recently purchased a
majority interest in Telec Centre, a small French manufacturer of communication
towers, which will position Valmont to expand in the European segment of the
market.

LIGHTING AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL STRUCTURES
     Valmont is a leading manufacturer of pole structures for lighting and
traffic signal standards. Sales are divided between public infrastructure
development and private spending for a wide variety of outdoor lighting
applications. Manufacturing and engineering flexibility to meet precise
specifications and delivery deadlines are the keys to Valmont's success in all
of its product lines. The outlook for lighting and traffic signal structures
continues favorable. New construction and redevelopment of cities and highways
remain among the most important demand factors. Crime prevention and the
growing need for safe and secure outdoor areas are also important contributors
to the increase in demand.

                                  (PICTURE)

Infrastructure development continues at a rapid rate across the United States.
Each day over 30,000 people are starting cellular phone service. Engineered
poles and towers are absolutely essential in these markets... markets in which 
Valmont stands as the only worldwide integrated manufacturer.
                                                                          34

UTILITY PRODUCTS
     Growth in the utility pole structures market is expected to come from
increased distribution and consumption of electric energy, replacement of
wooden and metal lattice structures, and deregulation of the utility industry.
Valmont's tapered steel transmission monopole designs offer better appearance,
greater reliability, and more efficient use of space. At the same time,
approximately 3% of the smaller wooden distribution poles found along most city
streets are being replaced each year...which amounts to in excess of two and a
half million poles annually. This represents potentially large demand as
utilities begin to replace a portion of their wooden poles with metal ones.
Valmont also serves the utility industry by producing components for the
electrical sub-station market.

OTHER PRODUCTS
     Ballasts - Valmont Electric produces a broad line of magnetic and
electronic ballasts for the fluorescent lighting industry. During the past
several years, this business unit has been repositioned to be one of the
lowest-cost producers in the industry and it has focused its resources on new
technology, high quality production and profitable niche markets. Newer, more
reliable, cost-efficient electronic models are the growth vehicles for the
lighting ballast industry. Sales of electronic ballasts are expected to
continue to grow rapidly.

     Custom Tubing - Valmont designs and manufactures to customer specification
a wide variety of shapes and sizes of tubular steel. Its custom tubing products
are used in a number of automotive, industrial and agricultural products,
including such diverse items as automotive starter motor housings, fire
extinguishers, and grain spouting. The Company's extensive manufacturing
capabilities allow just-in-time deliveries of custom-engineered products.

     Fasteners, Grating, and Pressure Vessels - Valmont produces and
distributes a full line of fasteners, including mechanically galvanized screws,
bolts, washers, and springs. In addition, the Company offers a full complement

INDUSTRY LEADER

Through the years, Valmont has built and supported the most extensive dealer
network in the irrigation industry. Valmont offers extensive training on a
continuous basis for its dealers who, in turn, provide world-class service in
the form of system design, installation, and replacement parts. It is Valmont's
dealer network and distribution system that has helped make the Company the
industry leader.
     Valmont pioneered the development of large-scale mechanized agricultural
irrigation equipment and today remains the worldwide industry leader. The use
of irrigation was initially begun as a means to increase the amount of land
available for food production and to increase crop yields from that land.
Surface or gravity flow methods of irrigation that simply flood the fields
became the predominant means of irrigation. Later, center pivot and linear move
irrigation systems were introduced that use less water, produce more consistent
yields and retain the chemicals in the root zone.

"VALLEY...THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN IRRIGATION"(TM)

     Today the emphasis in agriculture is on water conservation and water
quality while continuing to increase crop yields. Mechanized irrigation
systems, such as the center pivots and linear move systems manufactured by
Valmont, offer growers both economic and environmental benefits.
     Computerized controls and precise water application enable mechanized
irrigation systems to reduce water usage by as much as 50% compared with field
flooding.
     The systems can be programmed to deliver the exact amount of water needed
on a timely basis, which eliminates excess water runoff and improves crop
yields. Valmont's systems can also be operated by a computer from the grower's
home or other remote location, thus reducing time and labor costs.
     Long-term demand for irrigation systems in the U.S. is also impacted by
replacement of older systems. Many systems were installed during the 1970s and
are nearing the time when they will need replacing. With the economical,
environmental, and technological benefits of the newer systems as an added
incentive, it is expected that many growers will replace their older systems
during the next five to ten years.

                                  [PICTURES]

Just 2% of the world's water supply is fresh water available for human use. Of
the total fresh water available, agriculture uses about 65%. Valmont's
mechanized irrigation systems efficiently use this water and are the solution
to meeting the growing demand for increased food production, which must double
over the next 35 years. Center pivot and linear move systems conserve precious
water, increase crop yields and reduce chemical runoff.
                                                                          37

INTERNATIONAL
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL GROWTH

     Valmont sells full lines of engineered metal pole structures and
mechanized irrigation systems in countries that span the globe. The Company has
pole manufacturing facilities located in France, The Netherlands, Canada and
China, an irrigation plant in Spain, and a ballast production plant in Mexico.
The breadth of its sales networks and the geographic coverage of its
manufacturing facilities are two key strengths of the Company's international
business.

IRRIGATION SYSTEMS
     Most of the factors affecting demand for irrigation systems in the U.S.
are also present on a worldwide basis. As diets improve around the world, food
production must increase to satisfy growing demand. At the same time, water
available for agricultural irrigation is in short supply. It is estimated that
about 2% of the world's water is fresh water. Of this amount, 65% is used in
agriculture with about two-thirds of that wasted due to inefficient flood
irrigation techniques. The combination of increased need for food supplies and
demand for water conservation has created attractive worldwide long-term growth
opportunities for Valmont's irrigation systems. Major agricultural areas in
South America, Australia, Europe, Africa and Asia are possible growth areas for
modern irrigation systems. These areas of opportunity are potential additions
to the over 10 million acres that are now irrigated by Valmont mechanized
irrigation systems in the U.S. and some 90 other countries around the world.
                                                                          38

ENGINEERED METAL STRUCTURES
     The worldwide demand for lighting standards remains strong throughout
world markets. Infrastructure development, road construction and commercial
expansion in both developed and developing countries are creating excellent
demand for a wide variety of pole structures.
     Valmont's strategy for developing markets has been consistent for many
years. Marketing and engineering people initially serve the market. Then,
manufacturing facilities and distribution channels are established throughout
the region. This focused process has been highly successful in North America
because it ensures the timely delivery of quality products and superior
customer service.
     In Europe, Valmont entered the lighting market during 1989 and is now
growing into the utility and communication structures areas. The Company has
expanded its market to include many other countries while, at the same time,
adding a manufacturing facility in the Netherlands and increasing capacity in
France.
     The same approach is working in Asia. Valmont initially supplied these new
markets from the United States and existing French facilities. By the time the
Shanghai manufacturing plant was completed in China in late 1995, four sales
offices were already open in the region...at Beijing, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and
Shanghai. Additional facilities are planned in the next several years. The
opportunities in Asia are tremendous as large numbers of people increase their
standard of living and the region's economy expands.

     Diverse customer requirements for irrigation systems and engineered metal 
structures are promptly satisfied through Valmont's worldwide sales and
distribution networks and its manufacturing facilities located in seven
countries.
                                                                          39

</TABLE>


     Valmont's net sales in 1995 increased $42.9 million over its sales for
1994. Industrial products segment revenues rose 13.1% primarily as a result of
strong sales growth of pole and tower structures to the U.S. communications
markets and the lighting markets in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
Structures for the wireless communication market was the fastest growing
product line with the acquisition of Microflect substantially improving the
Company's position in this expanding market. The ballast business experienced
sales similar to 1994 sales.
     Irrigation products segment sales declined slightly to $162.7 million in
1995 from $164.0 million as unfavorable weather conditions during the spring
and summer in the U.S. markets slowed demand. Sales to international markets,
primarily Europe, South America and Africa, rose to offset much of the domestic
market decline.
     Gross profit increased $23.5 million in 1995 to $145.0 million, and as a
percent of sales increased from
                                                                          40

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24.2% in 1994 to 26.6% in 1995. The Irrigation Products segment gross profit
increased despite lower sales as a result of productivity improvements and
lower steel prices. Industrial Products segment gross profit also increased
from sales increases in engineered metal structures and productivity increases
in the ballast operation. A shift in the mix of products sold also impacted
gross profit as a percent of sales.
     Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 1995 were $103.1
million compared to $89.8 million in 1994. In 1995, SG&A as a percent of gross
profit was 71.1% compared to the prior year's 73.9%. The SG&A expense increase
was to support the sales volume growth, for incentive accruals and for the
development of various international markets to foster future sales.
     For 1995 and 1994, net interest expense was $3.5 million and $3.8 million,
respectively. The decrease results from lower debt levels and lower interest
rates on variable rate debt. At the end of 1995, long-term debt had decreased
by $6.8 million from the debt level at 1994 year-end.
     Miscellaneous income of $1.7 million in 1994 decreased to $0.1 million in
1995. The figure for 1994 included non-recurring gains from the sale and
disposal of excess property of $1.2 million.
     In 1995, the effective tax rate of 35.6% decreased from the 1994 effective
rate of 36.1% primarily due to reduced state income taxes as a result of
relocation of businesses to states with lower tax rates and state tax
incentives.
     For the reasons discussed above, the Company's earnings in 1995 were $24.8
million compared to $18.9 million for 1994. Earnings per share increased $0.41
per share in 1995 to $1.80 per share.

     Net sales in 1994 increased $37.5 million over 1993 sales. Sales for the
Industrial Products segment increased 2.2% in 1994 to $337.8 million from
$330.4 million in 1993. The Industrial Products segment reported significant
sales growth for United States and Canadian engineered metal structures. These
sales gains, to a great extent, were offset by the absence of sales from the
steel reinforcing bar operations exited in 1993 and divestiture of the cathodic
protection operation. Sales in the ballast product line were managed lower for
margin improvement. European metal structure sales in 1994 were slightly higher
than the levels attained in 1993 as economic conditions in Europe improved in
the second half of 1994.
     Sales for the Irrigation Products segment for 1994 of $164.0 million were
up 22.2% over 1993, as record

North American sales more than offset weaker export shipments. Improved demand
was driven by an increased focus on water conservation and replacement of older
center pivots. Sales to the international markets for 1994 declined mainly from
the reduction of sales to the Saudi Arabian market and the absence in 1994 of
large project shipments.
     Gross profit improved $11.7 million in 1994 over 1993's performance, as
sales volume increased. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 24.2% for 1994
compared to 23.6% in 1993. For the year 1994, gross profit improved in the
engineered metal structures businesses compared to 1993 as a result of
operating improvements. The lighting ballast product line and the Irrigation
Products segment experienced lower gross profit percentages due to lower market
prices in the last half of 1994.
     As a percent of gross profit, SG&A was 73.9% in 1994 compared to 74.7% in
1993. The increase in SG&A of $7.8 million in 1994 over 1993 resulted from
increased sales commissions and incentives and expanded marketing efforts
internationally.
     Operating income for 1993 was reduced by a restructuring charge of $11.0
million incurred for moving the lighting ballast product line operation from
Illinois to Texas.
     Net interest expense decreased in 1994 by $1.3 million as a result of
lower debt levels and lower interest rates on variable rate debt.
     The miscellaneous caption of other income (deductions) in the consolidated
statements of operations contains gains and losses which were of an unusual or
infrequent nature. Included in the $1.7 million in 1994 were gains of $1.2
million from the sale and disposal of excess property.
     The effective tax rate of 36.1% for 1994 was lower than the 36.4%
effective tax rate of 1993 due to increased nontaxable interest income and
foreign sales corporation tax benefits.
     As a result of the aforementioned operating factors and general business
conditions, earnings from continuing operations increased by $11.3 million in
1994 over 1993 levels. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.39
for 1994 and $0.55 for 1993. For the year 1993, the Company reported earnings
from discontinued operations of $4.6 million or $0.34 per share and an
accounting charge of $4.9 million or $0.36 per share. As a result, the
Company's 1993 net earnings of $7.3 million or $0.53 per share differed from
its earnings from continuing operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     Net working capital of $81.0 million at the end of 1995 was less than the
$88.3 million of working capital at the end of 1994. The net change results
from using cash and cash equivalents to fund additions to property, plant, and
equipment and principal payments on long-term debt. As a result, the ratio of
current assets to current liabilities was 1.8:1 at the end of 1995 compared to
1.9:1 at the end of 1994.
     Available short-term credit facilities through bank lines of credit were
$54.6 million at the end of 1995 compared to $49.8 million at the end of 1994.
At the end of 1995, $51.1 million was unused.
     The Company's growth has been financed through a combination of cash
provided from operations and the sale of Inacom Corp. stock in 1993, and to a
lesser extent through long-term financing. Cash provided from


                                                                          43

operating activities is the primary source of liquidity and amounted to $28.6
million in 1995 and $48.7 million in 1994. The Company's objective is to
maintain long-term debt as a percent of invested capital in the range of 32% to
40%. However, occasionally business conditions or opportunities may warrant
being temporarily outside this range. The Company is below the lower limit of
the range due to the sale of its investment in Inacom Corp. in 1993 and
subsequent principal payments on long-term debt. At the end of 1995 long-term
debt as a percent of invested capital was 17.3% as compared to 22.4% at the end
of 1994, due to payment of scheduled installments.
     The Company believes cash flow from operations, credit facilities
available and the capital structure now in place will be adequate for 1996
planned capital expenditures, dividends and other financial commitments, and
will allow the Company to pursue opportunities to expand its markets and
businesses.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     In 1995, the Company expended $34.8 million in property, plant and
equipment, an $11.3 million increase from the $23.5 million invested in 1994.
Major additions included new facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah and Shanghai,
China, and expansion of manufacturing capabilities and capacities at the
Brenham, Texas plant. All three of these investments were made to increase
capacity for manufacturing of engineered metal structures. These capital
expenditures will enable the Company to reach new markets and customers,
enhance capacity and productivity, and maintain up-to-date equipment and
facilities.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued statement No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" in October 1995.  This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995 and requires that
an employer's financial statements include certain disclosures about
stock-based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to
account for them.  The Company expects to comply with SFAS 123 in fiscal year
1996 by footnote disclosure of the pro forma amounts required by an employer
that continues to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."

OUTLOOK FOR 1996
     As the Company begins 1996, order backlogs are at approximately the same
levels as at the beginning of 1995, $110.0 million for 1996 compared to $111.1
million a year ago.
     The markets for the Company's irrigation products are expected to continue
favorable in 1996. The long-term driving forces of conversion from less
efficient methods of irrigation and replacement of aging equipment account for
more than 75% of the segment's sales. The conversion market is based on the
need to conserve the world's fresh water supply and reduce runoff of unused
chemicals. The replacement market is driven by the need to upgrade aging
systems.
     The short-term market forces for irrigation products are farm income,
commodity prices, interest rates and weather. While the weather is difficult to
predict, management believes that the remainder of these forces are favorable
entering 1996.

                                                                          44

     International markets also present an opportunity for the Company's
Irrigation Products segment. In 1995, sales to markets in Europe, South America
and Africa grew over 1994 levels. Management expects continued export growth in
1996 in order to meet the world's needs for food production.
     For the Industrial Products segment, the various markets are driven by
infrastructure development. The Company supplies products to the communication,
lighting and utility markets.
     In 1995, sales of poles and towers to the communication industry was the
Company's fastest growing product line and management expects this growth to
continue into 1996. These volume increases are supported by consumer demand for
cellular phones and other wireless communication equipment.
     Expansion and upgrading of the world's streets and highways is a major
element of the Company's sales of engineered metal pole structures to the
lighting and traffic markets, along with parking lot lighting for commercial
developments. The Company participates in the world markets for these products
with manufacturing plants in North America, Europe and Asia. Entering 1996,
management has some concerns about the European economy in general, and France
in particular, but feels confident that worldwide markets will continue to
grow.
     The Company supplies electrical transmission and distribution structures
to the utility industry; this industry is currently facing possible changes due
to deregulation. Management feels that the Company is well positioned to take
advantage of the ultimate structure of the industry through new products and
meeting the specific requirements of customers.
     The Company also participates in the lighting market by producing ballasts
for fluorescent lamps. Management expects the electronic side of this market to
grow in 1996, while the demand for magnetic products is expected to continue to
decline.
     Overall, the Company's performance can be influenced by developments in
national and world economies, however, management feels that the markets the
Company serves provide ample opportunities for growth in the future.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   Valmont Industries, Inc.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THREE-YEAR PERIOD  ENDED DECEMBER 30, 1995
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts.)

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valmont
Industries, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany items have been eliminated.
     The consolidated financial statements have been restated for the July 31,
1995 acquisition of Microflect Company, Inc., (Microflect), which has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The financial statements and notes
reflect amounts related to the consolidated results of the Company and
Microflect.
     In 1994, the Company acquired the assets of Energy Steel Corporation of
Tulsa, Oklahoma, a manufacturer of utility products.  Pro forma consolidated
financial information is not considered significant and has been omitted.

Fiscal Year
     The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis which ends on the
last Saturday in December, except for certain foreign subsidiaries which
operate on a fiscal year which ends on November 30.  Accordingly, the Company's
fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993 ended on December 30, December 31 and December
25, respectively and contained 52 weeks, 53 weeks and 52 weeks respectively.

Inventories
     At December 30, 1995 approximately 46% of inventory is valued at the lower
of cost on the basis of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) dollar value method under
the natural business unit concept or market (net realizable value).  As a
result, it is not possible to segregate inventory into its component values of
raw material, work in process and finished goods.  All other inventory is
valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market (net
realizable value).  During 1994, the method of determining the cost of
inventories for the lighting ballast product line was changed from the LIFO
method to the FIFO method because the Company has experienced deflationary
material and labor cost components of inventory.  The effect of this change was
immaterial for all years presented.
     The excess of replacement cost of inventories over the LIFO value is
approximately $10,200 and $10,600 at December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994,
respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment
     Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.  Depreciation
and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets.

Income Taxes
     Effective the beginning of fiscal 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Under SFAS 109, the asset
and liability method is used to calculate deferred income taxes.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized on temporary differences between
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates.  The effect that a change in tax rates has on deferred tax assets and
liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 decreased 1993 net earnings
by $4,910 ($.36 per share).

Foreign Currency Translations
     Results of operations for foreign subsidiaries are translated using the
average exchange rates during the period.  The assets and liabilities are
translated at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date.
Cumulative translation adjustments are included as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.

Earnings Per Share
     Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and equivalent common shares from in-the-money stock
options.  The difference between primary and fully-diluted earnings per share
is not material.


                                                                          52

Miscellaneous
     The miscellaneous caption of "Other income (deductions)" in the
consolidated statements of operations contains gains and losses which are of an
unusual or infrequent nature. Pretax gains from disposal of excess property
amounting to $1,183 were included in 1994.

Use of Estimates
     Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(2) CASH FLOW SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
     The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash
payments for interest and income taxes (net of refunds) were as follows:

(3) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENT IN NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
     The Company's investment in Inacom Corp., which was previously accounted
for under the equity method of accounting as an investment in nonconsolidated
affiliate, was sold in 1993 in an underwritten public offering. The Company
received net cash proceeds of $47,557 and realized a net gain after tax of
$3,950.  The Company's share of Inacom net earnings prior to the public
offering were $687 in 1993.  All other nonconsolidated affiliates are not
material.

(a)  The promissory notes payable are due in varying annual principal
     installments through 2001.  The notes are subject to prepayment in whole or
     in part with or without premium as specified in the agreements.

(b)  The promissory note totaling 38.6 million French francs is due in three
     equal annual principal installments through 1998. The interest rate on 
     the note is variable based on 6-month PIBOR (Paris Interbank Offering 
     Rate), or can be fixed at the Company's option.  At December 30, 1995 the 
     effective interest rate was 5.03%. The note is secured by the common stock
     of Sermeto.

     The agreements place certain restrictions on working capital, capital
expenditures, payment of dividends, purchase of Company stock and additional
borrowings.  The amount of retained earnings at December 30, 1995 not
restricted as to payment of cash dividends and purchase of the Company's
capital stock under the most restrictive provisions of the agreements was
approximately $42,000.
     The minimum aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the four
years following 1996 are: $7,645, $7,538, $4,943 and $3,760.

(9)  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
     Established under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k), the Valmont
Employee Retirement Savings Plan is available to all eligible employees.  The
Company makes an annual basic contribution equal to $.25 on the dollar of the
first 3% of each participant's annual pay.  In addition, participants can elect
to contribute up to 15% of annual pay, on a pretax and/or after-tax basis.  The
Company will match $.50 to $.75 on the dollar of the first 6% of the employee
pretax contribution.  The Company, at the discretion of the Board of Directors,
may also pay a supplemental contribution of up to $.50 on the dollar of the
first 6% of the participants' pretax contributions.  In addition, the Company
has a defined contribution plan covering the employees of Microflect;
contributions under this plan are based primarily on the performance of the
business unit and employee compensation.  The 1995, 1994 and 1993 Company
contributions to these plans amounted to approximately $4,700, $3,000 and
$3,100, respectively.

(10) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
     The Company's accounting system does not accumulate all costs incidental
to research and development for new products or improvements to existing
products.  It is estimated that the research and development costs charged
against earnings were approximately $2,800 in 1995, $2,700 in 1994 and $2,700
in 1993.

(11) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
     During 1993, the Company incurred a $10,961 nonrecurring restructuring
charge ($7,125 or 52 cents per share after tax) related to its lighting ballast
subsidiary, Valmont Electric, Inc.  The charge was the result of finalizing the
move of ballast operations from Illinois to Texas as well as changes in the
ballast market.  Write-offs of equipment no longer necessary, severance
accruals and other related costs were included in the charge.

                                                                          56

(12) DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts
payable, notes payable to banks and accrued expenses approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments.  The fair values of each of
the Company's long-term debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash
flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's current
borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity.  The fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time and the underlying
assumptions are subject to change based on market conditions.  At December 30,
1995, the carrying amount of the Company's long-term debt is $36,687 with an
estimated fair value of approximately $39,000.

(13)  STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHT PLAN
      In December 1995, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend
of one preferred stock purchase right ("Right") for each outstanding share of
common stock. The Rights become exercisable ten days after a person (other than
Robert B. Daugherty and his related persons and entities) acquires or commences
a tender offer for 15% or more of the Company's common stock.  Each Right
entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a new series
of preferred stock at an exercise price of $100, subject to adjustment. The
Rights expire on December 19, 2005 and may be redeemed at the option of the
Company at $.01 per Right, subject to adjustment.  Under certain circumstances,
if (i) any person becomes an Acquiring Person or (ii) the Company is acquired
in a merger or other business combination, each holder of a Right (other than
the Acquiring Person) will have the right to receive, upon exercise of the
Right, shares of common stock (of the Company under (i) and of the acquiring
company under (ii)) having a value of twice the exercise price of the Right.

(14) ACQUISITION
     On July 31, 1995, Microflect Company, Inc. was merged with and became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the terms of an agreement
and Plan of Merger under which the Company exchanged 1,950,000 shares of its
common stock for all of the outstanding common stock of Microflect.  The merger
qualifies as a tax-free reorganization and was accounted for as a pooling of
interests.  Accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial statements have
been restated to include the results of Microflect for all periods presented.
The combined financial results presented include adjustments made to conform
accounting policies of the two companies.  The only adjustment impacting net
income was the recording of income taxes, as prescribed by SFAS No. 109, for
Microflect as it was a subchapter S corporation prior to the merger.  All other
adjustments are reclassifications to conform with the financial statement
presentation.  Combined and separate results of the Company and Microflect
during the periods preceding the merger were as follows:

   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
   Valmont Industries, Inc.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
VALMONT INDUSTRIES, INC.:

     We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Valmont Industries,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 30, 1995.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valmont
Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 30, 1995 and December 31,
1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 30, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
     As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," in fiscal 1993.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Valmont Industries, Inc.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The consolidated financial statements of Valmont Industries, Inc. and
Subsidiaries and the other information contained in the Annual Report were
prepared by and are the responsibility of management.  The statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
necessarily include amounts based on management's best estimates and judgments.
     In fulfilling its responsibilities, management relies on a system of
internal controls which provide reasonable assurance that the financial records
are reliable for preparing financial statements and for maintaining
accountability of assets.  Internal controls are designed to reduce the risk
that material errors or irregularities in the financial statements may occur
and not be timely detected.  These systems are augmented by written policies,
careful selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational
structure providing division of responsibilities and a program of financial,
operational and systems audits.  The Company also has a business ethics policy
which requires employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of
Company business.
     The Audit Committee, composed of non-employee directors is responsible for
recommending to the Board of Directors, subject to ratification by
shareholders, the independent accounting firm to be retained each year.  The
Audit Committee meets regularly, and when appropriate separately, with the
independent certified public accountants, management and the internal auditors
to review Company performance.  The independent certified public accountants,
internal auditors, and the Audit Committee have unrestricted access to each
other in the discharge of their responsibilities.
