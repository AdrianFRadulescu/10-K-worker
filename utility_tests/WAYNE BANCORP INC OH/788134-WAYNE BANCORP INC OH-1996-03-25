ITEM I.   BUSINESS

General Development of Business:
Wayne Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, the Wayne County National Bank,
(collectively the "Company"), conduct general commercial banking business. 
Wayne Bancorp, Inc. is a one-bank holding company organized in April, 1986.

The Wayne County National Bank ("The Bank") is a full-service bank offering a
wide range of commercial and personal banking services primarily to customers in
Wayne, Holmes and Stark Counties of Ohio.  These services include a broad range
of loan, deposit and trust products and various miscellaneous services.  Loan
products include commercial and commercial real estate loans, a variety of
mortgage and construction loan products, installment loans, home equity lines
of credit, Visa and Master Card lines of credit and lease financings.
Deposit products include interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts,
various savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and IRAs.  The Trust 
Department provides services in the areas of employee benefits, and personal
trusts.  Miscellaneous services include safe deposit boxes, night depository,
United States savings bonds, traveler's checks, money orders and
cashier checks, bank-by-mail service, money transfers, wire services, utility
bill payments and collections, notary public services, discount brokerage 
services and alternative investments.  In addition, the Bank has correspondent
relationships with major banks in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Detroit pursuant
to which the Bank received various financial services.  The Bank accounts for
substantially all (99%) of Wayne Bancorp.'s consolidated assets at
December 31, 1995.

The Bank's primary lending area consists of Wayne County, Ohio, and its 
contiguous counties. Loans outside the primary lending area are considered
for creditworthy applicants.  Lending decisions are make in accordance with
written loan policies designed to maintain loan quality.

Retail lending products are comprised of credit card loans, overdraft lines,
personal lines of credit and installment loans.  Credit cards are unsecured
credit accounts, on which the credit limits are determined by analysis of two
criteria, the borrowers debt service and gross income. Overdraft lines of 
credit are lines attached to checking accounts to cover overdrafts and/or
allow customers to write themselves a loan. Credit limits are based on a 
percentage of gross income and average deposits.   Personal lines of credit
include lines secured by junior mortgages (home equity) and Private Banking
lines which are generally secured by junior mortgages but may be unsecured or
secured by other collateral.  The lines have a twenty year draw period and may
then be renewed or amortized over ten years.   Credit limits are determined
by comparing three criteria, appraised value, debt service and gross income.
Installment loans include both direct and indirect loans.  The term can range
from three to 180 months, depending upon the collateral which includes new and
used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles as well as junior mortgages
and unsecured personal loans.  Retail lending underwriting guidelines include
evaluating the entire credit using the Five C's of Credit, character, capacity
capital, condition and collateral.  Credit scoring, analysis of credit bureau
ratings and debt to income ratios are the major tools used by the lender in
the underwriting process.

The Bank offers a variety of mortgage loans programs, including a variety of 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgages ranging from 120 to 260 months.  The 
underwriting guidelines include those for consumer loans and those necessary
to meet secondary market guidelines.  The Bank may sell loans to the secondary
market when it deems it profitable and desirable to do so.Residential real 
estate decisions focus on loan to value limits, debt to income ratio, housing
to income ratio, credit history, and in some cases whether private mortgage
insurance is obtained.

Business credit products include commercial loans and commercial real estate
loans and leases. Commercial loans include lines and letters of credit, fixed
and adjustable rate term loans, demand and time notes.  Commercial real estate
loans include fixed and adjustable mortgages.  Loans are generally to owner
occupied businesses.  The portfolio also includes loans to churches, rental
property, shopping plazas and residential development loans. Loans to businesses
often entail greater risk because the primary source of repayment is typically
dependent upon adequate cash flow.  Cash flow of a business can be subject to
adverse conditions in the economy or a specific industry.  Should cash flow fail
the lender looks to the assets of the business and/or the ability of the 
comakers to support the debt.  Commercial lenders consider the Five C's of
Credit, character, capacity, capital, condition and collateral in making 
commercial credit decisions.  The Bank has provided both direct and indirect
leasing on a limited basis.  The direct  leases are for specific equipment and
may be open-end or closed-end.  Indirect leases are established by the same 
methods as an indirect consumer auto finance.  Each vehicle has its own 
amortization.

In addition to the underwriting guidelines followed for specific loan types, the
Bank has underwriting guidelines common to all loan types.  With regard to 
collateral, the Bank follows supervisory limits set forth in Regulation H for
transactions secured by real estate.  Loans in excess of these guidelines are
reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.  Loans not secured by
real estate are analyzed on a loan  by loan basis, based on collateral type
guidelines set forth in the loan policy.  Appraisal policies follow and comply 
with provisions outlined under Title XI of  FIRREA.  All appraisals are done by
outside independent appraisers The Bank, as a general rule, gets an appraisal
on all real estate transactions even when not required by Title XI.  Approval
procedures include loan authorities approved by the Board of Directors for 
ndividual lenders and loan committees.   Retail and residential loans are 
centrally underwritten by their respective departments.  Business credits can
be approved by the individual commercial lender or taken to Loan Committee if
it exceeds individual approval limits. The Board of Directors approves 
aggregate loan commitments in excess of $500 thousand up to the Bank's legal
lending limit.  Loans to Directors and Executive Officers are approved by
the Board of Directors. 

The Loan Quality Review Committee meets on a monthly basis.  The Committee
reviews Bank lending trends, the Past Due Report, the Watch List and various
other reports in order to monitor and maintain credit quality.  The Committee
also reviews on a relationship basis, customers on the Bank's Watch List and
credits with aggregate commitments in excess of $300 thousand.

Revenues from loans accounted for 71%, 69%, and 66% of consolidated revenues in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Revenues from interest and dividends on 
investment securities, federal funds sold and mortgage-backed securities 
accounted for 19%, 20% and 22% of consolidated revenues in 1995, 1994, and 
1993, respectively.

The business of the Registrant is not seasonal to any material degree, nor is it
dependent upon a single or small group of customers whose loss would result 
in a material adverse effect on the Registrant or its subsidiaries.

Regulation and Supervision
Wayne Bancorp, Inc., is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of 
Ohio. The Company is required to file certain reports and periodic information
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

As a bank holding company incorporated and doing business within the State of
Ohio,   The Company is subject to regulation and supervision under the Bank 
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act").  The Company is required
to file with the Federal Reserve Board on a quarterly basis information 
pursuant to the Act.  The Federal Reserve Board may conduct examinations or 
inspections of the Company and its subsidiaries.

The Company is required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board
for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting shares or 
substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.  In 
addition, the Company is prohibited by the Act, except in certain situations 
from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent
of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company 
and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of 
banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its 
subsidiaries.  The Company may, however, subject to the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board, engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in 
activities which are deemed by; the Federal Reserve Board by order or by 
regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling a 
bank as to be a proper activity.



The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary Bank.  
It is anticipated that a significant portion of the Company's revenues, 
including funds available for payment of dividends (if any) and for operating
expenses, will be provided by dividends paid by its Bank subsidiary.  There 
are statutory limitations on the amount of dividends which may be paid to 
the Company by its Bank subsidiary.

The Company's national banking subsidiary is subject to primary regulation, 
supervision and examination by the Comptroller of the Currency.  The Bank is a 
member of the Federal Reserve System and, as such, is subject to the applicable 
provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued thereunder.  
Further, the subsidiary Bank is also subject to the applicable provisions of 
Ohio law insofar as they do not conflict with federal banking laws.

The Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  
Related to that, the Bank is subject to provisions of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.  This Act is designed to 
protect the deposit insurance fund, to improve regulation and supervision of 
insured depository institutions and to improve the reporting information related
to financial institutions.

Management is not aware of any; current recommendations by regulatory 
authorities which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material 
effect on the Company.

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company is required by the various regulatory authorities to maintain 
certain capital levels. The required capital levels and the Company's capital 
position at December 31, 1995 are:

                Minimum Regulatory Requirements   Company's Current Ratios

Leverage Ratio              4.0% to 5.0%                  10.1%
Risk Based Capital            8.0%                        18.2%

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sets premiums for deposit insurance 
based on the Company's capital levels.  In the event the Company's levels fall 
below the minimum requirement, the premiums for deposit insurance could rise.  

Government Monetary Policy
The earnings of the Company are affected primarily by general economic 
conditions, and to a lesser extent by the fiscal and monetary policies of the 
federal government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank.  
Its policies influence the amount of bank loans and deposits and interest rates 
charged and paid thereon, and thus have an effect on the earnings of
the subsidiary and the Company.

Competition
The banking and financial services industry in the Company's market is highly 
competitive.  The Company's market area encompasses Wayne, Holmes and Stark 
Counties in Ohio.  The Bank competes for loans and deposits with other 
commercial banks, savings and loans, finance companies and credit unions.  The 
primary competitive factor is interest rates charged on loans and paid for 
deposits as well as fees charged for various other products and service.

Employees
As of December 31, 1995, the Company had 147 full time employees and 29 part 
time employees. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining 
agreement and management considers its relationship with their employees to 
be good.

(1)   For purposes of the above table, changes in interest due to volume and 
      rate were determined as follows:
         Volume variance - Change in volume multiplied by the prior year's rate.
         Rate Variance - Change in rate multiplied by the prior year's balance.
         Rate/Volume Variance - Change in volume multiplied by change in rate.

The rate/volume variance was allocated to volume variance and rate variances in 
proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of change in each.

(2) Interest income on tax exempt securities includes the effects of taxable 
        equivalent adjustments using a 34% tax rate for each year.

The policy for placing loans on non-accrual status is to stop the accrual on 
interest when it is like that collection of all of the principle or interest 
is deemed doubtful, or when loans are past due as principle or interest ninety
days or more.  In certain cases, interest accruals are continued on loans
ninety days past due if they are deemed to be adequately secured and in the 
process of collection.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 114 and SFAS No. 118 effective January 1, 1995.  
At December 31, 1995, the Company had no loans classified as impaired, and 
therefore, the adoption of SFAS No. 114 and SFAS No. 118 had no effect on the
comparability of non-performing assets at December 31, 1995 to prior periods.

As of December 31, 1995, there were no potential problem loans for which 
management has doubt as to the borrower's ability to comply with the present 
repayment terms, which are not disclosed as past due ninety days or more, 
non-accrual or restructured.  These loans and their potential loss
exposure has been considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the reserve 
for loan losses, prepared by management and included on page 13 of this filing.

There were no foreign loans outstanding at December 31, 1995, 1994 or 1993.

As of December 31, 1995, there were no concentrations of credit greater than 10%
of total loans which are not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans pursuant
to Guide 3, Item III. A.

As of December 31,1 995, there are no other interest bearing assets that would 
require disclosure under Guide 3, Item III. C. 1 or C.2., if such assets were 
loans.


SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE
WAYNE BANCORP, INC.

In the normal course of business, the Company assumes risk of extending credit.
The Company manages this risk through its lending policy, loan review procedures
and personal contact with the borrower.

In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management 
evaluates past loan loss experience, present and anticipated economic 
conditions and credit-worthiness of its borrowers.  The allowance for loan 
losses is increased by provisions charged to operations and recovery of loans
previously charged off.  The allowance is reduced by loans charged off as they
become uncollectible by the Bank's management.  The following table contains 
information relative to the loan loss experience for five years ending 
December 31:

                            ==============================================

Management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on several 
factors.  First, consideration is given to the current portfolio.  Management
has an internal loan review function that is designed to identify problem and
impaired loans and the losses that may be expected if the borrower is unable 
to continue servicing the debt.  Management will use the amount of loss that 
is expected on those loans.  The second step is review the prior charge-off 
history of each category of loan.  In this step, management will review the 
prior three year average charge-offs and compare that to the expected loss 
identified in the first step and will adjust the allocation accordingly.  The
third step is to review any loans that have been classified by the regulatory
examiners and allocate the specific loss portion that is determined by the 
examiners.

The Company's management has an internal strategic goal that sets the allowance
for loan losses in a range of 1.25% to 1.50% of total net loans and leases.
At December 31, 1995 that ratio was 1.75% of total net loans and leases.  Based 
on the ratio of allowance to total net loans and leases and the  December 31,
1995 ratio of loans past due 30 days or more to total net loans and leases
was .61%, the above allocation is considered reasonable by the Company's 
management.

The amounts included in the specific allocations are obtained by using the 
principle balance of any loans classified on the problem loan list as loss or
doubtful, plus 10% of the total principle balances of loans considered 
substandard and 5% of those which are considered watch credits.

At December 31, 1995, the Company had not allocated any portion of the allowance
for loan losses for impaired loan balances.  The adoption of SFAS No. 114 and
SFAS No. 118 had no impact on the comparability of the December 31, 1995 
allowance for loan losses allocation to prior periods.

FORM 10-K

A copy of the Company's 1995 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission is available to shareholders without charge.
To obtain a copy, direct your request to David P. Boyle, CPA, Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer, P.O. Box 757, Wooster, OH  44691.

                                                        January 25, 1996


     The management of Wayne Bancorp, Inc. has prepared and is responsible for
the financial statements and for the integrity and consistency of other related
information contained in the Annual Report.  In the opinion of management,
the financial statements, which necessarily include amounts that are based on
management estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances.


     The Company designed and maintains a system of internal accounting 
controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are 
safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with Company 
authorizations and policies, and that transactions are properly recorded so 
as to permit preparation of financial statements that will fairly present the
financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.  Internal accounting controls are augmented by
written policies covering standards of personal and business conduct and an 
organizational structure providing for division of responsibility and authority.

     The effectiveness of and compliance with established control systems is 
monitored through a continuous program of internal audit and credit 
examinations.  In recognition of cost-benefit relationships and inherent 
control limitations, some features of the control system are designed
to detect rather than prevent errors, irregularities and departures from 
approved policies and practices.  Management believes that the system of 
controls has prevented or detected on a timely basis any occurrences that 
could be material to the financial statements and that timely corrective 
actions have been initiated when appropriate.

     The Company engaged Crowe, Chizek and Company LLP, independent certified
public accountants, to render an opinion on the financial statements.  The 
accountants have advised management that they were provided with access to 
all information and records deemed necessary to render their opinion.

     The Board of Directors exercises its responsibility for the financial 
statements and related information through the Audit Committee, which is 
comprised entirely of outside directors. The Audit Committee meets on a 
regular basis with mangement, the Internal Auditor of the Company, and Crowe,
Chizek and Company LLP to assess the scope of the annual audit plan, to review
the status and results of audits, to review the Annual Report and Form 10-K,
including major changes in accounting policy and reporting practices, and to
approve non-audit related services rendered by the independent auditors.

     Crowe, Chizek and Company LLP also meets with the Audit Committee, without
management being present, to afford them the opportunity to express their 
opinion on the adequacy of management's compliance with the established 
policies and procedures and the quality ofthe financial reporting.

                   Report of  Crowe, Chizek and Company LLP
                            Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Wayne Bancorp, Inc.
Wooster, Ohio

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wayne 
Bancorp, Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related consolidated 
statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity for the
three years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993. These financial statements
 are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform our audits to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for 
our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wayne 
Bancorp, Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of operations
and cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the 
Company changed its method of accounting for impaired loans in 1995, for 
certain investment securities in 1994 and for income taxes in 1993 to conform
to new accounting guidance.

1.   NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Wayne Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, the Wayne County National Bank conduct
general commercial banking business. Wayne Bancorp is a one-bank holding company
organized in April, 1986.

The Company operates in the single industry of commercial banking.  While the 
Company offers a wide range of services, they are all deemed to be part of 
commercial banking.

The Wayne County National Bank has eleven banking locations in Wayne, Holmes 
and Stark Counties in Ohio.  A wide variety of services are provided to 
businesses, individuals, and institutional and governmental customers.  These
services include commercial and personal checking accounts, savings and time 
deposits, business and personal loans, real estate loans, credit cards, leases
safe deposit facilities and electronic banking.

The Bank operates a Trust Department which offers complete trust administrative
services, and agency, trust and investment services to individuals, 
corporations, partnerships, institutions and municipalities.  In addition, 
the Trust Department has discount brokerage service which offers stock trading
services to customers.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wayne Bancorp,
Inc. (the Company), subsidiary Wayne County National Bank (the Bank), and the
Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, Wayne National Corporation.  All significant 
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Investment Securities

    Effective January 1, 1994, the Company changed its method of accounting for
debt and equity securities to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 
Securities."  Accordingly, securities are classified into held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale categories.  The held-to-maturity securities are those which
management has the positive intent the Company has the ability to hold to 
maturity, and are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts.  Available-for-sale securities are those which the 
Company may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management,
or other reasons.  Available-for-Sale securities are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of equity,
net of tax.  The effect of adopting this new accounting guidance was to increase
the Company's equity at January 1, 1994 by approximately $140 thousand.  Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 115, the Company recorded its investment securities
at amortized cost. Realized gains or losses are determined based on the 
amortized cost of the specific security sold.

Interest and Fees on Loans and Leases

    Interest income on commercial, consumer and mortgage loans is primarily 
calculated by using the simple interest method based on the principal amounts
outstanding.  Lease income is recognized under a method which provides for a
level return on the net investment outstanding.  Loan origination fees and 
certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized over the contractual
life of the related loan using the level yield method.  The net amount of fees
and costs deferred is reported in the consolidated balance sheets as a part of
loans and leases.

    The accrual of interest on loans is suspended when, in Management's opinion,
the collection of a a portion of the loan principal has become doubtful.  When
a loan is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid interest at risk is
charged against income.  Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied 
against principal until recovery of the remaining balance is reasonably assured.
The carrying value of loans classified as impaired is periodically adjusted to
reflect cash payments, revised estimates of future cash flows and increases in
the present value of expected cash flows due to passage of time.  Cash payments
representing interest income are reported as such and other cash payments are
reported as reductions in carrying values.  Increases or decreases in carrying
values due to changes in estimates of future payments or the passage of time
are reported as reductions or increases in the provision for loan losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

    The allowance for loan losses is a valuation established through a provision
for loan losses charged to expense.  The allowance is the amount which, in the
opinion of management, is necessary to provide for potential losses in the loan
portfolio.  Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance
is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans outstanding, taking 
into consideration prior loss experience, loan quality, current economic 
conditions and other pertinent factors.  Loans which are deemed uncollectible
are charged off and deducted from the allowance and recoveries on loans
previously charged off are added to the allowance.

On January 1, 1995 the Company adopted SFAS 114, as amended by SFAS 118.  Under
this standard, loans considered to be impaired, as identified according to 
internal loan review standards, are reduced to the present value of expected
future cash flows or to the fair value of collateral by allocating a portion
of the allowance for loan losses to such loans.  If these allocations cause the
allowance for loan losses to require an increase, such an increase will be
reported as a provision for loan losses charged to operations.  The effect of
adopting this standard did not materially effect the allowance for loan losses
at January 1, 1995 or at December 31, 1995.

    Management analyzes loans on an individual basis and classifies a loan as
impaired when an analysis of the borrower's operating results and financial 
condition indicates that underlying cash flows are adequate to meet its debt
service requirements.  Often this is associated with a delay or shortfall in
payments of 30 days or more.  Smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated
for impairment in total.  Such loans include residential first mortgage loans
secured by one to four family residences, residential construction loans, 
consumer automobile, home equity and credit card loans with balances less than
$300 thousand.  In addition, loans held for sale and leases are excluded from 
consideration as impaired.  Loans are generally moved to non-accrual status when
90 days or more past due.  These loans are often also considered impaired.  
Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.
The nature of the disclosures for impaired loans is considered generally 
comparable to prior nonaccrual loans and non-performing and past due asset 
disclosures.  The adoption of SFAS No. 114 had no impact on the comparability
of the December 31, 1995 allowance for loan losses to prior periods.

Premises and Equipment

     Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of the asset.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred
and major improvements are capitalized.

Other Real Estate

     Other real estate is recorded at  the lower of cost or fair value, less 
estimated costs to sell.  Any reduction from the carrying value of the related
loan to fair value at the time the property is acquired is accounted for as a
loan charge-off.  Any subsequent reductions in the fair value are reflected in a
valuation allowance through a charge to other real estate expense.  Expenses 
incurred to carry other real estate are charged to operations as incurred.

     There was no other real estate held at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

Investment in Affiliate

     The Bank's 20% partnership interest in NB5 Financial Services is reported
using the equity method of accounting.  NB5 Financial Services is an Ohio 
general partnership engaged in equipment leasing activities.  Due to changes
in the demand for leases, the partners have determined that NB5 will not 
continue generating new leases.  As existing leases are paid, equity 
distributions will be made to the partners.  In 1995 there were no capital
distributions versus $105 thousand in 1994.

Intangibles

     Intangible assets arising from the Bank's acquisition of four branches of
the former First Savings & Loan Company of Massillon, F.A., in July of 1991
are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet
and are summarized as follows:

          Goodwill...................    $919
          Core Deposit Intangible....     279

     Goodwill is being amortized using a method and life which corresponds to
the accretion of the loan discount.  Core deposit intangible is being amortized
by deposit component, on a level yield basis over a ten year period.  
Amortization of these intangibles totaled $250 thousand, $290 thousand, and $323
thousand for 1995, 1994 and 1993 respectively.

Income Taxes

     Beginning in 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes."  The Company records income tax expense based on the amount of taxes
due on its tax return plus the change in deferred taxes computed based on the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates.  
Previously, the Company computed deferred taxes for the tax effects of timing
differences between financial reporting and tax return income.  The effect of
adoption of SFAS No. 109 as of January 1,1993 is shown as the cumulative effect
of an accounting change in the 1993 Consolidated Statement of Income.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     In 1993, the Company established a dividend reinvestment plan whereby the
Company's shareholders are eligible to acquire new common shares of stock at
100% of the current estimated fair market value in lieu of receiving cash 
dividends.  Shareholders can have all or part of their normal cash dividends 
reinvested in the Company's stock.  During 1995, 5,454  shares of stock were
allocated under the plan in lieu of cash dividends of $214 thousand.  Of the
shares allocated, 2,754 new shares were issued by the Company and 2,700 shares
were obtained from a reduction in the Treasury stock.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

    Cash and cash equivalents include cash, noninterest bearing deposits with
banks and federal fund sold.  As permitted, the Company reports cash flows from
certain transactions on a net basis. For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994
and 1993, income taxes paid totaled $1.83 million, $1.75 million, and $1.73
million and interest paid totaled $9.40 million, $8.32 million, and $8.41 
million respectively.

Per Share Amounts

    Net income per share computations are based on the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.  In November of 1994,
the Company declared a 5% stock dividend.  These dividends were recorded by the
transfer of the market value of the new shares from Retained Earnings to Common
Stock and Paid in Capital.  Fractional shares resulting from the stock dividend
were paid in cash.  In June of 1993, the Board of Directors voted to split the
stock on a 2 for 1 basis.  The split was effective June 15, 1993 and payable 
to shareholders on July 1, 1993.  All per share data has been retroactively 
adjusted for the stock split and stock dividends.

     Weighted average shares outstanding for December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993
were 1,872,188, 1,866,146 and 1,855,289, respectively.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Areas involving the use of management's estimates and assumptions include
the allowance for loan losses, the realization of deferred tax assets, fair 
value of certain securities, the determination and carrying value of impaired
loans, the determination of other-than-temporary reductions in the fair
value of securities, depreciation of premises and equipment, the carrying value
and amortization of intangibles and the fair value of financial instruments.
Estimates that are more susceptible to change in the near term include the 
allowance for loan losses and the fair value of certain securities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The Wayne County National Bank grants residential, consumer and commercial
loans and also leases assets to customers located in Wayne, Holmes and Stark
Counties. The makeup of the loan portfolio at December 31, 1995 was as follows:

                   Commercial.................       40%
                   Real Estate Loans..........       35%
                   Consumer Loans.............       18%
                   Home Equity Loans..........        3%
                   Direct Financing Leases....        2%
                   Credit Cards...............        2%

Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts previously reported to
conform with the current financial statement presentation.

     During the years ended December 31, 1995, and 1994  proceeds from sales of
securities available-for-sale were $1  million with gross realized gains of $22
thousand in 1994  and losses of $1 thousand and $20 thousand in 1995 and 1994
respectively included in earnings.    Proceeds from sales of held-to-maturity
securities who's maturity date was within 90 days of the sale date amounted to
$8.1 million in 1995, with gross realized gains of $1 thousand and losses of
$12 thousand included in earnings.  There were no sales of held-to-maturity 
securities in 1994.  Proceeds from these transactions are reflected as 
maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.  There were no security
sales in 1993.
    On December 1, 1995, the Company transferred securities with an amortized
cost of $45.65 million previously classified as held-to-maturity to available-
for-sale.  The unrealized gain on the securities transferred totaled $653 
thousand.  This was done in accordance with a Financial Accounting Standards
Board ruling allowing a one time reclassification of securities.  On December 1,
1995, the Company's equity increased approximately $431 thousand as a result
of this transfer.
     The amortized cost and estimated market value of the securities at 
December 31, 1995 by contractual maturity, are shown below.  Expected maturities
may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right
to call or prepay the obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

    As of and for the year ended December 31, 1995 there were no impaired loans.
 Loans on non-accrual status at December 31, 1994 were $22 thousand. If interest
had been accrued on non-accrual loans, interest income would have increased by
approximately $5 thousand in 1994 and $3 thousand in 1993.  Additionally, loans
past due more than 90 days and still accruing income were approximately $149
thousand at December 31, 1994.
    The Bank leases various types of equipment and automobiles to its customers,
which are classified as direct lease financing leases.  All leases have terms
ranging from two to five years.  The composition of the net investment in direct
financing leases included in loans at December 31 is as follows:

                                             1995    1994

     The Bank has granted loans to the officers and directors of the Company and
its subsidiaries and related business interests.  The aggregate dollar amount of
these loans was $954 thousand and $596 thousand at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  During 1995, $559 thousand of new loans and advancements were
made and the repayments on loans to these parties totaled $201 thousand.  

    In 1996, the Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 122,
"Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights."  This statement requires lenders
who sell originated loans and retain the servicing rights to recognize as 
separate assets the rights to service the mortgage loans for others.  It also 
requires that capitalized mortgage servicing rights be assessed for impairment
based on the fair value of those rights.  Management does not anticipate that
this pronouncement will have a material impact on the Company's financial
condition or results of operations upon adoption.

5.  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

    Changes in the allowance for loan losses for the three years ending 
December 31 are as follows:

Interest expense on these deposits was $959 thousand, $440 thousand and $534
thousand for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.


8.  DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate
that value.

Cash and Short Term Investments
     For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable 
estimate of the fair value

Investment Securities
     Fair values are based on a quoted market price, if available.   If a quoted
market price is not fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for
similar instruments.

Loans and Leases
     For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as some residential
mortgages, credit card receivables, and other consumer loans, fair value is
estimated using quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans,
adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  The fair value of other types
loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates at which
similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for
the same remaining maturities.  For variable rate loans, the carrying amount
approximates fair value.

Deposits
     Fair values for deposit liabilities with defined maturities are based on
the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be paid, using the current
rate offered  for similar deposits with the same remaining maturities.  For 
deposit liabilities with no defined maturities, the fair value is the amount
payable upon demand.  For time deposits with variable rates, the carrying value
approximates market value.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit
     The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged
to enter similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the
agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  For fixed
rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current
levels of interest  rates and the committed rates.  The fair value of letters
of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the
estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligation with the
counterparties at the reporting date.  The estimated  fair values of the Bank's
financial instruments are as follows:

                                                1995

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Bank sponsors a noncontributory Profit Sharing Retirement Plan (PSRP)
and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) in which all salaried employees 
with one year or more of service participate.  Annual contributions are made by
the Bank to both plans in an amount which is the lesser of 8.5% of the Bank's
current profits or 6.375% of the aggregate compensation paid in such year to
all eligible participants.  Actual contributions paid to the plans for the 
three years ending December 31 were:

                                         1995     1994      1993

   The Company's stock is not listed on a national exchange and as such the
Company could be required to repurchase shares of the Company's stock held by
the ESOP upon the retirement or termination of participants in the plan.  At
December 31, 1995, the fair value of shares subject to the repurchase obligation
totaled $2.4 million.

10. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    As of December 31, 1995, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit
of $1.8 million.  Also at that date, the Bank had commitments outstanding to
extend credit and unfunded lines of credit for customers totaling approximately
$25.3 million.  These commitments generally require the customer to maintain
certain credit standards.  Management does not anticipate any material losses
as a result of these commitments.
    At December 31, 1995, the Bank was required to maintain $4.6 million either
in cash or in balances with the Federal Reserve Bank.  These balances do not
earn interest.
    In November, 1988, the Bank entered into a service agreement with Electronic
Data Systems Corporation to provide proof and data processing services.  The
contract covers a period of ten years with remaining minimum yearly service 
fees as summarized by the following  schedule:

Years Ended December 31
          1996..............    $834
          1997..............     834
          1998..............     765

                             ========

13. RESTRICTIONS ON SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS

     Dividends are paid by the Company from its assets which are mainly provided
by the dividends from the Bank.  However, certain restrictions exist in regard
to the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of
dividends.  The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to pay
dividends in excess of the Bank's earnings retained in the current year plus
retained profits from the preceding two years.  The amount of retained earnings
available for dividends without approval from the Comptroller of the Currency
is approximately $8.62 million at December 31, 1995.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

        Net income for 1995 was $4.49 million or $2.40 per share compared to
$4.02 million or $2.15 per share for 1994 and $3.67 million or $1.98 million
in 1993.  1995 net income surpassed 1994 net income by  $465 thousand or 11.6%
and 1993 net income by $813 thousand or 22.1%.

        Return on average assets for 1995 was 1.43% compared to 1.33% in 1994
and 1.27% in 1993.  Return on average equity for these same periods was 12.56%,
12.44% and 12.43% respectively.

        The allowance for loan and lease losses to total net loans and lease 
ratio at December 31,1995 was 1.75% compared to 1.75% in 1994 and 1.67% in 1993.

        As discussed in more detail below, the increase in net income for 1995
resulted primarily from a $1.05 million or 8.0% higher net interest margin, and
a reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations.
These two items which increased the Company's earnings for 1995 were partially
offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $692 thousand.  Non-interest
income increased $154 or 5.9% from 1994 to 1995.  This increase is primarily 
attributed to increased income from the Trust & Investment Services Department.

Net Interest Income

        Net interest income represents the primary source of earnings for Wayne
Bancorp, Inc.  Net interest income represents the difference between interest
income generated by earning assets offset by interest expense generated by 
interest bearing liabilities.  Net interest income is impacted by changes in
interest rates, volume and composition of both earning assets and and interest
bearing liabilities as well as the level of non-interest bearing demand deposit
accounts.  During 1995, the Company saw a relatively stable interest rate
environment in the deposit and investment areas.    As a result of this rate 
environment and the Company's balance sheet position,  the Company was able to
increase the net interest income from $13.2 million in 1994 to $14.2 million
in 1995, representing a 8.0% increase.

        Total interest income increased $3.0 million or 14.4% in 1995 over 1994.
There are two primary factors contributing to this increase.  First the loan
portfolio of the Bank grew by $15.3 million over 1994.  The majority of these
new loans are residential real estate loans or commercial loans that have their
interest rate tied to the national prime rate.  During 1995, the national prime
rate used by the Bank increased in January to 9% and has fallen to 8.5% in
December.  With the bulk of these loans being originated in the first six months
of the year when the rates were higher, the Company was able to book the fixed
rate mortgages at higher rates during the first half of the year.  The second
factor that contributed to this increase was that the loan growth was funded
primarily through sales and maturities of the investment portfolio.  The
investment portfolio by design has a short average life which means generally
lower yielding assets than the loan portfolio.  During the year, securities
either matured or were sold with yields in the 5.25% range and were replaced
with loans which were at the time in the  8% to 10% range.  

        The average yield on earning assets for 1995 was 8.19% an increase from
the 7.45% yield in 1994 and a slight decline from the 8.30% in 1993.  The 
increase in the loan volume resulted in an increase in average earning assets
of  over $11.6 million.   This was offset by an increase in the yield cost on
the deposit and short term borrowing liabilities of the Bank from 2.95% in
1994 and 3.22% in 1993 to 3.59% in 1995.   Based on the Company's projections
for the coming year, including a declining interest rate environment for at
least the first half of 1996, management anticipates an approximate 3% increase
in net interest income in 1996.

        Interest expense on repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds
increased $250 thousand or 64.1% in 1995.  The largest portion of this increase
is attributed to the repurchase agreements.  The average outstanding balance
for repurchase agreements during 1995 was $11.6 million compared to $10.0 
million in 1994.  In addition to the increase in the repurchase agreements, the
interest cost of these accounts has increased from 3.41% in 1993 to 3.90% in
in 1994 to 5.03% in 1995.  This increase in rate is due to the nature of these
accounts in that their interest rate is tied to a 30 day treasury index.  During
1995, this index has been relatively flat in the 5.10% range.   Management 
expects this expense to fall in 1996 as short term rates are expected to fall
into the 4.0% range by year end 1996.

        The Bank's Asset/Liability committee monitors the maturity structure of
all assets and liabilities on a monthly basis in order to maintain stability
in the net interest income during volatile interest rate periods.  During 1995
the Company was primarily in a negative GAP position.  In theory this meant that
during a stable or falling rate environment, the net interest margin should 
increase.  With a relatively stable interest rate environment as was the case
in 1995, the Company was able to increase the net interest margin as the 
liabilities repriced faster than the assets.

        Management anticipates short term interest rates to continue to decline
in 1996, with a possible slight increase in long term interest rates, resulting
in a more positively sloped yield curve.  Management has been attempting to 
move the GAP position of the Company toward a more negative position.  The 
negative GAP position should allow the net interest margin to  widen as interest
rates move downward.  


Provision and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

        The provision for loan and lease losses is an expense item charged to
operations of the Company.  The provision is recorded to maintain the balance
sheet related allowance for loan and lease losses at a level which will shield
the Bank's earnings and capital from decline due to credit losses. The allowance
is determined by Bank management based on estimates of possible losses in the
current loan and lease portfolio.  Management also considers the past historical
loss experience, the mix and size of the loan portfolio as well as current and
expected future economic conditions in their assessment of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan and lease losses.  Consideration is also given the 
information known about specific borrowers or industry groups which are
subject to change over time.



        Management has set a level of 1.5% of total net loans and leases as a
benchmark for the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses.  This
level will change from time to time, based on the growth  in the various types
of loans in the portfolio and the relative increase or decrease in the quality
of the loan portfolio.  During 1995, the Company maintained the ratio of
allowance coverage of total net loans and leases.  At December 31, 1995 the
coverage ratio stood at 1.75% of total net loans and leases, compared to 1.75%
in 1994 and 1.67% in 1993.  The stability in the ratio is a result of the
provision charged to operations being in excess of the net charge-offs for the
year, offset by the growth in the loan portfolio.  For the twelve months 
ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Bank  was in a "net recoveries position",
where the recovery of loans previously charged off were greater than the amount
of loans currently charged off.

        Past due and non-performing loans are one of the primary factors that
management uses to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease
losses.  At December 31, 1995 the Company had loans that were past due over 90
days or on non-accrual status of about $203  thousand  compared to $170 thousand
at December 31, 1994.  Loans on non-accrual status were approximately $15 
thousand and $22 thousand respectively.  In addition, the Company's loan
portfolio showed loans past due 30 days or more was approximately $452 thousand
or 2.1% of total loans at December 31, 1995.  These same numbers in 1994 were
$621 thousand which represents .31% of total loans.  With this type of current
quality, management feels that the Company has adequate reserves set aside to
cover potential loan problems.   

        The provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations was $120
thousand in 1995 compared to $346 thousand in 1994 and $600 thousand in 1993.
The reduction was based on management's evaluation of the quality of the loan
portfolio, the adequacy of the allowance at year end 1994, and the stability
of the net loan charge-offs in 1994 and the net recovery position in 1995.  The
net recovery position in 1995 is due mostly to the collection of a previously
charged off leverage lease in the amount of $137 thousand.  The current policy
of the Bank is to provide as a charge to operations on a monthly basis an 
amount equal to the gross charge-offs for the month.  This policy will allow
the reserve to grow through recoveries of previously charged off loans.
Management feels that based on the current loan portfolio quality and the
adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, that the provision charged
to operations for 1996 will be comparable to the 1995 level. 

Non-Interest Income

        Total non-interest income for 1995 was $2.75 million compared
to $2.60 million in 1994, an increase of $154 thousand or 5.9%. 
The major components of non-interest income are service charges
on deposit accounts, income from the Trust and Investment
Services and fees for other services.  Service charges and fees
on deposit accounts amounted to $1.26 million in 1995 and 1994. 
The Company's management monitors the market to ensure that the
fees charged on these types of accounts are competitive in the
marketplace.  In addition, management reviews the costs
associated with offering these accounts when considering the
price of the service to the customer.  Base service charges per
account have not increased since mid-year 1992.  These charges
will be reviewed in the second quarter of 1996, and if
necessary, will be adjusted.

        The Trust and Investment Services Department at the Wayne
County National Bank provides a complete line of trust and
investment services.  The Department provides individually
managed portfolios in order to provide the investment
flexibility required to meet the needs of each and every Trust
customer.  During 1994 the Trust Department added additional
non-deposit type investment products, including mutual funds. 
In the coming months and years, the Department anticipates
offering a full line of investment products for the traditional
investor.  The Department is active in management of individual
stock and bond portfolios as well as company sponsored benefit
plans.  It is management's belief that this Department will
continue to grow and to increase its contribution to the
earnings of the Company.

        The Trust and Investment Services Department has had another
record earnings year.  Trust income grew to $942 thousand in
1995 from $833 thousand in 1994 and $809 thousand in 1993.  The
trend in the Trust Department over the past ten years has been
steady growth in both earnings and assets under management.  

        Other non-interest income consists primarily of charges for
other banking related services, such as, fees for safe deposit
box rental, check cashing fees, brokerage fees and fees   for
servicing mortgages sold into the secondary market.  In 1995,
income from these activities   as well as other miscellaneous
income was $563 thousand.  This represents an increase of $60
thousand or 11.9%.  The primary reason for this increase is an
increase in the fee income for servicing mortgages sold into the
secondary market.  During 1995, the Bank's subsidiary, Wayne
National Corporation had income of approximately $40 thousand
from the sale of real estate.  This is non-recurring income. 
Management feels that with the expected loan sale in the first
quarter of 1996, the servicing income will increase enough to
offset the non-recurring income from 1995, and that other
non-interest income should rise slightly in 1996.  


Non-interest Expenses

        Non-interest expenses are comprised of the expenses of the
Company related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and
equipment expenses and other operating expenses.  In total,
non-interest expenses were $10.53 million, an increase of  $692
thousand or 7.0% over 1994 and $1.44 million or 15.8% over 1993
figures.  Both the salaries and employee benefits and occupancy
and equipment expense categories had increases in 1995 over
1994, primarily related to increased compensation and  additions
and improvements in the Bank's facilities.  Other operating
expenses declined due to reductions in FDIC insurance and
decreases in other expenses.    

        Total employee compensation (including wages and benefits)
increased from $4.4 million to $5.2 million from 1994 to 1995,
an increase of 17.5%.  This increase is attributed to two major
factors.  First, in December of 1995 the Company accrued an
additional $380 thousand for its retirement plans.  This was
done in order to recognize the liability for the funding of
these plans in the spring of 1996.  Second, the Company's
employment market is highly competitive.  Unemployment in the
market area is very low, and as a result, management raised the
starting and mid level salary ranges for the staff.  The
increase brought the wages at those levels up approximately 7% to 10%.

        Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $78 thousand or 7.7%
in 1995.  This increase is due to the plans of the Company to
upgrade and renovate offices where the appearance has
deteriorated over the past several years.  Included in these
renovations are upgraded Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), new
signs, and general improvements.  In addition, the Bank opened a
new branch facility in Berlin, Ohio in September of 1994.  The
costs associated with  opening this branch and the operations
for three months are included in the 1994 expense figures, with
twelve months of expenses included in the 1995 figures.

        Other operating expenses decreased $154 thousand or 3.5% in
1995.  This decrease is due to two primary factors.  First, the
FDIC insurance fund was determined to be at the required funding
level in April of 1995.  As a result, the Company received a
refund of a portion of the first six month's premiums, and a
reduction in the second six months.  As a result of these items,
the expense for FDIC insurance is down $216 thousand.  Second,
management made efforts to continue to reduce costs in areas
where they could control.  These areas include service charges,
advertising, legal and accounting, and miscellaneous expenses. 
There are costs for which management does not exercise
significant control. These costs include primarily franchise
taxes paid to the State of Ohio and some computer and data
processing costs.    

        For 1996, management anticipates that there will be a decision
made as to the BIF/SAIF insurance fund controversy.  It is
expected that the Company will have to pay approximately $225
thousand to the SAIF fund for deposits acquired in 1991 from the
Resolution Trust Corporation.  While this is a significant
amount, it represents a decrease of $125 thousand over the
expense related to deposit insurance for 1995.  The expenses
related to buildings and equipment are also expected to decrease
in 1996 as the renovation program is substantially complete, and
those costs have been reflected in the 1995 and 1994 numbers.    


Income Taxes

        Federal Income taxes increased from $1.48 million in 1993 to
$1.56 million in 1994 to $1.83 million in 1995.  These increases
are due primarily to the increases in income for the Company. 
The expense for income tax represented an effective income tax
rate of 30.2% in 1993, 28.0% in 1994 and 29.0% in 1995.  The
effective tax rate paid by the Company is impacted by the amount
of tax free income that can be generated during the year.  The
Company can reduce the amount of taxes by increasing primarily
the investment in tax-exempt investment securities and loans to
tax-exempt customers.

        As discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", effective January
1, 1993.  This statement changed the method used to calculate
the Company's deferred tax liability.  This change requires that
deferred taxes be calculated on an asset/liability approach.  As
a result of the adoption of this statement on January 1, 1993,
the cumulative effect of this adoption was to increase the net
income of the Company in 1993 by $260 thousand.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

        Total assets at December 31, 1995 were $330.9 million compared
to $315.7 million on December 31, 1994.  This increase of $15.2
million represented a total asset growth rate of 4.8% for 1995. 
The bulk of the increase on in the assets can be found in the
loan portfolio, with the majority of the increase in the real
estate and commercial lending areas.  The loan portfolio,
including loans held for sale made up 61.5% of the total assets
of the Company at December 31, 1995 compared with 62.4% in 1994.
 The investment portfolio represented 28.5% of the total assets
at December 31, 1995  versus 29.5% in 1994.  The increase in the
lending areas are a result of the slowly declining  interest
rates during 1995 and the fact that the Company's market area
has been growing at a steady pace since the early 1990's.  This
growth in the loan portfolio was funded primarily from
investment maturities and sales during the first half of the
year, and increased deposits and short term borrowings in the
second half of the year.

        The Company's earning assets increased $17 million or 6.0%  to
$307 million in 1995 from $290 million in 1994.    At year end
1995, the earning assets of the Company represented 92.9% of the
total assets.  This compares with 91.9% in 1994.  This increase
in earning assets as a percent of total assets is due to lower
dollars invested in premises and equipment and fewer other
assets as well as  the timing of clearing items with the Bank's
primary correspondent bank.


Investment Securities

        The primary function of the investment portfolio is to absorb
deposits that are not loaned to borrowers, and to serve as a
source of funds for the lending function when deposits are not
readily available.  The investment portfolio supplements
interest revenues and provides funds with which to meet the cash
flow needs of our customers.  The funds management function is
also given the responsibility of meeting cash flow needs of the
lending function and depositors through other means, primarily
short term borrowings by the Bank, when the sale of investment
securities is not warranted.  

        In order to maintain what management feels is sufficient
liquidity, the Bank continues to invest in primarily shorter
term (under 3 years) securities with lower risk.  These include
US. Treasury and Agency Securities.  These securities are
purchased and generally held as "available-for-sale" securities.
 Securities that are classified as "available-for-sale" under
FAS 115 are investments which may be sold at some point prior to
maturity for a variety of reasons.  In order to increase yields
in the investment portfolio, investments are also made again in
shorter term government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities
and high quality corporate bonds.  Investments in obligations of
states and political subdivisions are made due to the nature of
their tax exempt status.  On December 1, 1995, the Company
transferred all of the investment securities to the
available-for-sale category.  The reason for this is to allow
management the ability to change the makeup of the portfolio in
correlation with other changes in the Company's balance sheet. 
It will also allow management to react to changes in the
interest rate environment in a manner which is consistent with
the asset/liability policies of the Company.   Under FAS 115,
"held-to-maturity" securities are those which management has
both the intent and ability to hold until maturity.  At this
time the Company does not have any securities classified as
held-to-maturity.  This does not preclude the use of this
classification in the future.

        The investment portfolio at December 31, 1995 was,  in total
dollars invested, relatively unchanged from the prior year and
similar in makeup to the portfolio at December 31, 1994.  

     The investment portfolio has a fair value of $94.3 million at
December 31, 1995, which was $1.26 million more than the
amortized cost.  This net unrealized gain represented 1.3% of
the amortized cost.    

        Management expects 1996 to be similar to 1995 from an interest
rate standpoint.  It is the belief of management that short
interest rates will continue to fall for the first half of the
year and then begin to stabilize toward the end of 1996.  These
expectations will prompt the investment of the excess funds into
medium term investments.  With the expected  decline in rates
and the repricing expectations within the portfolio, the
investment portfolio is expected to show  flat  earnings for 1996.


Loans and Leases

        The Wayne County National Bank is committed to lending to our
customers for a variety of purposes.  The lending market area
includes Wayne, Holmes and Stark Counties.  The Bank's lending
staff is conscious of making loans to credit worthy businesses
and individuals.  The Bank's management and lending staff have
no intention of sacrificing loan quality for the purpose of loan
growth.  The growth in the loan portfolio from 1994 to 1995 is
due to the diligent efforts of the lending staff to find new
quality credit customers.  

        At December 31, 1995, total loans and leases, including loans
held for sale, amounted to $212.9 million compared to $197.6
million at December 31, 1994.  This increase of $15.3 million
represented 7.7% growth in the loans outstanding.  Every loan
category except credit cards showed growth in 1995.  The most
substantial areas of growth were found in the mortgage lending
area where total loans grew by $5.9 million or 8.1% and
commercial loans which grew $5.8 million or 7.6%.

        Loans and leases accounted for 70.0% of the Company's average
assets in 1995.  This compares with 67.1% in 1994 and 60.1% in
1993.  The three major loan categories include commercial, real
estate and consumer loans.  These three categories represented
40%, 35% and 18% respectively of total loans and leases at
December 31, 1995.  The loan portfolio mix has remained
relatively unchanged from 1994 to 1995.   The Bank experienced
increases in real estate lending in 1995 due partially to
customers refinancing other types of debt into real estate debt
for tax purposes.  For the second year in a row,  the Bank has
experienced growth in the consumer lending portfolio.  In 1995
this portfolio grew by $2.7 million or 8%.  This compares to
growth of $5.4 million or 18.9% in 1994.  This growth is
attributed to improved consumer confidence and the Bank's
attempt to grow this portfolio with quality loans at slightly
lower yields.  Growth of this type in consumer lending often
leads to growth in past due and charged off loans.  However, at
December 31, 1995, the consumer loans past due over 30 days were
approximately 1% of the total portfolio, which is far below the
3.4% peer group average.  Consumer debt in this country is at an
all time high.  If the economy should begin to slow or enter a
period of recession, losses in this area could increase.  

        Real estate loan production for 1995 was consistent with 1994. 
Production in this area was approximately $19 million in both
years.  The increase in outstandings in the mortgage area is due
to a reduction in the number of customers who refinance their
homes.  Mortgage interest rates have remained fairly stable
throughout the year, with declines coming in the last quarter. 
The 1995 loan production is what management had estimated it to
be.  At December 31, 1995, the Company had reclassified $8.5
million of real estate loans to held for sale.  The loans are
carried at the lower of their aggregate book value or their fair
value.  The market value of these loans at December 31, 1995 was
approximately $21 thousand above the book value.  In February of
1996, management sold these loans and recorded the gain.  The
reclassification of and subsequent sale of these real estate
loans was done to reduce the concentration of real estate loans
and to decrease the Company's loan to deposit ratio.   In
addition, with the expected decline in mortgage rates in 1996,
management expects loan production of approximately $25 million.
 This would cause this portion of the portfolio to grow outside
the desired level.  The Company does not currently engage in
mortgage banking activities and these loan sales are a one time
realignment of the loan portfolio.  


Sources of Funds

        The Company's subsidiary, The Wayne County National Bank is
Wayne County's largest locally owned commercial bank. 
Management has made a commitment to provide complete banking
services for its customers.  The deposit products offered by the
Bank provide a means by which customers can safely invest their
money and get a competitive return on their investment.  With
the volatile interest rate environment experienced in 1994
behind us, the Bank's customer base seems more willing to
deposit their funds into longer term, higher yielding deposits.
As a result of this,  the interest costs to the Company have
risen in 1995.  

        The Bank's primary source of funds are deposits collected from
the local market area.  At December 31, 1995,  total deposits
amounted to $274.7 million.  This represents growth of $8.2
million or 3.1% over the December 31, 1994 figure of $266.5
million.  In addition to the customer deposits at December 31,
1995, the Bank has securities sold under agreements to
repurchase (Repos) and federal funds purchased in 1994.  Both of
these items serve as a source of funds for the Bank.  The Repos
totaled $15.7 million in 1995 versus $8.9 million for 1994. 
Federal funds purchased at December 31, 1994 of $5 million
represents borrowing from the Bank's correspondent bank for one
day.  These purchased dollars are a short term source of funds.

        At December 31, 1995, the deposit mix had changed somewhat from
the prior year.  With the relative stability in the interest
rate environment compared with 1994, this has encouraged
customers to move their deposits into the longer term accounts. 
 During most of 1995, the Bank saw the amount of funds in the
certificates area continue to growth at the expense of a decline
in the short term deposit accounts.   This caused upward
pressure on the Bank's interest expense.

        Management's strategy for 1996 will be much the same as 1995,
that is to increase the Bank's core deposit base.  It is
expected that in the early part of 1996, the Bank will attempt
to attract core deposits.  With a loan to deposit ratio of 77%,
and expected continued strong loan growth through the first half
of the year, funding these new loans will take growth in the
core deposit base.  In order to grow these core deposits,
management will be pricing the desired deposit products
aggressively and in some cases at a premium over the market.  It
is expected that this will cause upward pressure on the overall
cost of the Bank's funds, depending upon the deposit mix.  This
increase in cost of funds will be offset by the pricing of the
loan products.  In addition, some of the maturing investment
portfolio bonds will be used to fund this loan growth.  


Capital Resources

        Capital adequacy has been one of the major concerns in the
banking industry for the past several years.  Items such as
deposit insurance rates and regulatory examinations are tied
directly to a bank's capital.  In recent years, the banking
industry has seen tremendous growth in the capital base of the
industry.  This capital growth has reduced the risk that was so
prevalent during the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980's.
 Capital adequacy is monitored closely by Company management,
regulatory authorities and investors.  Capital adequacy is a
function of several items, including; asset quality, bank
earnings performance, liquidity, dividends paid, and economic
conditions.  For the past five years, all of these items have
improved for the Company, and as a result of that, the Company's
capital places it among the best in the industry.

        There are several key ratios used to monitor capital adequacy. 
These ratios have not been impacted by the adoption of FAS #115,
"Accounting for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity
Securities". The statement requires a valuation allowance netted
against the Company's capital account for the tax adjusted
unrealized gain or loss on securities classified as
"available-for-sale".  At December 31, 1995 this valuation
allowance was $830 thousand, and is not considered part of the
Company's capital for these calculations.  The long standing
measure for capital adequacy is the percent of shareholders'
equity to total Company assets.  At December 31, 1995, Wayne
Bancorp, Inc., has a capital to asset ratio of 11.2% versus
10.8% in 1994.

        The other key ratios used in determining capital adequacy are
used primarily by the bank regulators.  These ratios are the
risk-based capital ratio and the leverage capital ratio.  Both
of these calculations have minimum standards set by banking
regulation.  The risk-based capital ratio is based on risk
adjusted Company assets.  All of the Company's assets are
assessed for risk and assigned a factor based on the risk
inherent in the assets.  All of these assets are then compared
with the Company's adjusted capital.  Capital accounts are
adjusted for intangible assets and a portion of the reserve for
loan losses.  The minimum requirement under the risk-based
capital standard is 8% with at least half of that being in core
capital.  Core capital  or Tier 1 capital for Wayne Bancorp,
Inc. consists of shareholders' equity less general intangibles
and Tier 2 capital represents a portion of the reserve for loan
losses.  

        At December 31, 1995, Wayne Bancorp, Inc. had total risk-based
capital of 18.1% with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.9%.  Both of
these ratios are well above the minimum requirements.  At
December 31, 1994, the Company had a total risk-based capital of
17.8% with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.5%.

        In addition to the risk-based capital ratio, the second primary
measurement of the Company's capital adequacy is the leverage
ratio.  This ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital in the numerator
with total company assets less general intangibles in the
denominator.  The banking regulators require that institutions
maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3%.   However,  bank
regulators will expect most banks to maintain leverage ratios in
the 4-5% range.  The Company's leverage ratios were 11.1% and
10.4% in 1995 and 1994.

        The Company has set internal capital adequacy levels.  These
levels are higher than those required by the regulatory
authorities.  For 1996, the minimum capital levels set by the
Board of Directors and Company management are; primary capital -
8.5%, risk based capital - 10.0% and leverage capital - 7.0%. 
Management feels that operating with these minimum levels of
capital will assure the best long term strength and performance
of the Company.  

        Cash dividends paid to shareholders of Wayne Bancorp, Inc.
during 1995 were $1.35 million or $.72 per share.  This compares
with $1.14 million or $.61 per share in 1994 and $1.04 million
or $.56 per share in 1993.  Of the cash dividends paid in 1995,
$214 thousand were reinvested by shareholders under the
Company's dividend reinvestment plan.


Asset and Liability Management

        The banking environment, including interest rates, has become
more volatile over the past several years.  This volatility has
made the process of asset and liability management a necessity. 
With the regulatory burdens, volatility in net interest margins
and increasing costs of operation, the asset/liability process
has become a valuable tool used to manage a financial
institution.  The management of Wayne County National Bank has
established policies in the areas of lending, investments,
deposits and borrowed funds which are based on the
asset/liability strategy.  This strategy is designed to maximize
earnings and manage the Bank's interest rate risk exposure.

        The primary tool used by the Company to measure interest rate
risk exposure is the "GAP" analysis.  GAP is defined as the
difference between the volume of assets and liabilities that are
subject to repricing within certain time periods.  The repricing
can result from changes in interest rates on variable rate
products or maturity of asset and liability products.  A
liability sensitive position benefits the Bank in a falling rate
environment, whereas an asset sensitive position will be a
benefit in a rising rate environment.  The presentation of
contractual maturities does not appropriately reflect the stable
source of funding provided by our core deposit base.

        The Company's one year GAP was (7.59%). The Bank's Asset and
Liability Management Policy has established a goal of +10% to
- -10% for the one year unadjusted GAP.  During 1995, the Bank was
in a negative GAP position a majority of the time.  With
interest rates being stable to slightly falling, it would be
expected that the Bank's net interest margin would have widened,
which it did.  The key reason for this was the growth in the
earning assets of the Bank was found in the higher yielding loan
portfolio.  The growth was funded from the lower yielding
investment portfolio, creating an increase in the yield on those
earning assets. 

        In 1996 it is expected that interest rates will continue to
fall for the first half of the year, and then stabilize by the
end of the year.  With this in mind, a negative one year GAP
should benefit the Company as the interest rates fall.  The
Asset/Liability plan for 1996 will be much the same as the
current plan, with the only significant change being in the
investment portfolio.  As interest rates peak in the first
quarter, the plan would be to lengthen the maturity and duration
of purchases by 6-12 months over the current portfolio average
life.  This will enable the Company to take advantage of the
expected falling interest rate environment by having slightly
longer term, higher yielding investments on the books as the
downward repricing of deposit products begins.

Liquidity

        Liquidity is the ability of the Bank to fund customer's needs
for borrowings and deposit withdrawals.  The purpose of
liquidity management is to assure that there is sufficient cash
flow to meet all of the financial commitments and to capitalize
on opportunities for business expansion.  This ability depends
on the institution's financial strength, asset quality, and
types of deposit and investment instruments offered by the Bank
to its customers.  The Company's primary source of liquidity is
the daily federal funds sold and maturing investment securities.
 Other sources of liquidity include cash and due from banks,
investments available-for-sale and maturing loans.  At December
31, 1995, the Company had sold $1 million as excess daily funds.
These funds are sold on a daily basis to one of the Bank's
correspondent banks.  At year end, the Company had $32.4 million
of securities scheduled to mature within one year, and the
entire portfolio is available-for-sale.  Management feels that
with the combination of the asset quality, profitability and 
reputation of the Bank, these sources are sufficient to meet the
current needs of the Bank's customers.

Effects of Inflation

        Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities
relate to banking activities and are monetary in nature.  The
consolidated financial statements and related financial data are
presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP).  GAAP currently requires the Company to
measure the financial position and results of operations in
terms of historical dollars, with the exception of securities
available-for-sale.  Changes in the value of money due to rising
inflation can cause purchasing power loss.

        Management's opinion is that movements in interest rates
affects the financial condition and results of operations to a
greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation.  It should
be noted that interest rates and inflation do effect each other,
but do not always move in correlation with each other.

GENERAL

     This statement is furnished in connection with the

previously taken, may revoke his/her Proxy by giving notice to
the Secretary of the Corporation (Jimmy D. Vaughn) in writing
prior to 1:00 p.m., March 28, 1996; by a subsequently dated
proxy; or by request for the return of the Proxy in person at
the Annual Meeting.  The presence at the meeting of the person
appointing a Proxy, does not in and of itself revoke the
appointment.

     This solicitation of proxies in the enclosed form is made
on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

     The cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the Proxy
material and of reimbursing brokers, nominees, and fiduciaries
for the out-of-pocket and clerical expenses of transmitting
copies of the Proxy material to the beneficial owners of shares
held of record by such persons will be borne by the Corporation.
 The Corporation does not intend to solicit proxies otherwise
than by use of mail, but certain officers and regular employees
of the Corporation or its subsidiary, without additional
compensation, may use their personal efforts by telephone or
otherwise to obtain proxies.  The Proxy material is being first
mailed to stockholders on approximately Match 1, 1996.

National Bank Trust Department as sole trustee which will be
voted in the election of Directors.  Only those stockholders of

stockholders may vote in favor of a proposal, against a
proposal, or may abstain from voting.  Stockholders should
specify their choices on the enclosed form of proxy.  If no
specific instructions are given with respect to the matters to
be acted upon, the shares represented by a signed proxy will be
voted for the election of the nominees and for each of the
proposals presented.  The four Directors receiving the greatest
number of votes will be elected.  The ratification of
independent  auditors will require the majority vote of the
shares of Common Stock represented at the meeting.

     Under rules established by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), the Corporation is required to provide
certain data and information in regard to the compensation and
benefits provided to the Corporation's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and, if applicable, the four other most highly
compensated executive officers, whose aggregate compensation
exceeded $100,000 during the Corporation's fiscal year.  The
disclosure requirements, as applied to the Corporation, included
the Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer (the
"CEO"), the Sr. Executive Vice President and Chief Loan Officer,
Executive Vice President and Senior Trust Officer, and Executive
Vice President and Operations Data Processing and include the
use of tables and a report explaining the rationale and
considerations that led to fundamental executive compensation
decisions affecting these individuals.  The Corporation is a
holding company and owns one significant operating subsidiary,
Wayne County National Bank.  The Corporation has no direct
employees.  All disclosures contained in this Proxy Statement
regarding executive compensation relate to the compensation paid
by Wayne County National Bank.  The Compensation Committee of
the Corporation and Wayne County National Bank (which are
identical) (the "Committee") has the responsibility of
determining the compensation policy and practices and making
recommendations to the full Board with respect to specific
compensation of the CEO and other executive officers.  At the
direction of the Board of Directors, the Committee has prepared
this report for  inclusion in this Proxy Statement.


Compensation Philosophy

     This report reflects the Corporation's compensation
philosophy as endorsed by the Board of Directors and the
Committee and resulting actions taken by the Corporation for the
reporting periods shown in the various compensation tables
supporting this report. The Committee approves and recommends to
the Board of Directors payment amounts and awards levels for
executive officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

     Essentially, the executive compensation program of the
Corporation has been designed to:

      * Support a pay-for-performance policy that awards
executive officers for corporate performance;

      * Motivate key senior officers to achieve strategic
business initiatives and reward them for their achievement, and

      * Provide compensation opportunities which are comparable
to those offered by other financial institutions,

        thus allowing the Corporation to compete for and retain
talented executives who are critical to the Company's long-term success.

     At present, the executive compensation program is comprised
of base salary and annual cash and stock incentive opportunities.

     Other than the base salary and participation in the Senior
Officer Incentive Compensation Plan for Messrs. Christopher,
Damron, Kitchen, and Vaughn discussed below, the additional
benefits to which Messrs. Christopher, Damron, Kitchen, and
Vaughn have been entitled are equivalent to that for all other
employees and are determined in the discretion of the Board of Directors

Base Salaries

     On January 11, 1995, the Committee met to review and
approve amendments to the compensation for all management. 
David L. Christopher, President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Corporation was present at the meeting to present his views
in regard to management and other salaried and hourly employees,
but was not present at the point-in-time that his compensation
was discussed by the Committee.  Compensation decisions are made
after review of performance of executive officers in relation to
the goals of the Company.  At the meeting on January 11, 1995,
the Committee proposed a base salary commencing February 1, 1995
for Mr. Christopher of $156,000 for Mr. Damron of $95,000, for Mr.
Kitchen of $75,000, and for Mr. Vaughn of $75,000 which were
approved  by the Board of Directors.  The salaries were a result
of a review of the four specific surveys regarding peers of the
Corporation and Wayne County National Bank including the following:

        1. Ohio Bankers Association survey reviewing all Ohio banks
           between $200 and $500 million in assets;

        2. Bank Administration Institute survey regarding all Ohio
           banks in Region 5 (the region of Wayne County National Bank);

        3. Bank Administration Institution survey regarding all Ohio
           banks;  and

        4. A study prepared by Crowe, Chizek & Company (the
           Corporation's external auditors) reviewing all banks between
           $200 and $500 million in asset size.

     The Committee reviewed all five of these studies and
blended the results to determine average compensation for
various positions including that of President and Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Loan Officer, Senior Trust Officer, and
Head of Operations.  The Committee then set a range of between
75 percent and 125 percent of the average in order to determine
the salary for Mr. Christopher, Mr. Damron, Mr. Kitchen, and Mr.
Vaughn.  The base salaries determined for Mr. Christopher, Mr.
Damron, Mr. Kitchen, and Mr. Vaughn represented 104, 118, 104
and 120 percent respectively of the average of the
above-referenced surveys.  The Compensation Committee believes
such salaries are justified based upon the performance of the
Company and the Bank relative to its peers.

     The survey results mentioned above are also utilized to set
salaries for the other management, salaried and hourly employees
of Wayne County National Bank.

     In addition to the base salaries described above, the
executive officers of the Company participate in the Profit
Sharing and ESOP Plans with all other salaried employees.  The
four named executive officers and five additional senior
management persons of the Company and the Bank participate in
the "Senior Office Incentive Compensation  Plan."  Under this
plan, which was adopted in 1994, payments are made to such
officers only if the net operating profit of the Bank exceeds
14% of total operating income.  In determining the bonus to be
paid, a sliding scale is used to determine the total bonus pool
available and individual bonuses are calculated based upon the
person's salary relative to the total of those participating in
the plan.  The aggregate amount paid under the plan in 1995 was
approximately $220,000.  The amounts received under the plan by
the listed executive officers are included in the compensation
table set forth above.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
requires the Corporation's officers and directors, and persons
who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the
Corporation's equity securities, to file reports of ownership
and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Officers, directors and greater than ten percent
stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the
Corporation with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

     Based solely on a review of the copies of forms 3, 4 and 5,
and amendments thereto furnished to the Corporation, or
representations that no Form 5's were required, the Corporation
believes that during 1995 all Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to its officers, directors and greater than ten
percent beneficial owners were complied with.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

The following affiliations exist between the Corporation and
nominees or Directors;

        David L. Christopher is one of several partners in Wayco and
Co., a partnership formed for the purpose of holding legal
title, as a nominee, to securities designated by the Wayne
County National Bank with respect to the business of its Trust Department

        Mr. Christopher is President and Mr. Boyle is Vice President
and Treasurer of Wayne National Corporation.  Wayne National
Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wayne County
National Bank.  Wayne National Corporation is a 20 percent
general partner in NB5 Financial Services.  NB5 Financial
Services is engaged in leveraged lease financing, direct
leasing, and other financial products.

        Mr. Frank M. Hays is a retired partner from, but still "of
Counsel" to the law firm of Taggart, Cox, Hays, Zacour, and
Lanham until  December 31, 1996.  The firm was paid $42,810 by
Wayne County National Bank in 1995 for legal services.  Taggart,
Cox, Hays, Zacour, and Lanham have served as the Bank's legal
counsel for many years and will be retained in that capacity
during  1996.  The Corporation believes the terms of all such
transactions were as favorable as could have been obtained from
unaffiliated parties.

     Some of the Directors, Officers, and greater than 5%
stockholders of Wayne Bancorp, Inc., their immediate families
and companies with which they are associated were customers of,
and had banking transactions with, the Wayne County National
Bank in the ordinary course of the Bank's business from the
beginning of fiscal year 1995 to present.  All loans and
commitments to loans included in such transactions were made in
the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and in
the opinion of the management of the Bank do not involve more
than a normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.

OTHER BUSINESS

     If any other business is brought before the meeting, your
vote will be made by your Proxy or may be revoked by you prior
to its exercise.  Management at present knows of no other
business to be presented.


PROPOSALS FOR 1997 MEETING

     A stockholder who desires to have a proposal printed in the
1997 Proxy Statement must submit that proposal no later than
November 1, 1996.  The proposal should be mailed to the Chairman
of Wayne Bancorp, Inc., P.O. Box 757, Wooster, Ohio 44691.
