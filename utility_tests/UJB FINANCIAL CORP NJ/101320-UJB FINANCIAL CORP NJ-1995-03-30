ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
  (A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.
 
     UJB Financial Corp. ("UJB" or the "company"), registrant, commenced
operations on October 1, 1970 as a New Jersey corporation and as a bank holding
company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The company owns
two banks (bank subsidiaries) and nine active non-bank subsidiaries. At December
31, 1994 the company had total consolidated assets of $15,429,472,000 which
ranked it as the third largest New Jersey based bank holding company. The bank
subsidiaries engage in a general banking business. United Jersey Bank is UJB's
largest bank subsidiary, accounting for approximately 82% of UJB's total
consolidated assets at December 31, 1994. The non-bank subsidiaries engage
primarily in securities brokerage, venture capital investment, commercial
finance lending, lease financing, and reinsuring credit life and disability
insurance policies related to consumer loans made by the bank subsidiaries.
 
     UJB Financial Corp. has its corporate office at 301 Carnegie Center, P.O.
Box 2066, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-2066.
 
     On January 19, 1995, the company announced a definitive agreement to
acquire Bancorp New Jersey, Inc. with total assets of approximately
$480,371,000. The merger is expected to occur in the second or third quarter of
1995. In addition, the company successfully completed the acquisitions of VSB
Bancorp, Inc. (VSB) and Palisade Savings Bank, FSB (Palisade) during 1994. VSB
was accounted for as a pooling of interests and was consummated on July 1, 1994.
On September 16, 1994 the acquisition of Palisade was completed and accounted
for under the purchase method.
 
     The restructuring of the company along core lines of business and the
consolidations of banks was completed. The three Pennsylvania banks were merged
into one entity on March 18, 1994 under the name of First Valley Bank. In
addition, the three New Jersey banks were consolidated into a single statewide
bank called United Jersey Bank which was completed on July 15, 1994.
 
     The following table lists each bank subsidiary, the location of its
principal office, the number of its banking offices and, in thousands of
dollars, its total assets and deposits as of December 31, 1994. Both the New
Jersey and Pennsylvania locations are state banks, however only the New Jersey
bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System.

the 70 communities in Bergen County, the second most populous county in New
Jersey. It also operates 146 banking offices throughout New Jersey. First Valley
Bank was organized in 1968 and is the company's Pennsylvania bank subsidiary.
The bank had total assets of $2,795,497,000 at December 31, 1994. First Valley
Bank operates 73 offices in 13 counties in northeast Pennsylvania.
 
     The company's bank subsidiaries are engaged in a general banking business.
Its major lines of business include commercial lending, retail banking, mortgage
banking and investment management. These lines of business offer a wide range of
financial services to individuals, businesses, not-for-profit organizations,
government entities and other financial institutions.

Leasing, Inc. were established for the purpose of making equipment leases. UJB
Financial Service Corporation provides data processing services to banking
subsidiaries.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
     The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls
increase a bank holding company's cost of doing business and limit the options
of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. Areas subject to
regulation and supervision by the bank regulatory agencies include: nature of
business activities; minimum capital levels; dividends; affiliate transactions;
expansion of locations; acquisitions and mergers; interest rates paid on certain
types of deposits; reserves against deposits; terms, amounts and interest rates
charged to various types of borrowers; and investments.
 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION
 
     UJB is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Holding Company Act"). As a bank holding
company, UJB is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the "FRB") and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such
additional information as the FRB may require. UJB is also regulated by the New
Jersey and Pennsylvania Departments of Banking.
 
     The Holding Company Act prohibits UJB, with certain exceptions, from
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of
the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any
business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or
furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application,
engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found
by the FRB to be so closely related to banking "as to be a proper incident
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   5
 
thereto" if the FRB determines that such acquisitions will be, on balance,
beneficial to the public. The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the
FRB of the acquisition by UJB of more than five percent of the voting stock of
any additional bank and in effect permits only the acquisition of banks located
in New Jersey and in states (including Pennsylvania) where laws specifically
permit acquisitions of banks by out-of-state bank holding companies having the
largest proportion of their deposits in New Jersey. Acquisitions in any state
will be permitted after September 29, 1995. See "Interstate Banking" below.
Satisfactory financial condition, particularly with regard to capital adequacy,
and satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act ratings are generally prerequisites
to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. All of UJB's
subsidiary banks are currently rated "satisfactory" or better under the
Community Reinvestment Act.
 
     In addition, UJB is subject to various requirements under both New Jersey
and Pennsylvania laws concerning future acquisitions. Such laws require the
prior approval of the relevant Department of Banking to acquire any bank
chartered by that State. Statewide branching is permitted in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. Branch approvals are subject to statutory standards relating to
safety and soundness, competition, and public convenience. The Holding Company
Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank
subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
 
     The policy of the FRB provides that UJB is expected to act as a source of
financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to
support such subsidiary banks in circumstances in which it might not do so
absent such policy. In addition, any capital loans by UJB to any subsidiary bank
would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other
indebtedness of such subsidiary bank.
 
     UJB is required by the Holding Company Act to file annual reports of its
operations with the FRB and is subject to examination by the FRB. Under Section
106 of the 1970 amendments to the Holding Company Act and the regulations of the
FRB, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging
in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or
provision of any property or services. Regulations of the FRB under the Federal
Reserve Act require that reserves be maintained by a UJB bank subsidiary to the
extent that the proceeds of any UJB promissory note, acknowledgement of advance,
due bill or similar obligation, with a maturity of less than four years, are
used to supply or to maintain the availability of funds (other than capital) to
the bank subsidiary, except any such obligation that, had it been issued
directly by the bank subsidiary, would not constitute a deposit. They also place
limits upon the amount of UJB's equity securities which may be repurchased or
redeemed by UJB.
 
     Bank regulatory authorities in the United States have issued risk-based
capital standards by which all bank holding companies and banks are evaluated in
terms of capital adequacy. These guidelines relate a company's capital to the
risk profile of its assets. The standards require all banks to have Tier I
capital of at least 4 percent, total capital, including Tier I capital, of at
least 8 percent of risk-adjusted assets and a minimum leverage ratio of 4
percent for institutions that have a regulatory rating of two or more. Failure
to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators
that could have a direct effect on the operations and financial statements. Tier
I capital includes shareholders' equity less certain intangibles and unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax. Total capital is
comprised of Tier I capital, qualifying debt instruments, and a portion of the
allowance for loan losses. Tier I leverage ratio measures the ratio of Tier I
capital to quarterly average assets less certain intangibles. As of December 31,
1994, UJB's Tier I capital was 9.27%, total risk-based capital was 12.04%, and
the leverage ratio was 7.02%.

INTERSTATE BANKING AND REGULATORY RELIEF LEGISLATION IN 1994
 
     The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994,
enacted September 29, 1994, permits full nationwide interstate banking (e.g.,
bank holding company ("BHC") acquisition of bank subsidiaries anywhere in the
U.S.), with interstate branching to be permitted after June 1, 1997.
Importantly, states retain the right to opt-out of interstate branching and to
require that out-of-state BHCs and banks comply with state rules governing
entry.
 
     A brief summary of the Act's major provisions follows:
 
          (A) INTERSTATE BANKING.  One year after enactment, adequately
     capitalized and adequately managed BHCs would be permitted to acquire banks
     in any state. States cannot opt-out of this provision. State laws may
     prohibit the purchase of banks 5 years of age or less. Concentration limits
     are imposed (10% of bank and thrift deposits nationwide/30% in the state;
     the state supervisor may waive this 30% limit). States retain existing
     authority to impose nondiscriminatory deposit caps. Those banks with over
     30% of statewide deposits may be sold to out-of-state BHCs without being
     subject to the 30% rule where the BHC has no presence in the host state
     (some limited exceptions may apply).
 
          (B) BANK/THRIFT AFFILIATE AGENCY AUTHORITY.  One year after enactment,
     an insured bank subsidiary may act as agent for an affiliate bank or thrift
     in offering specified banking services (receive deposits, renew time
     deposits, close loans, service loans, and receive payments on loans and
     other obligations) both within and across state lines without offices of
     the agent being deemed branches of the affiliates on whose behalf they act.
     Thrift affiliates may provide these same agency services under limited
     circumstances.
 
          (C) INTERSTATE BRANCHING.
 
             (1) Branching Through Bank Mergers.  After June 1, 1997, the
        appropriate Federal regulator may approve the merger of adequately
        capitalized banks across state lines, so long as the resulting
        institution is adequately capitalized and adequately managed. This will
        allow BHCs, after that date, to convert their subsidiary banks in
        different states into branches of the same bank; banks in different
        states, whether within holding companies or independent, will likewise
        be permitted to directly merge. Bank mergers would have to conform with
        state laws which impose age restrictions of up to 5 years on
        acquisitions of new banks. States may opt-out of interstate branching
        from September 29, 1994 until June 1, 1997. Doing so will preclude the
        merger of banks in that state with banks located in other states; banks
        located in states which opt-out would not be permitted to have
        interstate branches. States may permit interstate branching earlier than
        June 1, 1997, where both states involved with the bank merger expressly
        permit it by statute. Where the bank/BHC would be effectively moving
        into a new state as a result of the merger, regulators must consider
        Community Reinvestment Act compliance of all bank affiliates before
        approving the merger application. The 10% nationwide/30% deposit
        concentration limits discussed above also apply to bank mergers; states
        retain current authority to impose deposit caps. Host state banks with
        over 30% of statewide deposits may be merged with out-of-state banks
        without being subject to the 30% rule where the out-of-state bank has no
        presence in the host state (some limited exceptions may apply).
 
             (2) Direct Branching by Banks.  National and state banks are
        prohibited from directly acquiring an existing branch (separate from the
        acquisition of a charter), or establishing a de novo branch, in a host
        state unless the law of the host state permits it.
 
          (D) FOREIGN BANKS.  Foreign branches and agencies located in the U.S.
     will be permitted to branch interstate to the same extent as domestic
     institutions. However, certain restrictions are placed on foreign branch
     operations in the U.S.
 
          (E) LAWS APPLICABLE TO STATE INTERSTATE BRANCHES.  Branches of
     out-of-state state chartered banks will be subject to the laws of the host
     state, including permissible activities, as if it were a branch of a bank
     located in that host state. State bank supervisors of the host state may
     examine an in-state branch of an out-of-state state bank for purposes of
     determining compliance with state law and to ensure that the branch is
     being operated in a safe and sound manner.

          (F) OTHER.  For financial institutions that maintain one or more
     branches outside the home state, the appropriate Federal banking agency
     must prepare a written evaluation of the entire institution's Community
     Reinvestment Act performance and a separate evaluation of the institution's
     performance for each state and metropolitan statistical area, and for the
     nonmetropolitan portion of the state. The Act prohibits the use of
     interstate branches primarily for the purpose of deposit production, and
     requires that the interstate bank's level of lending in the host state
     relative to deposits from the host state (using available information) is
     greater than half the average of all banks with home offices in that state.
     The appropriate Federal regulator may require closure of a branch which
     fails this test. In the case of an interstate bank that proposes to close
     any branch in a low- or moderate-income area, the branch closure notices
     must contain the mailing address of the bank's Federal regulator, and a
     statement that comments regarding the closure may be mailed to that
     regulator. If a person from the area in which the branch is located submits
     a written request and includes a statement of specific reasons, and the
     request is not frivolous, the agency must consult with community leaders
     and convene a meeting with such leaders and depository institutions to
     explore the feasibility of obtaining adequate alternative facilities and
     services. The legislation specifically states that this process shall not
     affect the authority of the bank to close the branch, or the timing of the
     closing.
 
     Congress also enacted the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory
Improvement Act of 1994 on September 23, 1994. This Act amended the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") to allow
regulators to issue guidelines instead of regulations on asset quality, earnings
and stock valuation standards, provides for electronic filing of call reports
and currency transaction reports, exempts business purpose loans from the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act, reduces certain audit requirements of FDICIA,
and included many other miscellaneous provisions intended to reduce regulatory
burdens. However, stricter requirements are imposed on banks with respect to
requiring flood insurance from borrowers.
 
FDICIA
 
     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, which
became law in December 1991, in addition to authorizing increased funding for
the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF") by raising the FDIC's borrowing limits and
eliminating the cap on deposit insurance premiums, imposes extensive additional
statutory requirements regarding the roles, responsibilities, and liabilities of
a bank's senior management, directors, independent auditors, and regulators in
compliance, management and financial affairs of a bank. This Act has required
additional time, effort and resources to be devoted to compliance and internal
controls.
 
     FDICIA requires each financial institution with $500 million or more in
total assets to have an annual audit of its financial statements by an
independent public accountant and to have an audit committee consisting of
independent outside directors. There are more stringent criteria for audit
committees of institutions with $3 billion or more in total assets. It also
requires that management report on and assess their responsibility for internal
controls over financial reporting and compliance with designated laws and
regulations.
 
     FDICIA requires each federal banking agency to ensure that its risk-based
capital standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of
credit risk and the risks of non-traditional activities, as well as reflect the
actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family mortgages. In
addition, pursuant to FDICIA, each federal banking agency has promulgated
regulations specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be
considered "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized," or "critically undercapitalized," and to take
certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital
level of the institution.
 
     Insured institutions are generally prohibited from paying dividends or
management fees if after making such payments, the institution would be
"undercapitalized." An "undercapitalized" institution also is required to
develop and submit to the appropriate federal banking agency a capital
restoration plan, and each company controlling such institution must guarantee
the institution's compliance with such plan. The liability of a holding company
under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the
institution's total
 
                                        7
<PAGE>   8
 
assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply
with all applicable capital standards. The FDIC is accorded a priority over the
claims of unsecured creditors in any bankruptcy proceeding of a holding company
that has guaranteed an institution's compliance with a capital restoration plan.
Further, "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically
undercapitalized" institutions are subject to increasingly extensive
requirements and limitations, including mandatory sale of stock, forced mergers,
and ultimately receivership or conservatorship. A "critically undercapitalized"
institution, beginning 60 days after it becomes "critically undercapitalized,"
generally is prohibited from making any payment of principal or interest on the
institution's subordinated debt.
 
     FDICIA provides that the FDIC insurance assessments are to move from
flat-rate premiums to a new system of risk-based premium assessments. The
risk-based insurance assessment will evaluate an institution's potential for
causing a loss to the insurance fund and base deposit insurance premiums upon
individual bank profiles. Currently the annual assessment rates for the
company's bank subsidiaries are 23 cents per $100 of domestic deposits. These
rates are applicable through June 30, 1995 at which time they will be
reevaluated based upon more current risk classifications. The FDIC has published
proposals where BIF members would pay assessment rates ranging from 4 to 31
cents per $100 of domestic deposits depending upon risk classification.
 
     FDICIA also contains the Truth in Savings Act, which requires certain
disclosures to be made in connection with deposit accounts offered to consumers.
The FRB has adopted regulations implementing the provisions of the Truth in
Savings Act.
 
     In addition, significant provisions of FDICIA require federal banking
regulators to draft standards in a number of other areas to assure bank safety
and soundness, including internal controls, information systems and internal
audit systems, credit underwriting, asset growth, compensation, loan
documentation and interest rate exposure. The bank regulators have proposed
substantially similar regulations that impose on banks which fail to meet the
safety and soundness standards of FDICIA substantially the same requirements
respecting the formulation and implementation of a corrective plan of action as
apply in the case of banks failing to meet the capital adequacy standards.
FDICIA require the regulators to establish maximum ratios of classified assets
to capital, and minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses without impairing
capital. The legislation also contains provisions which tighten independent
auditing requirements, restrict the activities and investments of
state-chartered banks to those permitted for national banks, amend various
consumer banking laws, limit the ability of "undercapitalized" banks to borrow
from the FRB discount window, and require federal banking regulators to perform
annual on-site bank examinations and set standards for real estate lending.
FDICIA has significantly increased costs for the banking industry due to higher
FDIC assessments, additional layers of reporting and compliance requirements and
more limitations on the activities of all but the most well capitalized banks.
 
FIRREA
 
     Although the most significant purpose of the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") was to restructure the savings
and loan industry, many of its provisions have importance for the commercial
banking industry, including the provision which authorized bank holding
companies to acquire healthy as well as troubled thrift institutions, generally
without limitations on interstate acquisitions, while retaining thrift branching
powers.
 
     Under FIRREA, a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held
liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the
FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured
depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly
controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. "Default"
is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and "in
danger of default" is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions,
including a failure to meet minimum capital requirements, indicating that a
"default" is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. These
provisions have commonly been referred to as FIRREA's "cross guarantee"
provisions. Liability under the "cross guarantee" provisions is subordinate to
claims (other than claims by shareholders, including bank holding companies, in
their capacity as sharehold-
 
                                        8
<PAGE>   9
 
ers, and affiliates of the institution) of depositors, secured creditors, other
general or senior creditors, and holders of obligations subordinated to
depositors or other creditors. The FDIC may waive its rights under limited
circumstances generally applicable to acquisitions of troubled institutions.
 
     FIRREA gives the FDIC as conservator or receiver of a failed depository
institution express authority to repudiate contracts with such institution which
it determines to be burdensome or if such repudiation will promote the orderly
administration of the institution's affairs. Certain "qualified financial
contracts", defined to include securities contracts, commodity contracts,
forward contracts, repurchase agreements, and swap agreements, are generally
excluded from the repudiation powers of the FDIC. The FDIC is also given
authority to enforce contracts made by a depository institution, notwithstanding
any contractual provision providing for termination, default, acceleration, or
exercise of rights upon, or solely by reason of, insolvency or the appointment
of a conservator or receiver. Insured depository institutions are also
prohibited from entering into contracts for goods, products or services which
would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the institution.
 
     The bank regulatory agencies have broad discretion to issue cease and
desist orders if they determine that the company or its subsidiaries are
engaging in "unsafe or unsound banking practices." In addition, the federal bank
regulatory authorities are empowered to impose substantial civil money penalties
for violations of certain Federal banking statutes and regulations. Financial
institutions, and directors, officers, employees, controlling shareholders,
agents, consultants, attorneys, accountants, appraisers and others associated
with a financial institution could now be subject to increased fines, penalties,
and other enforcement actions as a result of provisions of FIRREA. Further,
under FIRREA the failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a banking
institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to Federal regulatory
authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.
 
REGULATION OF SUBSIDIARIES
 
     Various laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to the company and
its bank subsidiaries impose restrictions and requirements in many areas,
including capital requirements, the maintenance of reserves, establishment of
new offices, the making of loans and investments, consumer protection,
employment practices and other matters. There are various legal limitations,
including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, on the extent to
which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to UJB or its
non-bank subsidiaries. Under federal law, no bank subsidiary may, subject to
certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or
investments in the securities of, its parent or non-bank subsidiaries of its
parent or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Each
bank subsidiary is also subject to collateral security requirements for any
loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions. Further, a
subsidiary bank may only engage in most transactions with other subsidiaries if
terms and conditions are at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing
for transactions with unaffiliated companies. UJB and its banking and other
subsidiaries are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging
in the business of issuing, underwriting, public sale, flotation or distribution
of securities.
 
     The two state-chartered subsidiary banks are subject to the supervision of,
and to regular examination by, the New Jersey Departments of Insurance and
Banking, in the case of United Jersey Bank, and the Pennsylvania Department of
Banking, in the case of First Valley Bank. In addition, the subsidiary banks are
subject to examination by the FDIC, and by the U.S Department of Education with
respect to student loan activity. United Jersey Bank is also subject to
examination by the FRB. The Municipal Bond Department of United Jersey Bank, as
a registered municipal securities dealer, is subject to the supervision of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
 
     None of the stocks of the subsidiary banks or other subsidiaries owned or
controlled by UJB carry statutory double liability. However, Article XIV,
Section 11 of the Constitution of the State of Arizona provide that the stock of
UJB's credit life insurance subsidiaries, may be subject to assessment to
restore impaired capital under certain circumstances as and to the extent
provided therein. There is no such provision in New Jersey or Pennsylvania law
governing UJB's state-chartered banks.
 
                                        9
<PAGE>   10
 
     Certain statutory restrictions may affect the declaration and payment of
dividends by the subsidiary banks to UJB. For additional information see Note 14
on page 49 of the 1994 Annual Report incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit
13.
 
     UJB and its non-bank subsidiaries are subject to examination by the New
Jersey and Pennsylvania state and the three federal bank regulatory agencies at
their discretion. As a mortgagee approved by Department of Housing and Urban
Development and a seller-servicer of mortgages approved by the Federal National
Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the New
Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, United Jersey Bank is subject to
regulation or supervision by these government agencies. First Valley Bank is a
participant in the mortgage program conducted by the Pennsylvania Housing
Finance Agency and is subject to the supervision of that agency. UJB Investor
Services Company and Lehigh Securities Corporation are subject to regulation and
examination by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities. UJB
Investor Services Company is also subject to regulation and examination by the
New York Bureau of Investor Protection and Securities and the Florida Department
of Banking and Finance. Lehigh Securities Corporation is also subject to
regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Securities Commission and, as a
registered municipal securities dealer, is subject to the supervision of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. United Jersey Credit Life Insurance
Company and First Valley Life Insurance Company are subject to regulation and
examination by the Department of Insurance of the State of Arizona.
 
     UJB and its subsidiaries are also subject to various reporting requirements
of Federal and state securities laws and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.
 
     From time to time, various bills are introduced in the United States
Congress and the New Jersey or Pennsylvania Legislature which could result in
additional regulation of the business of UJB and its subsidiaries, or further
increase competition.
 
     There is a continuing trend toward regulating every aspect of retail
banking through consumer protection laws, at significant expense to financial
institutions. At the same time, securities brokers, insurance companies,
retailers and other non-bank entities are being allowed to offer a variety of
traditional bank services without being subject to the same degree of regulation
as banks and bank holding companies. If these trends continue without providing
parity to the commercial banks in matters such as permissible services, taxation
and interest rates chargeable on loans, adverse effects on commercial banks
could ensue.
 
     In its operations in other countries, United Jersey Bank is also subject to
restrictions imposed by the laws and banking authorities of such countries.
 
     References under this caption, Supervision and Regulation, to applicable
statutes are brief summaries of portions thereof which do not purport to be
complete and which are qualified in their entirety by reference to such
statutes.
 
Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions
 
     The earnings and business of UJB and its subsidiaries are affected by the
policies of regulatory authorities, including the FRB. The monetary policies of
the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial
banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because
of the changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the
money markets, as a result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities,
interest rates, credit availability and deposit levels may change due to
circumstances beyond the control of UJB or its subsidiaries.
 
Effects of Inflation
 
     A bank's asset and liability structure differs from that of an industrial
company, since its assets and liabilities fluctuate over time based upon
monetary policies and changes in interest rates. The growth in the bank's
earning assets, regardless of the effects of inflation, will increase net
interest income if the bank is able to maintain a consistent interest spread
between earning assets and supporting liabilities.
 
                                       10
<PAGE>   11
 
     A purchasing power gain or loss from holding net monetary assets during the
year represents the effect of general inflation on monetary assets and
liabilities. Almost all of the assets and liabilities of UJB are considered
monetary because they are fixed in terms of dollars and therefore, are not
materially affected by inflation.
 
  (C)(1)(I) PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RENDERED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.
 
     Not applicable. See response to Item 1(b) contained elsewhere in this
report.
 
  (C)(1)(II) DESCRIPTION OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SEGMENTS.
 
     Not applicable.
 
  (C)(1)(III) SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS.
 
     Not applicable.
 
  (C)(1)(IV) IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISES AND
CONCESSIONS HELD.
 
     Patents and licenses, as such, are not of importance to UJB or its
subsidiaries, but operating charters (similar to licenses) -- approved banking
location authorizations granted by the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Departments
of Banking for state-chartered bank subsidiaries -- are vital to the operation
and expansion of the bank subsidiaries. Such charters are perpetual unless
revoked by the granting authorities. Various licenses and approvals to do
business are also required by the other regulatory agencies referred to under
Supervision and Regulation above. Most of these licenses and approvals require
periodic renewal.
 
     UJB has several registered service marks, none of which is considered
material to its business. The duration of each registration is perpetual so long
as the registrant continues to use the mark.
 
  (C)(1)(V) SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS.
 
     Not applicable.
 
  (C)(1)(VI) WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO INVENTORY.
 
     Not applicable.
 
  (C)(1)(VII) CONCENTRATION OF CUSTOMERS.
 
     The business of the registrant and its subsidiaries is not dependent on a
single customer, nor on a small group of customers.
 
  (C)(1)(VIII) BACKLOG OF ORDERS.
 
     Not applicable.
 
  (C)(1)(IX) GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.
 
     No material portion of the business of UJB and its subsidiaries is subject
to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the Government.
 
  (C)(1)(X) COMPETITION.
 
     Each bank subsidiary faces strong competition for local business in the
communities it serves from other banking institutions as well as from other
financial institutions. United Jersey Bank and First Valley Bank compete in the
national market with other major banking and financial institutions in the New
York and Philadelphia areas, many of which are substantially larger and may have
greater financial resources. A number of these institutions offer their services
throughout New Jersey and Pennsylvania through bank and non-bank subsidiaries,
loan production offices and solicitations through broadcast and print media and
direct mail. For international business, United Jersey Bank competes not only
with a substantial number of United States banks having foreign departments, but
also with agencies and branches of foreign banks located in the United States
and with other major banks throughout the world. The effect of liberalized
branching and acquisition
 
                                       11
<PAGE>   12
 
laws has been to lower barriers to entry into the banking business and to
increase competition for banking business, as well as to increase both
competition for and opportunities to acquire other financial institutions.
Nationwide interstate banking will accelerate these trends.
 
     For most of the services which the subsidiaries perform, there is
increasing competition from financial institutions other than commercial banks
due to the relaxation of regulatory restrictions. Money market funds actively
compete with banks for deposits. Savings banks, savings and loan associations
and credit unions also actively compete for deposits and for various types of
loans; such institutions, as well as securities brokers, consumer finance
companies, mortgage companies, factors, insurance companies and pension trusts,
are important competitors. Financial institutions such as these, as well as
retailers and other non-bank entities, have acquired so-called "non-bank banks"
permitting them to offer traditional banking services without being subject to
the same degree of regulation. Insurance companies, mutual fund investment
counseling firms and other business firms and individuals offer competition for
personal and corporate trust services and investment advisory services.
 
     Each of UJB's non-bank subsidiaries competes with a very large number of
competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater financial
resources.
 
     Competition for banking and permitted non-bank services is based on price,
nature of product, quality of service, and in the case of retail activities,
convenience of location.
 
  (C)(1)(XI) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
 
     UJB and its subsidiaries conduct research activities, from time to time,
relating to the development of new services. Expenditures for these activities
are not considered material to the financial condition of UJB and its
subsidiaries. Research expenditures during 1994 were charged directly to expense
as incurred.
 
  (C)(1)(XII) COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.
 
     It is not expected that compliance with Federal, state and local provisions
relating to the protection of the environment will have any material effect on
UJB or its subsidiaries.
 
  (C)(1)(XIII) NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.
 
     At December 31, 1994, there were 6,143 persons, on a full-time equivalent
basis, employed by UJB and its subsidiaries.
 
  (D) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT
SALES.
 
     United Jersey Bank operates an International Banking Department principally
for the benefit of its domestic customers and, in January 1974, opened its first
offshore banking facility on the island of Grand Cayman in the British West
Indies. Business at the offshore facility constituted less than one-half of one
percent of the total assets and income of United Jersey Bank in 1994.
 
  (E) STATISTICAL INFORMATION.
 
     The following tables set forth, on a consolidated basis, certain
statistical information concerning UJB and its subsidiaries. The tables should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in
the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, included herein as Exhibit 13. Average
data have been derived from daily balances except in the case of certain smaller
subsidiaries where month-end balances were used.

     Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity; Interest
Rates and Interest Differential.
 
     The following table shows the Average Balance Sheet with Resultant Interest
and Rates for the years ended 1994 through 1992. Net interest income is the
amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. Net interest income in
any given period is affected by the average volume of earning assets and the
yield earned on such assets, the average volume of interest bearing sources of
funds and the average rate paid on such liabilities.

     The following table shows the approximate effect on the effective interest
differential of volume and rate changes for the years 1994 and 1993 on a
tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, the change in interest due to
both volume and rate has been allocated to change due to volume and change due
to rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the
change in each.

     The following table shows the maturity distribution and weighted average
yields to maturity on a tax-equivalent basis for investment securities available
for sale, by type and in total, of Federal agencies, and other securities at
December 31, 1994. The carrying value represents the market value of securities
at December 31, 1994 and are distributed by contractual maturity. However,
mortgage-backed securities and other securities which may have prepayment
provisions are distributed to a maturity category based on estimated average
lives. These principal prepayments are not scheduled over the life of the
investment, but are reflected as adjustments to the final maturity distribution.
The distribution follows:

     The loan portfolio is reviewed regularly to determine whether specific
loans should be placed in a non-performing status. Non-performing loans consist
of commercial non-accrual and renegotiated loans. Non-accrual loans include
loans that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where
reasonable doubt exists as to timely collectibility. At the time a loan is
placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is
reversed against interest income. Interest collections on non-accrual loans are
generally credited to interest income when received. However, if ultimate
collectibility of principal is in doubt, interest collections are applied as
principal reductions. After principal and interest payments are brought current
and future collectibility is reasonably assured, loans are returned to accrual
status. Renegotiated loans are loans whose contractual interest rates have been
reduced to below market rates or other significant concessions made due to a
borrower's financial difficulties. Interest income on renegotiated loans is
generally credited to interest income as received. Non-performing loans do not
include past due consumer loans 90 days or more as to principal or interest, but
which are well collateralized and in the process of collection.
 
     The following table shows, in thousands of dollars, the principal amount of
commercial non-accruing loans, renegotiated loans, and loans contractually past
due 90 days or more at December 31 for each of the past five years, and their
resultant impact on earnings before taxes for the years then ended. All loans in
the following table represent domestic loans. There are no foreign loans
included in any of the categories.

     Potential problem loans are those which management believes conditions
indicate that the collection of principal and interest may be doubtful in
accordance with the original contract terms. They are not included in
non-performing loans as these loans are still performing. Potential problem

$37,684,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993 respectively. Potential problem loans
at December 31, 1994 comprised commercial and industrial loans of $26,130,000,
construction and development loans of $1,710,000, and real estate related loans
of $6,774,000. Such risk associated with these loans have been factored into the
company's allowance for loan losses.

     Implicit in the lending function is the fact that loan losses will be
experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with the type of loan being
made, the creditworthiness of the borrower and prevailing economic conditions. A
standardized process has been established throughout the company to provide for
loan losses through a reasonable and prudent methodology. This methodology
includes a review to assess the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. It
incorporates a credit review and gives consideration to areas of exposure such
as concentrations of credit, economic and industry conditions, and negative
trends in delinquencies and collections. Consideration is also given to
collateral levels and the composition of the portfolio.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.
 
     United Jersey Bank owns the building, constructed in 1984, in West Windsor
Township, New Jersey where UJB maintains its administrative headquarters.
Additionally, UJB occupies offices in Hackensack, New Jersey in space provided
by United Jersey Bank as well as at other locations in New Jersey, which it
leases from third-party lessors. During 1978, UJB sold a six-story office
building that it owned in Hackensack, adjacent to the administrative and
principal banking office of United Jersey Bank. United Jersey Bank leases space
in the building.
 
     The principal banking office and administrative offices of United Jersey
Bank are located in Hackensack in a nine-story building owned by the bank which
was constructed in 1927. The bank occupies substantially the entire building. In
addition to its principal office, United Jersey Bank owns 99 of its branch
office buildings; office space in certain of these buildings is leased to
others. United Jersey Bank leases the buildings and property for 98 of its
branch offices. It leases a multi-level parking garage accommodating 250 cars
located near the principal office and an office and warehouse facility in Fair
Lawn, New Jersey. UJB leases real property located in Ridgefield Park, New
Jersey and a multi-story building containing approximately 300,000 square feet
of space for use by UJB Financial Service Corporation as a data processing
facility which was completed in 1991. The tenant improvements and furniture,
fixtures and equipment for the new facility was initially funded by UJB. On
August 31, 1992, the Company consummated the sale of certain assets and
simultaneously negotiated the leaseback of these assets. The previous computer
center in Hackensack, owned by United Jersey Bank, has been utilized to
centralize certain banking activities. The principal banking and administrative
offices of First Valley Bank are located in an eleven-story building built in
1974 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. First Valley leases the building for an initial
term ending in the year 2000, with renewal options extending for an additional
38 years. First Valley occupies approximately two-thirds of the building. All
properties owned by the various bank subsidiaries are unencumbered by mortgages
or similar liens.
 
     The bank subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 operated banking offices in 17
of the 21 counties in New Jersey (Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden,
Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris,
Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren), and 13 of the 67 counties in
Pennsylvania (Berks, Bucks, Carbon, Chester, Delaware, Lackawanna, Lancaster,
Lehigh, Luzerne, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia and Schuylkill).
Gibraltar Corporation of America occupies leased offices in New York City, New
York. UJB Investor Services Company occupies leased offices in Fort Lee,
Matawan, Morristown, Paramus, Princeton and West Caldwell, New Jersey. First
Valley Leasing, Inc. occupies leased offices in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Lehigh
Securities Corporation occupies leased offices in Whitehall, Pennsylvania.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
     Management does not believe that the ultimate disposition of the litigation
discussed below will have a material adverse effect on the financial position
and results of operation of the company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
 
SHAREHOLDER SUIT
 
     In Re UJB Financial Corp. Shareholder Litigation, United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey, Trenton, Civil Action No. 90-1569. Suit
filed April 5, 1990.
 
     Three suits, UJB Financial Corporation, derivatively by Chappaqua Family
Trust and Robert Bassman v. UJB Financial Corporation et al; Irwin Shapiro v.
UJB Financial Corp. et al; Lester Associates and Jerome Katz v. UJB Financial
Corp, et al were filed in April and May of 1990. These suits were consolidated
and a Consolidated Amended Complaint and Derivative Complaint was filed on
September 4, 1990.
 
     This purported derivative and class action securities lawsuit against UJB
Financial Corp. ("UJB") and certain officers and directors is brought by
Plaintiffs who are alleged to have owned or purchased securities of UJB from
approximately February 1, 1988 through July 1990. Violations are alleged of
Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20 of the Exchange Act, Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 and New Jersey common law. The suit alleges that UJB's
reserves for loan losses were inadequate, resulting in inaccurate financial
 
                                       21
<PAGE>   22
 
statements, and that the defendants made misleading positive statements about
UJB's financial condition and failed to disclose negative information about
UJB's lending policies, operations and finances, thus artificially inflating
UJB's earnings and the prices of UJB's securities. The suit further alleges that
UJB's internal credit review and controls were inadequate.
 
     In addition, plaintiffs assert that the 1990 Proxy Statement was false and
misleading because it did not disclose that defendants had engaged in the
conduct described in the preceding paragraph or that entrenchment allegedly was
defendants' true motive behind the adoption of a shareholder rights plan and a
provision amending UJB's certificate of incorporation to require 80% approval by
the shareholders to increase the authorized number of directors (and 80%
approval to amend or repeal any provision of the proposed amendments). The
plaintiffs demand judgment including unspecified money damages, a declaration
that all action taken at the 1990 Annual Meeting is null and void, a declaration
that the shareholder rights plan is void, and attorneys' fees.
 
     Discovery and determination of class issues were stayed by District Court
order. UJB and the defendant directors and officers moved to dismiss the
complaint and each claim for relief on various grounds, including, among others:
failure to state a claim; failure to plead with particularity; and failure to
make the required demand. The District Court granted the motion in part and
allowed plaintiffs thirty days to replead or amend their complaint with respect
to other alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiffs determined not to replead or amend
and appealed the District Court ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Plaintiffs did not appeal dismissal of the derivative claims and voluntarily
withdrew, with prejudice, the claim challenging UJB's 1990 Proxy Statement. On
May 22, 1992 the Court of Appeals reversed in part the District Court's decision
insofar as it dismissed certain claims in the complaint and remanded same to the
District Court for further proceedings, including repleading by the plaintiffs.
By orders dated July 7, 1992, the Court of Appeals denied the defendants'
petition for rehearing en banc but stayed entry of its mandate until August 13,
1992 to permit defendants to seek review by the United States Supreme Court. All
proceedings in the District Court were stayed pending entry of the mandate; the
mandate issued upon denial of review by the Supreme Court. On October 13, 1992,
the Supreme Court declined to accept the case for review. On March 22, 1993, the
Plaintiffs served the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint which
contained substantially the same claims (except for those that had been
dismissed) as set forth in the prior Amended Complaint. UJB and the defendant
directors and officers then moved to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended
Class Action Complaint and each claim for relief contained therein on various
grounds. On September 13, 1993, the District Court denied the defendants' motion
to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
New Jersey common law and reserved decision on the motion with regard to
plaintiffs' claims under the Securities Act of 1933. The plaintiffs subsequently
stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of their claims under the Securities
Act of 1933 on October 14, 1993. The defendants filed a motion requesting
certification of an appeal from the District Court order to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1292(b) on October
29, 1993. The defendants also filed an Answer denying the allegations of the
Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on October 28, 1993. The
District Court by order dated December 3, 1993 denied the defendants' motion
requesting certification of an appeal. Discovery commenced in January 1994. On
April 21, 1994 the court entered another consent order dismissing without
prejudice all claims against the defendant Clifford H. Coyman (the former
president and CEO of United Jersey Bank) and dismissing with prejudice all
claims against the outside director defendants (Robert L. Boyle, Elinor J.
Ferdon, Walter L. Dealtry, Fred G. Harvey, Francis J. Mertz, Henry S. Patterson
II, James A. Skidmore, Jr. and Joseph M. Tabak.) On the same day, the court
entered a consent order conditionally certifying the matter to proceed as a
class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with
respect to Counts I, II, and VI of the Complaint, on behalf of a plaintiff class
consisting of all persons who purchased UJB's common stock during the period
beginning February 1, 1988 through and including July 18, 1990, and who
allegedly sustained damages thereby. On December 30, 1994, the parties agreed to
settle the action for $3.65 million, subject to, among other things, notice to
the class and final approval by the Court.  The Court approved the settlement
on March 29, 1995. A portion of this settlement will be paid by UJB's
insurance carrier and the remaining balance has been fully reserved. 
Therefore, the effect of this settlement will have no significant impact on
the financial operating results of the Company. The Company has agreed to the
settlement in light of a number of considerations including the avoidance of
 
                                       22
<PAGE>   23
 
continuing costs of the litigation and the burden and disruption to the Company,
its directors, management and employees caused by the continued defense of the
litigation. As permitted by New Jersey law, the expenses of the individual
defendants are being advanced by UJB.
 
OTHER LITIGATION
 
     1. McAdoo CERCLA Matter.  First Valley Bank ("FVB") foreclosed on property
in McAdoo, Pennsylvania, taking title by a sheriff's deed in 1980. The property
was later designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") as a part of a site (the "McAdoo Site") listed on the National
Priorities List of sites to be remediated pursuant to the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA").
 
     On June 3, 1988, the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania entered a Consent Decree in United States v. Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc., Civil Action No. 87-7352 (the "Air Products litigation"), in
which sixty-five potentially responsible parties ("PRPs"), not including FVB,
agreed to undertake remediation of the McAdoo Site and the United States agreed
to pay 25% of the settling PRPs (the "Initial PRPs") cost of remediation.
 
     On June 11, 1988, after having made a demand upon FVB and a number of other
non-settling PRPs, the United States sued a number of the PRPs other than FVB
who did not enter into the Consent Decree in a matter entitled United States of
America v. Alcan Aluminum et al, United States District Court, Eastern District
of Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 88-4970 (the "Alcan litigation"). Although the
United States did not sue FVB, on April 16, 1990, one defendant in the Alcan
Litigation, Kalama Chemical, Inc., filed a motion for leave to file a third
party complaint against FVB seeking contribution. The motion was denied without
prejudice.
 
     FVB then participated in settlement discussions in the Alcan litigation.
Pursuant to those negotiations, FVB and certain defendants, third-party
defendants and other potential third-party defendants deposited, in a Court
registry, a sum which the United States agreed will satisfy all of its claims
against FVB. The parties also executed a Consent Decree which was approved by
the District Court by Order dated June 24, 1993. The Consent Decree gives FVB a
broad covenant not to sue and contribution protection to the extent available
under 42 U.S.C. sec. 9622(d)(2). The Consent Decree was the subject of public
notice and comment, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. sec. 9622(d)(2). The Initial PRPs
submitted comments to the United States objecting to the Consent Decree,
including inter alia, the broad release provided to FVB. The Initial PRPs also
filed a motion to intervene in the Alcan litigation, which was denied by the
District Court. The Initial PRPs then appealed that denial to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a matter captioned United States v.
Alcan Aluminum, Inc., et al., Action No. 93-1099 (3rd Cir.). On May 25, 1994,
the Third Circuit vacated the District Court's orders denying the motion to
intervene and approving the Consent Decree, holding that the Initial PRPs may
intervene as a matter of right in the Alcan litigation if they can prove that
they have a protectable interest in that litigation. Consequently, the case was
remanded to the District Court to determine whether the Initial PRPs have a
protectable interest in the Alcan litigation.
 
     As a result of settlement negotiations, the parties have reached an
agreement in principle for the settlement of the case. In light of this
agreement in principle, the Court has suspended all proceedings in the case.
 
     2.  In re Payroll Express Corporation of New York and Payroll Express
Corporation, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York, Case Nos. 92-B-43149 (CB) and 92-B-43150 (CB).
 
     United Jersey Bank (the "Bank") is involved in six Chapter 11 cases venued
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
"Bankruptcy Cases") involving a former customer of the Bank, Payroll Express
Corp. ("Payroll"), and several related entities. Payroll was primarily in the
business of providing on-site check cashing services.
 
     Customers of Payroll deposited funds into a general deposit account
("Account") at the Bank to cover their payrolls. The Account was given credit
for deposits received by Payroll and cash was obtained by debiting the Account.
 
                                       23
<PAGE>   24
 
     Payroll perpetrated a substantial check kiting scheme using the Account and
another account at National Westminster Bank, NJ ("NatWest"). NatWest apparently
discovered this scheme in late May of 1992. Due to this discovery, NatWest
ceased honoring checks drawn by Payroll on its account. UJB was ultimately left
with a loss of approximately $4 million in the Account.
 
     On June 5, 1992, Robert Felzenberg, the President of Payroll, was charged
in a Federal court located in Manhattan with embezzlement and wire fraud. He has
pled guilty to among other things, wire and tax fraud, and was sentenced to
6 1/2 years imprisonment in March 1994.
 
     A trustee (the "Trustee") has been appointed by the Bankruptcy Court, and
he is currently conducting an investigation of Payroll. The Trustee has also
retained special counsel to pursue potential claims against the fidelity
insurers of Payroll Express Corp. and possibly Payroll's insurance agent.
Several parties concerned with the Bankruptcy Cases have undertaken an extensive
discovery pursuant to a Discovery Order under Bankruptcy Rule 2004.
 
     Payroll customers deposited a total of $11.8 million into the Account
during this period of time.
A number of these customers have asserted claims against the Bank, although only
three lawsuits by seventeen customers are currently pending: Beth Israel Medical
Center, et al. v. United Jersey Bank and National Westminster Bank New Jersey,
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action
No. 94-8256 (LAP), Frederick Goldman, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank and National
Westminster Bank New Jersey, United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Civil Action No. 94-8256 (LAP) and Towers Financial
Corporation v. United Jersey Bank, United States District Court for the District
of New Jersey, Civil Action No. 92-3175 (WGB). The lawsuits allege various
common law causes of action against the Bank, including unjust enrichment,
restitution, conversion, fraud, negligence and/or breach of fiduciary duty. The
Beth Israel and Frederick Goldman matters have been consolidated and the Bank
has filed a motion to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted. The motion is pending. Towers Financial has filed
for protection under the bankruptcy laws and this case has been inactive for
some time.
 
     The Trustee appointed in the Bankruptcy Cases described above filed two
adversary proceedings against the Bank. The first, captioned John E. Pereira, as
Chapter 11 Trustee of the Estate of Payroll Express Corporation et al. v. United
Jersey Bank, was originally filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York. The adversary complaint alleges the Account
received incoming wire transfers of at least $17,013,537.54 within the 90 days
prior to the filing of bankruptcy by Payroll. These incoming wire transfers were
allegedly used by the Bank to reduce its losses on the check kiting scheme. The
Trustee claims that the amounts of the wire transfers are recoverable by the
Trustee as avoidable preferences under the Bankruptcy Code. The Bank
successfully moved to withdraw the reference of this matter to the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York where it is currently
pending under Civil Action No.
94-1565 (LAP). The Bank has filed a motion for summary judgment in this matter.
The motion is pending.
 
     The second adversary complaint, captioned John E. Pereira, as Chapter 11
Trustee of the Estate of Payroll Express Corporation et al. v. United Jersey
Bank, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York,
Adversary Proceeding No. 94-8297A, alleges that the mortgages given to UJB on
property owned by the various Felzenberg-controlled entities, together with
certain loan payments made by Payroll to UJB, were fraudulent conveyances. The
properties in question have all been sold. The Trustee also seeks the return of
$310,000.00 in principal and $152,487.50 in interest payments made by Payroll on
its loan in the year prior to the bankruptcy. The Trustee claims that these
transfers are recoverable under section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, as well as
under the New Jersey Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. The Bank has filed an
answer denying the material allegations of the complaint and the parties are
currently conducting discovery.

to a related Mortgaged Property in each instance with Purchaser's approval,
then, the Asset Schedule shall be amended and such Mortgaged Property, the
Collateral Documents related thereto and all other rights of the Bank arising
out of or in connection with the related Mortgage Loan, shall be treated as an
OREO Parcel for all purposes hereof and the Purchaser shall be obligated to
acquire such OREO Parcel under and consistent with the terms hereof.

         SECTION 2.7      RISK OF LOSS.

         (a)     CASUALTY.  In the event of damage to any Mortgaged Property or
OREO Parcel by fire or other casualty, act of God or any other event occurring
prior to the Closing, the Bank or the applicable PIPCO, as the case may be,
shall assign to the Purchaser all insurance proceeds paid or payable to the
applicable PIPCO in connection therewith; provided, however, that in the event
of an





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   17

uninsured loss or a loss, whether or not covered by insurance, which is valued
at more than an amount equal to the greater of (i) $50,000 or (ii) 10% of the
Schedule Price of the related Loan or OREO Parcel, the Purchaser may elect to
delete such Loan or OREO Parcel from the Asset Schedule, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Schedule Price attributed to such Loan
or OREO Parcel.

         (b)     CONDEMNATION.  The Bank or the applicable Pipco shall give the
Purchaser written notice of any action or proceeding, instituted or threatened,
in eminent domain or for condemnation affecting any material part of any
Mortgaged Property or OREO Parcel, promptly after the receipt of notice or
knowledge thereof.  If prior to the Closing Date all or a substantial part of
any such Mortgaged Property or OREO Parcel is taken by condemnation or eminent
domain or by a transfer of the parcel in lieu thereof, the Bank shall, by the
earlier to occur of the date which is five Business Days after receipt of
notice or the Closing Date, deliver to the Purchaser notice of the same and
thereupon the Bank's obligation to sell the related Loan or the OREO Parcel
shall terminate and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Schedule Price
attributed to such Loan or OREO Parcel; provided however, the Purchaser may
elect to purchase such Asset for the Schedule Price less any Condemnation
Proceeds received or payable.  In the event of a partial taking of less than a
substantial portion of any Mortgaged Property or OREO Parcel, the Bank's
obligation to sell, and the Purchaser's obligation to purchase, the applicable
Asset shall continue, and in such event (i) any condemnation proceeds received
by the applicable PIPCO in connection with such related Loan or the OREO Parcel
on or before the Closing Date shall be credited against the Purchase Price, or
(ii) if by the Closing Date the applicable PIPCO has not received the related
condemnation award, the applicable PIPCO on the Closing Date shall assign to
the Purchaser all rights of its Condemnation Proceeds and all other rights, if
any, arising out of or in connection with any such eminent domain or
condemnation action or proceeding.  No proceeding in connection with any
Condemnation Proceeds may be settled without the Purchaser's approval.

         (c)     WITHDRAWAL OF AN ASSET.  If the Bank or any PIPCO reasonably
believes that the sale of an Asset pursuant hereto would violate any law, rule
or regulation applicable to the Bank or such PIPCO, the applicable owner
thereof may, at its option, provide the Purchaser with notice of same and that
such Asset shall be withdrawn, in which event the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Schedule Price attributed to the withdrawn Asset.

         SECTION 2.8      POST CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.  If the amounts required to
be paid or credited pursuant to this Article cannot be precisely determined by
the Closing Date, or were determined erroneously on or before the Closing Date,
the Bank or the applicable PIPCO, as the case may be, and the Purchaser shall
make the necessary determination or redetermination promptly following the
Closing and the Bank and the Purchaser shall make the necessary





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   18

adjustments through remittances between themselves not later than the 30 days
after the Closing Date. Without limitation of the foregoing, within 45 days
after the Closing Date each party that receives a payment which is due to the
other party under Section 2.4(a), (b) or (c) shall prepare an accounting of the
amounts so received for the benefit of the party entitled to the same.  The
parties agree to work in good faith to effectuate this clause consistent with
the intention and provisions of this Agreement.  This provision shall survive
the Closing.

         SECTION 3.8      ADDITIONAL ASSETS; SCHEDULE 9 ASSETS.

         (a)     The parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser's due
diligence with respect to the Additional Assets is not yet complete for the
Purchaser to be able to make an educated investment decision with respect to
the purchase of such Assets.  Accordingly, the parties agree that the Purchaser
shall not be required to purchase the Additional Assets unless the Purchaser is
satisfied as of three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, in the exercise of
its reasonable discretion, with respect to the results of its due diligence on
the Additional Assets.  In any event, the Purchaser shall advise the Bank of
its decision no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.  In the
event that the Purchaser elects to purchase any one or more of the
aforementioned Additional Assets, such assets shall be considered as
constituting part of the "Assets" for the purposes of this Agreement.  In the
event that any such due diligence cannot be completed prior to the Closing, the
parties shall enter into an option agreement with respect to the Tinton Falls

Purchaser may elect to acquire said Additional Assets on the terms hereof for a

below, Purchaser shall not be required to purchase any Asset so identified on
SCHEDULE 9 with respect to which it is not satisfied, as of three (3) days
prior to Closing, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, with respect to
the status of the conditions so identified on SCHEDULE 9.

         (c) The parties further acknowledge and agree that, except as set
forth in the proviso immediately following, the Purchaser shall





                                      -20-
<PAGE>   25

be entitled to review the conditions set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.8(b) on an
Asset by Asset basis and may elect, in the event that any condition therein
contained has not been fulfilled with respect to a particular Asset, to delete
such Asset from the transaction herein contemplated or waive such condition;
provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to close the transactions
herein contemplated if any of the following Assets are not being conveyed by the
Bank or the applicable PIPCO hereunder because of any such election made by the
Purchaser to delete any such Asset: Wyndham; Bishop's Gate; Panther Valley; and
Heathcote.  In the event that any Asset is so deleted from the transaction, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by reducing the Purchase Price by the Schedule
Price relating to such Asset so deleted.

by the Bank and the PIPCOs, this Agreement and all the obligations of the
Purchaser hereunder are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Purchaser,
enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         (b)     CONFLICT WITH EXISTING LAWS OR CONTRACTS.  The execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the performance by the Purchaser of
its obligations hereunder will not, conflict with any provision of any law or

breach of or constitute a default under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any agreement or instrument to which the Purchaser is a party or
by which it is bound, or any order or decree applicable to the Purchaser, or
result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any of its assets or
property which could materially and adversely affect the ability of the
Purchaser to discharge its obligations under and complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and the Purchaser has obtained all consents,
approvals, authorizations and orders of any courts or governmental agencies or

Purchaser of this Agreement.

         (c)     LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE PURCHASER.  There are no judgments,
orders or decrees of any kind against the Purchaser that are unpaid or
unsatisfied of record, nor is there any legal action, suit or other legal or
administrative proceeding pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated that

has not relied in entering into this Agreement upon any oral or written
information from the Bank or any of the PIPCOs, or any of its employees,

representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (subject, however,
to the limitations set forth herein).  The Purchaser further acknowledges that

the PIPCOs has made or has been authorized to make, and that the Purchaser has
not relied upon, any statements or representations other than as contained in

shall a breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement be deemed in
and of itself to constitute bad faith, misconduct or fraud for the purpose of
alleging or proving punitive damages.

identified" meaning, with respect to any fact or circumstance, that such fact
or circumstance was disclosed with clarity sufficient to have given a
reasonably prudent purchaser, based upon customarily diligent inquiry and due
diligence, notice or a basis for further inquiry and a reasonable basis for
realizing or inquiring further into the significance of such fact or
circumstance, provided, however, the absence of any written disclosure as to
any fact or circumstance shall not be construed as having "clearly identified"
such fact or circumstance:

         (a)     AUTHORITY; BINDING ON THE BANK AND THE PIPCOS; ENFORCEABILITY
OF AGREEMENT.  The Bank and each PIPCO has taken all necessary action to
authorize its execution, delivery and performance of, and the Closing Date will
have the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under, this Agreement and all related documents executed by the Bank or such
PIPCO in connection herewith and to consummate all the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the power and authority to sell,
assign and transfer the Assets in accordance with this Agreement.  Assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Purchaser, this Agreement
and all related documents and all the obligations of the Bank and each PIPCO,
respectively, hereunder or thereunder are legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Bank and each PIPCO, respectively, enforceable against the Bank and such
PIPCO, respectively, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         (b)     CONFLICT WITH EXISTING LAWS OR CONTRACTS.  The execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the performance by the Bank and each
PIPCO of its obligations hereunder will not, conflict with any provision of any
law or regulation to which the Bank or any PIPCO is subject or conflict with or
result in a breach of or constitute a default under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any agreement or instrument to which the Bank or
any PIPCO is a party or by which it is bound or any order or decree applicable
to the Bank or such PIPCO, nor will such execution, delivery and performance
result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any of the Bank's or such
PIPCO's assets or properties that could materially and adversely affect the
ability of the Bank or such PIPCO to discharge its obligations under and
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and the Bank and each
PIPCO, respectively, has obtained all consents, approvals, authorizations and
orders of any courts or governmental agencies or bodies required for the due
execution, delivery and performance by the Bank and each PIPCO of this
Agreement.

         (c)     LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE BANK AND THE PIPCOS.  There are no
judgments or orders of any kind against the Bank or any PIPCO that are unpaid
or unsatisfied of record, nor is there any legal action, suit or other legal or
administrative proceeding pending,





                                      -23-
<PAGE>   28

threatened or reasonably anticipated that could be filed against the Bank or
any PIPCO, that if concluded adversely to the Bank
or such PIPCO, could materially adversely affect the ability of the Bank or
such PIPCO to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         (d)     CONDEMNATION.  There is no pending or, to the Bank's and
PIPCOs' knowledge, threatened total or partial condemnation or similar
proceeding affecting any Mortgaged Property or OREO Parcel.

         (e)     LITIGATION.  There is no litigation or governmental
investigation pending or to the Bank's and the PIPCOs' knowledge, threatened,
nor any order, injunction or decree relating to any Asset, that could have a
material adverse effect upon such Asset or title thereto.

         (f)     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   Other than what is in the
Environmental Assessment Reports, neither the Bank nor any of the PIPCOs has
knowledge of any other material conditions or circumstances related to the
Assets or any Mortgaged Property which pose a material risk to the environment
or has received written notice of any violation of any applicable federal or
state environmental law.

         (g)     CAMBRIDGE SQUARE (MARLBORO LOAN).  With respect to the
Cambridge Square (Marlboro) Loan, which is secured in part upon a leasehold
estate under a ground lease of the related Mortgaged Property, but not by the
related fee interest therein:

                 (i)      Such ground lease permits the interest of the lessee
thereunder to be encumbered by the related Mortgage;

                (ii)      The Bank has received no notice of default and has no
knowledge of the occurrence of any default under such ground lease or any event
which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would
constitute a default under such ground lease.

         (h)     GROUND LEASES. There are no ground leases except as set forth
on the Asset Schedule.

         (i)     SOLE OWNERSHIP AND RIGHT TO SELL.  The Bank is the sole
beneficial owner and record holder of each Loan, free of any participation
interest, has full right to sell and assign such Loan free and clear of any
ownership claims or security interests and without the consent of any third
party.  The applicable PIPCO is the sole owner and holder of the OREO Parcel
and has good and marketable title to and the full right to sell the respective
OREO Parcel without the consent of any third party.

         (j)     ENFORCEABILITY.  Each Note and Mortgage and any related
guaranty is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Mortgagor thereon,
enforceable against such Mortgagor in accordance with its terms except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,





                                      -24-
<PAGE>   29

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).  The unenforceability of any particular provision or provisions of
any Mortgage or Note does not affect the ability of the holder thereof to
enforce, and to realize the practical benefits of the security intended to be
provided by, such Note and Mortgage.  There is no valid offset, defense or
counterclaim to any Note or Mortgage.

         (k)     NO MODIFICATION.  The Bank has not modified any Mortgage or
Note in any material respect, nor satisfied, cancelled or subordinated such
Mortgage or Note in whole or in part nor released all or any material portion
of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage, nor executed any
instrument of release, cancellation or satisfaction with respect to such Note
or Mortgage.

         (l)     NO RIGHT TO FUTURE ADVANCES.  The Mortgagor has no right to
disbursement of additional loan proceeds or future advances with respect to a
related Loan.  SCHEDULE 1 accurately reflects the outstanding principal balance
of each Loan as of the Credit Date.

         (m)     CROSS COLLATERALIZATION.  Except for the Loans in a Loan
Group, none of the Loans is cross collateralized with any other loan made by
the Bank.

         (n)     ASSET FILES.  To the knowledge of the Bank and the PIPCOs, as
of the date of this Agreement the Asset Files contained and as of the Closing
Date the Asset Files will contain all material documents, which are listed on
Schedule 13, or copies thereof, relating to each Asset that are in the
possession or control of the Bank and PIPCOs.  Except as otherwise provided in
this Article, the Bank and the PIPCOs make no representation or warranty as to
the accuracy of facts or opinions recited in the documents and papers which are
included in the Asset Files, or otherwise provided to the Purchaser.

         (o)     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  As of the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, neither the Bank nor the applicable PIPCO has received any
notice by any governmental authority or any Person entitled to enforce a
restrictive covenant affecting any Mortgaged Property or OREO Parcel that any
zoning, building, or other federal, state or municipal law, ordinance or
regulation or any restrictive covenant is currently violated by the
maintenance, operation, occupancy or use of the Mortgaged Property or OREO
Parcel in its present manner, which violation could materially and adversely
affect the value, operation, occupancy or use of such Mortgaged Property or
OREO Parcel.  Each Loan is in compliance in all material respects with
applicable state and Federal usury and equal credit opportunity laws.

         (p)     LEASES.  To the knowledge of the Bank and the applicable
PIPCO, each of the leases affecting the Real Estate is in full

force and effect and has not been modified and the applicable PIPCO is not in
material default under any such lease.

all material documents evidencing the relationship among the Bank, the
Mortgagors and any guarantors.

         (r)     LIABILITY.  To the knowledge of the Bank, there is no basis
upon which any Mortgagor could initiate any valid claim for damages or other
relief arising out of the acts or omissions of the Bank in connection with the
underwriting, approval, disbursement, administration or restructuring of any of
the Loans.  To the knowledge of the Bank and each applicable PIPCO, there is no
basis upon which any vendor, supplier, property manager, broker, contractor,
subcontractor or contract vendee could initiate any valid suit against the
applicable PIPCO for non-payment, damages or other relief in connection with
any outstanding agreement affecting any OREO Parcel.

         (s)     RENT ROLLS.  The rent rolls attached hereto as EXHIBIT J
relating to the Real Estate, are, as of the date on each such rent roll, true
and correct in all material respects.

         (t)     RIGHTS OF FIRST REFUSAL, OPTIONS.  There are no rights of
first refusal, rights of first offer or options to purchase in respect of any
of the Assets.

         (u)     ESCROW ACCOUNTS.  There are no suspense accounts or escrow
accounts held by the Bank, any affiliate thereof or any applicable PIPCO with
respect to any Asset except security deposits held pursuant to leases of the

         (v)     CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS.  As of the Closing Date, no
director, employee or agent of the Bank, any affiliate thereof or any
applicable PIPCO will be on any board of a condominium association, which
governs any OREO Parcel.  Neither the Bank nor any PIPCO subsidizes the costs
of any condominium association, which governs any OREO Parcel.

         (w)     OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS.  There are no outstanding contracts to
sell OREO Parcels or any interest therein.  The applicable PIPCOs are not in
material default of their respective obligations under the contracts listed on
SCHEDULE 2.

         (x)     FARMLAND ASSESSMENT APPLICATIONS/PENDING TAX APPEAL/TENANT
REBATE ACT.  There are no pending tax appeals affecting any OREO Parcel.  To
the knowledge of the Bank and the applicable PIPCO, none of them has received
notice of violation of the applicable rent control laws and tenant rebate acts,
if applicable, in force in the jurisdictions in which the OREO Parcels are
situated.  All farmland assessment applications pertaining to the Real Estate
have been delivered to the Purchaser.





                                      -26-

         (y)     HAZARD INSURANCE.  Each Mortgaged Property and OREO Parcel is
insured against loss by fire and hazards of extended coverage.  The Bank or the
applicable PIPCOs currently maintains the following casualty and liability

applicable PIPCO, except as shown on the title reports annexed as SCHEDULE 4,

which have been filed for work performed or materials ordered by or on behalf
of the Bank or a PIPCO.  The Bank and each applicable PIPCO has paid all of the
outstanding invoices for work performed at, and materials ordered for, each of
the OREO Parcels.

         (aa)    BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS.  All brokerage commissions, which are
payable in connection with existing leases affecting any OREO Parcel have been
paid in full.  There are no sales or brokerage commissions payable in
connection with the sale of any OREO Parcel.

Schedule is true and correct as of the date or dates respecting which such
information is furnished.

         (ac)    VALID LIEN.  Each Mortgage is a valid and enforceable lien on
the Mortgaged Property.  Any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent
document related to each Mortgage and previously delivered to the Purchaser
establishes in the Bank a valid and subsisting lien on the property described
therein.

         (ad)    TITLE INSURANCE.  Each of the Loans is covered by a mortgagee
title insurance policy or title binder insuring the Bank, its successors and
assigns, as to the priority lien of the Mortgage in the original principal
amount of each Loan (or any higher or lower amount resulting from a
modification thereof).  To the knowledge of the Bank, no claims have been made
under such lender's title insurance policy or equivalent and the Bank has not
done, by deed or omission, anything which would impair the coverage of such
title insurance policy.

bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

Purchaser's convenience. No representation or warranty by any of the Bank or
the PIPCOs or any of its or their employees, advisors, agents, property
managers, consultants, representatives, accountants or attorneys is being made
to the Purchaser, its employees, advisors, agents, property managers,
consultants, representatives, accountants, investors or attorneys with respect
to such Reports.  Any reliance upon the Reports shall be at the sole risk of
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser hereby expressly waives any claim, suit,
recourse, damages, or other right of recovery or set- off it may have against
the Bank, the PIPCOs, and its or their employees, advisors, agents, property
managers, consultants, accountants, or attorneys with respect to reliance on
such Reports by the Purchaser, its employees, advisors, agents, property
managers, consultants, accountants, investors or attorneys.

         SECTION 6.4      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  As to the Assets, the
Purchaser is aware of the environmental conditions or contamination in the
Environmental Assessment Reports.  The Purchaser has been afforded the
opportunity for itself, its attorneys, its agents, its engineers, its
environmental engineers or consultants, and other representatives of its
choosing, to fully inspect and assess the value and conditions of the Assets.
The Bank and the PIPCOs have provided or otherwise made or offered to make
available to Purchaser those materials which the Bank and the PIPCOs possess,
pertaining to the environmental conditions of the Assets.

         SECTION 6.5      PHYSICAL CONDITION.  The Purchaser expressly
acknowledges that it is buying the Assets in their "AS IS" condition on the
date hereof, subject to reasonable use, wear and tear and normal depreciation
between the date hereof and the Closing Date.


                                  ARTICLE VII
                          CURE AND REPURCHASE OF ASSET

         SECTION 7.1      PURCHASER'S CLAIM OF A DEFECTIVE ASSET.  In the event
of a material breach of a representation or warranty with respect to an Asset,
then Purchaser may execute and deliver to Seller a Certificate of Defect no
later than the end of the applicable Representation and Warranty Period for
such representation and warranty.

         SECTION 7.2      BANK AND PIPCOS ELECTIONS FOR DEFECTIVE ASSET.  By no
later than thirty (30) days following its receipt of a





                                      -32-
<PAGE>   37

Certificate of Defect, the Bank or the applicable PIPCO shall notify the
Purchaser (i) (x) that the Bank or the applicable PIPCO disputes that the
alleged breach exists or that the breach is material, and (y) of the basis for
the Bank's or applicable PIPCOs position or (ii) that the Bank or the applicable
PIPCO will cure such breach within the Cure Period by either curing such breach
or paying to the Purchaser the amount to cure such breach or (iii) that the Bank
or applicable PIPCO will repurchase the Asset as provided in SECTION 7.3.

         SECTION 7.3      REPURCHASE PRICE.  The Bank with respect to the Loans
and the PIPCOs with respect to the Real Estate, and Pipco Windsong, Inc. with
respect to the Distribution Rights shall repurchase for the Repurchase Price
any Asset (i) that it has either elected to repurchase under SECTION 7.2
hereof, or (ii) with respect to which it has failed to cure the breach under
SECTION 7.2 hereof within the Cure Period.  Seventy-five percent (75%) of the
Repurchase Price shall be applied to the reduction of the Purchase Money Loan.

         SECTION 7.4      REPURCHASE DATE.  The "Repurchase Date" for any Asset
being repurchased pursuant to this Article VII shall be on or before the date
thirty (30) days following (i) if the Bank has elected to repurchase the Asset,
the date the Bank has made such election or (ii) if the Bank or the applicable
PIPCO has elected to cure the breach and has failed to do so, the expiration of
the Cure Period.

         SECTION 7.5      RECONVEYANCE OF ASSETS.  On the Repurchase Date,
Purchaser shall convey to the Bank or the applicable PIPCO all its right, title
and interest in and to the repurchased Asset pursuant to an assignment, deed
and other appropriate documents; provided, however, that neither the Bank nor
the applicable PIPCO shall be required to repurchase any Asset to the extent
that the physical condition of any applicable Asset, the substantive rights of
the Bank under any applicable Loan, the condition of the title to any
applicable Asset, or the collateral for any applicable Loan has been materially
adversely affected as a result of the Purchaser's gross negligence, bad faith,
willful misconduct or intentional disregard of prudent operating or servicing
practices.  Each of the Bank and the PIPCOs covenants and agrees that, whether
or not it shall be required to repurchase any Asset hereunder, it shall
indemnify and hold harmless, for actual damages (excluding consequential
damages), the Purchaser, its affiliates and agents and their respective
partners, members, shareholder, officers, directors and employees suffered as a
result of any Claims arising in connection with any material breach of a
representation or warranty with respect to which Purchaser shall have timely
delivered a Certificate of Defect.

         SECTION 7.6      DEFECTS COVERED BY TITLE INSURANCE.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not
be entitled to deliver a Certificate of Defect for an OREO Parcel if the
Purchaser is





                                      -33-
<PAGE>   38

entitled to assert a valid claim under a title insurance policy with respect to
the loss caused by such breach.  If the Purchaser would otherwise be entitled
to deliver a valid Certificate of Defect but for the lack of a final
determination as to whether a related loss is covered by either a title
insurance policy despite the Purchaser's reasonable efforts to resolve such
matter (which efforts shall consist of the prompt submission of a claim to the
appropriate title company) then the Purchaser may deliver such Certificate of
Defect to the Bank in accordance with SECTION 7.2, provided that the survival
period of the applicable representations and warranties shall be tolled until
such time as a final determination regarding such coverage has been made.

         SECTION 7.7      MATERIALITY.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser shall only be entitled to deliver a
Certificate of Defect if one or more breaches of a representation or warranty
by the Bank or any PIPCO with respect to an Asset is "material".  For the
purposes of this Agreement the term "material" shall mean a breach by the Bank
or any PIPCO of a representation or warranty that (a) with respect to an Asset
having a Schedule Price greater than $400,000, cannot be cured or remediated
for less than the greater of (i) $200,000 or (ii) 10% of the Schedule Price of
the related Asset and (b) with respect to an Asset having a Schedule Price
equal to $400,000 or less, cannot be cured or remediated for less than 25% of
the Schedule Price of the related Asset.  The "material" or "materiality"
limitation herein shall not apply to any breach of representations contained in
Section 5.1(u) or (ab) as it relates to security deposits or the outstanding
principal balance of any Loan.

         SECTION 7.8  ARBITRATION.

         (a) Any controversy or claim between Purchaser and the Bank and the
PIPCOs arising out of or relating to this Article shall be determined by
arbitration.  The arbitration shall be conducted under the Commercial Rules of
the American Arbitration Association, but not under its auspices unless the
parties agree.  Any controversy concerning whether an issue is arbitrable shall
be determined by the arbitrator(s).  The award rendered by the arbitrator(s)
shall set forth findings of facts and conclusions of law and shall be final,
and the judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  A
failure by the arbitrator(s) to make findings of fact and conclusions of law
shall be grounds for overturning the award.  The institution and maintenance of
an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy
shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the
plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party
contests such action for relief.

         (b) In any arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator(s) is (are)
authorized to award interest and penalties and to apportion costs and expenses,
including investigation, legal and other expense, which will include, if
applicable, a reasonable estimate of allocated costs and expense.  Such costs
and expenses are to be





                                      -34-
<PAGE>   39

awarded only after the conclusion of the arbitration and will not be advanced
during the course of such arbitration.

                                   TRANSITION

         SECTION 8.1      TRANSITION OF THE SALE OF ASSETS.

         (a)  Between the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Bank shall
service and administer each Loan in conformity with customary prudent industry
servicing standards of servicers of similar loans. Between the date hereof and
the Closing Date, neither the Bank nor the PIPCOs will, if the Purchaser
objects within five (5) Business Days after written notice from the Bank (which
notice the Bank covenants to deliver prior to any such act) (i) enter into, or
cause or permit, any new leases for all or any portion of any OREO Parcel to be
entered into, (ii) consent to any assignment or sublease in connection with any
leases affecting any OREO Parcel or Mortgaged Property; (iii) make, or cause or
permit to be made, any applications or institute or cause or permit to be
instituted, legal or other proceedings except as expressly authorized herein;
(iv) restructure, amend or modify a Loan; (v) restructure, release, foreclose,
or permit any foreclosure, upon a mortgage or otherwise acquire title to a
Mortgaged Property; (vi) further encumber any OREO Parcel; or (vii) enter into,
or cause or permit any new service, maintenance construction, operating or
other agreement to be entered into which might become the obligation of the
Purchaser or to which an OREO Parcel would be subject following the Closing,
nor modify, extend, renew, supplement, cancel, or cause or permit the
modification, extension, renewal, supplementation, cancellation or accept the
surrender of or the renewal of, such agreements, if any, which may exist at
present or are hereafter entered into unless the same (except for leases and
other occupancy agreements) is reasonably necessary for the normal operation of
any OREO Parcel prior to the Closing Date and may be terminated by the Bank
prior to or on the Closing Date; provided, however, the foregoing notice
requirement shall not apply to matters addressed in SECTION 3.8(B) and the
applicable Schedule.

         (b)     The Bank or the applicable PIPCO shall keep, maintain and
preserve the OREO Parcels in their present condition (normal wear and tear
excepted) until the Closing Date, and comply with all laws pertaining to the
OREO Parcels or the use or occupancy thereof.

         (c)     The Bank or the applicable PIPCO shall give written notice to
the Purchaser of any actions, claims, proceedings, or investigations threatened
or commenced against the Bank or applicable PIPCO which relate to, or affect,
any Asset.

         (d)     The Bank or the applicable PIPCOs shall promptly provide
Purchaser with a copy of any notice of violations of law or governmental
ordinances, orders or requirements affecting any OREO Parcel or Mortgaged
Property received by the Bank or the applicable PIPCO.

         (e)     Until such time as the Bank or the applicable PIPCO physically
delivers the Asset Files to the Purchaser, the Bank





                                      -36-
<PAGE>   41

shall use reasonable efforts to arrange for the Purchaser, its agents and
designees to have reasonable access thereto and to
the OREO Parcels for the purposes of site inspections, reports, valuations and
other related activities and agrees to permit
the Purchaser access to all documentation reasonably requested by Purchaser and
to use, inspect, make extracts from or request
copies of such documentation.

         (f)     The Bank or the applicable PIPCO shall prior to the Closing
Date transfer to the Purchaser all files, correspondence, court papers,
pleadings and documentation, in its possession, relating to any litigation
involving any of the Assets and shall use all reasonable efforts and take all
necessary actions, including a notice of motion and related materials, as may
be required in order to substitute Purchaser as Plaintiff in any such actions
to effect the resignation of its counsel therefrom.

         (g)     The Bank shall, at the Closing and upon request of the
Purchaser, terminate any service contracts pursuant to the terms thereof.


                                   ARTICLE IX
                                    DEFAULT

         SECTION 9.1      THE PURCHASER'S DEFAULT.  In the event the Purchaser
shall default in its obligation to purchase the Assets or materially breach a
representation or warranty or covenant hereunder or otherwise fail to perform
its obligations under this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Bank and the
PIPCOs may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Purchaser and the
Bank and the PIPCOs shall be entitled to retain the Deposit, plus interest on
the cash portion of the Deposit, as full compensation and liquidated damages as
its sole remedy.

         If such default, breach or failure occurs, the Bank and the PIPCOs
will incur costs and other damages in an amount that would be difficult or
impractical to ascertain.  The deposit bears a reasonable relationship to the
damages which the Purchaser and the Bank and the PIPCOs estimate may be
incurred by the Bank and the PIPCOs by reason of the Purchaser's breach,
default or failure hereunder.

         SECTION 9.2      THE BANK'S AND PIPCOS' DEFAULT.  Except as provided in
Article VII hereof, upon any default by the Bank or any PIPCO as of or after
the Closing, the Purchaser may avail itself of any remedies the Purchaser may
have at law or in equity or under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, specific performance.  However, the Purchaser shall neither have
(a) any right to consequential damages, nor (b) any right to offset amounts due
to the Bank under the Purchase Money Loan Documents or any other contract or
agreement between the Bank and the Purchaser or any affiliate of either against
any damages on account of the Bank's or any PIPCO's default hereunder.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         SECTION 11.1     OBLIGATIONS OF BANK.  In the event that any PIPCO
fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Bank shall cause
such PIPCO to perform within 15 days after written demand for performance by
the Purchaser.

         SECTION 11.2     SEVERABILITY.  Each provision of this Agreement is
intended to be severable.  If any term, covenant, condition or other provision
herein is unlawful, invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, and
such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability does not affect the remaining
parts of this Agreement, then all such remaining parts hereof shall be valid
and enforceable and have full force and effect as though the invalid or
unenforceable provision had not been included herein.

         SECTION 11.3     RIGHTS CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS.  Except to the extent
expressly limited in this Agreement, the rights of each of the parties under
this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised as often as such party
considers appropriate.  Without limitation on the foregoing, if in light of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement a party disputes the position taken by
the other party then either party may seek judicial resolution of such dispute.
No right of any party hereunder shall be capable of being waived or varied
otherwise than by an express waiver or variation in writing.  Except to the
extent expressly limited in this Agreement, failure to exercise or any delay in
exercising any of such rights also shall not operate as a waiver or variation
of that or any other such right.  Except to the extent expressly limited in
this Agreement, defective or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other right.  No act,
course of conduct or negotiation on the part of any party shall in any way
preclude such party from





                                      -40-
<PAGE>   45

exercising any such right or constitute a suspension or variation of any such
right.

         SECTION 11.4     ELECTION BY BANK ON BEHALF OF PIPCOS.  Title to the
OREO Parcels identified in SCHEDULE 1 is held by the PIPCOs.  Whenever under
this Agreement any PIPCO is entitled or required to make an election with
respect to an OREO Parcel, each such PIPCO agrees that the Bank may make such
election on behalf of such PIPCO.

         SECTION 11.5     HEADINGS.  The headings contained in this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         SECTION 11.6     CONSTRUCTION.  Unless the context otherwise requires,
singular nouns and pronouns, when used herein, shall be deemed to include the
plural s of such nouns or pronouns and pronouns of one gender shall be deemed
to include the equivalent pronouns of the other gender.  Wherever used the
words "including" or "included" shall be deemed followed by the phrase "without
limitation."

         SECTION 11.7     ASSIGNMENT.

         (a)     GENERAL.  Except as set forth in Section 3.5(f), neither party
may assign any rights under this Agreement to any Person without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided however, that the Purchaser may
designate one or more related entities to take title to the Related Mortgage
Interests or such other of the Assets as it may specify.

         (b)     MISCELLANEOUS.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and
the terms, covenants, conditions and other provisions hereof, and the
obligations, undertakings, rights and benefits herein and hereunder, including
the Schedules and Exhibits, shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
undersigned parties and their respective successors and assigns.

         SECTION 11.8     INTEGRATION.  Except for the Confidentiality
Agreements, this Agreement supersedes any and all prior discussions and

         (a)     GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be construed, and the

such dispute shall be tried before a judge sitting without a jury.

         SECTION 11.14    NO PARTNERSHIP.  Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed to place the parties in relationship





                                      -42-

option to acquire the below named properties at any time prior to the
respective dates set forth opposite same and on the terms and conditions of the
Asset Purchase Agreement; provided, however that the provisions of Section 8.1

exercise any such Cross Provisions. Purchaser agrees to inform any subsequent
purchaser of the Fair Lawn Office Center Loan of the above referenced
limitation.

                             UNITED JERSEY BANKS

                             INCENTIVE BONUS PLAN
                                                                               
                                                                   

1.      OBJECTIVES OF THE PLAN

        *       encourage the achievement of corporate and profit center
                performance goals and other business development objectives.

        *       reinforce the importance of coordination among the
                sectors that together form the total corporation.

        *       enable the Bank to retain and attract experienced key
                executives by holding forth the opportunity to earn awards
                which reflect the success of their managerial leadership.

2.      GOAL-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT BONUS PLAN

        The Plan recognizes the performance of individuals and groups
        of individuals on the basis of the attainment of predetermined and
        explicitly communicated objectives. These objectives are restated on an
        annual basis and are often tied to budgets or forecasts. If objectives
        are realized, funds are accrued out of which bonuses are paid. The
        exact relationship between performance and bonus levels is determined
        in advance using a defined formula. While the measurement factors
        generally remain constant over a period of years, the goals with
        respect to these factors change from year to year. The expectation is
        that the goal set for any year represents a management challenge
        comparable to that of any other year, given the internal resources and
        external environment of the business at that time.

        This approach is most consistent with a management style that
        focuses on the accountability of individuals or groups of individuals
        for making specific, predefined contributions to the overall results of
        the business. The goal-oriented approach does require a process for
        setting reasonable goals at the beginning of the year and a means of
        measuring performance at the end of the year both qualitatively and
        quantitatively. This is usually accomplished as part of the normal
        management budgeting and control process.

    * Accumulative funding based on the use of guideline bonus award levels for
      each UJB salary grade.
    * Three level of participants to provide for direct focus on performance
      standards and objectives closest to the personal level of
      responsibility of each executive.
    * Eligibility limited to key executives and individual contributing 
      bankers throughout UJB commercial and retail banking activities and 
      central support functions.

4.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

    The Plan shall be administered under the direction of the Personnel
    Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of United Jersey Banks,
    which shall take into consideration the recommendations of management.

    The Committee shall be composed of such members (not less than three)
    as shall be appointed from time to time by the Board of Directors. No
    member of the Committee while serving as such shall be eligible for
    participation in the Plan. The Committee has exclusive and final authority
    in all determinations affecting the Plan and shall have the sole authority
    to interpret the Plan, establish and revise rules and regulations relating
    to the Plan and make any other determinations that it believes necessary or
    advisable for the administration of the Plan.

    The Senior Vice President - Human Resources, will review all candidates
    and the Chief Executive Officer will review and approve additions and
    deletions of plan participants.

5.  PARTICIPATION

    Participants in the Plan shall be selected each year by the Committee from
    among the Bank's salaried key executive employees whose performance
    significantly affects the business results of the Bank. In addition,
    selected employees who have demonstrated the potential for rapid
    advancement into key positions may be considered for participation in the
    Plan.

    As a partial guide for eligibility, no employee will be eligible unless in
    a job assigned to salary grade 66 and above except in circumstances where
    personal potential indicates a rapid advance to such grades.

    Three levels of participants are identified in order to recognize different
    roles in the Bank. The levels are:

        1.  Chief Executive and heads of basic banking functions (e.g.,
            commercial banking; operations) and staff departments (e.g.,
            finance; human resources).

        2.  Bank presidents and head of basic functions in major banks (e.g.,
            trust; branch operations).

        3.  Individual contributing bankers and heads of basic functions in
            smaller banks.

6.  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

    Specific performance standards will be developed for three Bonus Levels,
    each of which emphasizes a different facet of Bank activity ranging from
    broad corporate-wide responsibilities to responsbility limited in the main
    to one key sector of the Bank. Each participant will be assigned to the
    appropriate Bonus Level determined according to the participant's major
    responsibilities within the Bank.


                                     -3-





<PAGE>   5
    For Level 1, the performance standards and relative weightings would be:

        *   UJB's annual financial plan (1/3).

        *   UJB's earnings growth rate over the prior year (1/3).

        *   UJB's overall financial performance as compared to other peer group
            banks (1/3).

    For these executives, the emphasis is on corporate-wide performance. The 
    use of the annual plan will reinforce the importance of careful planning,
    as well as the execution of the overall business plan; the growth rate will
    stress the importance of increasing earnings; the comparison to other banks
    will emphasize the importance of moving into a stronger leadership
    position. Each performance standard is discrete, in that no award could be
    paid for failure in one, whereas an award may be paid for results in
    another.
    
    This Level reflects a management environment oriented to collective
    activity rather than to just individual accountability for achieving
    business results. This approach creates an identity of interest between
    Level 1 participants and the Company in the overall results of the
    business.

    For Level 2, the performance standards and relative weightings would be:

        *  Corporate performance on same factors as used for Level 1
           participants (1/3).
           
        *  Annual financial plan for own profit center (2/3).

    For these executives, the emphasis shifts to the particular unit of UJB
    for which they are responsible and standards which are influenced by their
    own performance. As a means of reinforcing the importance of coordination
    and cooperation among all key executives, some part of Level 2 participants
    bonus will be tied to bank-wide performance.


                                     -4-

<PAGE>   6
    For Level 3, the performance standards and relative weightings would be:

    *  Annual financial plan for own profit center (1/3).

    *  Personal performance in meeting particular business development and
       other goals established for the year appropriate to the job (2/3).

    For these executives and key individual contributing professionals, the
    emphasis is on performance criteria over which they have significant
    influence. The corporate performance measure is omitted for this reason.

    In addition to the standards for Levels 1, 2, and 3:

    *  The Chief Executive evaluates the performance of all those eligible for
       awards with respect to their support of the Bank's overall business
       development strategy and human resources development.

    *  The Chief Executive should also adjust results derived from the formula
       guidelines to reflect top management and Board judgements concerning
       the quality of the performance in the economic environment in which the
       results were obtained.

7.  DETERMINATION OF AWARDS

    An incentive bonus award schedule for each Bonus Level will be used by
    the Committee in determining annual incentive bonuses. The schedule will
    define guideline incentive bonus size as a percentage of each participant's
    base salary earnings in the year for which the award is made. The guideline
    incentive bonus awards will be in an amount that when combined with annual
    salary, the resulting total cash compensation will be equal to competitive
    rates. The guideline incentive bonus percentage will be increased for
    above-standard performance; conversely it will be decreased for below
    standard but still acceptable performance. Guideline awards will be paid
    for meeting performance standards and objectives as established for 


                                     -5-

<PAGE>   7

    each of the three Levels of participants.  When performance falls below
    expectation, the individual bonus rate will be reduced by up to 50 percent
    of the guideline rate at the lowest level of acceptable performance. 
    Bonuses will be paid up to 150 percent of guideline rates for performance
    that goes clearly beyond expectations.

    The following guideline bonus rates at the indicated salary grades are
    set forth to demonstrate how they are linked to salary and adjusted for
    performance:

 8.  TIME OF PAYMENT

     All incentive bonuses earned under the Plan will be paid in cash within
     a reasonable period after annual performance achievements have been
     determined, reviewed, and approved by the Committee.       

 9.  RIGHT TO PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE BONUS

     A participant shall have no right to receive payment for any part of
     the annual incentive bonus.  The incentive bonus shall be forfeited unless
     the participant remains in the employment of the Bank until the last day
     of the Plan Year as defined in Section 2.

     The Committee may, if it determines that circumstances so warrant,
     approve payment of any part or all of an incentive bonus which would
     otherwise be forfeited as a result of a participant terminating employment
     with the Bank prior to the end of the Plan Year.  A participant shall not
     receive any part or all of an incentive bonus in the event of dismissal
     with cause.

10.  SPECIAL LIMITATIONS

     The aggregate incentive bonuses paid under this Plan to the participant
     group shall not exceed 50 percent of the participants' aggregate salaries
     for the year for which the incentive bonuses are paid.

     No incentive bonuses shall be paid for any year in which after tax
     income is less than seven percent of average capital employed for the
     year.

     The above limitations notwithstanding, the Committee may in its
     judgement provide for incentive bonus awards to any individual whose
     performance clearly so warrants.

     No participant in this Plan will be eligible for any other annual bonus
     arrangement.

11.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     An employee's rights and interests under the Plan may not be assigned
     or transferred.  In the case of an employee's death, payment under the
     Plan shall be made to his/her designated beneficiary, or in the absence of
     such designation, by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

     No employee or other person shall have any claim or right to be granted
     an incentive bonus under the Plan.  Neither this Plan nor any action taken
     hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee any right to be
     retained in the employ of the Bank.

     The Bank shall have the right to deduct from all incentive bonuses any
     taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such cash awards.

     The Board of Directors of the Bank may amend, suspend or terminate the
     Plan or any portion thereof at any time.

12.  TERM OF THE PLAN

     The Plan is designed to operate on an annual basis commencing January 1,
     1982.  The Plan Year shall be January 1 through December 31.  No awards
     shall be made under the Plan after December 31, 1987.

                             UNITED JERSEY BANKS

                          DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                          FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS


1.  United Jersey Banks (the "Company") hereby establishes The United Jersey
    Banks Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the benefit of members of
    the Board of Directors of the Company.  A Director may elect to defer
    receipt of all fees payable to the Director by the Company for services
    rendered  as a member of the Board of the Company and Committees thereof,
    following the effective date of such election and prior to revocation of
    the election.  For purposes of the Plan, "Directors Fees" shall mean any
    compensation payable to a Director for services rendered to the Company in
    that capacity, including fees payable for services as a member of any
    Committee of the Board of Directors.

2.  The Comapny shall establish and maintain a book memorandum account
    ("Memorandum Account") which shall be administered by the Chief Financial
    Officer of the Company in the name of each Director who elects to
    participate in the Plan.  Upon a Director's election, pursuant to the
    election provisions of the Plan, to defer receipt of all of his Directors'
    Fees each quarter, the Company shall credit such amounts to the Memorandum
    Account as of the last day of each quarter and shall also credit to the
    Memorandum Account as of the end of each calendar quarter an additional
    amount equal to interest at the rate currently paid by United Jersey Bank
    on IRA and Keogh Accounts, or such other rate as the Board of Directors may
    from time to time determine, compounded quarterly, on the amounts held in
    the Memorandum Account as of the end of the previous calendar quarter.  All
    right, title, and interest in and to all amounts credited to the Memorandum
    Account shall at all times be the sole and absolute property of the Company
    and shall in no event be deemed to constitute a fund or collateral security
    for the payments provided under the applicable Plan provisions.  All
    amounts credited to the Memorandum Account shall for all purposes be a part
    of the general funds of the Company.  To the extent that any Director or his
    designee acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan, such right
    shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the
    Company.  Neither the Director nor his designee shall have any interest in
    any amounts credited to the Memorandum Account, or any right to commute,
    encumber, pledge, sell, assign, or transfer any right to receive payments
    under the Plan, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
    All payments and rights thereto are expressly declared to be
    non-assignable.

3.  An election to defer receipt of Directors' Fees shall be made in writing on
    a form provided for that purpose, and shall become effective upon filing
    with the Secretary of the Company, or such later effective date stated
    thereon.  An election shall remain in effect for each succeeding calendar
    year
<PAGE>   2

        unless the Director amends or terminates his election by a
        notice in writing filed with the Secretary of the Company. Any
        amendment or termination of an election shall be applicable only
        prospectively for Directors' Fees payable for services rendered after
        the effective date of the amendment or termination and shall not affect
        amounts previously credited to the Memorandum Account. A Director may
        not amend or terminate his Memorandum Account with respect to the
        method or time of payment of amounts held in or to be credited to the
        Memorandum Account.

4.      All amounts credited to the Memorandum Account shall be paid to the
        Director, if living, at the time and in the manner specified in his
        initial election filed with the Company. The Director may elect to
        receive all amounts credited to the Memorandum Account in one lump-sum
        or in a specified number of annual installment payments (the amounts of
        which shall equal a fraction of the balance credited to the Memorandum
        Account at the time of such payment, the numerator of such fraction
        being one (1) and the denominator of such fraction being the number of
        unpaid annual installments). The date on which lump-sum payment or the
        initial installment payment shall be made shall be specified in the
        form of an election filed with the Company and shall be determined by
        reference to a Director's age and/or the date on which he ceases to be
        a Director.

5.      In the event that a Director shall die before all amounts credited
        to the Memorandum Account shall have been paid to him, the Company
        shall make payments of the balance of the Memorandum Account in one
        lump-sum to such person or persons as the Director shall designate by
        notice in writing filed with the Company or, in the absence of such
        designation, to the Director's estate. The Director may, from time to
        time, by notice filed with the Company, substitute another or further
        beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive all or a portion of such
        lump-sum payment payable subsequent to his death.

6.      Any amendments or termination of the Plan shall be made at the
        discretion of the Board of Directors. However, any changes made thereto
        will not affect any amount already credited to the Memorandum Account.

                                                             EXHIBIT (10)H.(i)

        THIS AGREEMENT dated April 2, 1981, between UNITED JERSEY BANKS, a New
Jersey Corporation with its office at 90 Nassau Street, Princeton, New Jersey
(UJB) and T. JOSEPH SEMROD, 1700 Bedford, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (Semrod).

        1.    Employment.  UJB hereby agrees to employ Semrod and Semrod hereby
accepts employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

        2.    Position.  Semrod is employed as the president and chief
executive officer of UJB, to perform such services in those capacities as are
usual and customary for a bank holding company of the nature of UJB, as shall
from time to time be established by the Board of Directors of UJB. Semrod shall
devote his full time and attention to the business of UJB, and shall not during
the term of the agreement be engaged in any other business activities. This
paragraph shall not be construed as preventing Semrod from managing any
investments of his which do not require any service on his part in the
operation of the affairs of the entities in which the investments are made, nor
preventing his service on any board of directors, with the prior approval of
the UJB Board of Directors.

        3.    Compensation.  UJB shall pay to Semrod compensation for his
services as follows:

              A.  Salary.  Base salary shall be at the rate of not less than
                  $200,000.00 per annum, in equal bi-weekly installments,
                  beginning on the date of commencement of employment and


<PAGE>   3

            payable on the regular payment dates of UJB.  The base salary
            shall be reviewed periodically to reflect the impact of inflation,
            performance and competitive compensation levels.

        B.  Bonus.  In lieu of any participation in the existing UJB bonus
            plan, at the time incentive bonuses are paid to other employees
            of UJB pursuant to that plan, and in any event no later than March
            1 of the year following the calendar year for which the bonus is
            earned (the year 1981 and each calendar year thereafter being
            considered a bonus year for these purposes), a bonus equal to the
            greater of:

             i)  $25,000.00; or

            ii)  1.5% of UJB income in the bonus year, before securities
                 transactions and extraordinary items, in excess of 
                 $15,000,000.  The increase in income upon which the bonus is
                 calculated shall be based upon the data as set forth in the
                 annual report of UJB; provided however, that the amount of the
                 bonus in any one year shall not exceed $225,000.

        C.  Stock Appreciation Units.  UJB shall issue to Semrod stock
            appreciation units (units)



                                     -2-
<PAGE>   4
            which become available and are exercisable as set forth below.

             i)  For each of the first five years Semrod is employed, as
                 president and chief executive officer, beginning on the
                 first day of his employment and on the anniversary date of his
                 employment thereafter, UJB grants to Semrod 10,000 units, for
                 a maximum of 50,000 units.

            ii)  Each unit shall have a value at conversion equal to the
                 appreciation of one share of UJB common stock as of the
                 date of conversion, valued as the average price per share at
                 the close of trading on the preceeding five trading days of
                 the New York Stock Exchange, over the value of a share of
                 stock as of the date of the issuance of the unit.  The value
                 of the share as of the date of the issuance of the unit shall
                 be the average of the closing quotes on the New York Stock
                 Exchange for each trading day in the 90 days immediately
                 preceeding the April 1 next preceeding the date of issuance.

<PAGE>   5

               Appropriate adjustments shall be made for each stock split,
               reverse split, or stock dividend.

         iii)  Each unit (in minimum multiples of 500 units) may be converted 
               to cash, (payable by UJB within five days after receipt of the
               within notice to it) only during the period from the first day
               of the fourth year after its issuance to the last day of the
               sixth year after its issuance. Any units not converted during
               the specified time shall be automatically cancelled.

          iv)  In the event of termination of the employment of Semrod due to
               his death, disability (as defined in the disability insurance
               program of UJB) or any reason other than for cause or other than
               the voluntary resignation of Semrod, all units held at the time
               of such termination may be converted by Semrod (or his estate or
               personal representative as the case may be), upon five days
               written notice to UJB, at any time from the date of termination
               through the final date on which the unit may have been coverted

                        had Semrod's employment not so terminated.

                    v)  Any units not previously converted to cash shall be
                        automatically cancelled, with no right of conversion
                        then or thereafter, in the event the employment of
                        Semrod is terminated for cause, or upon his voluntary
                        resignation.

                   vi)  In the event that 51% or more of the outstanding common
                        stock of UJB is acquired by a single stockholder or an
                        affiliated group of stockholders as that term is
                        defined by the Federal securities laws, Semrod shall
                        automatically then be entitled to payment as if the
                        entire 50,000 units had been granted to him and this
                        right to payment may be exercised, on five days notice
                        to UJB or its successor, at any time from the date of
                        the acquisition through the final date on which the
                        units could be converted if they had been issued in due
                        course pursuant to subparagraph (i) hereinabove without
                        regard to the fact that the time period specified in
                        subparagraph (iii) hereof has not been reached. In
                        this event, the value of the unit shall be

                        measured by the price then offered by the acquiring
                        stockholder or group of stockholders, or the average 
                        closing quote on the New York Stock Exchange of a 
                        share of UJB common stock for the preceeding five 
                        trading days, whichever is greater; and the value of 
                        a share of UJB stock at the date of issuance for the 
                        newly issued units shall be the average of all values 
                        established pursuant to subparagraph (ii) hereof for 
                        the units previously issued.

        4.    Term.  The term of this Agreement shall be three years, and
shall continue for one year terms from year to year thereafter according to the
terms hereof unless notice of non-renewal is given by one party to the other at
least 120 days prior to the expiration of the original or any renewal term, or
unless employment is earlier terminated by UJB for cause, or due to disability
or death.

        5.    Severance.  In the event that employment is terminated for other
than voluntary resignation, cause, disability or death, during the initial
three year term of this Agreement, Semrod is entitled to receive the salary,
and other benefits exclusive of bonus agreed upon by the parties, which he
would have received if employment had continued for the remainder of the
initial three-year term, to be paid as a lump sum severance payment. Upon the


                                     -6-



<PAGE>   8
mutual agreement of the parties, the severance payment may be paid in
installments. For purposes of this Agreement, "termination for cause" shall mean
termination of employment due to misfeasance, malfeasance, or breach of
fiduciary duty to UJB or its stockholders, as determined by the Board of
Directors of UJB.

        6.    Pension.  At any Normal or Early Retirement Date, as defined in
the UJB Retirement Plan (the Plan) or at any later retirement date provided for
in such plan, at the time of such retirement, and not earlier:

                i)  Semrod shall be entitled to retirement benefits as if he
                    had commenced his employment with United Jersey 
                    Banks as an "Employee", as that term is defined in
                    the Plan, on February 1, 1963.

               ii)  The retirement benefits to which Semrod shall be entitled
                    shall be computed on the basis of the benefit formula set 
                    forth in the Plan, as in effect at the time of retirement,
                    based on a date of commencement of employment as set forth
                    in subparagraph (i) above, subject to such limitations in 
                    the Plan as to maximum Years of Service and ceilings on 
                    the maximum retirement benefit payable, but not subject 
                    to any limitations imposed by the Employee Retirement 
                    Income

                    Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) or its successor or 
                    replacement.

              iii)  As a beneficiary of the Plan, Semrod shall receive from 
                    the Plan as much of his entitled benefits as the Plan
                    may pay, according to its terms and limitations, and within
                    the legal limits of ERISA, to the end that the Plan does
                    not make payments contrary to its terms or in violation of
                    law, or which would jeopardize its tax exemption by
                    discriminating in favor of Semrod.

               iv)  The portion (if any) of the retirement benefits to which 
                    Semrod is entitled which cannot be paid directly from
                    the Plan shall be an unfunded contractual obligation of UJB
                    to Semrod, and shall be paid at the same time and in the
                    same manner as the payments from the Plan, unless Semrod
                    requests and the Plan Administrator approves a different
                    method of payment, so that the aggregate payments from both
                    sources shall total the benefit to which Semrod is
                    entitled.

                v)  With respect to the retirement benefits not payable from 
                    the Plan, Semrod shall have the same options, including
                    but not limited to early retirement and choice of annuity
                    benefits, as are



                                     -8-
<PAGE>   10

                    
                    available to him under the Plan.

               vi)  References to Semrod in this paragraph shall include, where
                    appropriate, his designated beneficiaries under the Plan.

              vii)  All payments pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be in 
                    addition to any payments to which Semrod may be entitled 
                    to pursuant to any prior employment.

        7.    Insurance Benefits.

                i)  Semrod shall be entitled to the same hospital, health, 
                    medical and disability insurance benefits enjoyed by
                    all other senior management employees of UJB.  In the event
                    that a period of employment with UJB is necessary to be
                    eligible for such benefits, and Semrod or any member of his
                    family would be eligible to receive such benefits but for
                    the period of eligibility, then UJB agrees to assume as a
                    contractual liability the payments that would be payable
                    under such insurance programs; provided, however, that if
                    Semrod or any member of his immediate family under such
                    circumstances is eligible to receive benefits through the
                    insurance program of his previous employer, he will first
                    seek to recover such benefits from



                                     -9-
<PAGE>   11
                   that source.

              ii)  Semrod shall be entitled to a life insurance program, in
                   accordance with the program available to all other senior
                   management employees of UJB; provided that the principal
                   amount payable thereunder in the event of death, excluding
                   double indemnity, shall be at least two times base salary.

        8.    Disability.  The parties agree that if Semrod becomes disabled,
as that term is defined for eligibility for long term disability benefits 
under the UJB disability insurance program, UJB may terminate the employment
of Semrod. In such event, in addition to any insurance or other benefits to
which Semrod may then be entitled, Semrod shall be entitled to supplemental
disability benefits as the parties will agree upon within 30 days of the
commencement of employment hereunder, which benefits will be at least equal to
the average of similar benefits established for the chief executive officer of
the five largest New Jersey bank holding companies.

        9.   Relocation Expenses.  To defray in part the expenses to be
incurred by Semrod in relocating to New Jersey, UJB agrees to make payment of:

                i)  $25,000, upon the execution of this agreement;

               ii)  Reimbursement for all reasonable moving

                                      
                                    - 10 -
<PAGE>   12
                     expenses, plus an amount equal to the estimated Federal
                     income tax payable by Semrod on account of receipt of
                     this amount;

               iii)  Reimbursement for the real estate commission payable by
                     Semrod upon the sale of his present home, not to exceed
                     $20,000.00; 

                iv)  Living expenses in New Jersey, and transportation expenses
                     to and from Oklahoma, until Semrod's family is
                     relocated, or until September 1, 1981, whichever first
                     occurs.

                 v)  Transportation expenses for Semrod's wife (2 trips) and
                     children (1 trip) to and from New Jersey.

        10.    Other.  Semrod shall be entitled to reimbursement for all other
business expenses incurred during the term of his employment, to the use of an
automobile, and vacations, in accordance with the practices and procedures of
UJB for other senior management employees.

        11.    Commencement of Employment.  Semrod shall commence employment
hereunder at such date as the parties may mutually select, but not later than
May 1, 1980.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, United Jersey Banks has caused this Agreement to be
signed by its duly authorized representative pursuant to the authority of its
Board of Directors, and T.

                                      to

          Agreement dated April 2, 1981 between UNITED JERSEY BANKS

                             and T. JOSEPH SEMROD


        A.     The introductory subparagraph of Paragraph 6 is restated in full
to read as follows:

                "6.   Pension.  At any Normal or Early Retirement Date,
        as defined in the UJB Retirement Plan (the Plan) or at any later
        retirement date provided for in such plan, at the time of such 
        retirement, and not earlier, provided that Semrod is then employed 
        by UJB or receiving benefits under UJB's disability plans."

        B.      Paragraph 8 is hereby amended by deleting the second sentence,
the parties having agreed that UJB's current disability benefits are comparable
to those available to the chief executive officers of the other largest New
Jersey bank holding companies.

        C.      Paragraph 11 is amended by deleting "May 1, 1980" and inserting
therefor "May 1, 1981."

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment No.
1 this 5th day of May, 1981.

                               Amendment No. 2

                                      to

          Agreement dated April 2, 1981 between UNITED JERSEY BANKS

                    and T. JOSEPH SEMROD (the "Agreement")



        WHEREAS, Semrod has surrendered the 10,000 stock appreciation units
granted to him on April 20, 1981 and the 10,000 stock appreciation units
granted to him on April 20, 1982; and

        WHEREAS, it is necessary to amend Paragraph 3(C)(vi) to provide for the
value of a share of UJB stock at the date of issuance for units which may be
newly issued as a result of the events referred to in Paragraph 3(C)(vi) in the
event that units have been surrendered or not issued as contemplated by the
original Agreement;

        NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

                Paragraph 3(C)(vi) is amended to read in full as follows:

                vi)   In the event that 51% or more of the 
                      outstanding common stock of UJB is 
                      acquired by a single stockholder
                      or an affiliated group of stockholders, 
                      as that term is defined by the Federal 
                      securities laws, Semrod shall automatically 
                      then be entitled to payment as


<PAGE>   3
                      if all units granted and not surrendered and all units
                      remaining to be granted to him under this Agreement had
                      been granted to him and were immediately convertible to
                      cash, not withstanding the provisions of subparagraph
                      (iii) above, and this right to payment may be exercised,
                      on five days notice to UJB or its successor, at any time
                      from the date of the acquisition through the final date
                      on which the units could be converted if they had been
                      issued in due course pursuant to subparagraph (i)
                      hereinabove without regard to the fact that the minimum
                      time period specified in subparagraph (iii) hereof has
                      not been reached.  In this event, the value of the unit
                      shall be measured by the price then offered by the
                      acquiring stockholder or group of stockholders, or the
                      average closing quote on the New York Stock Exchange of a
                      share of UJB common stock for the preceding five trading
                      days, whichever is greater; and the value of a share of
                      UJB stock at the date of issuance for

<PAGE>   4
                      the newly issued units shall be the average of all
                      values established pursuant to subparagraph (ii) hereof
                      for the units which have been or would have been
                      previously issued under the terms of the original
                      Agreement, notwithstanding that units may have been
                      surrendered or not issued.

     

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment
No. 2 this 15th day of December, 1982.

                          (dated February 17, 1982)



                                   RECITALS

        WHEREAS, on February 17, 1982, the Board of Directors of United Jersey
Banks adopted the United Jersey Banks 1982 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan");

        WHEREAS, the shareholders of United Jersey Banks approved the Plan on

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of United Jersey Banks desires to amend
the Plan in accordance with Article XIX thereof;

        NOW, THEREFORE, effective June 16, 1984, the United Jersey Banks 1982
Stock Option Plan is hereby amended as follows:

        1.      Article XII, TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, is hereby amended by
inserting after the third full paragraph of said Article XII, so as to
constitute the fourth full paragraph of said Article XII, the following:

                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XII, if the
        employment of any employee with the Company and all subsidiary and
        parent corporations is terminated, whether voluntarily or
        involuntarily, following a change in control of the Company (as defined
        in Article XIII) and while such employee is entitled to exercise an
        Option or Right as herein provided, other than a termination of such
        employment by the employer for cause, such employee shall have the
        right to exercise all or any portion of such Option or Right at any
        time up to and including three (3) months after the date of such
        termination of employment, at which time such Option or Right shall
        cease to be exercisable.

        2.      The second paragraph of Article XIII, ADJUSTMENT OF SHARES,
EFFECT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, is hereby amended and restated in its entirety

                In the event of a change in control of the Company all then
        outstanding Options and Rights shall immediately become exercisable. 
        For purposes of the Plan, a "change in control" of the Company occurs
        if: (a) any "person" (including as such term is used in Sections 13(d)

                                     FOR
           PARTICIPANTS IN THE UNITED JERSEY BANKS RETIREMENT PLAN



                                   PREAMBLE



        WHEREAS, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA")
requires that limits be set on the maximum benefits which may be paid from a
tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan to a participant in such a plan; and

        WHEREAS, as required by ERISA, the United Jersey Banks Retirement Plan
(the "Basic Plan") has been amended to impose a maximum benefit provision;

        NOW, THEREFORE, United Jersey Banks adopts the Retirement Restoration
Plan ("Plan") for employees who participate in the Basic Plan ("the
Participants") for the purpose of providing for the payment to each Participant
and Beneficiary of that part of any pension or pension-related benefit which
cannot be paid under the Basic Plan because of the benefit restrictions imposed
by ERISA.



<PAGE>   3
                                   THE PLAN


1.      Eligibility

        All Participants and Beneficiaries whose retirement income benefits are
limited, directly or indirectly, by the provisions of Article IV, Section 8 of
the Basic Plan, as amended from time to time by resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors, shall receive benefits pursuant to this Plan.  In no event
shall a Participant or Beneficiary who is not entitled to benefits under the
Basic Plan be eligible for, or receive, a benefit under this Plan.

2.      Amount of Benefit

        The benefits which the Corporation shall pay to a Participant or such
Participant's beneficiaries under this Plan shall equal the excess, if any, of
(a) over (b) where;

(a)     is the benefit which would have been paid to such Participant or on
        the Participant's behalf to his or her Beneficiaries under the Basic
        Plan, if the provisions of the Basic Plan were administered without
        regard to the special benefit limitations set forth in Article IV,
        Section 8 of the Basic Plan; and

(b)     is the limited benefit which is payable to such Participant or, on the
        Participant's behalf, to his or her Beneficiaries under (i) the Basic
        Plan and (ii) any contract or agreement between the Participant and the


<PAGE>   4
        Corporation or other participating employer in the Basic Plan
        which provides for a supplementary benefit to the limited benefit
        payable under the Basic Plan and does not by its specific terms
        (whether executed prior or subsequent to the adoption of this Plan)
        state that the Participant or his or her Beneficiaries shall be
        entitled to the benefits payable under this Plan in addition to the
        benefits payable under such contract.

3.      Form and Timing of Benefits

        Payments of benefits under this Plan shall be coincident in time and
form with the payment of the limited benefit payments made to, or on behalf of,
a Participant or Beneficiary under the Basic Plan, unless otherwise determined
by the Corporation.  Any benefit payments under this plan shall be net of any
applicable withholding under federal or state law.

4.      Vesting

        Subject to the right of the Corporation to discontinue the Plan, as
provided in Section 8, a Participant shall have a nonforfeitable interest in
benefits payable under the Plan to the same extent as the Participant has a
"Vested Right" under Article I, Section 15 of the Basic Plan.  Amounts
otherwise vested, however, shall be forfeited to the extent that a Participant
engages in activity resulting in a detriment to the Corporation, as determined
by the Corporation, whether before or after the Participant's retirement.

<PAGE>   5
5.      Funding

        Benefits under this Plan shall be paid from the general assets of the
Corporation and other participating employers in the Basic Plan.  This Plan
shall be administered as an unfunded plan which is not intended to meet the
qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code.  No
Participant or Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive any payment for
benefits under this Plan from the qualified Trust maintained for the Basic
Plan.

6.      Operation and Administration

        This Plan shall be operated under the direction of the Board of
Directors and administered by the Benefits Committee in a manner consistent
with the operation and administration of the Basic Plan as set forth in Article
X of the Basic Plan.  The Benefits Committee's decision in any matter involving
the interpretation and application of this Plan shall be final and binding.

7.      Definitions

        All terms under this Plan shall have the same meaning as those terms
used in the Basic Plan.

8.      Amendment and Discontinuance/State Laws

        The Corporation expects to continue this Plan indefinitely but reserves
the right to amend or discontinue it if, in its sole judgment, such a change is
deemed necessary or desirable.  The interpretation of this Plan shall be
pursuant to the laws of the State of New Jersey.

                     RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
                                      OF
                             UJB FINANCIAL CORP.
                         Meeting of October 18, 1989

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN
                                     FOR
           PARTICIPANTS IN THE UJB FINANCIAL CORP. RETIREMENT PLAN



        WHEREAS, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code")
requires with respect to tax-qualified pension plans (i) that annual benefit
payments by such plans to any participant not exceed 60% of that participant's
average annual base salary (the "60% limitation") and (ii) that annual salary
of any participant in excess of $200,000 be excluded from the calculations of
that participant's average annual base salary (the "salary limitation"); and

        WHEREAS, the UJB Financial Corp. Retirement Plan (the "Basic Plan")
conforms to above-described requirements of the Code; and

        WHEREAS, the Corporation's Retirement Restoration Plan restores to
participants in the Basic Plan benefits not payable because of the 60%
limitation but does not restore benefits not payable because of the salary
limitation; and

        WHEREAS, the Corporation desires to provide participants in the Basic
Plan with the full benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the
Basic Plan without regard to the 60% limitation or the salary limitation (the
"full benefits"); and

        WHEREAS, counsel has advised the Corporation to adopt a Supplemental
Retirement Plan, rather than amend the Corporation's Retirement Restoration
Plan, to so provide full benefits to participants in the Basic Plan;

        NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT:

        RESOLVED, that the Corporation hereby adopts the Supplemental
Retirement Plan in the form presented to this meeting and attached hereto (the
"Plan") for employees who participate in the Basic Plan (the "Participants")
for the purpose of providing Participants and their beneficiaries with pension
or pension-related benefits which otherwise could not be paid to them under the
Basic Plan because of the above-described salary limitation.

benefits under the Basic Plan be eligible for, or receive, a benefit under
this Plan.

2.      Amount of Benefit

                The benefits which the Corporation shall pay to a Participant

                        such Participant or on the Participant's behalf to his
                        or her beneficiaries under the Basic Plan, if the
                        provisions of the Basic Plan were administered
                        without regard to the special limitations set forth
                        in Code Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) (or any successor
                        provisions); and

                (b)     is the total limited benefit which is payable to
                        such Participant or, on the Participant's behalf,
                        to his or her beneficiaries under (i) the Basic

                Participants in the United Jersey Banks
                Retirement Plan ("Restoration Plan") and (iii) any 
                contract or agreement between the Participant
                and the Corporation or other participating
                employer in the Basic Plan which provides for a
                supplementary benefit to the limited benefit
                payable under the Basic Plan and does not by its
                specific terms (whether executed prior or
                subsequent to the adoption of this Plan or the
                Restoration Plan) state that the Participant or
                his or her beneficiaries shall be entitled to the
                benefits payable under this Plan or the
                Restoration Plan in addition to the benefits
                payable under such contract.

3.      Form and Timing of Benefits

                Payments of benefits under this Plan shall be
coincident in time and form with the payment of the limited
benefit payments made to, or on behalf of, a Participant or
beneficiary under the Basic Plan, unless otherwise determined
by the Corporation.  Any benefit payments under this Plan shall
be net of any applicable withholding under federal or state law.

4.      Vesting

                Subject to the right of the Corporation to discontinue the
Plan, as provided in Section 8, a Participant shall have a nonforfeitable

No Participant or beneficiary shall be entitled to receive any payment for
benefits under this Plan from the qualified Trust maintained for the Basic
Plan.

                WORKING THROUGH OUR FOUR CORE BUSINESS LINES --
                      COMMERCIAL BANKING, RETAIL BANKING,
                 MORTGAGE BANKING AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT --
                      WE HAVE STREAMLINED THE COMPANY FOR
               COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND INCREASED PROFITABILITY.
                   ... OUR ENTIRE ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON
                               CUSTOMER SERVICE.



CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

This past year was one of progress and one of challenge. Our earnings increased
for the fourth consecutive year. A strengthened regional economy helped us
achieve significant loan growth. Non-performing loans declined to their lowest
level in six years. The restructuring of the company along core lines of
business was completed, as well as the consolidation of our member banks into
United Jersey Bank in New Jersey and First Valley Bank in eastern Pennsylvania.

Working through our four core business lines - commercial banking, retail
banking, mortgage banking and investment management - we have streamlined the
company for competitive advantage and increased profitability. Simultaneously,
our entire organization is focused on customer service, and each business unit
has developed specific service quality goals. A new partnership has been created
between our operations center and the business lines which is certain to
increase productivity.

With the new structure comes a redefined mission: our objectives are to
reinforce our position as a market leader in financial services and deliver
long-term shareholder value.

Along with setting new financial goals, we have also set a goal to achieve total
customer satisfaction. We want to make customer service our ultimate focus - to
make our customers the reason for everything that we do. We believe that every
decision we make and every technological investment should be to benefit or
serve customers. You will be reading more of our thoughts on this subject in the
UJB Financial: Progress Report section.

DIVIDEND RAISED As a result of UJB Financial's continued earnings improvement,
the common stock dividend was increased 11.5 percent in February 1995 to $.29
per share, with an annual dividend rate of $1.16 per share. Since March 1993,
the dividend has been raised a total of 81.3 percent. This reflects the Board of
Directors' continued confidence in our progress.

THREE ACQUISITIONS As part of our strategy to expand market share and maximize
the value of our franchise, during 1994 we acquired VSB Bancorp, Inc., parent of
Valley Savings Bank, and Palisade Savings Bank, FSB which had combined assets of
over $700 million. The VSB Bancorp merger was completed in July 1994. Their
branches have

further enhanced our strong presence in affluent Bergen County. Palisade Savings
Bank with branches in both Bergen and Hudson counties was acquired in September
1994.

Our acquisition activity continued into 1995 when in January we entered into a
definitive merger agreement with Bancorp New Jersey, Inc., parent of New Jersey
Savings Bank, with $480 million in assets. Their retail offices are in Somerset,
Hunterdon and Mercer counties. The addition of Bancorp will move us into second
place for market share in Somerset County, which ranked fifth in the nation in
the latest per capita income rankings by county. We will also gain access to
Hunterdon County.

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Net income for 1994 was $130.2 million, or $2.35 per common
share, a 57.9 percent increase over 1993. Increased net interest income, lower
non-interest expenses, and a reduction in non-performing loans contributed to
our improved performance.

To further accelerate the resolution of non-performing loans and other real
estate owned (OREO), we identified certain assets with a net realizable value of
$90.9 million at December 31, 1994 for potential sale in bulk transactions. An
additional provision for loan losses of $10 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1994 in connection with this transaction. At December 31, 1994,
non-performing loans declined 34.1 percent from a year ago, and OREO 57.9
percent.

The execution of our new line of business strategies will keep us competitive
and allow our organization to achieve a solid financial performance while
further improving customer service. We are making progress, however, there is
still much to be done.

FINANCIAL GOALS When we announced the restructuring in September 1993, we set
new financial goals for the company: a return on assets (ROA) of 1.20 percent, a
return on common equity (ROE) of over 15 percent, and a 59 percent efficiency
ratio, all by the fourth quarter of 1995.

                                                                               5

                       UJB FINANCIAL HAS EMERGED FROM THE
                   RESTRUCTURING AND CONSOLIDATION AS A MUCH
                     STRONGER COMPANY AND A MAJOR REGIONAL
                   FORCE IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.
                      OUR BUSINESS LINES ARE POSITIONED TO
                      BENEFIT FROM THE IMPROVING REGIONAL
                    ECONOMY. WE HAVE SHARPENED OUR FOCUS ON
                         EFFICIENCY AND PROFITABILITY.


For the fourth quarter of 1994, our ROA was .89 percent, and ROE was 12.57
percent. If you exclude the additional provision for loan losses recorded for
the bulk sale, ROA would have been 1.04 percent, and ROE 14.77 percent. This
core performance shows that we are on the way to our stated goals.

The efficiency ratio for 1994 improved to 60.4 percent, excluding OREO and
restructuring expenses. The efficiency ratio is a measure of productivity. We
compare very favorably against our bank peer group average of 62.4 percent.

LOAN GROWTH Substantial loan growth in 1994 played an important part in our
improved performance. Total loans at December 31, 1994 were $9.7 billion, a 10.4
percent increase from the prior year. With help from strong growth in commercial
and municipal accounts, demand deposits climbed 16.2 percent to $3.3 billion at
year end. Total deposits reached $12.6 billion, a 6.9 percent increase over the
prior year.

In April 1994, it was my pleasure to welcome Anne Evans Estabrook to the Board
of Directors. Mrs. Estabrook is the owner of Elberon Development Co., a real
estate company. She is also president of David O. Evans, Inc., a real estate
management and construction firm. Her expertise in property management and
previous experience as a bank director should prove invaluable to our company.

UJB Financial has emerged from the restructuring and consolidation as a much
stronger company and a major regional force in the financial services industry.
Our business lines are positioned to benefit from the improving regional
economy. We have sharpened our focus on efficiency and profitability.

At UJB Financial, we remain committed to maximizing shareholder value and
maintaining long-term earnings growth. Your support of our ongoing endeavors is
appreciated.

                           OUR STRONG LOAN GROWTH IN
                         1994 -- THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT
                            INCREASE IN LOAN VOLUME

                               WAY WE MANAGED THE

                               FLOWS TO FUND THIS
                                  LOAN GROWTH.

                                JOHN G. COLLINS
                                 Vice Chairman


Q. HAS THE RESTRUCTURING MET MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS?

     SEMROD Yes, all in all, we're quite pleased. We established visible
financial goals for the company, and at the same time we set some ambitious
customer service expectations. We are also putting together some very, very
aggressive business development goals for our business lines. We fully expect to
meet these goals -- financial and otherwise. I think that we are starting to
show some real positive results.

     COLLINS There were some areas of real challenge when we began the
restructuring. We wanted to get closer to the customer, stay current on
technology, and be sure that we had appropriate levels of customer service. Of
course, we also wanted to keep our financial house in order. When you consider
all those challenges, we are proud of the progress that we have made.

Q. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE RESTRUCTURING IN 1993, WE ESTABLISHED NEW FINANCIAL
GOALS FOR THE COMPANY. THEY ARE A RETURN ON ASSETS OF 1.2 PERCENT, A RETURN ON
COMMON EQUITY OF OVER 15 PERCENT, AND AN EFFICIENCY RATIO OF 59 PERCENT ALL BY
THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1995. HOW ARE WE DOING?

     HAGGERTY We continue to make steady progress in reaching these goals.  For
example,  in 1993 our efficiency  ratio was 64.4 percent. In 1994, it improved
to 60.4 percent.

     Return on average assets rose to .88 percent during 1994, compared to .59
percent for 1993. Finally, return on common equity moved up to 12.36 percent in
1994, from 8.32 percent in 1993.

Q. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR RESTRUCTURING WAS THE CREATION OF A CENTRALIZED
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP. WHAT BENEFITS HAS THIS PROVIDED?

     HOWELL The creation of a centralized credit risk management group has
provided uniformity and consistency throughout our company in credit
administration and loan approvals. This group is dedicated to ensuring our
commitment to a balanced and disciplined approach to the credit process. Our
credit culture promotes a consistent methodology for generating quality assets
within realistic growth and profitability objectives. This strategy fosters an
enhanced and proactive response to customers and prospects.

     We have redesigned our monitoring tools to sustain quality within the
portfolio. These tools help us to better assess situations that we should
improve or exit.

     The consolidation has created a uniformity in the language throughout the
company. It has enhanced training and created a total awareness of important
issues such as credit concentration. All of these efforts strengthen our ability
to achieve our business objectives while assuring the risk quotient is
appropriate.

Q. OUR NET INCOME FOR 1994 WAS $130.2 MILLION, A 58 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 1993.
TO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS GROWTH?

                                 Vice Chairman


     HAGGERTY Many areas of the company contributed to our 1994 earnings
performance, in addition to the improvement in our region's economy. The economy
helped us in two ways. First, we experienced significant loan growth, which from
year-end 1993 to year-end 1994 rose over $900 million, or 10.4 percent.

     Second, real estate values stabilized which enabled us to resolve problem
loans and reduce non-performing loans and other real estate owned (OREO). Our
credit quality costs, including the provision for loan losses and OREO expenses,
declined $34 million from a year ago.

     To further accelerate the resolution of non-performing loans and OREO,
certain assets were identified for potential sale in bulk transactions. These
assets had a net realizable value of $90.9 million at December 31, 1994. They
were construction and commercial real estate loans, both non-accruing and
accruing, and OREO properties. An additional provision for loan losses of $10
million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994 in conjunction with this
transaction. The sale will enable us to take non-productive dollars and reinvest
them into assets that will have a positive effect on earnings.

Q. WE HAVE ALL READ ABOUT LARGE BANKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT ARE CLOSING
BRANCHES TO REDUCE EXPENSES. WHAT HAS UJB FINANCIAL ALREADY DONE IN THIS REGARD
AND WHAT ARE THE FUTURE PLANS FOR OUR BRANCH NETWORK?

     MACKOUL Over the last six years, we have closed or consolidated 39
branches. During 1995, we plan to consolidate an additional seven offices, which
include four of the Palisade Savings branches. So, in six years we've pruned
about 18 percent of our facilities.

Q. IN THE RESTRUCTURING, WE COMBINED PRIVATE BANKING AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.
BOTH OF THESE PLUS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES REPORT TO THE SAME LINE OF BUSINESS
HEAD.  WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESULT?

     O'GORMAN I think that our greatest accomplishment here is that we've
substantially improved the referral process. For example, in the mortgage area
prior to the consolidation, applications were not referred elsewhere in the bank
for cross-selling opportunities. Now, all mortgages over $250,000 are
automatically sent to the private banking department to see if this individual
qualifies as a private banking or investment management client. Cross-selling is
our philosophy and that has substantially accelerated the interaction between
our divisions.

Q. WE HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH OUR GLOBAL ACCESS CHECK CARD. ARE THERE ANY
NEW FEATURES OR BENEFITS IN STORE FOR THIS DEBIT CARD?

     MACKOUL Our Global Access VISA check card can now be used at the teller
line the same way it is used at an automated teller machine (ATM). That is,
customers can withdraw money without writing a check, simply by giving

                                                                              11

the card to the teller and entering their personal identification number (PIN)
into a PIN pad at the teller counter. Customers can also transfer funds between
accounts and make deposits without a deposit ticket. The customers are reducing
the number of checks they have to write each month, and reducing the expense of
reordering checks.

      During the first quarter of 1995, we were the first bank in the country to
introduce the United Jersey/First Valley Bank Global Access Business check card
to small businesses. This VISA check card can be used by small business owners
to make purchases anywhere that VISA, MAC and NYCE are accepted. They can also
withdraw cash from any participating ATM, and can even use it to pay for travel
and entertainment.

Q. OUR INTERNAL CONSOLIDATIONS HAVE FURTHER STRENGTHENED THE TIES BETWEEN OUR
NEW JERSEY AND EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA OPERATIONS. HAS THE CONSOLIDATION ALSO
ENHANCED OUR ABILITY TO GARNER MORE BUSINESS FROM THE EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
MARKET?

     HOWELL Definitely. From the commercial side of our business, reorganization
and structural changes have allowed us to have one management team focus across
both New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. This has permitted an increased and
consistent calling presence in the Philadelphia marketplace. With higher lending
limits, we now have the opportunity to work with customers on the upper end of
the middle market. Also, by coordinating our advertising and marketing efforts,
our business development program is more efficient and effective. This is
particularly evident in the small business and retail areas where our community
branches are enjoying record levels of growth.

Q. DURING 1994, UJB FINANCIAL SHOWED AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL LOAN GROWTH. WHAT
AREAS HAD THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND WHAT WILL BE THE KEY EMERGING GROWTH
MARKETS GOING FORWARD?

     PANEYKO During 1994, we saw significant growth in middle market lending,
national accounts and asset based lending. We continue to be the largest asset
based lending institution in New Jersey, and going forward will capitalize on
our expertise.

     In the Northeast, we are continually in contact with institutions who have
credit strategies and capabilities similar to ours to do loan participations. As
1995 unfolds, you'll see us developing a common marketing name for our asset
based lending related activities. In 1994, this was a profitable way to increase
assets, and we expect it to continue into the future.

     In addition, import/export trade finance credit related business continues
to have a lot of potential for UJB Financial. Our investments in technology such
as our automated letters of credit, as well as our highly trained staff,
position us to take advantage of two of the more significant ports in the United
States -- Port Elizabeth and Philadelphia.

     United Jersey Bank is also the recognized leader in serving the premier
hospitals in New Jersey, and we work with numerous doctor partnerships. We have
the capability to meet the needs of the rapidly changing medical industry.

Q. THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT DIVISION IS USING THE RELATIONSHIP MANAGER/TEAM
APPROACH. WHAT SPECIFICALLY DOES THIS MEAN?

     O'GORMAN In the private  bank area,  each of our  clients is  assigned a
relationship  manager who acts as the single point of contact with that
customer. As no one individual can possess all skills, we've created a
relationship team centered around that manager. The entire team will work on the
client's behalf. The customer talks to one individual for service of all
financial needs such as insurance, brokerage, investment advice and mortgage.

Q. HOW HAS THE CONSOLIDATION CHANGED THE ORGANIZATION OF UJB FINANCIAL SERVICE
CORPORATION?

     POSENCHEG The Service Corporation has restructured itself to be more
responsive to the lines of business. Our system development efforts, as well as
our operational support areas, are aligned with wholesale, retail, mortgage and
investment management/private banking. In reality, the lines of business are our
customers. In fact, we try to deal with them as if they have an alternative and
can go elsewhere for service if we don't perform up to their expectations. As a
result, the company is assured a far greater return on its investment in
technology.


     COLLINS The organizational change has made the Service Corporation sharpen
its customer focus. Now everything is measured and analyzed to be sure that the
business lines are being served. A partnership has been created between the
Service Corporation and the business lines. This can't help but produce positive
results.

Q. WHAT SPECIFICALLY WILL THE SERVICE CORPORATION BE DOING DURING 1995 TO HELP
THE BUSINESS LINES REACH THEIR FINANCIAL GOALS?

     POSENCHEG Supporting consolidations has been a high priority for the
Service Corporation for the last four years. These activities have increased our
ability to serve the entire organization and have driven down the company's
overall operation and technology costs. In 1995, we will use our technology
initiatives to further lower line of business expenses. For example, working
closely with the business lines, we are addressing the origination function for
various lending areas including instalment, small business, mortgage and
commercial to reduce operating costs. Simultaneously, we will be increasing
revenues and improving service to our customers.

Q. HAS THE RESTRUCTURING ACTUALLY CHANGED THE OPERATIONS OF THE FINANCE
DEPARTMENT?

     HAGGERTY Very much so. The  restructuring  has caused us to  consolidate
the reporting  units and focus on supporting the lines of business. Accordingly,
we are designing and building a line of business accounting system. This is a
major

                                                                             15

our staff. There is excitement for this project, and it is progressing very
well. Once completed, we will be able to report by business segment and provide
product profitability.

Q. WHAT IS THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR THE CORE BUSINESSES?

      SEMROD We must continue to strive for superior customer service. Every
strategy of the lines of business must start by embodying that important
principle. The restructuring has allowed us to give one senior executive
singular responsibility for everything that affects the customer in that line of
business. For example, all of our senior executives are making more customer
calls whether in retail, wholesale, investment management or private banking.

      Right now, all of our business lines are doing a great job of
cross-selling within their own areas. But, I want to see us do a better job in
cross-selling across lines of business. There are tremendous opportunities here.

Q. HOW HAVE OUR CUSTOMERS BENEFITED FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE MEMBER BANKS?

     HOWELL The most obvious benefit is that our customers now have access to
the entire branch network in their state. United Jersey Bank clients can do
business with any one of the 197 community offices throughout New Jersey.
Pennsylvanians have available the entire 73 branch system stretching from
Wilkes-Barre to the Philadelphia suburbs and to Lancaster.

     The consolidation has resulted in each of the two banks having higher
lending limits and has provided the opportunity to standardize and expand
product lines. We have taken advantage of new technology by installing a
state-of-the-art branch automation system throughout the entire network. This
translates to better service at less cost to the customer.

     The unified approach to product and marketing, combined with our new
technology, has provided benefits which we have just begun to tap.

Q. WHAT IS UJB FINANCIAL DOING IN RETAIL BANKING TO FURTHER IMPROVE SERVICE TO 
OUR CUSTOMERS?

     MACKOUL To achieve excellence, we first had to know the consumer's
definition of superior customer service. We had a customer satisfaction survey
done which showed that consumers want a bank to concentrate on timely service,
demonstrate a sincere interest in resolving problems, be as helpful as possible
when providing service and be courteous. As a result of the survey, we are now
expanding our training programs to focus on these quality issues.

     But, that's not all. We will be automating our instalment loan origination
department in the second quarter of 1995 which will result in faster loan
approvals. We'll continue to enhance our branch automation system at both the
teller window and the platform areas. We will be expanding our Customer Call
Center which experienced a fifty percent

growth in call volume in 1994. In fact, in 1995 we expect six million calls to
go to the Center. That's very significant because it frees up branch staff to
cross-sell products and services.

Q. IN OUR MARKETPLACE, AS COMPETITION FROM BANKS AND NON-BANKS BECOMES MORE
INTENSE IN PROVIDING CREDIT AND NON-CREDIT PRODUCTS, HOW WILL WE DIFFERENTIATE
OURSELVES FROM THE COMPETITION?

     PANEYKO On the commercial side as well as the retail, we'll differentiate
ourselves from the competition by understanding customer needs, rapid response,
quick resolution of problems, providing industry expertise, and being perceived
as a strategic business partner. These concepts are part of every relationship
manager's credo.

Q. WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED IN MANAGING THE COMPANY'S  INVESTMENT  
SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, AND ARE DERIVATIVES USED IN ANY WAY?

     COLLINS During 1994, we experienced the first significant increase in loan
volume since 1990. From 1990 until early 1994, excess funds generated from
deposits were placed in the investment portfolio, which grew on average from
$3.0 billion in 1990 to $3.9 billion in 1993. We concentrated on using the
investment portfolio as a primary source of interest income and maintaining net
interest margin. Our strong loan growth in 1994 changed the way we managed the
investment portfolio, as we redirected investment maturities and other cash
flows to fund this loan growth.

     The stronger economic conditions during 1994 also produced a rising
interest rate environment, as the Federal Reserve moved interest rates upward to
restrain perceived inflationary pressures. The shift in the asset mix to the
higher yielding loan portfolio, combined with this interest rate scenario,
resulted in increased net interest income in 1994.

     At year end, we had derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps with a
notional value of $923.5 million, or 6 percent of assets, which were accounted
for as hedges. These instruments are used primarily as part of our
asset/liability management process. In 1994, hedged transactions reduced net
interest income by $1.2 million, or less than one percent.

Q. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR REVENUE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM IN 1989, OVER $33
MILLION IN EMPLOYEE SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AFTER FIVE YEARS, HAS
THIS PROGRAM LOST ITS MOMENTUM?

     HAGGERTY Not at all. In 1994, we received 600 ideas from our employees. We
were able to implement 180 of them, which contributed $7.2 million annually to
our bottom line. Others will be implemented in 1995. We continue to receive
about 50 suggestions a month, and experience a 40 percent acceptance rate. Many
are directed towards improving processes and enhancing productivity. For
example, one of the best 1994 ideas was to create a more efficient process in
the asset based lending audit function using lap top computers. That one idea
generated

$300,000 in annual savings. As you can see, there is still potential left in
this program, and we'll continue to realize the benefits.

Q. NON-CREDIT FEE INCOME IS AN INCREASINGLY  IMPORTANT ASPECT OF A BANK'S
EARNINGS.  HOW WILL COMMERCIAL BANKING CONTRIBUTE TO THIS INCOME CATEGORY?

     PANEYKO For the last five years, non-credit fee income for commercial
banking has shown a compounded growth rate of 13 percent a year. By continually
introducing new products, we have supplemented our fee income base. One example
is StatLink, an electronic medical claims processing system that is used by
doctors and hospitals. We have the exclusive right as a financial organization
to offer this product in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

     We are also the only commercial bank in the country that has been selected
by Merrill Lynch to go into a joint venture whereby UJB Financial originates
commercial mortgages for sale and retains the servicing for a fee. This will
also introduce opportunities to expand our fee based business.

Q. UJB  FINANCIAL IS ALREADY A MAJOR FORCE IN THE  ORIGINATION  OF HOME  
MORTGAGES  AND IN MORTGAGE  LOAN  SERVICING.  WITH RISING INTEREST RATES, WAS 
THERE A DECLINE IN THE MORTGAGE AREA IN 1994?

      O'GORMAN No, due to our early reaction in anticipation of changing rates,
we proactively and aggressively sold our adjustable rate mortgage products as
opposed to traditional 30-year fixed rate loans. As a result, we actually
experienced an increase in 1994.

      When you look at the current market, there is now much less difference in
rates between the two products, so you might actually see fixed rate mortgages
becoming popular again in 1995.

Q. WHAT IS OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR 1995? WHERE WOULD WE CONSIDER EXPANDING?

     Collins Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain interested in
expanding our existing markets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. For example, the
Bancorp New Jersey acquisition will greatly enhance our presence in Somerset
County and gain us entry into Hunterdon County. There are additional
opportunities that might be available in New York State in markets that are
close to our strong Bergen County branch network. We are also looking at
Connecticut and Delaware. In addition, we're exploring smaller non-bank
financial organizations that would aid our business lines and increase fee
income.

     We are looking for ways to expand our franchise that do not create dilution
or significantly impact our return on equity and return on assets.

Q. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THE COMPANY'S FUTURE?

     SEMROD First of all, we aren't just a bank anymore. We are truly a
financial services company. A lot of our income comes from areas other than what
used to be known as traditional banking. I really believe that in the region we
serve, we have an opportunity with our lines of business to become the premier
financial services provider. In many areas, we are already the best.

----------------------
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT
----------------------

AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY

Community outreach has taken on new and exciting dimensions at UJB Financial.
Partnerships with community groups, state and local government agencies and
community leaders have always been an important element in accomplishing
community development goals. Today, internal partnerships among divisions and
business lines are also enriching community development efforts.

     The Community Development group's new structure, with distinct community
outreach and data analysis functions, allows it to interface more effectively
throughout the company. It has also led to strong ties with small business
banking and the minority lending group. In addition, all branch managers have
been charged with furthering the banks' community reinvestment commitments.

     The reshaping of the community development effort has already had a
positive impact on the banks' ability to assist low and moderate income
communities. Community reinvestment lending commitments reached $394 million in
1994, a 14 percent increase over 1993. The 1994 figure was boosted by a $53
million rise in residential mortgage loans, partly due to unusually low interest
rates early in the year, but sustained by enthusiastic support from our mortgage
division and branch personnel.

     Community reinvestment has become an integral part of this organization,
and UJB Financial has provided leadership in helping breathe new life into its
communities. Here are a few examples:

     In March of 1994, United Jersey Bank organized New Jersey's first
Affordable Housing Forum, gathering lenders from more than 30 institutions and
representatives from 15 affordable housing programs to discuss opportunities for
financing redevelopment of declining neighborhoods. The bank also financed a New
Jersey Citizen Action Mortgage Loan Counseling Office in Trenton. We also closed
a $100,000 loan to the New Jersey Community Loan Fund, making United Jersey one
of the fund's largest investors.

     United Jersey also instituted the Mercer Partners Breakfasts, a series of
working sessions with members of the Mercer County Black Business Association. A
similar series of meetings was held to encourage and support black
entrepreneurship with members of the Monmouth/Ocean  Investment Corp. and the
Central and Southern New Jersey Chapters of the National Business League.

     In Pennsylvania during the fourth quarter, First Valley Bank issued a
$100,000 investment challenge to small investors of the Delaware Valley
Community Reinvestment Fund (DVCRF). By December 31, DVCRF, which has been
nationally acclaimed for its work in low and moderate income communities, had
attracted 73 new investments totaling $338,000.

     First Valley was also an active participant in the Lehigh Valley Mortgage
Plan (LVMP), which offers its members the opportunity to consider mortgage
applications from low and moderate income borrowers that are slated for
rejection by another lender. Thanks to LVMP intervention, ten percent of the
reconsidered loans were closed.

     Early in 1994, UJB Financial began using the name "Partners in PRIDE"* to
describe the community reinvestment and related activities of its member banks.
UJB Financial is indeed proud of the many individuals from all corners of the
organization who have contributed to the success and continued growth of its
community development programs.

1994 FINANCIAL REVIEW

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Financial Review has been restated to include VSB Bancorp, Inc., which was
acquired on July 1, 1994.


INTRODUCTION

UJB Financial's performance for 1994 was highlighted by continued progress in
earnings growth, improved asset quality and the completion of the restructuring
program. This was the fourth consecutive year of improved earnings since the
loss in 1990 and net income exceeded the previous high achieved in 1989. The
common stock dividend was increased for the third time in two years.
Additionally, with the acquisitions of VSB Bancorp, Inc. and Palisade Savings
Bank, we were able to further increase our market share in Bergen and Hudson
counties.

NET INCOME

[CHART]

(for the years 1989 to 1994) The information conveyed by this chart is
presented in the Summary of Selected Financial Data table on pages 38 and 39 of
this report.

     Net income amounted to $130.2 million, a 57.9% increase compared to the
$82.4 million reported in 1993. Earnings per common share increased 56.7% to
$2.35, from $1.50 earned in 1993. Earnings were enhanced by the significant loan
growth experienced during the year. The loan portfolio increased $912.9 million,
or 10.4%, from a year ago.

     Continued progress in asset quality was reflected in declines in
non-performing loans and other real estate owned (OREO). During 1994,
non-performing loans were reduced by $86.6 million, or 34.1%, to $167.6 million.
Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans declined to 1.74% from 2.91%
in 1993. OREO declined $43.3 million, or 57.9%, to $31.4 million. At year-end
1994, $132.7 million of accruing loans, non-accruing loans and OREO were
identified for bulk sale in an accelerated disposition program. These assets
were written down to a net realizable value of $90.9 million.

     During the third quarter, the three New Jersey banks were consolidated into
United Jersey Bank, resulting in the largest state-chartered New Jersey bank. In
addition, the consolidation of the three Pennsylvania banks into First Valley
Bank occurred during the first quarter. These consolidations enabled us to
reduce non-interest expenses and further improve our operating efficiency.

     Finally,  the quarterly  common stock dividend was increased to an annual
dividend rate of $1.04 per share, a 23.8% increase over the $.84 dividend rate
at year-end 1993.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income for the year ended December 31, 1994 was $130.2 million compared to
$82.4 million the prior year, an increase of $47.8 million, or 57.9%. On a per
share basis, earnings were $2.35 compared to $1.50 reported in 1993. Return on
average assets improved to .88% compared to .59% the previous year, while return
on common equity reached 12.36% compared to 8.32% for 1993. In addition, the
efficiency ratio, the relationship of non-interest expenses (excluding OREO and
non-recurring expenses) to net operating income, improved to 60.4% for 1994
compared to 64.4% in 1993.

     Improved earnings in 1994 were primarily the result of growth in net
interest income, a lower provision for loan losses and reduced non-interest
expenses. Net interest income rose $40.2 million, or 7.0%, over the prior year
as a result of growth in earning assets, particularly loans, as well as
increased non-interest bearing demand deposits. The loan loss provision
decreased $11.7 million as a result of the declining level of non-performing
loans. Excluding the $21.5 million 1993 third quarter restructuring charge,
non-interest expenses declined $27.4 million and reflected a significant
decrease in the provision for OREO as well as reduced salaries and employee
benefits.


INTEREST EARNING ASSETS AND INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES

Average interest earning assets totaled $13.6 billion in 1994, an increase of
$791.6 million, or 6.2%, compared to 1993. Most of the increase occurred in the
investment and loan portfolios. During 1994, total investment securities
increased $525.0 million, or 13.5%, to average $4.4 billion, while the loan
portfolios increased $296.1 million, or 3.3%, to average $9.2 billion.

     Average interest bearing liabilities totaled $10.7 billion in 1994, an
increase of $393.0 million, or 3.8%, compared to 1993. This increase was
primarily attributable to an increase in other borrowed funds of $614.1 million
and was partially offset by a $204.0 million decrease in interest bearing
deposits.

     The tax-equivalent yield on total interest earning assets amounted to
7.17%, a decline of 3 basis points from 7.20% earned in 1993. The cost of
interest bearing liabilities remained relatively unchanged at 3.23% for 1994
compared to 3.22% in 1993. Net interest spread, the difference between the yield
on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities, was
3.94% for 1994, compared to 3.98% in 1993.


                                                                              25

INVESTMENT SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE

On January 1, 1994, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS No.
115) was adopted. This statement required the classification of securities into
one of three categories: trading, available for sale or held to maturity.
Investment securities available for sale are held for an indefinite period of
time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions
as part of the asset/liability management strategy. Effective January 1, 1994,
these securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses,
net of tax, included as a separate component of shareholders' equity.

     Available-for-sale securities averaged $613.9 million during 1994, compared
with an average balance of $754.2 million in 1993, a decrease of $140.3 million,
or 18.6%. At December 31, 1994, these securities totaled $201.2 million,
compared to $1.2 billion at the prior year end, a reduction of $960.9 million,
or 82.7%. A major factor in the decline was a $707.8 million second quarter
transfer of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) to held-to-maturity
securities.

     In anticipation of the January 1, 1994 adoption of SFAS No. 115, UJB
Financial transferred $666.7 million of CMOs from the held-to-maturity portfolio
to the available-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 1993. Although management
had the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity, the
transferred securities had the potential to not meet certain regulatory
suitability tests (FFIEC tests) in the future. The Financial Accounting
Standards Board reasoned that securities which may fail the FFIEC tests could
not be categorized as held to maturity because bank regulators could force the
sale of such securities. On April 15, 1994, the FFIEC amended their policy to
state that the mere existence of regulatory divestiture authority should not
preclude an institution from classifying as held to maturity those securities
which may subsequently fail the FFIEC tests.

     As a result of these policy statements and additional suitability testing,
$707.8 million of CMOs were transferred back to the held-to-maturity portfolio.
These securities were transferred at fair value. The related unrealized loss of
$4.8 million was deferred and is being amortized, net of tax, through
shareholders' equity over the life of the related securities.

     At December 31, 1994, the average estimated life of the portfolio, adjusted
for prepayments, was 6 years, 7 months. The yield on this portfolio increased
148 basis points to 5.59% in 1994, compared to 4.11% in 1993. After the second
quarter transfer to held-to-maturity securities, the portfolio consisted of
primarily higher yielding, fixed-rate CMOs.

     During the year, $3.5 million of available-for-sale investments were sold
for a net gain of $1.6 million and maturities for the period amounted to $261.1
million. At December 31, 1994, the available-for-sale portfolio had pre-tax net
unrealized losses of $12.5 million.


INVESTMENT SECURITIES

The investment securities portfolio is carried at amortized historical cost and
consists of those securities for which there is a positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity. Investment securities held to maturity averaged $3.8 billion
during 1994, an increase of $665.3 million, or 21.2%, from 1993. This increase
was primarily the result of the aforementioned $707.8 million transfer of
securities from the available-for-sale category as well as purchases of agency
and corporate CMOs early in the year. At December 31, 1994, the average
estimated life of investment securities adjusted for prepayments was 5 years.
The yield on this portfolio declined 83 basis points to 6.06% in 1994, compared
to 6.89% in 1993, as higher yielding investments prepaid or matured. At
December 31, 1994, all CMOs in the held-to-maturity portfolio met the FFIEC
tests.

     U.S. Government and Federal agency securities averaged $1.9 billion during
1994, a decrease of $356.3 million, or 16.0%, as maturities were primarily
reinvested in corporate CMOs. The yield on this portfolio declined 84 basis
points to 5.76% in 1994, compared to 6.60% in 1993. A majority of the purchase
activity in this portfolio occurred during the lower rate environment of late
1993 and early 1994. In addition, the securities in this category are primarily
adjustable-rate instruments which repriced at these lower interest rates.

     State and municipal securities declined $17.0 million, or 5.0%, to average
$323.1 million during the year. The tax-equivalent yield on this portfolio was
10.54% in 1994 compared to 11.12% in 1993, a decrease of 58 basis points.

     Other securities, primarily corporate CMOs, averaged $1.6 billion during
1994, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 183.7%, compared to 1993. This increase
reflected the reinvestment of prepayments and cash flows received in early 1994,
as well as the securities transferred from the available-for-sale portfolio. The
yield on this portfolio was at 5.52% in 1994 compared to 5.51% in 1993.


LOANS
     
The improvement in the regional economy during 1994 contributed to the growth in
loans, most of which occurred in the second half of the year. Total loans
averaged $9.2 billion during 1994, an increase of $296.1 million, or 3.3%,
compared to 1993. At December 31, 1994, loans totaled $9.7 billion, an increase
of $912.9 million, or 10.4%, compared to the prior year. Commercial loans grew
$391.5 million, mortgage loans increased $297.4 million and instalment loans
rose $224.0 million. The yield on the total portfolio was 7.75% in 1994 compared
to 7.61% in 1993.

     The commercial loan portfolio, which consists primarily of commercial and
industrial (C & I) and construction and development loans, grew $104.4 million,
or 2.4%, to average $4.5 billion. This portfolio totaled $4.6 billion at
December 31, 1994, up $391.5 million, or 9.2%, from the prior year. The yield on
the portfolio increased 57 basis points to 7.57% in 1994 from 7.00% the prior
year, reflecting the steady rise in the prime rate throughout the year.


                                                                              27

1994 FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)

     The following chart illustrates the level of year-end commercial loans for
the past six years.

COMMERCIAL LOANS ($ in billions)

     The following table presents the commercial loans for the years 1989 to
1994 in billions.

     1994                  4.6
</TABLE>

     The 1994 commercial loan growth was concentrated in the C & I portfolio.
These loans totaled $3.9 billion at year-end 1994, an increase of $555.7
million, or 16.5%, over 1993. The major areas contributing to this growth
included: middle market lending, up $183.1 million; national accounts, up $106.0
million; asset-based lending, up $90.9 million; and leasing, up $58.9 million.
This portfolio continued to mirror the business diversification in the region
with no concentration greater than 5% of total C & I loans to any one industry.

     Construction and development loans amounted to $705.6 million at December
31, 1994, a decline of $164.2 million, or 18.9%, compared to 1993. Contributing
to this decline were paydowns and transfers to permanent financing, as well as
a managed reduction in construction loan activity. In addition, $80.8 million
of the decline was the result of the year-end transfer to assets held for
accelerated disposition.

     The accompanying table illustrates the composition of the construction
portfolio.

</TABLE>

     Total mortgage loans, which include residential and commercial mortgage
loans, averaged $2.6 billion in 1994, an increase of $114.7 million, or 4.7%,
from 1993. Total year-end mortgage loans were $2.8 billion, an increase of
$297.4 million, or 11.9%, over the prior year, with the Palisade acquisition
accounting for $157.0 million of this increase. The yield on the mortgage
portfolio decreased 35 basis points to 7.82%, reflecting the full year impact of
the lower rate environment and refinancing activity in 1993 and early 1994.

     At December 31, 1994, residential mortgage loans were $1.3 billion, up
$401.2 million, or 43.2%, from 1993. Although interest rates rose steadily
during 1994, mortgage origination volume remained favorable, rising 5.1% in 1994
to $552.1 million. This rate environment resulted in a shift in originations
from refinancings to new loans and from fixed-rate to adjustable-rate loans.
Refinance activity accounted for 19.9% of new loans in 1994 compared with 56.5%
of 1993 originations. Adjustable-rate loans, which are generally retained for
long-term investment, represented 55.1% of loan originations in 1994, compared
to 21.3% in 1993. Fixed-rate loans are generally sold in the secondary market
with servicing retained to provide an ongoing source of fee income. With fewer
fixed-rate loans originated during 1994, mortgage loans sold in the secondary
market totaled $145.9 million, compared to $317.7 million in 1993.

     Also included in mortgage loans at December 31, 1994 were $1.5 billion of
commercial mortgages, a decrease of $103.8 million, or 6.6%, from 1993.
Generally, these loans represent owner-occupied or investment properties and
complement a broader commercial lending relationship. The decrease reflected
both accelerated prepayment activity and continued adherence to underwriting
policies.

     Total instalment loans averaged $2.1 billion for the year, an increase of
$77.0 million, or 3.8%, from 1993. At December 31, 1994, instalment loans
amounted to $2.2 billion, an increase of $224.0 million, or 11.1%, over the
prior year.

     The following chart represents the year-end balance of instalment loans for
the past six years.

     The growth was concentrated in home equity and automobile lease loans. The
home equity portfolio increased $136.5 million, or 9.8%, to $1.5 billion at year
end and represented 68.3% of total instalment loans. Automobile lease loans
totaled $199.3 million at December 31, 1994, an increase of $114.8 million, or
135.8%. The yield on the instalment loan portfolio was 8.05%, a decline of 19
basis points from the 8.24% earned in 1993 primarily due to the lower rate
environment and the impact of promotional rates offered on home equity loans
during 1994.

DEPOSITS

Average total deposits remained relatively unchanged at $11.9 billion for 1994,
compared to $11.8 billion for 1993. However, total deposits were $12.6 billion
at December 31, 1994, an increase of $816.3 million, or 6.9% over the prior year
end. The acquisition of Palisade accounted for $254.3 million of this increase.

     With the lower rate environment in 1993 and early 1994, investors searched
for higher yielding investment alternatives, such as the stock market or mutual
funds. This resulted in an outflow of retail time deposits and a shift of
deposit funds into more liquid transaction and savings accounts, primarily money
market accounts. With rising rates during most of 1994, this trend began to
reverse. The higher interest rates offered on intermediate term certificates
of deposit (CDs) caused retail time deposits to show significant growth during
the last five months of 1994.

     The following chart illustrates the level of year-end demand deposits for 
the past six years.

DEMAND DEPOSITS ($ in billions)

     The following table presents demand deposits for the years 1989 to 1994 in
billions.

</TABLE>

     Demand deposits continued to show strong growth in business, municipal and
correspondent accounts. Average demand deposits increased $315.8 million, or
12.2%, to $2.9 billion for the year. At December 31, 1994, these deposits
totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of 16.2%, or $454.8 million, over 1993. The
percentage of demand deposits to total deposits grew to 25.9% at December 31,
1994 compared to 23.9% at year-end 1993. The increase in demand deposits, an
interest-free source of funds, was a contributing factor in the growth of net
interest income and net interest margin.

     Total savings deposits, which include interest-bearing checking, money
market and savings accounts, increased $102.5 million, or 1.9%, to average $5.6
billion during 1994. The preferred money market account, a tiered-rate product,
increased $228.7 million, or 26.1%, to average $1.1 billion in 1994. This
increase was partially offset by a decline of $76.0 million in average
interest bearing checking accounts and a decline of $72.5 million in average
money market accounts. The cost of total savings deposits declined 20 basis
points to 2.08% in 1994 compared to 2.28% in 1993.

     Other time deposits, which consist primarily of retail CDs, declined $389.0
million, or 11.1%, during 1994 to average $3.1 billion. However, these deposits
totaled $3.6 billion at December 31, 1994, an increase of $413.4 million, or
13.1% over the prior year end. This increase reflected the shift in deposit
activity during the second half of 1994 from transaction and savings accounts to
higher yielding CDs. The "SureWin CD," a variable-rate instrument which is
indexed to the prime rate, was reintroduced in August 1994. This product
accounted for approximately $213.2 million of the $487.7 million
growth in retail CDs experienced during the last five months of the year. In
addition, $150.0 million of brokered CDs were issued in the fourth quarter. The
cost of other time deposits declined to 3.98% in 1994 from 4.20% in 1993. Due to
the average maturity for these funds, the 1994 cost reflects the impact of lower
rates during 1993.

     Commercial certificates of deposit $100,000 and over are primarily used as
an additional funding source to support growth in the loan and investment
portfolios. These deposits averaged $338.4 million during 1994, an increase of
$82.4 million, or 32.2%, compared to 1993. At December 31, 1994, commercial CDs
totaled $371.1 million, an increase of $144.6 million, or 63.8%, compared to the
prior year. The cost of commercial CDs increased by 117 basis points during the
year to 4.03%, compared with 2.86% in 1993, and reflected the impact of rising
interest rates.

OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

Other borrowed funds include Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements,
treasury tax and loan deposits and other short-term borrowings. These borrowings
are generally used to support growth in the loan and investment portfolios.
During 1994, other borrowed funds increased $614.1 million, or 76.5%, to average
$1.4 billion. The cost of borrowed funds increased 105 basis points during the
year to 5.04%, compared with 3.99% in 1993.

     Commercial paper, which amounted to $42.2 million at year end, is a funding
source for the non-bank subsidiaries. These funds averaged $46.5 million during
the year, a decrease of $12.4 million, or 21.0%, from 1993. The cost of
commercial paper increased 111 basis points to 4.06% in 1994, from 2.95% in
1993, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates.

                                                                              29

NET INTEREST INCOME

Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $976.2 million, an increase of
$51.9 million, or 5.6%, compared to 1993. This increase was primarily due to
volume increases in the loan and investment portfolios. The yield on interest
earning assets was 7.17% for 1994, compared to 7.20% for 1993.

     Interest expense was $344.9 million for 1994, an increase of $13.1 million,
or 4.0%, from $331.7 million a year ago. The increase was principally a result
of volume increases in borrowed funds and commercial CDs. These increases were
partially offset by the decline in retail time deposits. The cost of all
interest bearing liabilities was 3.23% in 1994, relatively unchanged from 3.22%
in 1993.

     The following chart illustrates the growth in tax-equivalent net interest
income for the past six years.

NET INTEREST INCOME (tax-equivalent basis, $ in millions)


[CHART]

The information conveyed by this chart is presented for the years 1989 to 1994
in the Comparative Interest Rates table found on page 30 of this report.


     Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $631.4 million,
an increase of $38.8 million, or 6.5%, from the $592.6 million earned in 1993.
The net interest spread on a tax-equivalent basis, the difference between the
rate earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing
liabilities, remained relatively unchanged at 3.94% for the year, compared to
3.98% earned in 1993. Net interest margin, tax-equivalent net interest income as
a percentage of average interest earning assets, also remained relatively
unchanged at 4.63% for 1994, compared to 4.62% in 1993.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

Non-interest income, including investment securities gains, amounted to $177.3
million in 1994, compared to $179.5 million the prior year, a decrease of $2.2
million, or 1.2%. Excluding investment securities gains, non-interest income
rose $4.8 million, or 2.8%, from 1993.
   
     Non-interest income categories compared to the prior year are shown in 
the accompanying table.

==============================================================================
</TABLE>

     Service charges on deposit accounts increased $4.0 million, or 6.6%, to
$64.5 million in 1994. This growth was primarily attributed to service charges
on personal demand deposit accounts.

     Service and loan fee income increased $7.4 million, or 21.3%, to $42.0
million in 1994. Merchant card fees totaled $22.5 million, an increase of $3.0
million, or 15.8%. Commercial loan fees increased $2.4 million, or 26.4%, to
$11.5 million, as a result of increased loan activity.

     Trust income of $21.8 million was relatively unchanged from the prior year.
Assets under trust administration, including corporate debt issue trusteeships,
grew $530.0 million during the year to total $18.0 billion as of December 31,
1994. Trust assets under discretionary management were $3.9 billion for both
1994 and 1993. These assets included the Pillar Funds, a family of mutual funds
established by UJB Financial in 1992, which totaled $1.1 billion at year-end 
1994 and 1993.

     Other income amounted to $46.5 million, a decline of $5.3 million, or
10.2%, compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.4
million decline in brokerage fees and a $2.7 million decrease in secondary
market mortgage income as a result of lower fixed-rate mortgage loan
originations.

     For the year ended December 31, 1994, securities gains were $1.9 million,
compared to $8.9 million in 1993, a decline of $7.0 million, or 78.7%. The 1993
gains were realized as securities available for sale were sold to reduce
prepayment risk in the CMO portfolio.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSES

Non-interest expenses totaled $505.2 million in 1994, a decrease of $48.9
million, or 8.8%, compared to 1993. Excluding the 1993 restructuring charge of
$21.5 million, non-interest expenses decreased $27.4 million, or 5.2%, from
1993. The efficiency ratio improved to 60.4% for 1994 compared to 64.4% in 
1993. This improvement in the efficiency ratio was attributable to the 
savings realized from the restructuring program as well as increased net 
interest income.

     Salaries totaled $183.3 million in 1994, a decrease of $2.2 million, or
1.2%, compared to 1993. Total full-time equivalent employees at December 31,
1994 were 6,143 compared to 6,300 at December 31, 1993, a decline of 2.5%.
Pension and other employee benefits totaled $53.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994, and were $5.2 million, or 8.9%, below 1993. The decreases in
salaries and benefits reflected the impact of the restructuring and
consolidation activities in 1994.

     Occupancy expenses were $50.7 million for 1994, an increase of $2.3
million, or 4.7%. This increase was attributed to additional maintenance costs,
primarily snow removal in the first quarter of 1994, as well as increased rental
expense and real estate taxes.

     Furniture and equipment expenses amounted to $49.1 million, an increase of
$3.5 million, or 7.6%, from $45.6 million in 1993. The increase was principally
due to additional lease and maintenance costs associated with new equipment
required to support the branch automation project completed in 1994.

     The FDIC assessment of $27.9 million decreased $1.3 million, or 4.5%, from
1993. The amount of the assessment is calculated by applying an assessed rate to
the level of outstanding deposits. Beginning in January 1993, the FDIC changed
their assessment methodology so that banks are assessed a rate based on their
respective regulatory rating.

     OREO expenses totaled $18.3 million for 1994, down $22.6 million, or 55.3%,
from 1993 due to a reduction in the number of OREO properties. A provision of
$10.6 million was recorded in 1994, compared to $32.1 million in 1993. OREO
expenses also include expenses related to holding and operating foreclosed
properties. These costs declined $1.1 million, or 13.0%, in 1994 and amounted to
$7.7 million for the year.

     Other expenses, which include professional fees, communication expenses,
and merchant bankcard processing fees, were $111.6 million in 1994, a decrease
of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, from 1993. This decline is primarily the result of a
$3.2 million reduction in professional fees which totaled $37.1 million for
1994.

     A restructuring charge of $21.5 million was recorded in the third quarter
of 1993 for incremental costs incurred as a result of the restructuring and
consolidation program announced in September 1993. To date, approximately $18.5
million of these costs have been recognized. Included in the 1994 results were
approximately $20.0 million of reduced expenses and increased revenues related
to the restructuring program.

INCOME TAXES

Federal and state income tax expense for 1994 was $72.3 million compared to
$27.0 million in 1993. The increase was primarily the result of higher pre-tax
income. The effective income tax rate, total income taxes as a percentage of
pre-tax income, was 35.4% for 1994, compared to 25.5% for 1993. The increase in
the effective tax rate for 1994 was the result of increased pre-tax earnings
with a relatively constant level of tax-free income.

     Differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities
recorded in the financial statements result in deferred taxes. As of December
31, 1994 and 1993, net deferred tax assets were $105.5 million and $118.9
million, respectively. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 18
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NON-PERFORMING LOANS

UJB Financial continued to make progress in reducing the level of non-performing
loans in 1994. These loans declined $86.6 million, or 34.1%, in 1994, following
a decline of $110.7 million, or 30.3% in 1993. Continued reductions and the
transfer of $46.8 million of non-performing loans to assets held for accelerated
disposition contributed to the 1994 decline. At December 31, 1994,
non-performing loans totaled $167.6 million, and represented 1.74% of total
loans, compared to $254.3 million, or 2.91%, the prior year.

     Non-performing loans, which consist primarily of commercial non-accrual and
renegotiated loans, declined to their lowest level in six years as illustrated
in the following chart.

non-accrual loans were $2.7 million for 1994 and $4.2 million in 1993. Total
lost interest on non-accrual loans, after deducting interest payments received,
amounted to $13.5 million and $14.5 million for 1994 and 1993, respectively.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

Other real estate owned amounted to $31.4 million at year end compared to $74.8
million the prior year, a decline of $43.3 million, or 57.9%. This decline was
primarily the result of the transfer of $33.9 million to assets held for
accelerated disposition in the fourth quarter of 1994.

     OREO includes foreclosed assets as well as in-substance foreclosures (ISFs)
and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell.
If the fair value less estimated costs to sell is less than the cost of the
asset, the deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance. At year-end 1994,
the allowance totaled $15.0 million, compared to $31.1 million the prior year
end. As of December 31, 1994, OREO had been written down by approximately 63.5%
of its original value and consisted of $25.0 million of foreclosed properties
for which title was held and $6.4 million of ISFs.


     The accompanying table illustrates the activity in OREO for the past two

ASSETS HELD FOR ACCELERATED DISPOSITION

In the fourth quarter of 1994, certain assets were identified for potential
sale in bulk transactions in order to accelerate the resolution of
non-performing loans and OREO. The assets selected had an aggregate book value
of $132.7 million at December 31, 1994, and consisted of accruing and
non-accruing construction and commercial real estate loans and OREO properties. 
In anticipation of the bulk sale transactions, these assets were transferred to
a category on the balance sheet entitled "Assets held for accelerated
disposition" at their net realizable value of $90.9 million. This transaction

                                                                              33

resulted in a charge of $37.0 million to the allowance for loan losses and a
charge of $4.8 million to the allowance for OREO. An additional fourth quarter
provision for loan losses of $10.0 million was also recorded as a result of the
aforementioned transaction.

     It is expected that the majority of this portfolio will be liquidated
during the first half of 1995, with the entire portfolio sold by year-end 1995.
The sales of these assets are subject to successful negotiation of terms,
completion of definitive agreements and satisfaction of closing conditions. No
assurance can be given that the bulk sale of these assets will be consummated or
that, if consummated, they will be sold for their current carrying value.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND RELATED PROVISION

The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1994 was $214.2 million, compared
to $244.2 million at the prior year end, a decrease of $30.0 million, or 12.3%.
The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 2.22% at year-end
1994 and 2.79% at year-end 1993. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage
of non-performing loans was 127.7% at year-end 1994 compared to 96.0% at the end
of 1993.
              
     A standardized process has been established to assess the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses and to identify the risks inherent in the loan
portfolio. This process incorporates credit reviews and gives consideration to
areas of exposure such as concentrations of credit, economic and industry
conditions, trends in delinquencies and collections, collateral coverage and the
composition of the loan portfolio. Specific allocations are identified by
individual loan while general reserve percentages are identified by loan
category or grade and allocated accordingly. Certain loans classified by
regulators, which may not be included in the non-performing loan totals, are
graded and incorporated in the process of assessing the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses. Therefore, such loans, if any, would not have a
material impact on future operating results beyond what was provided in the
allowance for loan losses. The allowance is maintained at a level considered
sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio.

     As of year end, of the total $214.2 million loan loss allowance,
approximately $23.2 million was specifically identified for problem credits,
$108.9 million was allocated to specific categories or grades of loans as deemed
necessary under the assessment process, and $82.1 million was considered a
general unallocated reserve for the remaining inherent risk in the portfolio.

        The provision for loan losses was $84.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994, down $11.7 million, or 12.2%, from the $95.7 million
recorded in 1993. This decrease resulted primarily from improvement in asset
quality during 1994 as non-performing loans declined 34.1% and net charge offs
declined 38.8%. Net charge offs in 1994, which do not include the write
down of $37.0 million on the transfer of assets held for accelerated
disposition, totaled $78.9 million, a decline of $50.1 million from $129.0
million in 1993. These net charge offs represented .86% of average loans in
1994, compared to 1.46% of average loans in 1993.

STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITIES AND DIVIDENDS

A strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and
profitability, to serve the needs of depositors and creditors, and to yield an
attractive return for shareholders. Shareholders' equity averaged $1.1 billion
during 1994, an increase of $69.6 million, or 7.0%, compared to 1993. The ratio
of average total equity to average total assets improved slightly to 7.19% for
1994, compared to 7.12% for 1993. Book value per common share rose to $19.53 at
year-end 1994 from $18.23 the prior year.

     As a result of continued earnings progress, the quarterly dividend was
increased by 23.8% to $.26 per share, from $.21 per share, beginning in the
third quarter. Common stock dividends declared totaled $.94 per share for 1994,
compared to $.69 for 1993, an increase of 36.2%.

     The market price of the common stock was $24.13 at December 31, 1994,
compared with $24.00 the prior year end. The common stock of UJB Financial is
traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UJB. The quarterly market
price ranges per common share for the last two years are shown in the

     UJB Financial and its bank subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory
capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier I
capital (shareholders' equity excluding unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities and certain intangibles), Tier II capital (certain
debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses) and total
capital (Tier I plus Tier II). The Federal Reserve Board has established the
Tier I leverage ratio, which measures the ratio of Tier I capital to quarterly
average assets less certain intangibles. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed
as a percentage of risk-adjusted assets, where balance sheet assets and
off-balance-sheet exposures are assigned a predetermined weight to measure their
level of risk.

     The current minimum regulatory guideline for the Tier I leverage ratio is
4.0% for institutions that have a regulatory rating of two or more. For Tier I
and total risk-based capital ratios, the minimum regulatory guidelines are 4.0%
and 8.0%, respectively. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct effect on the
operations and financial statements.

     The following table illustrates the leverage and risk-based capital ratios
at December 31, which were well above the required minimums.

</TABLE>

     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA)
established five capital level designations ranging from "well capitalized" to
"critically undercapitalized." At December 31, 1994, each of the subsidiary
banks met the "well capitalized" criteria, which requires a minimum Tier I
leverage ratio of 5.0% and minimum Tier I and total risk-based capital ratios of
6.0% and 10.0%, respectively.

LIQUIDITY

Bank liquidity is the ability to support asset growth while satisfying the
borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers. Traditional
sources of liquidity include asset maturities, asset repayments and deposit
growth. Purchased liabilities such as Federal funds purchased, securities sold
under agreements to repurchase and commercial paper represent other major
sources of funding. In addition, the banking subsidiaries have established lines
of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
and other correspondent banks which further support and enhance liquidity.

     Liquidity management is a function of the Asset/Liability Management
Committee (ALCO) and includes monitoring current and projected cash flows, as
well as economic forecasts for the industry. UJB Financial also maintains a
liquidity contingency plan designed to effectively manage potential liquidity
concerns due to changes in interest rates, credit markets or other external
risks.

     The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present the change in cash and
cash equivalents from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and
cash equivalents increased by $145.6 million during 1994. Net cash provided by
operating activities totaled $202.9 million. This amount was primarily
attributable to results of operations adjusted for the provisions for loan
losses and OREO, and proceeds from the sales of mortgages held for sale. Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $1.5 billion and was the result of
investment and loan activity. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$1.5 billion in 1994 reflecting the increases in short-term borrowings and
deposits.

     The total investment portfolio, including investment securities available
for sale, is also a source of liquidity as portfolio assets provide cash flows
through maturities and periodic repayments of principal. During the year ended
December 31, 1994, proceeds from maturities in the combined portfolios were $1.2
billion, while proceeds from the sales of investment securities available for
sale were $5.1 million. Investment portfolio cash flows were primarily used to
fund loan growth and manage the borrowed funds position. As a result of this
reinvestment of cash flow, total scheduled maturities of interest bearing
deposits with banks plus maturities and anticipated principal repayments of the
combined investment portfolio will be approximately $391.3 million during 1995.
In addition, all or part of the investment securities available-for-sale
portfolio could be sold to provide additional liquidity. At December 31, 1994,
the average maturity of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment
portfolios, adjusted for historical prepayment patterns on mortgage-backed
securities, was estimated to be approximately 6 years, 7 months and 5 years,
respectively.

     A strong base of low-cost demand and retail deposits, which are a
cornerstone of liquidity, is managed through an extensive branch network. Total
demand and retail time deposits amounted to $12.2 billion at December 31, 1994,
compared to $11.5 billion at year-end 1993.

     Liquidity is also available through lines of credit and the ability to
incur additional debt. During 1994, average short-term borrowings increased
$614.1 million and were used to fund the growth in the loan and investment
portfolios.

     Liquidity is also important at the Parent Corporation to provide funds for
operations and to pay dividends to shareholders. Parent Corporation cash
requirements are met primarily through dividends from its subsidiaries and the
issuance of short and long-term debt. The amount of dividends from bank
subsidiaries is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as detailed in Note
14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, at December
31, 1994, there were $40.0 million of short-term lines of credit available for
general corporate purposes.

     Commercial paper issued by the Parent Corporation of UJB Financial is
primarily a funding source for the second mortgage and asset-based lending
subsidiaries. These funds averaged $46.5 million during the year, a decrease of
$12.4 million, or 21.0%, from 1993, and amounted to $42.2 million at year end.

1994 FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)

     At December 31, 1994, long-term debt outstanding was $204.8 million,
compared to $208.7 million at December 31, 1993. Under the most restrictive 
limitations on various debt agreements, the unrestricted consolidated
retained earnings available for dividends amounted to $249.4 million at
December 31, 1994. The amount of additional funded debt that could have been
created as of year-end 1994 was $298.8 million. For additional information
about the creation of additional funded debt and the limitations on retained
earnings available for the payment of dividends, see Notes 12 and 14 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INTEREST SENSITIVITY

Interest rate sensitivity and the repricing characteristics of assets and
liabilities are managed by ALCO. The principal objective of ALCO is to maximize
net interest income within acceptable levels of risk established by policy.
Interest rate risk is managed using financial modeling techniques, including
stress tests, to measure the impact of changes in interest rates.

     Net interest income, the primary source of earnings is affected by 
interest rate movements. To mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates,
the balance sheet must be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for
both assets and liabilities in approximately equivalent amounts at basically the
same time intervals. Imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in
time constitute interest-sensitivity gaps, the difference between
interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. These static
measurements do not reflect the results of any projected activity and are best
used as early indicators of potential interest rate exposures.

     As illustrated by the interest rate sensitivity analysis in the
accompanying table, sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations is measured in a
number of time frames. ALCO monitors the gap position on an adjusted basis
allowing for the impact of off-balance-sheet transactions.

     At December 31, 1994, UJB Financial had a negative 30-day gap position of
$829.8 million and a negative one-year gap of $912.8 million. A negative gap
means an excess of interest-sensitive liabilities over interest-sensitive
assets. In a rising rate environment, a negative gap position indicates that
increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities will outpace increases in
income from interest earning assets. This risk is mitigated by ALCO's numerous
strategies, including the administration of liability costs and a re-deployment
of asset maturities and cash flows to insulate net interest income from the
effects of changes in interest rates.

     These gap positions are monitored as part of the ALCO process, which
includes periodic forecasts of future business activity applied to various
interest rate environments in a simulation process. The use of these financial
modeling techniques assists management in its continuing efforts to achieve
earnings growth in ever-changing interest rate environments.

     Asset and liability management efforts also involved the use of
derivatives, which was primarily limited to interest rate swaps. These swaps
were accounted for as hedges and were not recorded on the balance sheet. Income
or expense related to these instruments was accrued monthly and recognized as an
adjustment to interest income or interest expense for those balance sheet
instruments being hedged. Hedged transactions resulted in a net interest income
reduction of $1.2 million in 1994, compared to a $6.8 million contribution in
1993.

     The accompanying table illustrates the aggregate notional amounts and
expected maturities of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 1994.

     At year-end 1994, the swap agreements had an average maximum remaining
maturity of 30 months. Most of the swaps were Indexed Amortizing Swaps (IAS)
that were structured to contain an initial principal lockout period followed by
scheduled principal amortization. The amortization speed was determined by a
sliding percentage scale which used different amortization percentages for
varying levels of LIBOR. As a result, the actual lives of these agreements will
move with the level of rates, but cannot exceed the maximum life contained in
each agreement.

past two years.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 1993 COMPARED WITH 1992

Total earnings in 1993 amounted to $82.4 million, or $1.50 per share, compared
to $56.8 million for 1992, or $1.09 per share. As a result of improved earnings
for the third year, the quarterly common stock dividend was increased twice
during 1993 to an annual dividend rate of $.84 per share, a 40.0% increase over
the $.60 dividend rate at year-end 1992. Improved earnings were primarily the
result of growth in net interest income and a reduction in the provision for
loan losses.

     Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $592.6 million,
an increase of $24.3 million, or 4.3%, from $568.3 million earned in 1992. The
net interest spread on a tax-equivalent basis increased to 3.98%, compared to
3.82% earned in 1992. Net interest margin increased to 4.62% during 1993
compared to 4.49% in 1992. The increase in the net interest spread and margin
reflected the growth in demand deposits, the repricing of interest bearing
liabilities in a declining rate environment and the benefit of reduced levels
of non-performing loans.

     Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $924.3 million, a decrease of
$73.8. million, or 7.4%, compared to 1992. This decline was primarily due to the
reinvestment of cash flows and the repricing of variable rate loans in a lower
rate environment. Interest expense was $331.7 million, a decrease of $98.0
million, or 22.8%, from $429.7 million in 1992. The decline was the result of
lower rates paid on deposits and other funding sources, in addition to the
decline in average interest bearing liabilities.

     The provision for loan losses was $95.7 million for the year ended December
31, 1993, down $43.9 million, or 31.4%, from $139.6 million recorded in 1992.
This reduction was due principally to the decline in non-performing loans. Net
charge offs declined $25.6 million to $129.0 million, or 1.46% of average loans,
compared to $154.6 million, or 1.73%, in 1992.

     Non-interest income, including investment securities gains, amounted to
$179.5 million in 1993 compared to $177.5 million in 1992, an increase of $2.0
million, or 1.1%. Excluding investment securities gains, non-interest income
rose 7.3% over 1992. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $6.1 million,
or 11.3%, to $60.5 million in 1993. Service and loan fee income increased $1.7
million, or 5.2%, to $34.6 million in 1993. Trust income rose $2.0 million, or
10.2%, to $21.9 million in 1993. The Pillar Funds grew to $1.1 billion by
year-end 1993 and accounted for $4.8 million and $2.0 million in fee income for
1993 and 1992, respectively. Other income amounted to $51.8 million, an increase
of $1.7 million, or 3.4%, compared to the prior year.

     For the year ended December 31, 1993, securities gains were $8.9 million
compared to $18.5 million in 1992. These gains were realized as securities
available for sale were sold to reduce prepayment risk in the CMO portfolio
resulting from the declining interest rate environment.

     Non-interest expenses totaled $554.2 million, an increase of $43.2 million,
or 8.4%, compared to 1992. Excluding the 1993 restructuring charge of $21.5
million, non-interest expenses would have been $532.7 million, an increase of
$21.7 million, or 4.2%, over 1992. Salaries totaled $185.6 million in 1993, an
increase of $6.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to 1992. Pension and other employee
benefits of $58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 were $7.4
million, or 14.4%, above 1992. The incremental expenses related to the adoption
of SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," amounted to $2.9 million in 1993.

     Furniture and equipment expenses amounted to $45.6 million, an increase of
$3.2 million, or 7.5%, over the $42.4 million in 1992. OREO expenses totaled
$40.9 million for 1993 and were up $2.8 million, or 7.4%, over 1992. Included in
this total was a provision of $32.1 million for valuation adjustments to
maintain the carrying value of the OREO portfolio at the lower of cost or fair
value less costs to sell on an individual property-by-property basis. Also
included in this total were expenses related to holding and operating foreclosed
properties. These costs declined by 12.4%, or $1.3 million, in 1993 to $8.9
million for the year.

     The FDIC assessment of $29.2 million reflected an increase of $3.2 million,
or 12.3%, above 1992. Other expenses were $113.8 million in 1993, a decrease of
$1.6 million, or 1.4%, from 1992. This decrease was primarily the result of
reduced expenses on non-performing loans and lower charge offs on check losses.

     In the third quarter of 1993, a charge of $21.5 million was recorded to
reflect the costs associated with consolidation of the bank subsidiaries and
reorganizing the company along business lines. The charge generally represented
those incremental costs incurred as a result of the restructuring plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS UJB Financial Corp. (UJB Financial) commenced operations on October 1,
1970, as a New Jersey corporation and as a bank holding company registered under
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Through its bank and active non-bank
subsidiaries, UJB Financial provides a full range of banking services and
certain non-bank services to individual and corporate customers in a competitive
environment. UJB Financial is regulated by various Federal and state agencies
and is subject to periodic examination by those regulatory authorities.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of UJB Financial and all of its subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Prior period consolidated financial statements and related footnote disclosures
have been restated to include the acquisition of VSB Bancorp, Inc. This
acquisition occurred on July 1, 1994 and was accounted for on the
pooling-of-interests method. Palisade Savings Bank, FSB acquired on September
16, 1994, was recorded under the purchase method of accounting, with the
operating results included from the date of acquisition.

     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet
and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ
significantly from these estimates.

CASH FLOW REPORTING The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented
using the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
amounts due from banks, Federal funds sold, and securities purchased under
agreements to resell. Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods and
securities purchased under agreements to resell are short-term, highly liquid
assets.

SECURITIES Effective January 1, 1994, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" (SFAS No. 115) was adopted. As required by SFAS No. 115, securities
are classified into one of three investment categories: trading account
securities, investment securities available for sale and investment securities.
Securities that are purchased specifically for short-term appreciation and held
with the intent of selling in the near future are classified as trading account
securities. Securities purchased with the intent and ability to hold until
maturity are classified as investment securities. All other securities,
including equity securities, are classified as investment securities available
for sale.

     Trading account securities are reported at market value on a specific
identification basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in
non-interest income as trading account gains.

     Securities are classified as available for sale where there is intent to
hold the securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to
maturity. Investments classified as available for sale may be sold in response
to changing market and interest rate conditions, or as part of an overall
asset/liability management strategy. These securities are reported at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in shareholders' equity.
Realized gains and losses are reported in non-interest income as investment
securities gains.

     Investment securities are held for long-term investment upon evaluation of
intent and the ability to hold these securities until maturity. The investment
securities are recorded at amortized cost.

     Transfers of securities between categories are at fair value as of the
transfer date, with the accounting treatment of unrealized gains or losses
determined by the category into which the security is transferred.

LOANS Loans are stated at principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned
discounts and net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income on
loans is accrued and credited to interest and fees on loans as earned. Loan
origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
recognized over the estimated life of the loan as an adjustment to the loan's
yield. Other loan fees are recorded as earned and included in non-interest
income.

NON-PERFORMING LOANS Non-performing loans generally consist of commercial
non-accrual and renegotiated loans. These loans are classified as non-accrual
loans when they are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or
where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collectibility. At the time a loan is
placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is
reversed against interest income. Interest collections on non-accrual loans are
generally credited to interest income when received. However, if ultimate
collectibility of principal is in doubt, interest collections are applied as
principal reductions. After principal and interest payments are brought current
and future collectibility is reasonably assured, loans are returned to accrual
status.

     Renegotiated loans are loans whose contractual interest rates have been
reduced to below market rates or other significant concessions made due to a
borrower's financial difficulties. Interest on renegotiated loans is generally
credited to interest income when received.

     Consumer loans are charged off when they are 120 days past due. Accruals
cease at 180 days on home equity loans, and uncollected interest is reversed
against interest income. Past due residential mortgage loans and home equity
loans are monitored and charged off when deemed uncollectible.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve
available for losses incurred or expected on extensions of credit. Credit losses
arise primarily from the loan portfolio, but may also be derived from other
credit-related sources including commitments to extend credit, guarantees,
standby letters of credit, and derivatives. Additions are made to the allowance
through periodic provisions which are charged to earnings. All losses of
principal are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a
determination is made that a loss is probable. Subsequent recoveries, if any,
are added back to the allowance.

44
<PAGE>   47
     The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined through a
quarterly review of outstanding extensions of credit. The impact of economic
conditions on the creditworthiness of the borrowers is given consideration, as
well as loan loss experience, changes in the composition and volume of the loan
portfolio, and management's assessment of the risk inherent in the loan
portfolio. These and other factors are used in assessing the overall adequacy of
the allowance for loan losses and the resulting provision for loan losses.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT Premises, furniture and equipment are stated at cost,
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization
charges are computed using the straight-line method. Premises, furniture and
equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets, except
for leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the term of the lease or
the estimated useful life of the asset, if shorter. Estimated useful lives are
ten to forty years for premises, and three to ten years for furniture and
equipment. The cost of major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

     Premises and major items of furniture and equipment are removed from
property accounts upon disposition at their carrying amount, and gains or losses
on such transactions are included in other non-interest income or expense.

ASSETS HELD FOR ACCELERATED DISPOSITION In December 1994, certain commercial
accruing and non-accruing loans and other real estate owned properties were
identified for sale under an accelerated disposition program. These assets were
transferred into an accelerated disposition classification and were written down
to their estimated net realizable value. The valuation of the assets in this
classification will be determined quarterly and will be carried at the lower of
the initially established carrying value or a new net realizable value.
Additional write downs, if any, will be charged against earnings.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED Other real estate owned includes both foreclosed and
in-substance foreclosed property. In-substance foreclosed property includes
properties for which borrowers have little or no equity or prospects for
building equity in the collateral and for which the loan repayment can only be
expected from the operation or sale of the collateral. When a property is
acquired through foreclosure or in-substance foreclosure, the excess of the
carrying amount over fair value, if any, is charged to the allowance for loan
losses.

     An allowance for other real estate owned has been established to maintain
these properties at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell.
Other real estate owned is shown net of the allowance. The allowance is
established through charges to other real estate owned expense. Operating
results of other real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses,
and gains and losses realized from the sale of properties owned, are recorded in
other real estate owned expense.

DERIVATIVES Derivative financial instruments are primarily used in the
management of interest rate risk and are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Interest income or expense arising from these instruments is recorded as a yield
adjustment to the related hedged assets or liabilities. Gains or losses on the
termination of interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized as an adjustment
to the yield of the hedged asset or liability over its remaining life.

INCOME TAXES The amount provided for income taxes is based on income reported
for consolidated financial statement purposes after elimination of income which
is exempt from Federal income tax. Such tax-exempt income is derived primarily
from investment securities of states and political subdivisions and certain
commercial and mortgage loans.

     On January 1, 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109) was adopted. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted statutory tax rates to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rate on deferred taxes is recognized
in the period of the enactment date. The cumulative effect at January 1, 1993,
of this change in the method of accounting for income taxes has been included in
the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 1993.

     UJB Financial and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax
return, and the amount of income tax expense or benefit is computed and
allocated on a separate return basis.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other assets include goodwill which represents the excess of
the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired through purchase acquisitions. Goodwill is being amortized on a
straight-line method over the future periods estimated to be benefited, ranging
from ten to forty years. Goodwill amounted to $31,998,000 and $13,561,000 at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Core deposit intangibles and other identifiable intangibles amounted to
$16,004,000 and $15,003,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and are
being amortized over their estimated future periods of benefit ranging from five
to ten years.

RETIREMENT PLANS UJB Financial and its subsidiaries have several formal
non-contributory retirement plans which cover substantially all employees.
Annual contributions are made to the plans in amounts not less than the minimum
regulatory requirements. The costs associated with these benefits are accrued
based on actuarial assumptions and included in non-interest expenses.

INCOME PER SHARE Income per common share is calculated by dividing net income,
less the dividend on the adjustable-rate cumulative preferred stock, by the
average daily number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common
stock equivalents are not included in the calculation as they are not material.

                                                                              45

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS

In December 1993, UJB Financial entered into an agreement to acquire VSB
Bancorp, Inc. (VSB) and its wholly owned subsidiary Valley Savings Bank. The
transaction, accounted for as a pooling of interests, was consummated on July 1,
1994. UJB Financial common stock was exchanged at the rate of .7727 for each
share of VSB common stock. There were 2,628,912 shares of UJB Financial common
stock issued for 3,402,619 shares of VSB common stock.

    Separate results of operations of the entities for the two years prior to
acquisition were as follows:

     Prior to the combination, VSB's fiscal year ended September 30. In
recording the pooling of interests, an adjustment has been made to stockholders'
equity as of January 1, 1994 to reflect the effect of including VSB's results of
operations for the three months ended December 31, 1993.

     In May 1994, UJB Financial entered into an agreement to purchase Palisade
Savings Bank, FSB (Palisade). On September 16, 1994, the acquisition of Palisade
was completed at a cost of $42,156,000 and the transaction was recorded under
the purchase method. Palisade had total assets of $324,237,000, loans of
$164,843,000 and deposits of $266,678,000. Results of operations are included
from the acquisition date. The acquisition of Palisade resulted in goodwill of
$19,942,000 which is being amortized over fifteen years.

     The proforma results of operations for the period January 1, 1994 to
September 16, 1994 and for the year ended December 31, 1993, assuming Palisade
had been acquired as of January 1, 1993, would not have been significantly
different from those presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

     On January 19, 1995, UJB Financial announced a definitive agreement to
acquire Bancorp New Jersey, Inc. (Bancorp) for a combination of cash and stock
with an approximate value of $88,900,000. Bancorp is a bank holding company with
assets of $480,371,000, loans of $293,363,000 and deposits of $421,993,000. It
operates New Jersey Savings Bank with 12 banking offices - nine in Somerset
County, two in Hunterdon County and one in Mercer County.


NOTE 3 RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS 

Certain subsidiary banks are required to maintain reserve balances with a
Federal Reserve Bank based principally upon deposits. These reserve balances
averaged $359,124,000 in 1994 and $332,881,000 in 1993.

     On January 1, 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (SFAS No. 114) and SFAS No.
118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and
Disclosures" will be adopted. These Statements address the accounting for
impaired loans and specify how allowances for credit losses related to these
impaired loans should be determined. The adoption of these Statements is not
expected to have a material effect on the allowance for loan losses or to the
existing income recognition and charge off policies for non-performing loans.
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 114, in-substance foreclosures will be classified as
non-performing loans.

===========================================================================
</TABLE>

     The 8.625% subordinated notes were issued in 1992 and are unsecured.
Interest is payable semi-annually on June 10 and December 10 of each year. The
notes are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. No sinking fund is
provided for the notes.

     The 7.95% ten year maturity private placement senior notes were issued in
1993 with interest payable quarterly on the twenty-fifth day of each February,

    The 7.75% sinking fund debentures are currently redeemable at the option of
UJB Financial at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. An annual
sinking fund of $700,000 is calculated to retire 52.5% of this issue prior to
maturity. UJB Financial may, at its option, increase its sinking fund payment in
any year by making an additional payment not in excess of the mandatory sinking
fund payment. The debentures are redeemable, through the sinking fund, at the
principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. At December 31, 1994, $162,000
was being held to satisfy future sinking fund requirements.

    Certain of the above long-term debt agreements include restrictions upon the
creation of liens by UJB Financial, the disposition of stock of subsidiaries,

earnings of $249,399,000 were unrestricted and available for dividends, and the

    A Shareholder Rights Plan exists which is designed to ensure fair and equal
treatment for all UJB Financial shareholders in the event of any proposal to
acquire UJB Financial. The terms of the plan provide that effective August 28,
1989, each share of common stock also represents one "right." Each right will
entitle the holder to buy one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of
preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, upon the
occurrence of certain other events, holders of the rights will be entitled to
purchase either shares of this new preferred stock or shares in an "acquiring
person" at half their fair market value as determined under the plan.


NOTE 14 RESTRICTIONS ON SUBSIDIARY BANK DIVIDENDS

Certain bank regulatory limitations exist on the availability of subsidiary bank
undistributed net assets for the payment of dividends to UJB Financial Parent
Corporation without the prior approval of the bank regulatory authorities.

    The Federal Reserve Act, which affects the New Jersey state member bank,
restricts the payment of dividends in any calendar year to the net profit of the
current year combined with retained net profits of the preceding two years. The
Pennsylvania state-chartered bank may declare a dividend up to the amount of
accumulated net profit. In addition to these statutory restrictions, the
subsidiary banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital under
FDICIA. At December 31, 1994, the total undistributed net assets of the
subsidiary banks were $1,079,115,000 of which $199,405,000 was available under
the most restrictive limitations for the payment of dividends to UJB Financial
Parent Corporation.


NOTE 15 BENEFIT PLANS

UJB Financial has several trusteed non-contributory defined benefit retirement
plans covering substantially all of its employees. The benefits are based on
years of service and the employees' final average compensation. The funding
policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for Federal
income tax purposes. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed for service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the
future.

    The following table sets forth the plans' funding status and amounts
recognized in the consolidated financial statements at December 31:

future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of
the projected benefit obligation was 5.5% in 1994 and 1993 and 6.0% in 1992. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9.0% in 1994, 1993 and
1992.

     In addition to pension benefits, certain health care and life insurance
benefits are made available to retired employees. In 1993 UJB Financial adopted,
on a prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS
No. 106). Under SFAS No. 106 the costs of such benefits are accrued based on
actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully
eligible to receive the benefits. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 106, the
costs of these benefits were expensed as paid and amounted to $1,039,000 in
1992.

     The following table sets forth the net periodic postretirement benefit cost
and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) at December 31:

     For measurement purposes, the cost of medical benefits was projected to
increase at a rate of 14.0% in 1994, 15.0% in 1993 and thereafter decreasing
linearly to 6.0% over eight years. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend
by one percent in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of January 1, 1994 by $1,504,000 and the aggregate of the
service and interest components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for
the year ended December 31, 1994 by $127,000. The present value of the
accumulated benefit obligation assumed an 8.0% and a 7.5% discount rate in 1994
and 1993, respectively. The rate of increase used in future compensation levels
was 5.5% in 1994 and 1993.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits"(SFAS No. 112) was issued in November 1992 to
establish accounting for benefits provided to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement. SFAS No. 112 requires that employers accrue
the costs associated with providing benefits, such as salary and benefit
continuation under disability plans, when payment of the benefits is probable
and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Effective January
1, 1994, UJB Financial adopted SFAS No. 112. UJB Financial recognized the
January 1, 1994 SFAS No. 112 transitional liability of $2,663,000. During 1994,
net costs of $2,945,000 were recognized, of which $2,174,000 were paid. At
December 31, 1994, the resultant SFAS No. 112 liability was $3,434,000.

     Management incentive plans have been established with the intention of
providing added incentive to key executives to increase the profits of the
company. The executives and the amount of the awards are subject to limits as
set forth in the plans. Accruals for the plans amounted to $3,258,000,
$1,640,000 and $1,420,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     There is a Savings Incentive Plan which covers substantially all employees
with one or more years of service. The Plan permits eligible employees to make
basic contributions to the Plan up to 3% of base compensation in 1994, 1993 and
1992, and additional contributions up to 12% of base compensation. Under the
Plan, the employer provides a matching contribution equal to 65% in 1992, 1993
and through October 31, 1994 of the basic contributions. Effective November 1,
1994, the employer matching contribution was increased to 100%. Matching
contributions to the Plan amounted to $2,446,000, $2,084,000 and $1,863,000 in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     Certain subsidiaries have other incentive plans and profit sharing
agreements. Accruals under these plans amounted to $1,959,000, $1,826,000 and
$1,525,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     The Incentive Stock and Option Plan and previous Long-Term Performance
Stock Plans of UJB Financial and the VSB Management Recognition and Retention
Plan and Trust provide for the grant of shares of common stock in the form of
restricted stock awards. Shares issued as stock awards were 60,250 in 1994,
73,431 in 1993 and 83,766 in 1992. The shares awarded are subject to certain
forfeiture restrictions as set forth in the Plans.


NOTE 16 STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Stock Option Plans permit UJB Financial common stock to be issued to key
employees of the company and its subsidiaries. The options granted under the
Plans are intended to be either Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified
Options.

     Options have been granted to purchase common stock principally at the fair
market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options are exercisable starting
one year after the date of grant and generally expire ten years from the date of
grant. Upon the exercise of options, proceeds received in excess of par value of
the shares are credited to surplus.

     Changes in options outstanding during the past three years were as follows:

there was a deferred state tax asset of $5,077,000 resulting from operating loss
carry forwards. This asset was reserved by the valuation allowance.

     UJB Financial is not aware of any factors which would generate significant
differences between taxable income and pretax book income in future years except
for the effects of the reversal of current or future net deductible temporary
differences. However, there can be no assurances that there will not be any
significant differences in the future, if circumstances change.

     Management believes, based upon current facts, that more likely than not
there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the net
deferred tax asset. However, there can be no assurance about the level of future
earnings.

     The significant components which affected the net deferred tax asset were
as follows:

NOTE 19 LEASE COMMITMENTS

Non-interest expenses include rentals for premises and equipment of $38,403,000
in 1994, $34,435,000 in 1993 and $31,969,000 in 1992, after reduction for
sublease rentals of $2,684,000, $2,894,000, and $3,164,000 in each of the
respective years. At December 31, 1994, UJB Financial and its subsidiaries were
obligated under a number of non-cancellable leases for premises and equipment,
many of which provide for increased rentals based upon increases in real estate
taxes and the cost of living index. These leases, most of which have renewal
provisions, are principally non-financing leases. Minimum rentals under the
terms of these leases for years 1995 through 1999 are $36,412,000, $29,754,000,
$26,837,000, $20,704,000, and $12,853,000, respectively. Minimum rentals due
after 1999 are $67,974,000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 20 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

UJB Financial and its subsidiaries may, from time to time, be defendants in
legal proceedings relating to the conduct of their business.

     UJB Financial was a defendant in a class action lawsuit brought by
plaintiffs alleged to have owned or purchased securities of UJB Financial.
Following pre-trial discovery, the parties agreed in principle to settle the
action. A portion of this settlement is expected to be recovered through
insurance carried by UJB Financial and the remaining balance has been fully
reserved.

     In the best judgment of management, the consolidated financial position of
UJB Financial and subsidiaries will not be affected materially by the final
outcome of any pending legal proceedings or other contingent liabilities and
commitments.


NOTE 21 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, UJB Financial and its subsidiaries enter
into a variety of financial instruments that are recorded off the balance sheet.
This reporting is considered appropriate where either the exchange of the
underlying asset or liability has not yet occurred or the notional amounts are
used solely as a means to determine the cash flows to be exchanged. These
off-balance-sheet financial instruments are primarily divided into two
categories; credit-related financial instruments and derivative financial
instruments.

     Credit-related financial instruments are principally customer related,
while derivative financial instruments are acquired primarily for
asset/liability management purposes. Credit-related financial instruments
include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial
letters of credit. UJB Financial's derivative financial instruments are limited
to interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, and foreign exchange contracts.

     The following table summarizes the notional amount of significant
off-balance-sheet financial instruments at December 31:

================================================================================
</TABLE>

CREDIT-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Commitments to extend credit are legally
binding agreements to lend to a customer provided all established contractual
conditions are met. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and
usually require the payment of a fee. UJB Financial did not issue fixed-rate 
loan commitments that could be locked in during the commitment period.

     Standby letters of credit are conditional guarantees issued to ensure the
performance of a customer to a third party and are generally terminated through
the fulfillment of a specific condition or through the lapse of time.

     Commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments, generally less
than 180 days, issued to guarantee payment by a customer to a third party upon
proof of an international trade shipment. The short-term nature of these
instruments limit their credit risk.

     Fees received from credit-related financial instruments are recognized over
the terms of the contracts and are generally included in non-interest income in
service and loan fee income.

     The credit risk associated with these financial instruments is essentially
the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. Credit risk is
managed by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding and by applying
normal credit policies. Many of the commitments to extend credit are expected to
expire without being drawn upon and, therefore, the amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash flow requirements.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS At December 31, 1994, the notional value of the
derivative financial instruments portfolio consisted of $923,541,000 of interest
rate swaps, $47,895,000 of interest rate caps and $45,496,000 of foreign
exchange contracts.

     Activities involving interest rate swaps are primarily attributed to
asset/liability risk management efforts. Asset/liability risk management
objectives are aimed at stabilizing net interest income through periods of
changing interest rates. The interest rate swaps were acquired to hedge interest
rate risk on certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

     Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to
exchange interest payments at particular intervals, computed on different terms,
on a specified notional amount. The notional amounts represent the base on which
interest due each counterparty is calculated and do not represent the potential
for gains or losses associated with the market risk or credit risk of such
transactions.

     Under the terms of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 1994, there were
$855,000,000 of contracts to receive fixed payments of 5.90% with an expected
maturity of July 1997, and an average payout based on LIBOR plus .74%.
Additionally, there were $68,541,000 of interest rate swaps to receive payments
at LIBOR and make fixed payments of 5.55% with an expected maturity of January
1996. These swaps have resulted in a decrease of $1,176,000 in net interest
income during 1994 and an increase of $6,775,000 in 1993.

     Credit-related losses can occur in the event of non-performance by the
counterparties to the derivative financial instruments. The credit risk that
results from interest rate swaps is represented by the fair value of contracts
that have a positive value at the reporting date. At December 31, 1994, the
total amount of credit risk was $1,121,000; however, this amount can increase or
decrease if interest rates change. To minimize the risk of credit losses, UJB
Financial monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and only transacts
with those that have AA credit ratings or better.

     Interest rate caps are purchased from brokers to accommodate those
customers who desire interest rate protection on variable rate loans. There is
nominal risk associated with these products as the credit rating of the
counterparty is closely monitored.

     UJB Financial enters into contracts to purchase or sell foreign currency to
be delivered at a future date to facilitate customer transactions. The notional
amount represents the outstanding contracts at year end.

NOTE 22 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which an asset or
obligation could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value estimates are made at a specific
point in time based on the type of financial instrument and relevant market
information.

     Because no quoted market price exists for a significant portion of
UJB Financial's financial instruments, the fair values of such financial
instruments are derived based on the amount and timing of future cash flows,
estimated discount rates, as well as management's best judgment with respect to
current economic conditions. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision.

     The fair value information provided is indicative of the estimated fair
values of those financial instruments and should not be interpreted as an
estimate of the value of UJB Financial taken as a whole. The disclosures do not
address the value of recognized and unrecognized non-financial assets and
liabilities or the value of future anticipated business.

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values
of significant financial instruments at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCES These financial
instruments have relatively short maturities or no defined maturities but are
payable on demand, with little or no credit risk. The carrying amounts reported
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value.

INVESTMENTS AND TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES Trading account securities and
investment securities available for sale are reported at their respective fair
values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These values were based on quoted
market prices. The fair values of investment securities held to maturity were
also based upon quoted market prices.

LOANS The fair value of loans is estimated using a combination of techniques
including discounted estimated future cash flows and, where available, quoted
market prices of similar instruments. The loan portfolios are segmented based
upon loan type, credit quality and repricing characteristics. The fair values of
most fixed-rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models taking
into consideration current rates that would be offered to borrowers with similar
credit risk for loans with similar remaining terms. The fair values of variable
rate loans are estimated by reducing their carrying values by their
corresponding general and specific credit reserves. Non-performing loans are
primarily valued based upon the net realizable value of the loan's underlying
collateral.

DEPOSITS The estimated fair values of demand and savings deposits are equal to
the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts do not
recognize the fair value of core deposit intangibles, which represent the value
of a core deposit base with an expected duration.

     The fair values for medium to long-term deposit liabilities are calculated
by discounting estimated future cash flows using current rates offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities.

BORROWED FUNDS AND BANK ACCEPTANCES The fair values for borrowed funds are
calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows using current rates
offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. Due to the short
maturities of bank acceptances, their carrying value approximates fair value.

LONG-TERM DEBT The fair value of long-term debt is based upon quoted market
prices. For long-term debt issuances where quoted market prices are not
available, the fair values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses.

OTHER The estimated fair values of accrued interest receivable, accrued interest
payable and assets held for accelerated disposition are deemed to be equal to
the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS The estimated fair values of derivative financial
instruments are based upon quoted market prices, without consideration of the
market values related to the hedged on-balance-sheet financial instruments. For
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, the fair values would
approximate fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements.

     The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of
financial instruments at December 31:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 23 CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

UJB Financial's credit policy emphasizes diversification of risk among
industries and borrowers. Concentrations of credit risk, whether on or off the
balance sheet, exist in relation to certain groups of customers or
counterparties. A group concentration arises when a number of customers or
counterparties have similar economic characteristics that would cause their
ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in
economic or other conditions. UJB Financial does not have a significant exposure
to any individual customer or counterparty. At December 31, 1994, the ten
largest credit relationships have outstanding loan balances of $345,858,000 and
have unexercised commitments of $288,357,000.

     UJB Financial's business is concentrated in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania. A significant portion of the total loan portfolio is secured by
real estate or other collateral located in these states. This concentration is
mitigated by the diversification of the loan portfolio among instalment,
residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction and commercial loans.
The commercial loan portfolio, excluding construction and development loans,
represents approximately 41% of the entire loan portfolio and has no
concentration greater than 5% to any specific industry.

NOTE 24 PARENT CORPORATION INFORMATION

As part of the comprehensive restructuring program, on August 31, 1994 UJB
Financial Parent Corporation transferred a significant portion of its operations
to United Jersey Bank. This included the transfer of 649 employees and
$26,269,000 of assets, primarily premises and equipment. Beginning September 1,
1994, the operating results of these functions were recorded in the operating
results and financial condition of United Jersey Bank. UJB Financial Parent
Corporation information is as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT


UJB Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries are responsible for the preparation,
integrity and fair presentation of the audited financial statements contained on
pages 40 through 54 in this report. The statements were prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances
and include amounts that are based on management's estimates and judgments.
Other financial information presented throughout the annual report is prepared
on a basis consistent with these financial statements.

     The financial statements of UJB Financial Corp. have been audited by KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP, independent auditors, whose selection has been ratified by the
shareholders. Their audit was made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards and considered the internal control structure to the extent
deemed necessary to support their independent auditors' report appearing herein.

     UJB Financial Corp. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an
internal control structure to provide reasonable assurance that financial
statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal
control structure, no matter how well designed, including the possibility of
human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and the consideration
of cost in relation to the benefit of the control. Accordingly, even an
effective internal control structure can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of an internal control structure may vary over
time. To monitor compliance, UJB Financial Corp. maintains an internal auditing
program. This program includes a review for compliance with written policies and
procedures and a review of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls.

     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of UJB Financial Corp.,
composed entirely of outside directors, meets periodically with the independent
auditors, management, and internal auditors to review the work of each and
ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The independent
auditors and internal auditors have full and free access to the Committee to
discuss the results of their audit work and their evaluation of internal
controls and the quality of financial reporting.



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Shareholders and Board of Directors
UJB Financial Corp.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UJB Financial
Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1994. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UJB
Financial Corp. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

     As discussed in Notes 1, 15 and 18 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" and
Statement No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" in 1994
and Statement No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" in 1993.
