Item 1.        Business

Varian Associates, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to
as the "Company" or the "Registrant") is a high- technology enterprise which
was founded in 1948.  It is engaged in the research, development, manufacture,
and marketing of products and services for the fields of communications, health
care, industrial production, scientific and industrial research, defense, and
environmental monitoring.  The Company's principal products are health care
systems, analytical instruments, semiconductor production equipment, and
electron devices.  Its foreign subsidiaries engage in some of the
aforementioned businesses and market the Company's products outside the United
States.  As of September 30, 1994, the Company employed approximately 8,100
people worldwide.

The Company sells its products throughout the world and has 37 field sales
offices in the U.S. and 52 sales offices in other countries.  In general, its
markets are quite competitive, characterized by the application of advanced
technology and by the development of new products and applications.  Many of
the Company's competitors are large, well-known manufacturers, and no reliable
information is generally available on their sales of similar products.

There were no material changes in the kinds of products produced or in the
methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.  The Company
anticipates adequate availability of raw materials.

The Company's sales to customers outside of the U.S. for 1994 were $732
million.  The profitability of such sales is subject to greater fluctuation
than U.S. sales because of generally higher marketing costs and changes in the
relative value of currencies.  Additional information concerning the method of
accounting for the Company's foreign currency translation is set forth under
the caption "Foreign Currency Translation" on page 26 of the Annual Report,
which information is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company's operations are grouped into four segments.  These segments, their
products, and the markets they serve are described in the following paragraphs.

The Health Care Systems business manufactures and markets linear accelerators,
cancer treatment planning systems, and data management systems for radiotherapy
centers.  It also designs and manufactures a wide range of X-ray generating
tubes for the medical diagnostic imaging market worldwide.  Linear accelerators
are used in cancer therapy and for industrial radiographic applications.  The
Company's leading CLINAC(R) series of medical linear accelerators, marketed to
hospitals and clinics worldwide, generates therapeutic X-rays and electron
beams for cancer treatment.  LINATRON(R) linear accelerators are used in
industrial applications to X-ray heavy metallic structures for quality control.
The Company is active in four primary medical X-ray imaging market segments:
CT scanner; diagnostic radiographic/fluoroscopic; special procedures; and
mammography.  Backlog for the Health Care Systems business amounted to $281
million and $274 million in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                                       2

Item 1. (continued)

The Instruments business manufactures, sells, and services a variety of
scientific instruments for analyzing chemical substances including metals,
inorganic materials, organic compounds, polymers, natural substances, and
biochemicals.  The products include liquid and gas chromatographs, gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometers, NMR spectrometers, ultraviolet visible-near
infrared spectrometers, atomic absorption spectrometers, inductively coupled
plasma spectrometers, inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometers, data
systems, and small, disposable tools used to prepare chemical samples for
analysis.  Typical applications are biochemical and organic chemical research,
measurement of the chemical composition of mixtures, studies of the chemical
structure of pure compounds, quality control of manufactured materials,
chemical analysis of natural products, and environmental monitoring and
measurement.  The major markets served are environmental laboratories;
pharmaceutical and chemical industries; chemical, life science, and academic
research; government laboratories; and specific areas of the health care
industry.  Backlog for this business amounted to $78 million and $84 million in
fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Company's Semiconductor Equipment business manufactures processing systems
which are essential to making integrated circuits.  A world leader in the
development, manufacture, and application of ion implantation and
sputter-coating systems, Varian equipment is operating in every major wafer
fabrication facility in the world, and its latest models are being used to
develop tomorrow's state- of-the-art devices.  Backlog for this business
amounted to $245 million and $105 million in fiscal 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The discontinuance of the semiconductor equipment distribution
agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited in the U.S. and Europe was completed as
planned effective September 30, 1994.  Semiconductor equipment orders and sales
growth will be moderated by discontinuation of the  distribution of TEL
products.  The impact on Semiconductor Equipment earnings is expected to be
minimal under the terms of the termination, which includes payments to the
Company for certain future TEL sales.

The Company's Electron Devices business holds world leadership positions in
microwave tube and power amplifiers used in satellite communications, radar,
radio and television broadcasting, and other communications applications, as
well as electronic countermeasures and medical diagnostics.  Approximately
one-third of the segment's sales are for defense applications, including
electronic countermeasures, radar, and missile guidance.  About one-half of its
sales are for communication applications, including radio and television
broadcasting and satellite communications.  Industrial markets are also served.
Replacements and spares represent approximately 40 percent of the tube sales,
particularly those used for communications and defense applications.  Backlog
for this segment amounted to $155 million and $142 million in fiscal 1994 and
1993, respectively.  On October 20, 1994, the Company announced that it will
seek a buyer for the Electron Devices operations.  The sale will not go forward
unless the selling price recognizes the increased profitability and improving
value attained in the business in recent years.

Additional information regarding the Company's lines of business and
international operations are incorporated herein by reference from the
information provided under the captions "Industry Segments" and "Geographic
Segments" on pages 34-35 of the Annual Report.

Item 1.  (continued)


The Company maintains in-house patent attorneys, holds numerous patents in the
United States and in other countries, and has many patent applications pending
in the U.S. and in other countries.  The Company considers the development of
patents through creative research and the maintenance of an active patent
program to be advantageous in the conduct of its business, but does not regard
the holding of patents as essential to its operations.  The Company grants
licenses to reliable manufacturers on various terms and cross-licensing
arrangements with other parties.  Information regarding the Company's research
and development costs is incorporated herein by reference from the information
provided under the caption "Research and Development" on page 28 of the Annual
Report.

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state and/or local
laws regulating the discharge of materials to the environment or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment.  The Company is also involved in
various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the
direction of or in consultation with federal, state and/or local agencies at
certain current or former Company facilities (see the information provided
under the captions "Management's Discussion and Analysis" and "Contingencies"
on pages 19-20 and 33, respectively, of the Annual Report, which information is
incorporated herein by reference).  The Company has established reserves for
these matters, which reserves management believes are adequate.  Based on
information currently available, management believes that the Company's
compliance with laws which have been adopted regulating the discharge of
materials to the environment or relating to the protection of the environment
is otherwise not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.  Also,
estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not
expected to be material in fiscal 1995, nor are they expected to be material in
fiscal 1996.

                      Report of Independent Accountants on

                         Financial Statement Schedules


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
         Varian Associates, Inc.

Our report on the consolidated financial statements dated October 19,1994
appears on page 37 of the 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders of Varian
Associates, Inc. and subsidiary companies (which report and consolidated
financial statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on
form 10-K).  In connection with our audits of such financial statements, we
have also audited the Financial Statement Schedules listed in the index on page
11 of this Form 10-K.

In our opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information required to
be included therein.

                          VARIAN EXECUTIVE CAR PROGRAM



1.    PURPOSE

      It is Varian's policy to provide automobiles for the use of selected key
      management employees who are required to travel frequently on Company
      business and need efficient, reliable transportation available
      immediately.

2.    ELIGIBILITY

      The Vice President, Human Resources, will determine which employees will
      be assigned vehicles under this policy, using the following criteria:

             The employee must:

             (a)    have a major management responsibility;
             (b)    be on call at any time;
             (c)    have a substantial need for auto transportation to travel 
                    to other Varian operations, other companies, universities, 
                    conferences, professional meetings, community and trade 
                    associations, etc.; and
             (d)    need to provide transportation for other employees and 
                    outside visitors on Company business.
             (e)    be in a grade "Q" or above, although there may be some 
                    exceptions made for significant management positions in 
                    grade "P".

      Overall, the need for an employee to have efficient, reliable
      transportation available immediately must be of economic benefit to
      Varian.

      Assignment of a car is not permanent.  If an employee's role and/or
      responsibilities change to where an assigned car is no longer
      appropriate, assignment of a car may be discontinued.

3.    SELECTION OF VEHICLE

      The Vice President, Human Resources, will establish the appropriate lease
      capitalization levels as well as the criteria for selecting Company cars,
      including optional equipment, that will be furnished under this policy.



                                       3

<PAGE>   4
Exhibit 10.10 Attachment A (Continued)


      Fuel-efficient cars are encouraged, but any car selected should be large
      enough to accommodate four adults comfortably.

      Selection of a car and optional equipment within the established criteria
      and lease cost limitation is made through the Corporate Traffic
      Department which will handle the lease and will arrange for delivery
      through a local dealer.

      Employees may exceed their lease capitalization levels by 100% at their
      own expense.  Any excess will be treated as an employee receivable and
      will be deducted from the employee's paycheck over the term of the lease.

4.    AVAILABILITY AND USE OF CAR

      Whenever possible, assigned drivers will make their cars available to
      members of their staff or other Varian employees for business use.

              4.1    Garaging:  The assigned driver is to provide protected 
              parking at the driver's residence.

              4.2    Vehicle Operations:  The assigned driver is responsible 
              for adequate protection of the Company car, ensuring that only 
              licensed operators drive it.  Traffic citations and resultant 
              fines are the employee's responsibility and are not reimbursable.

              4.3    Accident Reporting:  The assigned driver is responsible 
              for reporting all accidents in a timely manner and submitting a 
              completed Varian Accident Report (Form 4470-09-01) to both 
              Corporate Traffic and Corporate Risk Management.  The assigned 
              driver is also responsible for contacting Corporate Traffic for 
              instructions as to disposition and repair of the car.  In order 
              to protect Varian's interests, an assigned driver is responsible 
              for contacting Varian's adjuster as soon as possible following
              an accident that causes personal injury or damage to property of 
              others.  Each assigned driver is provided with a claim kit which 
              should be kept in the car's glove compartment.  The kit contains 
              accident report forms, explains procedures to be followed, and 
              lists toll-free telephone numbers for contacts.

              4.4    Personal Operation:  Company cars may be used for personal 
              driving by the employee, the employee's spouse, and other 
              immediate family members who hold a valid driver's license.

                     Use of a company car by non-family members is  permitted 
              at the discretion of

Exhibit 10.10, Attachment A (Continued)


             the employee, provided the user possesses a valid driver's license.

                    4.5    Loss Control Program:  The assignment of a company
             vehicle  is a privilege that requires drivers to maintain good
             driving records. Therefore, the company will conduct a confidential
             annual screening of  the employees' driving records to ensure that
             such records are  maintained in good order.  The point system used
             by the California  Department of Motor Vehicles will be the
             governing criteria, unless the criteria of the jurisdiction in
             which the vehicle is operated is more stringent.  If the guideline
             is exceeded, Risk Management will coordinate a confidential review
             of the record with the employee's supervisor, Human Resources, and
             the Legal Department.  If the  decision is made to remove the
             company vehicle, the employee must  return it promptly and in good
             condition.  Thereafter, at management's discretion, the employee
             may be placed on a car allowance program.  An employee may also be
             reinstated to the program, at management's discretion, once
             his/her driving record falls within the acceptable Department of
             Motor Vehicles guidelines.

                    To comply with the company's loss control program, 
             employees are asked to complete the attached form and return it to 
             Risk Management as soon as they are notified of participation in 
             the program.  This provision does not apply to Company Officers.

5.    INSURANCE

      The following coverages are provided by Varian or its insurance carriers
      for accidents involving Company cars.

             5.1    Public Liability:  This coverage protects the Company and
      the employee (including licensed drivers in the employee's immediate
      family) against claims resulting from personal injuries to others or
      damage to the property of others.

             5.2    Collision/Comprehensive:  For accidents that occur during
      business driving, Varian pays the entire cost of repairs.  For accidents
      that occur during personal use of a Company car, the employee is
      responsible for the first $200.00 of repair costs regardless of fault.
      The employee will be reimbursed the $200.00 if Varian collects from the
      other party involved.

             5.3    Personal Injury:  Injuries incurred by an employee while
      driving (or riding as a passenger) on Company business are covered under
      Workers' Compensation benefits.  Injuries incurred by an employee when
      the Company car is being used for personal driving and injuries incurred
      by family members, whether the car is being used for business or





                                       5

Exhibit 10.10, Attachment A (Continued)


      personal reasons, will be covered by whichever Company-sponsored or       
      private health plan the injured person is covered.

             5.4    Personal Property:  Varian carries insurance to cover the
      loss of Company property by theft or damage.  Employees should take all
      possible steps to avoid theft by concealing briefcases and other property
      from view and always locking cars when unattended.  This insurance does
      not cover an employee's or family member's personal property which should
      be insured under a Homeowner's or Personal Articles Floater policy.

             5.5    Driving to Canada or Mexico:  Canadian authorities require
      a certificate of insurance before a car is allowed across the border.
      This certificate may be obtained from the Corporate Risk Management
      Office.

                    Travel across the Mexican border requires Mexican insurance
      for collision, comprehensive, and liability coverages which may be
      obtained at the border.  Varian reimburses an employee for the expense if
      travel is business related.  The expense is not reimbursed if travel is
      for personal reasons.

6.    OPERATING EXPENSES

      Varian will reimburse employees for all normal operating expenses such as
      fuel, lubricating oils, fluids and necessary car washes.

      Reimbursement may be obtained by submitting a monthly expense report with
      appropriate receipts attached.  These expense reports should be submitted
      to the appropriate Controller for approval.

7.    SERVICE AND REPAIRS

      Company cars must be maintained in presentable, reliable and safe
      operating condition and available for intended use.  Varian will pay for
      periodic maintenance and service for lubrications, wheel alignments,
      tune-ups, replacement of tires and batteries, repairs, etc.  Normal wear
      and tear is expected; however, excessive costs will not be paid to
      maintain cars in "showroom condition."

      A Company car should be returned to the dealer through which the car was
      obtained for any adjustments or repairs covered under the factory
      warranty.  When the factory warranty expires, a driver identification
      card will be provided which is honored for service, repairs, and
      replacement parts at designated repair establishments.  Contact the
      Corporate Fleet Administrator on any question regarding major service and
      repairs.

8.    TAXABILITY

      For tax purposes, the company considers all expenses and lease costs, up
      to the lease capitalization cost limit, to be personal expenses which
      will be reported as additional income on the employee's W-2.  To make
      this program effectively tax neutral to an employee, the company will
      apply a tax gross-up to this income.  This gross-up will be determined
      annually by the Tax Department.

             Example:  Assume  $1,000 of taxable compensation and a gross-up of
             $650 (65% of $1,000):

<TABLE>                   
                                                  
                    <S>                                                      <C>
                    Taxable payment including gross-up - $1,650
                    Federal tax on $1,650 @ 33%                              $545
                    State tax on $1,650 @ 9.3%                                153
                    Federal tax benefit of deduction for
                     State tax of $153 @ 33%                                  (50)
                                                                             ----

                           Total tax                                         $648
                                                                             ====
</TABLE>

9.    SERVICE LIFE

      An executive car is normally retained in service for 30 months or 55,000
      miles, whichever occurs first.  It is the employee's responsibility to
      notify Corporate Human Resources when their car will be turned in and to
      initiate the process of ordering a replacement vehicle.

10.   PURCHASE OPTION

      An assigned driver has the option of purchasing the car, at the time it
      would otherwise be taken out of service, at a price to be determined on
      the fair market value or a predetermined depreciation schedule, depending
      on the terms of the individual's participation in the plan. The price
      information will be provided to the employee by the leasing company, and
      the purchase of the car will be coordinated directly between the leasing
      company and the employee.

      Any repairs that are performed in the 12 months prior to the vehicle's
      purchase will be amortized at 8% per month; the unamortized cost of these
      repairs will be added to the fair market value to establish the vehicle's
      sale price.

                       INCENTIVE AND SEPARATION AGREEMENT


         This Incentive and Separation Agreement ("Agreement"), dated as of
September 14, 1994, is by and between Varian Associates, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Company") and Al D. Wilunowski ("Employee").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Company has decided to explore the possibility of selling
the Company's Electron Devices Business ("Business") and has requested that
Employee continue to manage the on-going operations of the Business and, if a
decision is made to sell the Business, to assist the Company with the sale of
the Business; and

         WHEREAS, Employee's position with the Company will be eliminated if
the Business is sold; and

         WHEREAS, Employee and the Company have discussed the foregoing and on
the basis of each party's own considerations have reached a mutual
understanding, as provided for in this Agreement, for Employee's assistance
with the sale of the Business and the eventual voluntary termination of
Employee's employment with the Company; and

         WHEREAS, both Employee and the Company intend that this Agreement will
mutually, amicably and finally resolve and compromise all issues and claims
relating to or involving Employee's employment by the Company and the voluntary
termination of that employment if and when the Business is sold.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of and subject to all of the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Employee and the Company agree as
follows:

1.   EMPLOYMENT.

         1.1   PRIOR TO SALE OF BUSINESS.  Until such time that (a) the
Business is sold and/or discontinued, (b) Employee voluntarily resigns, or (c)
Employee is terminated for cause as defined by Company policies ("Cause"),
Employee will continue in his current capacity as Executive Vice President, in
accordance with the current terms and conditions of his employment, subject to
Company policies and procedures, and with compensation and benefits provided in
the ordinary course.  Employee acknowledges that this Agreement does not
guarantee Employee continued employment or the terms of that employment, and
the Company maintains the absolute right to manage the Business and determine
the terms of any sale and/or discontinuation of the Business.

         1.2   UPON SALE OF THE BUSINESS.  If Employee is still actively
employed by the Company on the date that sale and/or discontinuation of the
Business is closed and/or completed ("Final

Work Day"), (a) Employee will become an inactive employee and will cease to be
an Executive Vice President, officer or active employee of the Company, and (b)
Employee will tender his voluntary and unqualified resignation of employment
with the Company, which will be accepted by the Company as of the Final Work
Day to be effective on the date when Employee receives the final salary payment
provided for in Section 3.1 ("Separation Date").  During the period from the
Final Work Day to the Separation Date ("Salary Continuation Period"), Employee
will not be expected to perform regular work for the Company, but will (i)
provide the Company with information and assistance regarding Employee's prior
acts and responsibilities, which information and assistance will be provided
without any additional compensation, and (ii) refrain from taking any action
detrimental to the Company.

         1.3   REEMPLOYMENT.  During the Salary Continuation Period, Employee

immediately notify the Company in writing upon obtaining any Reemployment.
"Reemployment" means (a) full-time employment other than with the Company, (b)
full-time self-employment, or (c) performance for compensation of twenty (20)
hours or more per week of consulting services.

2.   INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.

sale of the Business, if a decision is made to sell the Business, the Company
will pay to Employee a  fixed bonus of $200,000 on the Final Work Day.  This
fixed bonus will not be paid if the Company does not sell and/or discontinue
the Business or if prior to such date Employee voluntarily terminates his
employment with the Company or his employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause.

         2.2   INCENTIVE BONUS.  In consideration of Employee's assistance in a
sale of the Business, if a decision is made to sell the Business, the Company
will pay to Employee an incentive bonus based on the aggregate sale price for

                 <S>                                       <C>
                    [     *     ]                           $25,000
                                                            $50,000
                                                           $100,000
                                                           $150,000

3.   OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.

         3.1   SALARY.  If Employee is employed by a buyer of the Business,
Employee's salary will end as of the Final Work Day.  If Employee (a) is not
employed by a buyer of the Business, or (b) is so employed but such employment
is involuntarily terminated within six (6) months of its commencement, then for
a period of one (1) year from and after the Final Work Day or the termination
of such employment, as the case may be, the Company will pay to Employee the
same salary he was earning as of the Final Work Day; provided, however, that
such salary will be reduced by the amount of any severence payments made to
Employee in the event of termination of employment with a buyer.  In the event
of Employee's Reemployment (other than by a buyer of the Business) during this
one-year period, the Company will promptly pay to Employee in a lump-sum the
balance of the annual base salary which he would otherwise have been paid
during the one-year period based on the foregoing.   If at the end of the
one-year period after the Final Work Day Employee has not obtained
Reemployment, the Company will continue to pay to Employee the annual base
salary he was earning as of the Final Work Day, (a) for a period of six (6)
additional months, or (b) until Employee obtains Reemployment, whichever first

provided, however, that any such award will be pro-rated for the period prior

discontinuation of the Business is closed and/or completed will be based 100%
on corporate performance objectives.

         3.3   LTI AWARDS.  Employee will be eligible for an award under the
Long-Term Incentive feature of the Company's Omnibus Stock Plan ("LTI") for the
fiscal 1992-1994 cycle.  Employee will be eligible for awards under the LTI for
any fiscal cycles subsequent to the fiscal 1992-1994 cycle which begin prior to
the Final Work Day; provided, however, that any such awards will be pro-rated
for the period prior to the Final Work Day.  Any award for a fiscal cycle in
which the sale and/or discontinuation of the Business is closed and/or
completed will be based 100% on corporate performance objectives.

         3.4   RESTRICTED STOCK.  Restricted stock will be treated as follows:

                 3.4.1   Employee will be eligible for restricted stock grants

INCENTIVE AND SEPARATION AGREEMENT (Continued)


salary he was earning on his Final Work Day.  If Employee elects to use
outplacement services, the Company will provide to Employee a list of
outplacement firms with which the Company has existing relationships, Employee
will select a firm from that list to provide outplacement services to Employee,
and the Company will pay the charges of that outplacement firm.  If Employee
elects to receive the amount described above, the Company will pay it to
Employee within fourteen (14) days after receiving Employee's election.

         4.2   DELIVERY OF MATERIALS AND CONFIDENTIALITY.  On the Final Work

executed previously by Employee, a form of which is attached as Exhibit A,
which prohibits disclosure of certain Company's information even after the
Separation Date.

         4.3   NON-DISCLOSURE.  Until such time that this Agreement is publicly
disclosed, Employee will not disclose or communicate the terms of this
Agreement to (a) any persons other than those within his immediate family
and/or his counselor(s), each of whom will be advised by him to keep such
communication and the terms of this Agreement confidential, and (b) the
Company's legal or other specifically authorized representatives, unless
otherwise compelled by legal process.  Any other disclosure by Employee, his
family or his counselor(s) will be deemed a disclosure by Employee constituting
a material breach of the Agreement.   Upon proof of such a disclosure, the
Company may recover the amount of $20,000 in liquidated damages and not as a
penalty or forfeiture.  In addition, upon proof by the Company before the
Separation Date of such a disclosure, the Company may immediately terminate
this Agreement and discontinue all benefits hereunder, other than those
required by law.  Employee expressly agrees that this provision is reasonable
under the circumstances that exist when he executes this Agreement and further
represents that the benefits and other consideration conferred by this
Agreement are sufficient to bind his release under Section 5, even under
circumstances where the Company terminates this Agreement before the Separation

         4.6   SUBSEQUENT REGULATORY CHANGES.  In the event that any
governmental regulation applicable to a Company compensation or benefit plan
under which payments or benefits are to be provided to Employee under this
Agreement would prohibit any such payment or benefit, or

would jeopardize the regulatory qualification or status of any such plan if
such payment or benefit is provided to Employee, the Company will not be
obligated to make such payment or to provide such benefit to Employee;
provided, however, that the Company will to the extent permitted under such
regulations provide Employee with comparable compensation.

         4.7   UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.  Employee will not file or make any
claim for unemployment insurance for any period after the Final Work Day.

5.   RELEASE.

         5.1   RELEASE OF CLAIMS.  On behalf of himself, his heirs and
successors, Employee forever releases and discharges the Company, its
employees, directors, agents and affiliates, from any all known or unknown
claims or obligations, whether in contract, covenant, tort or based on or
through any federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance relating
to or arising out of Employee's relationship with the Company or the
termination of that employment.  This release includes, without limitation, a
waiver of all claims (a) for "wrongful discharge," (b) for breach of any
express or implied contract of employment, (c) for severance pay or other
compensation other than as provided for in this Agreement, (d) for statutory
workers' compensation insurance that Employee may make based on accidents or
alleged injuries occurring after the Final Work Day, (e) for unemployment
insurance for any period after the Final Work Day, (f) under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991, (g) under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967, (h) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, and (i) under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act;
provided, however, that this release does not include any claims Employee may
have, but of which he is currently unaware, (1) for statutory workers'
compensation insurance, and (2) for indemnification under the provisions of the
California Labor Code, Delaware law, the Company's Bylaws, the Company's
Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Indemnity Agreement referred to in
Section 4.6.

         It is further understood and agreed that as part of the consideration
and inducement for the execution of this Agreement which is intended to release
the Company and its related parties identified above of and from any and all
claims of every nature and kind whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, Employee also specifically waives the provisions of California
Civil Code Section 1542 and any similar provisions of the law of other
jurisdictions.  Section 1542 provides:

         "A general release does not extend to claims which the 
         creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his/her 
         favor at the time of executing the release, which if 
         known by him/her must have materially affected his/her 
         settlement with the debtor."

         This Section 5.1 will be deemed renewed and restated by Employee on
the Final Work Day and on the Separation Date.

         5.2   NO CONTEST.  If Employee or any person acting on Employee's
behalf in any way contests this Section 5, Employee will return to the Company
all payments made by the Company to Employee under Section 3 of this Agreement.

         5.3   NO ADMISSIONS.  Neither the proposal of this Agreement, its
execution nor its performance is or will in any way be considered an admission
of any liability by Employee or the Company.

6.   MISCELLANEOUS.

         6.1   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  Employee has read this entire Agreement,
understands its provisions, and is not executing this Agreement in reliance on

                                   AGREEMENT


IN CONSIDERATION of my employment or the continuance of my employment by VARIAN
ASSOCIATES, INC.,  I agree as follows:

1.       For the purpose of this Agreement the term "the Company" shall include
VARIAN ASSOCIATES, INC., its subsidiaries and/or its affiliates in which VARIAN
ASSOCIATES, INC. now or hereafter during the term of this Agreement owns more
than twenty percent of the stock eligible to vote for directors and the
assignees and licensees of VARIAN ASSOCIATES, INC., its subsidiaries and
affiliates.

2.       I agree that all information and know-how, whether or not in writing,
of a private, secret or confidential nature concerning the Company's business
affairs, including its inventories, products, processes, projects,
developments, and plans are and shall be the property of the Company, and I
will not disclose the same to unauthorized persons or use the same for any
unauthorized purposes without written approval by an officer of the Company,
either during or after the term of my employment, until such time as such
information has become public knowledge.  I also agree to treat all U.S.
Government classified information and material in the manner specified by
applicable Government regulations.

3.       I agree that all files, letters, memos, reports, sketches, drawings,
laboratory notebooks or other written material containing matter of the type
set forth in paragraph 2 above which shall come into my custody or possession
shall be and are the exclusive property of the Company to be used by me only in
the performance of Company duties and that all such records or copies thereof
in my custody or possession shall be delivered to the Company upon termination
of my employment.

4.       I agree that my obligation not to disclose or use proprietary or
confidential information of the types set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 above
also extends to such types of information of customers of the Company or
suppliers to the Company who may have disclosed or entrusted such information
to the Company or me in the course of business.

5.       I hereby assign and agree to assign to the Company or its designees
all my right, title and interest in and to all inventions, improvements,
discoveries, or technical developments, whether or not patentable, which I,
solely or jointly with others, may conceive or reduce to practice during the
term of my employment and which are conceived or first actually reduced to
practice (a) in the utilization by the Company of my services in a technical or
professional capacity in the areas of research, development, marketing,
management, engineering or manufacturing, or (b) pursuant to any project of
which I am a participant or member and that is either financed or directed by
the Company, or (c) at the Company's expense, in whole or in part.  All other
inventions, improvements, discoveries or technical developments shall remain my
property.

6.       I agree to promptly disclose to and to cooperate with the Company or
its designee, both during and after employment, with respect to the procurement
of patents for the establishment and maintenance of the Company's or its
designee's rights and interests in said inventions, improvements, discoveries
or developments, and to sign all papers which the Company may deem necessary or
desirable for the purpose of vesting the Company or its designee with such
rights, the expense thereof  to be borne by the Company.

7.       Since I am to assign to the Company certain inventions which I may
conceive or first actually reduce to practice after I enter the employ of the
Company, I have listed below all those inventions which I own at this time and
which  I believe should be brought to the attention of the Company to avoid
future misunderstandings as to ownership.

others, in the course of or under any contracts that the Company now has or may
have pertaining to work for the Atomic Energy Commission during the term of my

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Net earnings for 1994 grew 73% to  $79.4 million ($2.22 per share),
compared to the $45.8 million ($1.26 per share) earned in the prior year.
1992's net earnings were $38.6 million ($1.02 per share).  Earnings for the
fourth quarter of 1994 rose 50% over the prior year's quarter to $27.0 million
($0.76 per share).

         Orders for the year reached a new high of $1.71 billion.  Fourth
quarter orders of $421 million were up 16% from the year- ago quarter.   Sales
for the year rose 18% to a record $1.55 billion, from the prior year's $1.31
billion, and also reached a quarterly high of $441 million.  Backlog at the end
of the year was $775 million compared to $627 million and $561 million at years
ended 1993 and 1992, respectively.

         Varian's four core businesses all benefited from the combination of
good order levels and improved efficiency.

         Good worldwide demand for Varian's cancer therapy equipment and X-ray
tubes drove orders and sales for the Company's Health Care Systems business up
10% over 1993.  Profits climbed 15% from the prior year.  Backlog rose slightly
over last year's level.  The good performance reflected both the Company's
continued strength in the radiation oncology market as well as strong results
from its X-ray tube business.  In the latter sector, steps to strengthen its
distribution system and relationships with key original equipment manufacturers
more than offset soft demand for the diagnostic equipment that uses the tubes.
Demand for radiation therapy equipment continued to grow on a worldwide basis
due to its efficacy and cost-effectiveness.  The Company's multi-year program
to expand its share of the overseas market resulted in 35% of 1994 orders
coming from international customers.

         Instruments orders advanced slightly during the year, as strength in
the Company's vacuum products line overcame the effects of generally slow
demand in the analytical instrument market.  Sales rose 6%, while operating
profits declined slightly from 1993, because of competitive industry pricing
conditions.  Backlog also declined 6% from the prior year.

         Orders for Varian's Semiconductor Equipment business rose 87% over
1993 to $610 million, as chip manufacturers worldwide continued to invest in
new equipment for the next generation of advanced devices.  Sales climbed 64%
from 1993's level, and operating profits reached $36 million, rising from $1
million in 1993.  Backlog more than doubled to $245 million at year's end.  The
upswing in Semiconductor Equipment performance was based on strong global
demand for all of its major product lines.   Continued market growth in the
U.S. and Korea was further strengthened by improving momentum in Europe and
recently in Japan.  The discontinuance of the semiconductor equipment
distribution agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited in the U.S. and Europe was
completed as planned effective September 30, 1994.  Semiconductor equipment
orders and sales growth will be moderated by discontinuation of the
distribution of TEL products.  The impact on Semiconductor Equipment earnings
is expected to be minimal under the terms of the termination, which includes
payments to the Company for certain future TEL sales.

         Orders for the Electron Devices business increased 7% during 1994,
with modest growth in both the commercial and defense sectors.  Sales fell
slightly, but operating profits rose 50% over 1993, an increase for the second
year in a row.  The profit improvement was evident across a wide variety of
product lines in 1994.  Backlog advanced 9% from year-end 1993.

         Spending on research and development continued at approximately 5% of
sales.  Research and development expense in 1994 was $81.3 million, compared to
$73.9 million and $76.7 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

         Net interest expense in 1994 declined to $2.0 million compared to $4.5
million and $3.2 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

         The effective tax rate for 1994 was 38%, the same as both of the two
preceding years.  See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition remained strong during 1994.  Operating
activities provided cash of $120.3 million compared to $89.8 million in 1993.
Investing activities used $51.4 million, and $57.9 million in 1994, and

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

1993, respectively, mainly for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.  
Financing activities used $61.4 million during 1994 as compared to $28.1 
million during 1993.  $36.1 million was used to buy back shares of the
Company's outstanding stock under a share reduction program, and to offset the
issuance of stock to employees.  Net payments of $18.1 million decreased total
debt as a percentage of total capital to 12.7% at the end of  fiscal 1994 as
compared with 16.8% a year ago.  Cash and cash equivalents were $78.9 million
at year-end, exceeding all short- and long-term debt of $65.2 million.  The
ratio of current assets to current liabilities remained at 1.55 to 1 at fiscal
year-end 1994, unchanged from fiscal year-end 1993.  Quarterly dividends were
increased from $.05 to $.06 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 1994.
The Company has available $50 million in unused lines of credit.


OUTLOOK

         Despite the favorable financial results described above, future
revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict.  The Company continues
to face various risks associated with its business operations including
uncertain general worldwide economic conditions, lingering worldwide
recessionary conditions, new product acceptance, and uncertainty regarding
possible legislation and private initiatives in the U.S. to control health care
costs.  Such conditions could affect the Company's future performance.

         On October 20, 1994, the Company announced that it will seek a buyer
for the Electron Devices operations.  The sale will not go forward unless the
selling price recognizes the increased profitability and improving value
attained in the business in recent years.

         The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or
local laws regulating the discharge of materials to the environment or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, such as discharges to
soil, waters, and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
and disposal of waste and hazardous substances.  These laws have the effect of
increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of such
operations.  The Company has also been named by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended, at seven sites to which Varian is alleged to have shipped
manufacturing waste for disposal.  The Company is also involved in various
stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the direction
of, or in consultation with, local and/or state agencies at certain current or
former Company facilities.  Uncertainty as to  (a) the extent to which the
Company caused, if at all, the conditions being investigated, (b) the extent of
environmental contamination and risks, (c) the applicability of changing and
complex environmental laws, (d) the number and financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties, (e) the stage of the investigation and/or
remediation, (f) the unpredictability of investigation and/or remediation costs
(including as to when they will be incurred), (g) applicable clean-up
standards, (h) the remediation (if any) which will ultimately be required, and
(i) available technology make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope
of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future
costs of such activities if undertaken.  In addition, the Company believes that
it has rights to contribution and/or reimbursement from financially viable,
potentially responsible parties and/or insurance companies, and has filed a
lawsuit against 36  insurance companies with respect to most of the
above-referenced sites.  The Company has established reserves for these
environmental matters, which reserves management believes are adequate.  Based
on information currently available, management believes that the costs of these
matters are otherwise not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition of the Company.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         The management of Varian Associates, Inc. (the Company) is responsible
for the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  This responsibility involves preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reporting data
which objectively reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of
the Company and its subsidiaries.

         In accumulating and controlling its financial data, the Company
establishes and maintains accounting systems designed to ensure adequate
internal controls.  Management believes a high level of internal control is
maintained by the selection and continual training of qualified personnel, by
the establishment and communication of accounting and business policies, and by
internal audits.  In establishing internal controls, management evaluates the
cost of such systems against the benefits received.  Management believes the
internal control systems in use are adequate to prevent significant misuse of
Company assets or misstatement of financial reports.

         Coopers & Lybrand, independent accountants, are engaged to render an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  Their opinion expresses an
informed judgment on whether management's financial statements, considered in
their entirety, present fairly in all material respects, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, the Company's financial condition,
operating results and cash flows.  It is based on procedures described in the
second paragraph of their report, which include obtaining an understanding of
the Company's systems and procedures and performing tests and other procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are
neither materially misleading nor contain material errors.  The audits make
extensive  tests of Company procedures.  It is neither practical nor necessary
for them to scrutinize a large portion of the Company's transactions.

         The Board of Directors, through its Audit and Corporate Responsibility
Committee consisting of five independent directors, is responsible for engaging
the independent accountants and assuring that management fulfills its
responsibilities in the preparation of the financial statements.  The Audit and
Corporate Responsibility Committee discusses audit and financial reporting
matters with both management and Coopers & Lybrand.  To ensure complete
independence, Coopers & Lybrand meets with the Audit and Corporate
Responsibility Committee with and without the presence of management
representatives.

         With the established system of internal accounting controls, internal
audit, and the independent audit by Coopers & Lybrand, the integrity and
objectivity of the Company's financial statements are maintained.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year: 
The Company's fiscal years reported are the 52- or 53- week periods which end
on the Friday nearest September 30.

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany balances, transactions, and stock
holdings have been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in
less-than-majority-owned affiliated companies are stated at equity in the net
assets of these companies.

Foreign Currency Translation:
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside of the United States
representing cash and amounts receivable or payable are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end.  Other accounts including
inventories and property, plant and equipment are translated at historical
exchange rates.  Revenue and expense items are translated at effective rates of
exchange prevailing during each year, except that inventories are charged to
cost of sales and depreciation is expensed at historical exchange rates.  The
aggregate exchange gain (loss) included in general and administrative expenses
for 1994, 1993, and 1992 was $(0.1) million, $(8.3) million, and $4.5 million,
respectively.

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of
operational (sales orders and purchase commitments) and balance sheet exposures
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  When the Company's foreign
exchange contracts hedge operational exposure, the effects of movements in
currency exchange rates on these instruments are recognized in income when the
related revenues and expenses are recognized.  When foreign exchange contracts
hedge balance sheet exposure, such effects are recognized in income when the
exchange rate changes.  Because the impact of movements in currency exchange
rates on foreign exchange contracts generally offsets the related impact on the
underlying items being hedged, these instruments do not subject the Company to
risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates.  At
fiscal year-end 1994, the Company had forward exchange contracts with
maturities of twelve months or less to sell foreign currencies totaling $9.1
million ($5.4 million of British pounds and $3.7 million of Canadian dollars)
and to buy foreign currencies totaling $71.8 million ($14.7 million of British
pounds and $57.1 million of Japanese yen).

Revenue Recognition:
Sales and related cost of sales are recognized primarily upon shipment of
products.  Sales and related cost of sales under long-term contracts to
commercial customers and the U.S. Government are recognized primarily as units
are delivered.


Statements of Cash Flows:
The Company considers currency on hand, demand deposits, and all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and
cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable:
Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $2.4
million at the end of fiscal year 1994 and $2.2 million at the end of fiscal
year 1993.

Inventories:
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (realizable value) using
last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost for the U.S.  inventories of the Health Care
Systems, except X-ray Tube Products, Instruments, and Semiconductor Equipment

segments.  All other inventories are valued principally at average cost.
Approximately half of total gross inventories are valued using LIFO method.  If
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method had been used, inventories would have
been higher than reported by $49.0 million in fiscal 1994, $50.8 million in
fiscal 1993, and $52.0 million in fiscal 1992.  The main components of
inventories are as follows:

Taxes on Earnings:
Effective the beginning of fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes.

The Company elected to adopt this new standard by restating the prior three
years.  Retained earnings for all years restated was decreased by $7.8 million
as a result of adoption, and the income tax provision did not change for any of
the three years restated.  Adopting SFAS 109 has not caused a significant
change in the Company's provision for income taxes.  The adoption has not
caused a change in the Company's reconciliation of the effective tax rate with
the federal statutory rate or a change in the significant components of the
income tax expense.

Postemployment Benefits:
During  1994, the Company adopted SFAS 112, Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits.  Its adoption did not have a material effect on the
financial statements of the Company.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions:
The Company adopted SFAS 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions, during 1994.  Its adoption did not have a material effect
on the financial statements of the Company.

Research and Development:
Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and
future products are expensed currently.  Costs related to research and
development contracts are included in inventory and charged to cost of sales
upon recognition of related revenue.  Total expenditures on research and
development for fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992, were  $93.1 million, $83.4
million, and $86.4 million, respectively, of which $11.8 million, $9.5 million,
and $9.7 million, respectively, were funded by customers.

Computation of Earnings Per Share (Shares in thousands):
Earnings-per-share computations are based on the weighted average common shares
outstanding and common share equivalents (dilutive stock options).  The average
number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the computation of
earnings per share in 1994, 1993, and 1992, was 35,676, 36,292, and 37,912
shares, respectively.  There is no significant difference between fully diluted
earnings per share and primary earnings per share.

Stock Split:
On February 17, 1994, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
in the form of a stock dividend, issued on March 17, 1994, to stockholders of
record on March 3, 1994.  All share and per share information has been restated
to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis.

The unsecured term loans contain covenants which limit future borrowings and
require the Company to maintain certain levels of working capital and operating
results.  At fiscal year-end 1994, the Company was in compliance with all
restrictive covenants of the loan agreements, including a restriction on
payment of cash dividends.  Approximately $44.8 million of retained earnings
were unrestricted for payment of cash dividends.

The annual maturities of long-term debt (in millions) for fiscal years 1995
through 1999, are as follows: $0.1, $0.1, $0.1, $12.1, and $12.1.

Interest paid (in millions) on short and long-term debt was $6.4, $6.4, and
$6.1, in fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.



OMNIBUS STOCK AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS (SHARES IN THOUSANDS)

During fiscal 1991, the Company adopted the Omnibus Stock Plan (the Plan) under
which shares of common stock can be issued to officers, directors, and key
employees.  The maximum number of shares of common stock available for awards
under the Plan during each fiscal year (including incentive stock options) is
5% of the total outstanding shares of the Company on the last business day of
the preceding fiscal year.  The maximum number of shares of the common stock
available for incentive stock option grants under the Plan is 6,000.  The
exercise price for incentive and nonqualified stock options granted under the
Plan may not be less than 100% and 50%, respectively, of the fair market value
at the date of the grant.  Options granted will be exercisable at such times
and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as determined by the
Organization and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors,
but no option shall be exercisable later than ten years from the date of grant.
Restricted stock grants may be awarded at prices ranging from 0% to 50% of the
fair market value of the stock and may be subject to restrictions on
transferability and continued employment as determined by the Organization and
Compensation Committee.

Options granted are generally exercisable in cumulative installments of
one-third each year, commencing one year following date of grant, and expire if
not exercised within seven or ten years from date of grant.

Options were outstanding at prices ranging from $10.60 to $38.31 per share at
fiscal year-end 1994.  Options were exercised at prices ranging from $10.60 to
$24.25 for fiscal 1994, $10.60 to $23.72 for fiscal 1993, and $10.60 to $16.63
for fiscal 1992.

During fiscal years 1994, 1993, and 1992, 64, 15, and 82, shares, respectively,
were awarded under restricted stock grants at no cost to the employees.  The
restricted stock grants vest over a three year period.  Compensation expense
from restricted stock was approximately $1.2 million, $0.9 million, and $1.2
million, in fiscal years 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) covers substantially all employees in
the United States and Canada.  The participants' purchase price is the lower of
85% of the closing market price on the first or last trading day of the fiscal
quarter.  The discount is treated as equivalent to the cost of issuing stock
for financial reporting purposes.  During fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992, 266
shares, 382 shares, and 466 shares, were issued under the ESPP for $7.0
million, $6.3 million, and $6.6 million,  respectively.  At fiscal year-end
1994, the Company had a balance of 3,330 shares reserved for ESPP.


PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS (SHARES IN THOUSANDS)

At fiscal year-end, there were issued and outstanding 33,979 preferred stock
purchase rights (one right for each outstanding common share).  Each right
entitles the holder to buy one two-hundredth of a share of the Company's Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $62.50.  Of the 1,000 shares of
authorized preferred stock, 280 shares have been designated as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, to be issued upon exercise of the rights.  Upon
issuance, these preferred shares will have certain voting, dividend, and
liquidation preferences over the common stock, as described in the Rights
Agreement of August 25, 1986, as amended.

The rights are exercisable ten days after a person or group has acquired 15% or
more of the Company's voting stock, or the tenth day (or such later date as may
be determined by the Board of Directors) after the date of the commencement of
announcement of a person's or group's intention to commence a tender or
exchange offer whose consummation will result in the ownership of 30% or more
of stock.  If a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


the voting stock, each right would entitle the holder, other than the acquiring
person or group, to buy shares of the Company's Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, having a market value of $125, for the exercise price of
$62.50.  If the Company were to be merged into another entity, or merged with
another entity, and the common stock were changed into other securities or
assets, each right would entitle the holder to purchase for the exercise price
of $62.50 common stock of the acquiring company equal to a market value of
twice the exercise price, or $125.

The rights expire on August 25, 1996, but may be redeemed by the Board of
Directors of the Company  for $.025 per right at any time before they become
exercisable.


RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company has defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially
all of its domestic and Canadian employees.  The Company's major obligation is
to contribute an amount based on a percentage of each participant's base pay.
The Company also contributes 5% of its consolidated earnings from continuing
operations before taxes, as adjusted for discretionary items, as retirement
plan profit sharing.  Participants are entitled, upon termination or
retirement, to their portion of the retirement fund assets, which are held by a
third-party trustee.  In addition, a number of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement plans for regular full-time
employees.  Total pension expense for all plans amounted to $23.1 million,
$18.4 million, and $17.9 million, for fiscal 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.

TAXES ON EARNINGS

U.S. federal income tax returns for the years through 1992 have been settled
with the Internal Revenue Service.  It is believed that adequate provision has
been made for all open years and unresolved issues.  The detail of taxes on

LEASE COMMITMENTS

At fiscal year-end 1994, the Company was committed to minimum rentals under
noncancellable operating leases for fiscal years 1995 through 1999 and
thereafter, as follows, in millions: $9.0, $6.8, $4.5, $3.9, $1.9, and $7.1.
Rental expense for fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, in millions, was $20.6,
$23.8, and $24.3, respectively.


CONTINGENCIES


In February 1990, a purported class action was brought by Panache Broadcasting
of Pennsylvania, Inc. on behalf of all purchasers of electron tubes in the U.S.
against the Company and a joint-venture partner, alleging that the activities
of their joint venture in the power-grid tube industry violated antitrust laws.
The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages which may be
trebled under the antitrust laws.  In February 1993, the U.S. District Court in
Chicago granted the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint with leave to
amend.  Panache Broadcasting filed an amended complaint in March 1993.  The
Company's motion to dismiss that complaint was granted in part and denied in
part.  No determination has been made regarding the plaintiff's request to
certify the purported class.  The Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to the Panache lawsuit.

In addition to the above-referenced matter, the Company is currently a
defendant in a number of legal actions and could incur an uninsured liability
in one or more of them.  In the opinion of management, the outcome of the above
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition
of the Company.

The Company has also been named by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or
third parties as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, at
seven sites to which Varian is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for
disposal.  The Company is also involved in various stages of environmental
investigation and/or remediation under the direction of, or in consultation
with, local and/or state agencies at certain current or former Company
facilities.  Uncertainty as to (a) the extent to which the Company caused, if
at all, the conditions being investigated, (b) the extent of environmental
contamination and risks, (c) the applicability of changing and complex
environmental laws, (d) the number and financial viability of other potentially
responsible parties, (e) the stage of the investigation and/or remediation, (f)
the unpredictability of investigation and/or remediation costs (including as to
when they will be incurred), (g) applicable clean-up standards,(h) the
remediation (if any) which will ultimately be required, and (i) available
technology make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further
investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such
activities if undertaken.  In addition, the Company believes that it has rights
to contribution and/or reimbursement from financially viable, potentially
responsible parties and/or insurance companies, and has filed a lawsuit against
36  insurance companies with respect to most of the above-referenced sites.
The Company has established reserves for these environmental matters, which
reserves management believes are adequate.  Based on information currently
available, management believes that the costs of these matters are otherwise
not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of the Company.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On October 20, 1994, the Company announced that it will seek a buyer for the
Electron Devices operations.  The sale will not go forward unless the selling
price recognizes the increased profitability and improving value attained in
the business in recent years.


INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The Company's operations are grouped into four business segments: Health Care
Systems, Instruments, Semiconductor Equipment, and Electron Devices.  Indirect
and common costs have been allocated through the use of estimates.
Accordingly, the following information is provided for purposes of achieving an
understanding of operations, but may not be indicative of the financial results
of the reported segments were they independent organizations.  In addition,
comparisons of the Company's operations to similar operations of other
companies may not be meaningful.

The Health Care Systems business includes linear accelerators used for cancer
therapy, industrial testing, and inspection, as well as cancer treatment
planning systems, and data management systems for medical facilities.  It also
designs and manufactures a broad range of X-ray generating tubes for the
medical diagnostic imaging market worldwide.  The Instruments business consists
of analytical instruments widely used in the fields of chemistry, environmental
monitoring, biology, life sciences, and metallurgy.  It also manufactures high
vacuum pumps, instrumentation, gauges and components.  The Semiconductor
Equipment business includes systems used for semiconductor wafer fabrication.
The Electron Devices business covers a broad line of electron devices used in
broadcasting, communications, and other commercial and military applications.
Included in Eliminations and Other are certain insignificant support
operations.

The Company operates various manufacturing and marketing operations outside the
United States.  No single country outside the United States accounts for more
than 10% of total sales or total assets.  Sales between geographic areas are
accounted for at cost plus prevailing markups arrived at through negotiations
between independent profit centers.  Related profits are eliminated in
consolidation.

Included in the total of United States sales are export sales of $304 million
in fiscal 1994, $207 million in fiscal 1993, and $208 million in fiscal 1992.
Sales under prime contracts from the U.S. Government were approximately $71
million in fiscal 1994, $69 million in fiscal 1993, and $79 million in fiscal
1992.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Varian Associates, Inc.

         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Varian
Associates, Inc. and subsidiary companies as of September 30, 1994 and October
1, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
September 30, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Varian
Associates, Inc. and subsidiary companies as of September 30, 1994 and October
1, 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
