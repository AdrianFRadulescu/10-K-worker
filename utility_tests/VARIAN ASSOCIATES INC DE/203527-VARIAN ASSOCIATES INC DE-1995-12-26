Item 1.      Business

Varian Associates, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to
as the "Company" or the "Registrant") is a high-technology enterprise which was
founded in 1948. It is engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and
marketing of products and services for the fields of health care, industrial
production, scientific and industrial research, and environmental monitoring.
The Company's principal products are health care systems, analytical
instruments, and semiconductor production equipment. Its foreign subsidiaries
engage in some of the aforementioned businesses and market the Company's
products outside the United States. As of September 29, 1995, the Company
employed approximately 6,900 people worldwide.

The Company sells its products throughout the world and has 34 field sales
offices in the U.S. and 53 sales offices in other countries. In general, its
markets are quite competitive, characterized by the application of advanced
technology and by the development of new products and applications. Many of the
Company's competitors are large, well-known manufacturers, and no reliable
information is generally available on their sales of similar products.

There were no material changes in the kinds of products produced or in the
methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year other than the
completion of the sale of the Electron Devices business as described under the
caption "Discontinued Operation" on page 32 of the Annual Report, which
information is incorporated herein by reference. The Company anticipates
adequate availability of raw materials.

The Company's sales to customers outside of the U.S. for 1995 were $797 million.
The profitability of such sales is subject to greater fluctuation than U.S.
sales because of generally higher marketing costs and changes in the relative
value of currencies. Additional information concerning the method of accounting
for the Company's foreign currency translation is set forth under the caption
"Foreign Currency Translation" on page 24 of the Annual Report, which
information is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company's operations are grouped into three segments. These segments, their
products, and the markets they serve are described in the following paragraphs.

The Health Care Systems business manufactures and markets linear accelerators,
simulators for planning cancer treatments, brachytherapy systems and data
management systems for radiation oncology centers. It also designs and
manufactures a wide range of X-ray generating tubes for the medical diagnostic
imaging market worldwide. Linear accelerators are used in cancer therapy and for
industrial radiographic applications. The Company's leading CLINAC(R) series of
medical linear accelerators, marketed to hospitals and clinics worldwide,
generates therapeutic X-rays and electron beams for cancer treatment.
LINATRON(R) linear accelerators are used in industrial applications to X-ray
heavy metallic structures for quality control. The Company is active in four
primary medical X-ray imaging market segments: CT scanner; diagnostic
radiographic/fluoroscopic; special procedures; and mammography. Backlog for the
Health Care Systems business amounted to $293 million and $281 million in fiscal
1995 and 1994, respectively.

The Instruments business manufactures, sells, and services a variety of
scientific instruments for analyzing chemical substances including metals,
inorganic materials, organic compounds, polymers, natural substances, and
biochemicals. The products include liquid and gas

                                       2
<PAGE>   3
Item 1. (continued)

chromatographs, gas chromatograph/mass spectrometers, NMR spectrometers,
ultraviolet visible near infrared spectrometers, atomic absorption
spectrometers, inductively coupled plasma spectrometers, inductively coupled
plasma/mass spectrometers, data systems, and small, disposable tools used to
prepare chemical samples for analysis. Typical applications are biochemical and
organic chemical research, measurement of the chemical composition of mixtures,
studies of the chemical structure of pure compounds, quality control of
manufactured materials, chemical analysis of natural products, and environmental
monitoring and measurement. The major markets served are environmental
laboratories; pharmaceutical and chemical industries; chemical, life science,
and academic research; government laboratories; and specific areas of the health
care industry. The Instruments business includes a facility located in Tempe,
Arizona, that fabricates circuit boards and sub-assemblies for customers inside
and outside the Company. This facility was formerly a part of the Electron
Devices business which was sold as of August 11, 1995. Backlog for the
Instruments business amounted to $111 million and $97 million in fiscal 1995 and
1994, respectively.

The Company's Semiconductor Equipment business manufactures processing systems
which are essential to making integrated circuits. A world leader in the
development, manufacture, and application of ion implantation and sputtercoating
systems, Varian equipment is operating in every major wafer fabrication facility
in the world, and its latest models are being used to develop tomorrow's
state-of-the-art devices. Backlog for this business amounted to $248 million and
$245 million in fiscal 1995 and 1994, respectively. The discontinuance of the
semiconductor equipment distribution agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited in
the U.S. and Europe was completed effective September 30, 1994.

Additional information regarding the Company's lines of business and
international operations are incorporated herein by reference from the
information provided under the captions "Industry Segments" and "Geographic
Segments" on pages 32-33 of the Annual Report.

The Company maintains in-house patent attorneys, holds numerous patents in the
United States and in other countries, and has many patent applications pending
in the U.S. and in other countries. The Company considers the development of
patents through creative research and the maintenance of an active patent
program to be advantageous in the conduct of its business, but does not regard
the holding of patents as essential to its operations. The Company grants
licenses to reliable manufacturers on various terms and cross-licensing
arrangements with other parties. Information regarding the Company's research
and development costs is incorporated herein by reference from the information
provided under the caption "Research and Development" on pages 25-26 of the 
Annual Report.

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local
laws regulating the discharge of materials to the environment or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment. The Company is also involved in
various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the
direction of or in consultation with federal, state, and/or local agencies at
certain current or former Company facilities (see the information provided under
the captions "Management's Discussion and Analysis" and "Contingencies" on pages
17-19 and 30-32 , respectively, of the Annual Report, which information is
incorporated herein by reference). The Company has established reserves for
these matters, which reserves management believes are adequate. Based on
information currently available, management believes that the Company's
compliance with laws which have been adopted regulating the discharge of
materials to the environment or relating to the protection of the environment is
otherwise not reasonably

                                       3

Item 1. (continued)

likely to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings
or competitive position of the Company. Also, estimated capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities are not expected to be material in fiscal 1996,
nor are they expected to be material in fiscal 1997.

                         Financial Statement Schedules

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
        Varian Associates, Inc.

Our report on the consolidated financial statements dated October 18,1995
appears on page 35 of the 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders of Varian
Associates, Inc. and subsidiary companies (which report and consolidated
financial statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form
10-K). In connection with our audits of such financial statements, we have also
audited the Financial Statement Schedule listed in the index on page 10 of this
Form 10-K.

In our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when 
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be
included therein.

series (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding). In case
the number of shares of any such series shall be so decreased, the shares
constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had prior to the
adoption of the resolution or resolutions originally fixing the number of shares
of such series.

         The number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock
of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors.

                                    ARTICLE V

         The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of
Directors of this corporation shall be 15. The directors shall be divided into
three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. The number of directors in each
class shall be 5. Directors of each class shall serve for a term ending on the
third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which such
class was elected, except that the term of office of the initial Class I
directors shall expire on the date of the annual meeting in 1977, the term of
office of the initial Class II directors shall expire on the date of the annual
meeting in 1978, the term of office of the initial Class III directors shall
expire on the date of the annual meeting in 1979. The foregoing notwithstanding,
each director shall serve until his successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified, unless he shall die, resign or be removed.

         At each annual election the directors chosen to succeed those which
terms then expire shall be identified as being of the same class as the
directors they succeed. If for any reason the number of directors in the various
classes shall not conform with the formula set forth in the preceding paragraph,
the Board of Directors may redesignate any director into a different class in
order that the balance of directors in such classes shall conform thereto.

         At all elections of directors of this corporation, each holder of
Common Stock shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of
votes which, except for this provision as to cumulative voting, he would be
entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of
Common Stock, multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and he may
cast all of such votes for a single nominee for director or may distribute them
among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them as he sees fit.

         Eight (8) directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business, and if at any meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less
than a quorum of (8), a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from
time to time. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the whole
Board of Directors, acting at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present,
or acting by written consent, shall be regarded as the act of the Board of
Directors unless a greater number be required by law or by this Certificate of
Incorporation.

                                   ARTICLE VI

         In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law,
the Board of Directors is expressly authorized, by resolution passed by a
majority of the whole board, to make, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of this
corporation.

                                   ARTICLE VII

         This corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal

stockholders are granted subject to this reservation.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

         Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary
way of this corporation or of any creditor of stockholder thereof, or on the
application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under
the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed
for this corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8 of the
Delaware Code, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or
the stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation, as the case may
be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in
number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of this corporation as consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of this corporation, as the case may be,
and also on this corporation.

                                   ARTICLE IX

         Meetings of stockholders may be held outside the State of Delaware, if
the Bylaws so provide. The books of this corporation may be kept (subject to any
provision of law) outside the State of Delaware. Elections of directors need not
be by ballot unless the Bylaws of this corporation shall so provide.

                                    ARTICLE X

         A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for any matter in respect of which such director

Delaware or shall be liable by reason that, in addition to any and all other

or, in failing to act, shall not have acted in good faith, (iii) shall have
acted in a manner involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the
law, or (iv) hall have derived an improper personal benefit. Neither the
amendment nor repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of the
certificate or incorporation inconsistent with this Article X shall eliminate or
reduce the effect of this article X in respect of the matter occurring, or any
cause of action, suit or claim that but for this Article X would accrue or
arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

was adopted by the Board of Directors of this corporation in accordance with
Section 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. It only
restates and integrates and does not further amend the provisions of this
corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation as heretofore amended, and
there is no discrepancy between those provisions and the provisions of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

                         CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION FILED
                        TO CORRECT A CERTAIN ERROR IN THE
                    RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF
                             VARIAN ASSOCIATES, INC.
                     FILED IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF
                       STATE OF DELAWARE ON JUNE 29, 1987

         Varian Associates, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under and
by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,

         DOES HEREBY CERTIFY:

         1.    The name of the corporation is Varian Associates, Inc.

         2.    A Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Varian Associates, 
Inc. was filed by the Secretary of State of Delaware on June 29, 1987, and said
Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires correction as permitted by
subsection (f) of Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

         3.    The inaccuracy or defect of said Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to be corrected was the inadvertent omission from Article IV of
said Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the provisions of the Certificate
of Designations of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of Varian
Associates, Inc., dated August 26, 1986, and filed with the Secretary of State
of Delaware on September 2, 1986, which provides for the designation and amount
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the corporation and the
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof.

         4.    Article IV of said Restated Certificate of Incorporation is
corrected to add to the end of the existing text of said Article IV the
following:

         Pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of the
    Company in accordance with the provisions of its Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock of the Company be, and hereby is,
    created and that the designation and amount thereof and the voting powers,
    preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
    the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations or
    restrictions thereof are as follows:

         Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be
    designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" (the "Series A
    Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting such series shall be
    280,000.

         Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.

         (A)   Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 
    the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
    receive, when, as 

                                       22
<PAGE>   6
Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

    and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available 
    for the purpose, (i) cash dividends in an amount per share (rounded to the 
    nearest cent) equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all 
    cash dividends declared or paid on the Common Stock, $1.00 par value per 
    share, of the Company ("the Common Stock") and (ii) a preferential cash 
    dividend (the "Preferential Dividends"), if any, on the first day of 
    January, April, July and October of each year (each a "Quarterly Dividend 
    Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date 
    after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A 
    Preferred Stock, in an amount equal to $10 per share of Series A Preferred 
    Stock less the per share amount of all cash dividends declared on the 
    Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence since the 
    immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to 
    the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any 
    share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the 
    Company shall, at any time after the issuance of any share or fraction of 
    a share of Series A Preferred Stock, make any distribution on the shares 
    of Common Stock of the Company, whether by way of a dividend or a 
    reclassification of stock, a recapitalization, reorganization or partial 
    liquidation of the Company or otherwise, which is payable in cash or any 
    debt security, debt instrument, real or personal property or any other 
    property (other than cash dividends subject to the immediately preceding 
    sentence, a distribution of shares of Common Stock or other capital stock 
    of the Company or a distribution of rights or warrants to acquire any such 
    share, including any debt security convertible into or exchangeable for 
    any such share, at a price less than the Fair Market Value of such share), 
    then and in each such event the Company shall simultaneously pay on each 
    then outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company a 
    distribution, in like kind, of 100 times such distribution paid on a share 
    of Common Stock (subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set 
    forth). The dividends and distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock to 
    which holders thereof are entitled pursuant to clause (i) of the first 
    sentence of this paragraph and pursuant to the second sentence of this 
    paragraph are hereinafter referred to as "Participating Dividends" and the 
    multiple of such cash and non-cash dividends on the Common Stock 
    applicable to the determination of the Participating Dividends, which shall
    be 100 initially but shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter 
    provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Dividend Multiple". In the 
    event the Company shall at any time after September 3, 1986 declare or pay 
    any dividend or make any distribution on Common Stock payable in shares of 
    Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a combination, 
    consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock 
    into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each 
    such case the Dividend Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination 
    of the amount of Participating Dividends which holders of shares of Series 
    A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be the Dividend 
    Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a 
    fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
    outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
    number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
    such event.

                                       23
<PAGE>   7
Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

         (B)   The Company shall declare each Participating Dividend at the same
    time it declares any cash or non-cash dividend or distribution on the Common
    Stock in respect of which a Participating Dividend is required to be paid.
    No cash or non-cash dividend or distribution on the Common Stock in respect
    of which a Participating Dividend is required to be paid shall be paid or
    set aside for payment on the Common Stock unless a Participating Dividend in
    respect of such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock shall be
    simultaneously paid, or set aside for payment, on the Series A Preferred
    Stock.

         (C)   Preferential Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding 
    shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
    next preceding the date of issuance of any shares of Series A Preferred
    Stock. Accrued but unpaid Preferential Dividends shall cumulate but shall
    not bear interest. Preferential Dividends paid on the shares of Series A
    Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at
    the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a
    share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.

         Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred
    Stock shall have the following voting rights:

         (A)   Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth,
    each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to
    100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
    Company. The number of votes which a holder of Series A Preferred Stock is
    entitled to cast, as the same may be adjusted from time to time as
    hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote Multiple". In
    the event the Company shall at any time after September 3, 1986 declare or
    pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or
    effect a subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or reverse
    split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser
    number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the Vote Multiple
    thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share
    to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled
    after such event shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior to such event
    multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of
    Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of
    which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
    immediately prior to such event.

         (B)   Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Restated Certificate
    of Incorporation or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred 
    Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one 
    class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company.

         (C)   In the event that the Preferential Dividends accrued on the 
    Series A Preferred Stock for four or more quarterly dividend periods, 
    whether consecutive or not, shall not have been declared and paid or set
    apart for payment, the holders of record of Preferred Stock of the Company
    of all series (including the Series A Preferred Stock), other than any
    series in respect of which such right is expressly 

                                       24
<PAGE>   8
Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

    withheld by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the authorizing
    resolutions included in the Certificate of Designations therefor, shall have
    the right, at the next meeting of stockholders called for the election of
    directors, to elect two members to the Board of Directors, which directors
    shall be in addition to the number required by the By-laws prior to such
    event, to serve until the next Annual Meeting and until their successors are
    elected and qualified or their earlier resignation, removal or incapacity or
    until such earlier time as all accrued and unpaid Preferential Dividends
    upon the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid
    (or set aside for payment) in full. The holders of shares of Series A
    Preferred Stock shall continue to have the right to elect directors as
    provided by the immediately preceding sentence until all accrued and unpaid
    Preferential Dividends upon the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
    Stock shall have been paid (or set aside for payment) in full. Such
    directors may be removed and replaced by such stockholders, and vacancies in
    such directorships may be filled only by such stockholders (or by the
    remaining director elected by such stockholders, if there be one) in the
    manner permitted by law; provided, however, that any such action by
    stockholders shall be taken at a meeting of stockholders and shall not be
    taken by written consent thereto.

         (D)   Except as otherwise required by the Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation or by law or set forth herein, holders of Series A Preferred
    Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be
    required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of
    Common Stock as set forth herein) for the taking of any corporate action.

         Section 4. Certain Restrictions.

         (A)   Whenever Preferential Dividends or Participating Dividends are in
    arrears or the Company shall be in default of payment thereof, thereafter
    and until all accrued and unpaid Preferential Dividends and Participating
    Dividends, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock
    outstanding shall have been paid or set aside for payment in full, and in
    addition to any and all other rights which any holder of shares of Series A
    Preferred Stock may have in such circumstances, the Company shall not

               (i)       declare or pay dividends on, make any other 
         distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for
         consideration, any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to
         dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series
         A Preferred Stock;

               (ii)      declare or pay dividends on or make any other 
         distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity as to
         dividends with the Series A Preferred Stock, unless dividends are paid
         ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on
         which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total
         amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled if
         the full dividends accrued thereon were to be paid;

                                       25
<PAGE>   9
Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

               (iii)     except as permitted by subparagraph (iv) of this 
         paragraph 4(A), redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for
         consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to
         dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the
         Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time
         redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock
         in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company ranking junior (both
         as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
         Series A Preferred Stock; or

               (iv)      purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any 
         shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a
         parity with the Series A Preferred Stock (either as to dividends or
         upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), except in accordance with
         a purchase offer made to all holders of such shares upon such terms as
         the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual
         dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the
         respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will
         result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or
         classes.

         (B)   The Company shall not permit any Subsidiary (as hereinafter
    defined) of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
    any shares of stock of the Company unless the Company could, under paragraph
    (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such
    time and in such manner. A "Subsidiary" of the Company shall mean any
    corporation or other entity of which securities or other ownership interests
    having ordinary voting power suffi cient to elect a majority of the board of
    directors or other persons performing similar functions are beneficially
    owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or by any corporation or other
    entity that is otherwise controlled by the Company.

         (C)   The Company shall not issue any shares of Series A Preferred 
    Stock except upon exercise of Rights issued pursuant to that certain Rights
    Agreement dated as of August 5, 1986 between the Company and The First
    National Bank of Boston, a copy of which is on file with the Secretary of
    the Company at its principal executive office and shall be made available to
    stockholders of record without charge upon written request therefor
    addressed to said Secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, nothing
    contained in the provisions hereof shall prohibit or restrict the Company
    from issuing for any purpose any series of Preferred Stock with rights and
    privileges similar to, different from, or greater than, those of the Series
    A Preferred Stock.

         Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
    purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever
    shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All
    such shares upon their retirement and cancellation shall become authorized
    but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series,
    and such shares may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock
    to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors.

Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

         Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any voluntary
    or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, no
    distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of stock ranking
    junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
    up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless the holders of shares of Series A
    Preferred Stock shall have received, subject to adjustment as hereinafter
    provided, (A) $125 per share plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
    dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of
    such payment, or (B) if greater than the amount specified in clause (i)(A)
    of this sentence, an amount equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be
    distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, as the same may be
    adjusted as hereinafter provided, and (ii) to the holders of stock ranking
    on a parity upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up with the Series A
    Preferred Stock, unless simultaneously therewith distributions are made
    ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all other shares of such parity
    stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of shares of
    Series A Preferred Stock are entitled under clause (i)(A) of this sentence
    and to which the holders of such parity shares are entitled, in each case
    upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The amount to which
    holders of Series A Preferred Stock may be entitled upon liquidation,
    dissolution or winding up of the Company pursuant to clause (i)(B) of the
    foregoing sentence is hereinafter referred to as the "Participating
    Liquidation Amount" and the multiple of the amount to be distributed to
    holders of shares of Common Stock upon the liquidation, dissolution or
    winding up of the Company applicable pursuant to said clause to the
    determination of the Participating Liquidation Amount, as said multiple may
    be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter
    referred to as the "Liquidation Multiple". In the event the Company shall at
    any time after September 3, 1986 declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock
    payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a
    combination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of
    Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then
    in each such case the Liquidation Multiple thereafter applicable to the
    determination of the Participating Liquidation Amount to which holders of
    Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled after such event shall be the
    Liquidation Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied
    by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
    outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
    number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
    such event.

         Section 7. Certain Reclassifications and Other Events.

         (A)   In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock of the 
    Company receive after September 3, 1986 in respect of their shares of Common
    Stock any share of capital stock of the Company (other than any share of
    Common Stock of the Company), whether by way of reclassification,
    recapitalization, reorganization, dividend or other distribution or
    otherwise (a "Transaction"), then and in each such event the dividend
    rights, voting rights and rights upon the liquida tion, dissolution or
    winding up of the Company of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
    adjusted so that after such event the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
    shall be entitled, in respect of each share of Series A Preferred 

                                       27

Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

    Stock held, in addition to such rights in respect thereof to which such
    holder was entitled immediately prior to such adjustment, to (i) such
    additional dividends as equal the Dividend Multiple in effect immediately
    prior to such Transaction multiplied by the additional dividends which the
    holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive by virtue of
    the receipt in the Transaction of such capital stock, (ii) such additional
    voting rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such
    Transaction multiplied by the additional voting rights which the holder of a
    share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive by virtue of the receipt
    in the Transaction of such capital stock and (iii) such additional
    distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company as
    equal the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior to such
    Transaction multiplied by the additional amount which the holder of a share
    of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive upon liquidation, dissolution
    or winding up of the Company by virtue of the receipt in the Transaction of
    such capital stock, as the case may be, all as provided by the terms of such
    capital stock.

         (B)   In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock of the 
    Company receive after September 3, 1986 in respect of their shares of Common
    Stock any right or warrant to purchase Common Stock (including as such a
    right, for all purposes of this paragraph, any security convertible into or
    exchangeable for Common Stock) at a purchase price per share less than the
    Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of a share of Common Stock on the
    date of issuance of such right or warrant, then and in each such event the
    dividend rights, voting rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution
    or winding up of the Company of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
    each be adjusted so that after such event the Dividend Multiple, the Vote
    Multiple and the Liquidation Multiple shall each be the product of the
    Dividend Multiple, the Vote Multiple and the Liquidation Multiple, as the
    case may be, in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied by a
    fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
    Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants
    plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired
    upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants and the denominator of
    which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
    before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of
    Common Stock which could be purchased, at the Fair Market Value of the
    Common Stock at the time of such issuance, by the maximum aggregate
    consideration payable upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants.

         (C)   In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock of the 
    Company receive after September 3, 1986 in respect of their shares of Common
    Stock any right or warrant to purchase capital stock of the Company (other
    than shares of Common Stock), including as such a right, for all purposes of
    this paragraph, any security convertible into or exchangeable for capital
    stock of the Company (other than Common Stock), at a purchase price per
    share less than the Fair Market Value of such shares of capital stock on the
    date of issuance of such right or warrant, then and in each such event the
    dividend rights, voting rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or
    winding up of the Company of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
    each be adjusted so that after such event each holder 

                                       28
<PAGE>   12
Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

    of a share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, in respect of each
    share of Series A Preferred Stock held, in addition to such rights in
    respect thereof to which such holder was entitled immediately prior to such
    event, to receive (i) such additional dividends as equal the Dividend
    Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied, first, by the
    additional dividends to which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be
    entitled upon exercise of such right or warrant by virtue of the capital
    stock which could be acquired upon such exercise and multiplied again by the
    Discount Fraction (as hereinafter defined) and (ii) such additional voting
    rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event
    multiplied, first, by the additional voting rights to which the holder of a
    share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon exercise of such right or
    warrant by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such
    exercise and multiplied again by the Discount Fraction and (iii) such
    additional distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
    Company as equal the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior to
    such event multiplied, first, by the additional amount which the holder of a
    share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive upon liquidation,
    dissolution or winding up of the Company upon exercise of such right or
    warrant by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such
    exercise and multiplied again by the Discount Fraction. For purposes of this
    paragraph, the "Discount Fraction" shall be a fraction the numerator of
    which shall be the difference between the Fair Market Value of a share of
    the capital stock subject to a right or warrant distributed to holders of
    shares of Common Stock of the Company as contemplated by this paragraph
    immediately after the distribution thereof and the purchase price per share
    for such share of capital stock pursuant to such right or warrant and the
    denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of such
    capital stock immediately after the distribution of such right or warrant.

         (D)   For purposes of this Section 7, the "Fair Market Value" of a 
    share of capital stock of the Company (including a share of Common Stock) on
    any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing price per
    share thereof over the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is
    hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however,
    that, in the event that such Fair Market Value of any such share of capital
    stock is determined during a period which includes any date that is within
    30 Trading Days after (i) the ex-dividend date for a dividend or
    distribution on stock payable in shares of such stock or securities
    convertible into shares of such stock, or (ii) the effective date of any
    subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or
    reclassification of such stock, then, and in each such case, the Fair Market
    Value shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors of the
    Company to take into account ex-dividend or post-effective date trading. The
    closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in
    case, no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid
    and asked prices, regular way (in either case, as reported in the applicable
    transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted
    to trading on the New York Stock Exchange), or, if the shares are not listed
    or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the
    applicable transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on
    the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed or
    admitted to trading or, 

                                       29
<PAGE>   13
Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

    if the shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national
    securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average
    of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as
    reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
    Quotation System ("NASDAQ") or such other system then in use, or if on any
    such date the shares are not quoted by any such organization, the average of
    the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker
    making a market in the shares selected by the Board of Directors of the
    Company. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal
    national securities exchange on which the shares are listed or admitted to
    trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the shares are not
    listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on which
    the New York Stock Exchange or such other national securities exchange as
    may be selected by the Board of Directors of the Company is open. If the
    shares are not publicly held or not so listed or traded on any day within
    the period of 30 Trading Days applicable to the determination of Fair Market
    Value thereof as aforesaid, "Fair Market Value" shall mean the fair market
    value thereof per share as determined in good faith by the Board of
    Directors of the Company. In either case referred to in the foregoing
    sentence, the determination of Fair Market Value shall be described in a
    statement filed with the Secretary of the Company.

         Section 8. Consolidation, Merger. etc. In case the Company shall enter
    into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which
    the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or
    securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each
    outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be
    similarly exchanged for or changed into the aggregate amount of stock,
    securities, cash and/or other property (payable in like kind), as the case
    may be, for which or into which each share of Common Stock is changed or
    exchanged multiplied by the highest of the Vote Multiple, the Dividend
    Multiple or the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior to such
    event.

         Section 9. Effective Time of Adjustments.

         (A)   Adjustments to the Series A Preferred Stock required by the
    provisions hereof shall be effective as of the time at which the event
    requiring such adjustments occurs.

         (B)   The Company shall give prompt written notice to each holder of a
    share of Series A Preferred Stock of the effect of any adjustment to the
    voting rights, dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or
    winding up of the Company of such shares required by the provisions hereof.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Company to give
    such notice shall not affect the validity of or the force or effect of or
    the requirement for such adjustment.

         Section 10. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
    not be redeemable at the option of the Company or any holder thereof.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence of this Section, the Company may
    acquire 

                                       30

Exhibit 3-a  (continued)

    shares of Series A Preferred Stock in any other manner permitted by law, the
    provisions hereof and the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
    Company.

         Section 11. Ranking. Unless otherwise provided in the Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or a Certificate of Designations
    relating to a subsequent series of preferred stock of the Company, the
    Series A Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the
    Company's Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the
    distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up and senior
    to the Common Stock.

         Section 12. Amendment. The provisions hereof and the Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall not be amended in any
    manner which would adversely affect the rights, privileges or powers of the
    Series A Pre ferred Stock without, in addition to any other vote of
    stockholders required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders to
    two-thirds or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
    voting together as a single class.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned officer of the corporation has
hereunto set his hand this 3rd day of November, 1995.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS

         In fiscal 1995, the Company earned $105.8 million from continuing
operations, up 56% from the $67.6 million earned in 1994. Earnings per share
from continuing operations rose to $3.01, a 58% increase from the prior year's
$1.90. Orders for the year grew 9% to $1.597 billion from 1994's $1.471 billion.
Sales of $1.576 billion were up by 20% from the year-ago's $1.313 billion.
However, after adjustments for the effect of an equipment distribution agreement
with Tokyo Electron, Ltd. (TEL), which ended in 1994, the increase in orders was
24% while sales rose 26%. Order backlog stood at $651 million at the close of
the year. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year totaled $33.5
million ($0.95/share), comprising of a $25.3 million ($0.72/share) gain on the
sale of its Electron Devices business, and $8.2 million ($0.23/share) from
discontinued operations. Each of Varian's three core businesses contributed to
the improved volume due largely to the continued strong performances by the
Company's Semiconductor Equipment and Health Care Systems businesses.

         For the second year in a row, the Company's largest business,
Semiconductor Equipment, posted higher results over the prior year. Orders and
sales rose to $658 million and $659 million respectively. After adjustments for
ending the previously noted distribution arrangement with Tokyo Electron, Ltd.,
orders were up 56% and sales grew 65% over the year-ago levels. The Company took
full advantage of increased demand for new chipmaking equipment, as orders for
its Thin Film Systems unit were up 76% over 1994, and bookings for its Ion
Implantation lines rose 48%. The higher demand was principally driven by
interest in the Company's newly introduced or improved sputtering systems as
well as its new VIISion high current ion implanter and its E220 and E500 medium
current systems. Operating profit for the Semiconductor Equipment business rose
to $99 million from the prior year's $36 million. Backlog grew to $248 million,
which was an increase of 65% for Varian-made products after adjusting for the
1994 TEL distribution arrangement.

         Varian's Health Care Systems business closed the year with
fourth-quarter orders exceeding the $150 million mark for the first time. Annual
orders and sales rose for both of its major business lines, oncology systems and
X-ray tube products, with most of the momentum coming in the X-ray sector.
Health Care Systems' operating profit improved over the prior year from $86
million in 1994 to $90 million in 1995. Backlog also rose from the 1994 level to
$293 million. Stronger demand for Oncology Systems' products outside the U.S.
and higher orders for related software and ancillary products offset continued
domestic pricing pressures and flat demand.

         Orders and sales for Varian's Instruments business rose from 1994
levels. The growth is attributed to higher demand for the Company's vacuum
equipment, products from its Tempe Electronics Center, and newly introduced
nuclear magnetic resonance instruments, while tempered by slow or stagnant
demand for its analytical lines (particularly in Europe). Backlog increased from
the year-ago level, with all product areas except the analytical sector
contributing to the gain. Operating profits for this business were substantially
below the prior year, due primarily to the weak analytical volume and related
restructuring activities.

         Research and development expense increased $17.3 million to $91.0
million, representing 5.8% of revenue, comparable with 1994 and 1993.

         Net interest expense in 1995 declined to $1.6 million compared to $2.0
million and $4.5 million in 1994 and 1993 respectively.

         The continuing operations effective tax rate for 1995 was 36%, and 38%
in each of the preceding two years. See Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

         The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) have issued statements which
the Company has not yet adopted. These statements are Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, (SFAS 121), Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of; Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, (SFAS 123), Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation; and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement
of Position No. 94-6, (SOP 94-6), Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and
Uncertainties. The adoption of these statements will not have a material effect
on the financial statements of the Company. See Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis  (continued)

FINANCIAL CONDITION

         The Company's financial condition remained strong during 1995.
Operating activities provided cash of $117.4 million compared to $120.3 million
in 1994. Investing activities provided $125.6 million inclusive of $191.3
million proceeds from the sale of the Electron Devices business, offset by the
purchase of property, plant, and equipment of $65.4 million and the purchase of
businesses of $12.7 million. Financing activities used $184.9 million to buy
back shares of the Company's stock, and to offset the issuance of stock to
employees. Total debt as a percent of total capital increased to 13.6% from
12.7% a year ago. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $122.7 million from
$78.9 a year ago, exceeding all short- and long-term debt of $62.1 million. The
ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.51 and 1.55 at fiscal
year-end 1995 and 1994, respectively. Quarterly dividends were increased from
$.06 to $.07 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 1995. The Company has
available $50 million in unused committed lines of credit.

OUTLOOK

         Despite the favorable financial results described above, future revenue
and profitability remain difficult to predict. Although the semiconductor
industry's extraordinary growth rate of the past two years may moderate to some
degree in 1996, the Company anticipates continued gains in sales and earnings in
its Semiconductor Equipment business. The debate over health care costs and
related pressures for cost containment in U.S. health care appear likely to
continue for the foreseeable future. The Health Care Systems business however is
continuing to emphasize development of increasingly efficient and effective
products, and expects continued strong sales in international markets and of
software and ancillary products. In addition, the Company continues to face
various general risks associated with its business operations, including
uncertain general worldwide economic conditions and new product acceptance. Such
conditions could affect the Company's future performance.

         The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or
local laws regulating the discharge of materials to the environment or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment, such as discharges to soil,
water, and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and
disposal of waste and hazardous substances. These laws have the effect of
increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of such
operations. The Company has also been named by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended, at eight sites to which the Company is alleged to have shipped
manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal. The Company is also involved in
various stages of environmental investigation and/or remediation under the
direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state, and/or local agencies at
certain current and former Company facilities (including facilities disposed of
in connection with the Company's sale of its Electron Devices business during
1995). Expenditures for environmental investigation and remediation amounted to
$2.3 million in 1995 compared with $3.5 million in 1994.

         Uncertainty as to (a) the extent to which the Company caused, if at
all, the conditions being investigated, (b) the extent of environmental
contamination and risks, (c) the applicability of changing and complex
environmental laws, (d) the number and financial viability of other potentially
responsible parties, (e) the stage of the investigation and/or remediation, (f)
the unpredictability of investigation and/or remediation costs (including as to
when they will be incurred), (g) applicable clean-up standards, (h) the
remediation (if any) that will ultimately be required, and (i) available
technology make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further
investigation or remediation activities, or to estimate the future costs of such
activities if undertaken. 

         Nevertheless, the Company continues to estimate the amounts of these
future costs in periodically establishing reserves, based partly on progress
made in determining the magnitude of such costs, experience gained from sites
on which remediation is ongoing or has been completed, and the timing and
extent of remedial actions required by the applicable governmental authorities.
As of September 29, 1995, the Company estimated that the present value of the
Company's future exposure for environmental related investigation and
remediation expenditures, including operating and maintenance costs, ranged
from approximately $35.7 million to $56.0 million. The time frame over which
the Company expects to incur such costs varies with each site, ranging up to 30
years. Management believes that no amount in the foregoing range of estimated
future costs is more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such
range.

Management's Discussion and Analysis  (continued)

         At September 29, 1995, the Company's reserve for environmental
liabilities, based upon future environmental related costs estimated by the
Company as of such date, was calculated as follows:

</TABLE>

         The amounts set forth in the foregoing table are only estimates of
anticipated future environmental related costs. The amounts actually spent by
the Company in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates.

         As a result of information developed and analyzed by the Company during
1995 as part of continuing investigations and in connection with the pending
environmental insurance coverage litigation referred to below, as well as the
Company's sale of its Electron Devices business in 1995, the Company increased
its reserve for environmental related costs at the end of 1995 to $35.7 million
compared to $3.6 million at the end of 1994. The reserve recorded at the end of
1995 included $5.0 million for environmental related costs attributable to
discontinued operations (i.e., the Electron Devices business). The Company
believes that its reserve is adequate. As the scope of the Company's obligations
becomes more clearly defined, this reserve may be modified and related charges
against the Company's earnings may be made.

         Although any ultimate liability arising from an environmental related
matter described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if
aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material
to the Company's financial condition, the likelihood of such occurrence is
considered remote. Based on information currently available to management and
its best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related
events, management believes that the costs of these environmental related
matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of the Company.

         The Company evaluates its liability for environmental related
investigation and remediation in light of the liability and financial
wherewithal of potentially responsible parties and insurance companies with
respect to which the Company believes that it has rights to contribution,
indemnity and/or reimbursement.

         Claims for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation
costs already incurred and to be incurred in the future have been asserted
against various insurance companies and other third parties. In 1992, the
Company filed a lawsuit against 36 insurance companies with respect to most of
the above-referenced sites. Due to recent developments with respect to this
litigation (including the California Supreme Court decision in Montrose Chemical
Corporation of California v. Admiral Insurance Company rendered in July 1995 and
recent settlements with certain defendant insurance carriers), the Company
received certain settlements during 1995 and recorded an $18.0 million
receivable in Other Current Assets at September 29, 1995. The Company expects to
recover at least this amount from the defendants in such litigation (net of
attorneys' fees). Except for this amount, due to the uncertainty as to ultimate
recoveries from third parties, the Company has neither recorded any asset nor
reduced any liability in anticipation of recovery with respect to claims made
against third parties. The Company believes that it has a strong case against
the defendant insurance carriers in its pending environmental insurance coverage
litigation. The Company intends to aggressively pursue additional insurance
recoveries from such defendants.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year

The Company's fiscal years reported are the 52- or 53-week periods which ended
on the Friday nearest September 30.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany balances, transactions, and stock
holdings have been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in
less-than-majority-owned affiliated companies are stated at equity in the net
assets of these companies.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside of the United States representing
cash and amounts receivable or payable are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rates in effect at year end.  Other accounts including inventories and
property, plant and equipment are translated at historical exchange rates.
Revenue and expense items are translated at effective rates of exchange
prevailing during each year, except that inventories are charged to cost of
sales and depreciation is expensed at historical exchange rates.  The aggregate
exchange gain (loss) included in general and administrative expenses for 1995,
1994, and 1993 was $(0.8) million, $(0.1) million, and $(8.3) million,
respectively.

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of
operational (sales orders and purchase commitments) and balance sheet exposures
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  When the Company's foreign
exchange contracts hedge operational exposure, the effects of movements in
currency exchange rates on these instruments are recognized in income when the
related revenues and expenses are recognized.  When foreign exchange contracts
hedge balance sheet exposure, such effects are recognized in income when the
exchange rate changes.  Because the impact of movements in currency exchange
rates on foreign exchange contracts generally offsets the related impact on the
underlying items being hedged, these instruments do not subject the Company to
risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates.  At
fiscal year-end 1995, the Company had forward exchange contracts with maturities
of twelve months or less to sell foreign currencies totaling $45.4 million
($15.9 million of French francs, $11.8 million of British pounds, $7.7 million
of Italian lira, $7.6 million of Japanese yen, $1.5 million of Canadian dollars
and $0.9 million of Swiss francs) and to buy foreign currencies totaling $20.7
million ( $6.0 million of Swiss francs, $5.8 million of British pounds, $4.2
million of Australian dollars, $2.8 million of Japanese yen, $1.1 million of
Swedish krona and $0.8 million of Deutsche marks).

Revenue Recognition

Sales and related cost of sales are recognized primarily upon shipment of
products.  Sales and related cost of sales under long-term contracts to
commercial customers and the U.S. Government are recognized primarily as units
are delivered.

Statements of Cash Flows

The Company considers currency on hand, demand deposits, and all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and
cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $2.3
million at the end of fiscal year 1995 and $2.4 million at the end of fiscal
year 1994.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (realizable value) using

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost.  Major improvements are
capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed currently .  Plant and
equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods
for tax purposes.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives, or the remaining term of the lease,
whichever is less.

Environmental Liabilities

Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts
are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  Generally, the timing
of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the
Company's commitment to a formal plan of action.

Taxes on Earnings

Effective the beginning of fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes.

The Company elected to adopt this new standard by restating the prior three
years.  Retained earnings for all years restated was decreased by $7.8 million
as a result of adoption, and the income tax provision did not change for any of
the three years restated. Adopting SFAS 109 has not caused a significant change
in the Company's provision for income taxes.  The adoption has not caused a
change in the Company's reconciliation of the effective tax rate with the
federal statutory rate or a change in the significant components of the income
tax expense.

Postemployment Benefits

During  1994, the Company adopted SFAS 112, Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits.  Its adoption did not have a material effect on the
financial statements of the Company.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The Company adopted SFAS 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions, during 1994.  Its adoption did not have a material effect
on the financial statements of the Company.

Research and Development

Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and
future products are expensed currently.  Costs related to research and
development contracts are included in inventory and charged to cost of sales
upon

recognition of related revenue. Total expenditures on research and development
for fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993, were  $94.7 million, $74.8 million, and $67.0,
million, respectively, of which $3.7 million, $1.1 million, and $0.6 million,
respectively, were funded by customers.

Computation of Earnings Per Share (Shares in thousands)

Earnings-per-share computations are based on the weighted average common shares
outstanding and common share equivalents (dilutive stock options).  The average
number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the computation of
earnings per share in 1995, 1994, and 1993, was 35,202,   35,676, and 36,292
shares, respectively.  There is no significant difference between fully diluted
earnings per share and primary earnings per share.

Stock Split

On February 17, 1994, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
in the form of a stock dividend, issued on March 17, 1994, to stockholders of
record on March 3, 1994.  All share and per share information has been restated
to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis.

Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To Be
Disposed Of

In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 121, Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of. It is effective for the
Company's fiscal year 1997.  Its adoption will not have a material effect on the
financial statements of the Company.

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation. It is effective for the Company's fiscal year 1997.  Its adoption
will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.

Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties

In December 1994, The AICPA issued SOP 94-6, Disclosure of Certain Significant
Risks and Uncertainties. It is effective for the Company's fiscal year 1996. Its
adoption will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the
Company.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term notes payable and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to
$1.8 million and $4.8 million at the end of fiscal years 1995 and 1994,
respectively. The  weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings were
9.7% and 6.1% at the end of fiscal years 1995 and 1994, respectively. Total debt
is subject to limitations included in long-term debt agreements.

At fiscal year-end 1995, the Company had total unused committed lines of credit
amounting to $50 million.

LONG-TERM ACCRUED EXPENSES

Long-term accrued expenses are comprised of accruals for environmental costs not

The unsecured term loans contain covenants which limit future borrowings and
require the Company to maintain certain levels of working capital and operating
results.  At fiscal year-end 1995, the Company was in compliance with all
restrictive covenants of the loan agreements, including a restriction on payment
of cash dividends.  At September 29, 1995, approximately $106.5 million of
retained earnings were unrestricted for payment of cash dividends.

The annual maturities of long-term debt (in millions) for fiscal years 1996
through 2000, are as follows: $0.1, $ 0.1,  $12.1, $12.1, and $12.1.

Interest paid (in millions) on short and long-term debt was $6.9, $6.4, and
$6.4, in fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

OMNIBUS STOCK AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS (SHARES IN THOUSANDS)

During fiscal 1991, the Company adopted the Omnibus Stock Plan (the Plan) under
which shares of common stock can be issued to officers, directors, and key
employees.  The maximum number of shares of common stock available for awards
under the Plan during each fiscal year (including incentive stock options) is 5%
of the total outstanding shares of the Company on the last business day of the
preceding fiscal year.  The maximum number of shares of the common stock
available for incentive stock option grants under the Plan is 6,000.  The
exercise price for incentive and nonqualified stock options granted under the
Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value at the date of the
grant.  Options granted will be exercisable at such times and be subject to such
restrictions and conditions as determined by the Organization and Compensation
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, but no option shall be
exercisable later than ten years from the date of grant.  Restricted stock
grants may be awarded at prices ranging from 0% to 50% of the fair market value
of the stock and may be subject to restrictions on transferability and continued
employment as determined by the Organization and Compensation Committee.

Options granted are generally exercisable in cumulative installments of
one-third each year, commencing one year following date of grant, and expire if
not exercised within seven or ten years from date of grant.

Option activity under the Plans is presented below.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Options were outstanding at prices ranging from $10.60 to $54.69 per share at
fiscal year-end 1995.  Options were exercised at prices ranging from $10.60 to
$39.13 for fiscal 1995, $10.60 to $24.25 for fiscal 1994, and $10.60 to $23.72
for fiscal 1993.

During fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993, 63, 64, and 15, shares, respectively,
were awarded under restricted stock grants at no cost to the employees.  The
restricted stock grants vest over a three year period.  Compensation expense
from restricted stock was approximately $2.0, million, $1.2 million, and $0.9
million, in fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) covers substantially all employees in
the United States and Canada.  The participants' purchase price is the lower of
85% of the closing market price on the first trading day of the fiscal quarter
or the first trading day of the next fiscal quarter.  The discount is treated as
equivalent to the cost of issuing stock for financial reporting purposes. During
fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993, 205 shares, 266 shares, and 382 shares were issued
under the ESPP for $7.0 million, $7.0 million, and $6.3 million,  respectively.
At fiscal year-end 1995, the Company had a balance of  3,125 shares reserved for
ESPP.


PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS (SHARES IN THOUSANDS)

At fiscal year-end, there were issued and outstanding  31,052 preferred stock
purchase rights (one right for each outstanding common share).  Each right
entitles the holder to buy one two-hundredth of a share of the Company's Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $62.50.  Of the 1,000 shares of
authorized preferred stock, 280 shares have been designated as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, to be issued upon exercise of the rights.  Upon
issuance, these preferred shares will have certain voting, dividend, and
liquidation preferences over the common stock, as described in the Rights
Agreement of August 25, 1986, as amended.

The rights are exercisable ten days after a person or group has acquired 15% or
more of the Company's voting stock, or the tenth day (or such later date as may
be determined by the Board of Directors) after the date of the commencement of
announcement of a person's or group's intention to commence a tender or exchange
offer whose consummation will result in the ownership of 30% or more of stock.
If a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the voting
stock, each right would entitle the holder, other than the acquiring person or
group, to buy shares of the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, having a market value of $125, for the exercise price of $62.50.  If the
Company were to be merged into another entity, or merged with another entity,
and the common stock were changed into other securities or assets, each right
would entitle the holder to purchase for the exercise price of $62.50 common
stock of the acquiring company equal to a market value of twice the exercise
price, or $125.

The rights expire on August 25, 1996, but may be redeemed by the Board of
Directors of the Company  for $.025 per right at any time before they become
exercisable.

RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company has defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all
of its United States' and Canadian employees.  The Company's major obligation is
to contribute an amount based on a percentage of each participant's base pay.
The Company also contributes 5% of its consolidated earnings from continuing
operations before taxes, as adjusted for discretionary items, as retirement plan
profit sharing.  Participants are entitled, upon termination or retirement, to
their portion of the retirement fund assets, which are held by a third-party
trustee.  In addition, a number of the Company's foreign subsidiaries have
defined benefit retirement plans for regular full-time employees.  Total pension
expense for all plans amounted to $25.4 million, $23.1 million, and $18.4
million, for fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

At fiscal year-end 1995, the Company was committed to minimum rentals under
noncancellable operating leases for fiscal years 1996 through 2000 and
thereafter, as follows, in millions: $7.8, $5.3, $4.1, $3.0, $1.9, and $4.0.
Rental expense for fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993, in millions, was $18.6,
$18.7, and $20.8, respectively.

CONTINGENCIES

In February 1990, a purported class action was brought by Panache Broadcasting
of Pennsylvania, Inc. on behalf of all purchasers of electron tubes in the U.S.
against the Company and a joint-venture partner, alleging that the activities of
their joint venture in the power-grid tube industry violated antitrust laws. The
complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages, which may be trebled
under the antitrust laws. In February 1993, the U.S. District Court in Chicago
granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion to dismiss the
complaint. Panache Broadcasting filed an amended complaint in March 1993. In
October 1995, the Court affirmed a federal Magistrate's recommendation to grant
in part and deny in part the Company's motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
Also in October 1995, the Magistrate recommended denial of plaintiff's request
to certify the purported class and recommended certification of a different and
narrower class than that defined by plaintiff. The Company is appealing that
proposed class certification to the District Court, and believes that it has
meritorious defenses to the Panache lawsuit.

In addition to the above-referenced matter, the Company is currently a defendant
in a number of legal actions and could incur an uninsured liability in one or
more of them. In the opinion of management, the outcome of the above litigation
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Company.

The Company has also been named by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or
third parties as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, at
eight sites to which Varian is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for
recycling or disposal. The Company is also involved in various stages of
environmental investigation and/or remediation under the direction of, or in
consultation with, federal, state, and/or local agencies at certain current or
former Company facilities. Uncertainty as to (a) the extent to which the Company
caused, if at all, the conditions being investigated, (b) the extent of
environmental contamination and risks, (c) the applicability of changing and
complex environmental laws, (d) the number and financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties, (e) the stage of the investigation and/or
remediation, (f) the unpredictability of investigation and/or remediation costs
(including as to when they will be incurred), (g) applicable clean-up
standards,(h) the remediation (if any) that will ultimately be required, and (i)
available technology make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of
further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs
of such activities if undertaken.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Nevertheless, the Company continues to estimate the amounts of these future
costs in periodically establishing reserves, based partly on progress made in
determining the magnitude of such costs, experience gained from sites on which
remediation is ongoing or has been completed, and the timing and extent of
remedial actions required by the applicable governmental authorities. As of
September 29, 1995, the Company estimated that the present value of the
Company's future exposure for environmental related investigation and
remediation expenditures, including operating and maintenance costs, ranged from
approximately $35.7 million to $56.0 million. The time frame over which the
Company expects to incur such costs varies with each site, ranging up to 30
years. Management believes that no amount in the foregoing range of estimated
future costs is more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such
range.

At September 29, 1995, the Company's reserve for environmental liabilities,
based upon future environmental related costs estimated by the Company as of
such date, was calculated as follows:

</TABLE>

The amounts set forth in the foregoing table are only estimates of anticipated
future environmental related costs. The amounts actually spent by the Company in
the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates.

As a result of information developed and analyzed by the Company during 1995 as
part of continuing investigations and in connection with the pending
environmental insurance coverage litigation referred to below as well as the
Company's sale of its Electron Devices business in 1995, the Company increased
its reserve for environmental related costs at the end of 1995 to $35.7 million
compared to $3.6 million at the end of 1994. The reserve recorded at the end of
1995 included $5.0 million for environmental related costs attributable to
discontinued operations (i.e., the Electron Devices business). The Company
believes that its reserve is adequate. As the scope of the Company's obligations
becomes more clearly defined, such reserve may be modified and related charges
against the Company's earnings may be made.

Although any ultimate liability arising from an environmental related matter
described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated
and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material to the
Company's financial condition, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered
remote. Based on information currently available to management and its best
assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events,
management believes that the costs of these environmental related matters are
not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of the Company.

The Company evaluates its liability for environmental related investigation and
remediation in light of the liability and financial wherewithal of potentially
responsible parties and insurance companies with respect to which the Company
believes that it has rights to contribution, indemnity and/or reimbursement.

Claims for recovery of environmental investigation and remediation costs already
incurred and to be incurred in the future have been asserted against various
insurance companies and other third parties. In 1992, the Company filed a
lawsuit against 36 insurance companies with respect to most of the
above-referenced sites. Due to recent developments 

                                       31

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


with respect to this litigation (including the California Supreme Court decision
in Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Admiral Insurance Company
rendered in July 1995 and recent settlements with certain defendant insurance
carriers), the Company received certain settlements during 1995 and recorded an
$18.0 million receivable in Other Current Assets at September 29, 1995. The
Company expects to recover at least this amount from the defendants in such
litigation (net of attorneys' fees). Except for this amount, due to the
uncertainty as to ultimate recoveries from third parties, the Company has
neither recorded any asset nor reduced any liability in anticipation of recovery
with respect to claims made against third parties. The Company believes that it
has a strong case against the defendant insurance carriers in its pending
environmental insurance coverage litigation. The Company intends to aggressively
pursue additional insurance recoveries from such defendants.

DISCONTINUED OPERATION

On August 11, 1995 the Company completed the sale of the Electron Devices
business segment (not including the Tempe Electronics Center). The Tempe
facility was retained as part of the Instruments business segment. The
transaction was accounted for as a discontinued operation. The Company received
$191.3 million net proceeds in cash. Amounts in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings for 1994 and 1993 have been reclassified to conform to the 1995
discontinued operations presentation. The gain on the sale was $25.3 million
(net of income taxes of $15.6 million). Summary operating results of
discontinued operations, excluding the above gain, are as follows.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The Company's operations are grouped into three business segments: Health Care
Systems, Instruments, and Semiconductor Equipment. Indirect and common costs
have been allocated through the use of estimates. Accordingly, the following
information is provided for purposes of achieving an understanding of
operations, but may not be indicative of the financial results of the reported
segments were they independent organizations. In addition, comparisons of the
Company's operations to similar operations of other companies may not be
meaningful.

The Health Care Systems business includes linear accelerators used for cancer
therapy, industrial testing, and inspection, as well as cancer treatment
planning systems and data management systems for medical facilities. It also
designs and manufactures a broad range of X-ray generating tubes for the medical
diagnostic imaging market worldwide. The Instruments business consists of
analytical instruments widely used in the fields of chemistry, environmental
monitoring, biology, life sciences, and metallurgy. It also manufactures high
vacuum pumps, instrumentation, gauges, components, and printed circuit boards.
The Semiconductor Equipment business includes systems used for semiconductor
wafer fabrication. Included in Eliminations and Other are certain insignificant
support operations.

The Company operates various manufacturing and marketing operations outside the
United States. For fiscal 1995, sales to customers located in Korea were $183.8
million. For fiscal 1994 and 1993, no single country outside the United States
accounted for more than 10% of total assets. Sales between geographic areas are
accounted for at cost plus prevailing markups arrived at through negotiations
between independent profit centers. Related profits are eliminated in
consolidation.

Included in the total of United States sales are export sales of $420 million in
fiscal 1995, $286 million in fiscal 1994, and $187 million in fiscal 1993. Sales
under prime contracts from the U.S. Government were approximately $22 million in
fiscal 1995, $28 million in fiscal 1994, and $14 million in fiscal 1993.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Varian Associates, Inc.

         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Varian
Associates, Inc. and subsidiary companies as of September 29, 1995 and
September 30, 1994, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended September 29, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Varian
Associates, Inc. and subsidiary companies as of September 29, 1995 and
September 30, 1994, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 29,
1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
