                                     PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
     Valley National Bancorp ("Valley") is a New Jersey corporation incorporated
as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
("Holding Company Act"). At December 31, 1995, Valley had consolidated total
assets of $4.6 billion, total deposits of $4.1 billion, and total shareholders'
equity of $400.2 million. Its principal subsidiary is Valley National Bank
("VNB").
 
     VNB is a national banking association chartered in 1927 under the laws of
the United States. VNB provides a full range of commercial and retail banking
services through 80 branch offices located in northern New Jersey. These
services include the acceptance of demand, savings and time deposits; extension
of consumer, real estate, Small Business Administration and other commercial
credits; and full personal and corporate trust services, as well as pension and
fiduciary services.
 
     VNB has five New Jersey wholly-owned subsidiaries which include a mortgage
servicing company, a real estate company which holds and disposes of real estate
which VNB may acquire through foreclosure, an investment company which holds,
maintains and manages tangible investment assets for VNB, an investment banking
company which offers investment banking services to middle market companies, and
an Edge Act Corporation which is the holding company for a wholly-owned finance
company located in Toronto, Canada. The mortgage servicing company services
loans for others as well as VNB.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
     On February 28, 1995, Valley acquired American Union Bank ("American"),
headquartered in Union, New Jersey, with two branches and approximately $58
million in assets. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 288,734 shares of
Valley common stock and was accounted for using the pooling of interests method
of accounting. The financial statements for Valley have not been restated to
include American as they would not have been materially different from those
presented. American's financial statements are included in Valley's consolidated
financial statements as of January 1, 1995. Each share of common stock of
American was exchanged for 0.50 shares of Valley common stock.
 
     On June 30, 1995 Valley acquired the $671 million asset Lakeland First
Financial Group, Inc. ("LFG"), the holding company for Lakeland Savings Bank
("Lakeland"), a state chartered savings bank headquartered in Succasunna, New
Jersey, with sixteen branches in Morris, Sussex and Warren counties, New Jersey.
The transaction resulted in the issuance of 5,136,446 shares of Valley common
stock and was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting.
Each share of common stock of LFG was exchanged for 1.286 shares of Valley
common stock.
 
     Valley began offering investment banking services to middle market
companies in 1995 through its recently chartered investment banking subsidiary,
Halidon Hill & Co., which provides a full range of merger and acquisition
advisory services, private placement of debt and equity, strategic planning
services, and also offers advice to middle market firms with respect to
management buyouts, capital formation strategies and recapitalizations.
 
     During the fourth quarter of 1995, Valley received all the necessary
approvals to establish a finance company in Toronto, Canada. The finance company
will make consumer loans in Canada, primarily auto loans, utilizing Valley's
expertise in the area and extending to Canada the existing referral program
Valley has with a major insurance company. Valley anticipates that the Canadian
finance company will become operational during the first quarter of 1996.
 
     VNB is a credit card issuer and has initiated several successful affinity
programs during 1994 and 1995, primarily with local municipalities in New
Jersey. In late 1995, VNB signed a letter of intent with a proposed partner for
a substantial co-branding credit card program. VNB anticipates this program, if
it occurs, could add a significant number of credit card accounts to VNB within
two years. The program is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and
if the parties reach a definitive agreement, VNB anticipates this program will
begin in the second quarter of 1996. Management can offer no assurance that VNB
and its proposed partner will enter into a definitive agreement.

<PAGE>   4
 
     During 1995 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of Valley's common stock. As of December 31, 1995 the company has
purchased 563,160 shares, all of which have been reissued under the company's
stock option plan and expired warrant program. Subsequent to December 31, 1995,
through February 15, 1996, approximately 115,000 additional shares were
purchased for the treasury. On February 20, 1996, the Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of an additional one million shares of Valley's common
stock to be used for employee benefit programs and other general corporate
purposes.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The market for banking and bank related services is highly competitive.
Valley and its subsidiary compete with other providers of financial services
such as other bank holding companies, commercial and savings banks, savings and
loan associations, credit unions, money market and mutual funds, mortgage
companies, and a growing list of other local, regional and national institutions
which offer financial services. Mergers between financial institutions within
New Jersey and in neighboring states have added competitive pressure.
Competition is expected to intensify as a consequence of interstate banking laws
now in effect or that may be in effect in the future. Valley and its subsidiary
compete by offering quality products and convenient services at competitive
prices. In order to maintain and enhance its competitive position, Valley
regularly reviews its products, locations and various acquisition prospects and
periodically engages in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     At year-end 1995, VNB and its subsidiaries employed 1,304 full-time
equivalent persons. Management considers relations with employees to be
satisfactory.
 
                           SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
     The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls
increase a bank holding company's cost of doing business and limit the options
of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion
is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the
banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the bank. It is
intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.
 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION
 
     Valley is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding Company
Act. As a bank holding company, Valley is supervised by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") and is required to file reports with the
FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require.
 
     The Holding Company Act prohibits Valley, with certain exceptions, from
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of
the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any
business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or
furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application,
engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found
by the FRB to be so closely related to banking "as to be a proper incident
thereto." The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the
acquisition by Valley of more than five percent of the voting stock of any
additional bank. Under current law, a New Jersey based bank holding company,
like Valley, is permitted to acquire banks located in New Jersey and in certain
other states if the states had enacted laws specifically to permit acquisitions
of banks by out-of-state bank holding companies having the largest proportion of
their deposits in New Jersey. Satisfactory capital ratios and Community
Reinvestment Act ratings are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal
regulatory approval to make acquisitions. Acquisitions through Valley National
Bank require approval of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States
("OCC"). Statewide branching is permitted in New Jersey. The Holding Company Act
does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank
subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
 
     The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994
(the "Interstate Banking and Branching Act") passed by Congress and signed into
law on September 29, 1994, significantly changed interstate banking rules.
Pursuant to the Interstate Banking and Branching Act, bank holding companies are
able to acquire banks in states other than its home state effective September
29, 1995, regardless of applicable state law.
 
                                        2
<PAGE>   5
 
     The Interstate Banking and Branching Act also authorizes banks to merge
across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches, beginning June 1,
1997. Under such legislation, each state has the opportunity either to "opt out"
of this provision, thereby prohibiting interstate branching in such states, or
to "opt in" at an earlier time, thereby allowing interstate branching within
that state prior to June 1, 1997. Furthermore, a state may "opt-in" with respect
to de novo branching, thereby permitting a bank to open new branches in a state
in which the bank does not already have a branch. Without de novo branching, an
out-of-state bank can enter the state only by acquiring an existing bank.
 
     The New Jersey legislature is presently examining whether it will opt-in
with respect to earlier interstate banking and branching, as well as whether it
will authorize de novo branching and the entry into New Jersey of foreign
country banks.
 
     Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry
are frequently introduced in Congress, in the state legislatures and before the
various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any such changes
and the impact such changes might have on Valley cannot be determined at this
time.
 
     The policy of the FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to
act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit
resources to support such subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not
do so absent such policy.
 
REGULATION OF BANK SUBSIDIARY
 
     VNB is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the
OCC.
 
     Various laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to Valley and its
bank subsidiary impose restrictions and requirements in many areas, including
capital requirements, the maintenance of reserves, establishment of new offices,
the making of loans and investments, consumer protection, employment practices
and other matters. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A
and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, to the extent which a bank subsidiary may
finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding
company's non-bank subsidiaries. Under federal law, no bank subsidiary may,
subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or
investments in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its
parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank) or take their securities as
collateral for loans to any borrower. Each bank subsidiary is also subject to
collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted
by such exceptions.
 
DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS
 
     Valley is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries.
Valley's revenues (on a parent company only basis) result in part from dividends
paid to Valley by VNB. Payment of dividends to the Company by its subsidiary
bank, without prior regulatory approval, is subject to regulatory limitations.
Under the National Bank Act, dividends may be declared only if, after payment
thereof, capital would be unimpaired and remaining surplus would equal 100
percent of capital. Moreover, a national bank may declare, in any one year,
dividends only in an amount aggregating not more than the sum of its net profits
for such year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Under
this limitation, VNB could declare dividends in 1996 without prior approval of
the OCC of up to $59,540,000 plus an amount equal to VNB's net profits for 1996
to the date of such dividend declaration. In addition, the bank regulatory
agencies have the authority to prohibit a bank subsidiary from paying dividends
or otherwise supplying funds to Valley if the supervising agency determines that
such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
 
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
 
     VNB's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and
10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is
currently governed by the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 375 of the National Bank Act
and Regulation O of the FRB thereunder. Among other things, these provisions
require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are
substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are
not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with
 
                                        3
<PAGE>   6
 
unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of
repayment or present other unfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain
limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and
in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank's
capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be
approved by the bank's board of directors.
 
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT
 
     Under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), as implemented by OCC
regulations, a national bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation
consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of
its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA
does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial
institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types
of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular
community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with
its examination of a national bank, to assess the association's record of
meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account
in its evaluation of certain applications by such association. The CRA also
requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. VNB
received a "Satisfactory" CRA rating in its most recent examination.
 
     In April 1995, the OCC and the other federal banking agencies adopted
amendments revising their CRA regulations. Among other things, the amended CRA
regulations substitute for the prior process-based assessment factors a new
evaluation system that would rate an institution based on its actual performance
in meeting community needs. In particular, the proposed system would focus on
three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution's record of making
loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the
institution's record of investing in community development projects, affordable
housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and
businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution's delivery of
services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The amended CRA
regulations also clarify how an institution's CRA performance would be
considered in the application process.
 
RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
 
     The Corporation's activities in Canada are subject to Section 25 and 25A of
the Federal Reserve Act, certain regulations under the National Bank Act and,
primarily, Regulation K promulgated by the FRB. Under these provisions, VNB may
invest no more than 10% of its capital in foreign banking operations. In
addition to investments, VNB may extend credit or guarantee loans for these
entities and such loans or guarantees are generally not subject to the loans to
one person limitation, although they are subject to prudent banking limitations.
The foreign banking operations are subject to supervision by the FRB, as well as
the OCC. Regulation K generally restricts activities by United States banks
outside of the United States to activities that are permitted for banks within
the United States. As a consequence, activities by VNB through its subsidiaries
outside of the United States would generally be limited to banking and
activities closely related to banking.
 
FIRREA
 
     Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of
1989 ("FIRREA"), a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable
for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled
FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. "Default" is defined
generally as the appointment of a conservatory or receiver and "in danger of
default" is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions, including
a failure to meet minimum capital requirements, indicating that a "default" is
likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. These provisions have
commonly been referred to as FIRREA's "cross guarantee" provisions. Further,
under FIRREA the failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a
variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities,
including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   7
 
     FIRREA also imposes certain independent appraisal requirements upon a
bank's real estate lending activities and further imposes certain loan-to-value
restrictions on a bank's real estate lending activities. The bank regulators
have promulgated regulations in these areas.
 
FDICIA
 
     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA"), which became law in December of 1991, required each federal banking
agency to revise its risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards
take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and
the risks of non-traditional activities. In addition, pursuant to FDICIA, each
federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at
which a financial institution would be considered "well capitalized",
"adequately capitalized", "undercapitalized", "significantly undercapitalized",
or "critically undercapitalized", and to take certain mandatory and
discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution.
 
     The OCC's regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that
an institution will be classified as "well capitalized" if it (i) has a total
risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at
least 5.0 percent, and (iv) meets certain other requirements. An institution
will be classified as "adequately capitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based
capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of at least 4.0 percent, (iii) has Tier 1 leverage ratio of (a) at least
4.0 percent or (b) at least 3.0 percent if the institution was rated 1 in its
most recent examination, and (iv) does not meet the definition of "well
capitalized". An institution will be classified as "undercapitalized" if it (i)
has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, or (iii) has a Tier 1
leverage ratio of (a) less than 4.0 percent or (b) less than 3.0 percent if the
institution was rated 1 in its most recent examination. An institution will be
classified as "significantly undercapitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based
capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of less than 3.0 percent, or (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less
than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as "critically
undercapitalized" if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is
equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be
deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory
examination.
 
     Insured institutions are generally prohibited from paying dividends or
management fees if after making such payments, the institution would be
"undercapitalized". An "undercapitalized" institution also is required to
develop and submit to the appropriate federal banking agency a capital
restoration plan, and each company controlling such institution must guarantee
the institution's compliance with such plan. The liability of a holding company
under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the
institution's total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount
needed to comply with all applicable capital standards. The FDIC is accorded a
priority over the claims of unsecured creditors in any bankruptcy proceeding of
a holding company that has guaranteed an institution's compliance with a capital
restoration plan. Further, "undercapitalized", "significantly undercapitalized",
and "critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to increasingly
extensive requirements and limitations, including mandatory sale of stock,
forced mergers, and ultimately receivership or conservatorship. A "critical
undercapitalized" institution, beginning 60 days after it becomes "critically
undercapitalized", generally is prohibited from making any payment of principal
or interest on the institution's subordinated debt.
 
     FDICIA also contained the Truth in Savings Act, which requires certain
disclosures to be made in connection with deposit accounts offered to consumers.
The FRB has adopted regulations implementing the provisions of the Truth in
Savings Act.
 
     In addition, significant provisions of FDICIA required federal banking
regulators to draft standards in a number of other important areas to assure
bank safety and soundness, including internal controls, information systems and
internal audit systems, credit underwriting, asset growth, compensation, loan
documentation and interest rate exposure. FDICIA also required the regulators to
establish maximum ratios of classified assets to capital, and minimum earnings
sufficient to absorb losses without impairing capital. The legislation also
 
                                        5
<PAGE>   8
 
contained other provisions which restricted the activities of state-chartered
banks, amended various consumer banking laws, limited the ability of
"undercapitalized" banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve's discount window,
and required federal banking regulators to perform annual onsite bank
examinations and set standards for real estate lending.
 
BIF PREMIUMS AND RECAPTURE OF SAIF
 
     VNB is a member of the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF") of the FDIC. The FDIC
also maintains another insurance fund, the Savings Association Insurance Fund
("SAIF"), which primarily covers savings and loan association deposits but also
covers deposits that are acquired by a BIF-insured institution from a savings
and loan association. VNB has approximately $1.3 billion of deposits at December
31, 1995, with respect to which VNB pays SAIF insurance premiums.
 
     For the first three quarters of 1995, both SAIF-member institutions and
BIF-member institutions paid deposit insurance premiums based on a schedule from
$0.23 to $0.31 per $100 of deposits. In August, 1995, the FDIC, in anticipation
of the BIF's imminent achievement of a required 1.25% reserve ratio, reduced the
deposit insurance premium rates paid by BIF-insured banks from a range of $0.23
to $0.31 per $100 of deposits to a range of $0.04 to $0.31 per $100 of deposits.
The new rate schedule for the BIF was made effective June 1, 1995. The FDIC
refunded to BIF-insured institutions the premiums they had paid for the period
beginning on June 1, 1995. On November 14, 1995, the FDIC voted to reduce annual
assessments for the semi-annual period beginning January 1, 1996 to the legal
minimum of $2,000 for BIF-insured institutions, except for institutions that are
not well capitalized and are assigned to the higher supervisory risk categories.
 
     Given the undercapitalized nature of the SAIF, the FDIC will continue the
range of assessment rates of $0.23 to $0.31 per $100 of deposits for
SAIF-insured institutions and BIF-insured institutions, like VNB,
required to pay SAIF premiums with respect to SAIF deposits.
 
     On July 28, 1995, the FDIC and the Treasury Department released statements
outlining a plan to recapitalize the SAIF, certain features of which were
subsequently approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the
United States in bills that provided for different resolutions of the BIF-SAIF
issues. In negotiations between members of the Banking Committees of the House
and Senate to reconcile the differences in the two bills, it was agreed that all
SAIF-member institutions would pay a special assessment to recapitalize the
SAIF. The amount of the special assessment required to recapitalize the SAIF was
estimated to be approximately 80 basis points of the SAIF-assessable deposits.
BIF-insured institutions with deposits subject to SAIF assessments would be able
to reduce such SAIF deposits by 20% in computing the institutions special
assessment.
 
     Management cannot predict whether the above legislation will be enacted,
or, if enacted, the amount of any special SAIF assessment. A significant
one-time fee to recapitalize the SAIF may have an adverse effect on the
operating expenses and results of operations of VNB in the quarter in which the
assessment is made.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
     The corporate headquarters and principal office of Valley are located in a
facility owned by VNB in Wayne, New Jersey. The operations and data processing
center for the bank is located in a facility owned by VNB in Passaic, New Jersey
and retail lending is located in a leased facility in Wayne, New Jersey. During
1996, Valley plans to continue its consolidation of operations by relocating its
operations and data processing center to a building purchased during the first
quarter of 1996 which is across the street from Valley's corporate headquarters
in Wayne.
 
     VNB provides banking services at 80 locations of which 43 locations are
owned and 37 locations are leased.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     There were no material pending legal proceedings to which Valley, or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries were a party, or to which their property was
subject, other than ordinary routine litigations

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
 
     The purpose of this analysis is to provide the reader with information
relevant to understanding and assessing Valley's results of operations for each
of the past three years and financial condition for each of the past two years.
In order to fully appreciate this analysis the reader is encouraged to review
the consolidated financial statements and statistical data presented in this
document.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
     On February 28, 1995, Valley acquired American Union Bank ("American"),
headquartered in Union, New Jersey, with two branches and approximately $58
million in assets. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 288,734 shares of
Valley common stock and was accounted for using the pooling of interests method
of accounting. The financial statements for Valley have not been restated as
they would not have been materially different from those presented. American's
financial statements are included in Valley's consolidated financial statements
as of January 1, 1995. Each share of common stock of American was exchanged for
0.50 shares of Valley common stock.
 
     On June 30, 1995 Valley acquired the $671 million asset Lakeland First
Financial Group, Inc. ("LFG"), the holding company for Lakeland Savings Bank
("Lakeland"), a state chartered savings bank headquartered in Succasunna, New
Jersey, with sixteen branches in Morris, Sussex and Warren counties, New Jersey.
The transaction resulted in the issuance of 5,136,446 shares of Valley common
stock and was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting.
Each share of common stock of LFG was exchanged for 1.286 shares of Valley
common stock.
 
     Valley began offering investment banking services to middle market
companies in 1995 through its recently chartered investment banking subsidiary,
Halidon Hill & Co., which provides a full range of merger and acquisition
advisory services, private placement of debt and equity, strategic planning
services, and also offers advice to middle market firms with respect to
management buyouts, capital formation strategies and recapitalizations.
 
     During the fourth quarter of 1995, Valley received all the necessary
approvals to establish a finance company in Toronto, Canada. The finance company
will make consumer loans in Canada, primarily auto loans, utilizing Valley's
expertise in the area and extending to Canada the existing referral program
Valley has with a major insurance company. Valley anticipates that the Canadian
finance company will become operational during the first quarter of 1996.
 
     VNB is a credit card issuer and has initiated several successful affinity
programs during 1994 and 1995, primarily with local municipalities in New
Jersey. In late 1995, VNB signed a letter of intent with a proposed partner for
a substantial co-branding credit card program. VNB anticipates this program, if
it occurs, could add a significant number of credit card accounts to VNB within
two years. The program is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and
if the parties reach a definitive agreement, VNB anticipates this program will
begin in the second quarter of 1996. Management can offer no assurance that VNB
and its proposed partner will enter into a definitive agreement.
 
     During 1995 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of Valley's common stock. As of December 31, 1995 the company has
purchased 563,160 shares, all of which have been reissued under the company's
stock option plan and expired warrant program. Subsequent to December 31, 1995,
through February 15, 1996, approximately 115,000 additional shares were
purchased for the treasury.

EARNINGS SUMMARY
 
     Net income was $62.6 million, or $1.76 per share in 1995 compared with
$64.6 million or $1.83 per share in 1994 (all amounts have been restated for the
Lakeland First Financial Group merger and the per share amounts have been
restated to give effect to a 5% stock dividend paid in May 1995). Return on
average assets decreased in 1995 to 1.40% from 1.48% in 1994, while the return
on average equity also decreased to 16.60% in 1995 from 18.66% in 1994.
 
     Net operating income, defined as net income before merger expenses and
securities gains, increased $1.4 million to $67.0 million from $65.6 million in
1994. This increase in net operating income is largely attributable to a
decrease in the provision for loan losses of $2.5 million and an increase in
non-interest income of $1.5 million, which was offset by a decrease in net
interest income of $1.7 million or 1.0%. Net operating income produced a return
on average assets of 1.50% in 1995 compared to 1.51% in 1994, and a return on
average equity of 17.78% in 1995 compared to 18.97% in 1994.
 
NET INTEREST INCOME
 
     Net interest income is the largest source of Valley's operating income. Net
interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased to $181.8 million for 1995
as compared to $183.9 million for 1994. The decrease in 1995 was due primarily
to the increase in the average rate of interest bearing liabilities of 68 basis
points during 1995, partially offset by an increase in rates on interest earning
assets of 31 basis points in the same period. The net interest margin decreased
20 basis points to 4.28% for 1995 compared to 4.48% in 1994.
 
     The decrease in net interest margin was partially due to the upward
movement in interest rates during 1994. This increase in rates caused depositors
to shift funds from short term savings accounts to longer term certificates of
deposit. Deposit rates increased faster than loan rates in 1994 and continued
throughout 1995, leading to a decline in the net interest margin during 1995.
 
     Average interest earning assets increased $144.2 million in 1995, or 3.5%
over the 1994 amount. This increase was mainly the result of increased volume of
automobile loans, commercial mortgages and commercial loans. Average loans
increased by $288.3 million or 11.8% over the 1994 amount. The average rate on
loans increased 24 basis points, and combined with the increase in average loan
volume, interest income on loans for 1995 increased by $30.0 million over 1994.
Offsetting this increase, was a decline in average taxable investment securities
of $120.8 million or 9.3% from the amount in the portfolio during 1994. Average
tax-exempt investments remained almost unchanged during 1995 as compared to
1994.
 
     Average interest-bearing liabilities grew 1.48% or $52.1 million. Deposit
growth, similar to the past few years, was held to a small increase due to
competitive factors and alternative investment opportunities for consumers.
Average demand deposits continued to grow and increased by $22.0 million or 4.8%
over 1994 balances. Average savings deposits decreased by $188.7 million or
9.9%, while average time deposits increased $266.8 million or 18.2%.

     Non-interest income continues to represent a considerable source of income
for Valley. Excluding gains on securities transactions, total non-interest
income amounted to $19.5 million in 1995 compared with $18.0 million in 1994.

     Service charges on deposit accounts increased $654 thousand or 9.0% from
$7.3 million in 1994 to $8.0 million in 1995. A majority of this increase is due
to the expansion of account volume and increased fees charged on deposit
accounts.
 
     Fees from mortgage servicing increased by 13.7% from $3.3 million in 1994
to $3.8 million in 1995. These fees represent gross servicing fees and related
ancillary fees for servicing mortgage portfolios by VNB Mortgage Services, Inc.
("MSI"), VNB's mortgage servicing subsidiary, after eliminating in consolidation
mortgage servicing fees earned by MSI on loans serviced for VNB. MSI serviced a
total of $1.69 billion and $1.20 billion of loans as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively, of which $816.5 and $536.6 million, respectively, are
serviced for VNB. The increase in the servicing portfolio was due to the
acquisition of several portfolios totalling approximately $305.7 million, the
new origination of loans by VNB of $82.4 million and the addition of loans from
Lakeland of approximately $259.1 million, less principal paydowns and
prepayments totaling $154.3 million. Amortization expense on servicing rights
increased during 1995 to $1.8 million from $1.6 million in 1994, reflecting the
increase in the size of the serviced portfolio. An analysis is completed
quarterly to determine amortization expense, based on all expected future cash
flows.
 
     Gains on the sales of loans were $846 thousand for 1995 compared to $539
thousand for 1994. The gains recorded in 1995 are primarily from the sale of SBA
loans. In 1994 Valley stopped selling its newly originated residential mortgage
loans in order to maintain its loan growth.
 
     Net gains on securities transactions in 1995 and 1994 amounted to $1.5
million and $6.0 million, respectively. The gains recorded in 1995 were the
result of the sale of securities due to rising interest rates beginning in early
1994 and Valley's decision to take advantage of the increased yields available.
 
     Valley began offering investment banking services to middle market
companies in 1995 through its recently chartered investment banking subsidiary,
Halidon Hill & Co., which provides a full range of merger and acquisition
advisory services, private placement of debt and equity, strategic planning
services, and also offers advice to middle market firms with respect to
management buyouts, capital formation strategies and recapitalizations.
Operations began in the latter part of 1995 and had no material impact on the
financial results of Valley.

     Non-interest expense totalled $90.2 million for 1995, relatively unchanged
from the 1994 level. The largest component of non-interest expense is salaries
and employee benefit expense which totalled $43.2 million in 1995 compared to
$43.4 million in 1994. At December 31, 1995, full-time equivalent staff was
1,304, compared to 1,294 at the end of 1994.

     Insurance premiums assessed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
("FDIC") decreased by $2.6 million, or 30.6% to $5.9 million in 1995. This
reduction reflects the refund received from the FDIC and the decrease in premium
rate from $0.23 to $0.04 per hundred on bank insurance fund ("BIF") deposits. It
is expected that the savings insurance fund ("SAIF") will be recapitalized
during 1996 and that Valley will be required to pay a one-time special
assessment. After this payment, it is anticipated that future premiums on these
deposits will also be reduced from $0.23 to the legal minimum of $2,000. The
one-time payment to the FDIC and the anticipated future reduction in premiums
are based upon the legislative process for which Valley has no control over the
effective date or final payments or reduction of premiums. (See Part I, Item
1 -- BIF Premiums and Recapture of SAIF).
 
     Net occupancy expense increased to $8.2 million in 1995 from $7.8 million
in 1994. The increase of $434 thousand represents additional rent, utilities,
tax and maintenance expense on facilities utilized by Valley. During the first
quarter of 1996 Valley acquired an 80,000 square foot building located across
the street from its current administrative headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey in
order to continue consolidating its operations. Renovations are currently being
made to prepare the building for Valley's use during 1996.
 
     Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $2.8 million in 1995 from
$3.1 million in 1994, representing a decrease of $335 thousand or 10.6%. The
majority of this decrease resulted from the reduction of amortization of core
deposit intangibles, offset by an increase in amortization of purchased mortgage
servicing rights totaling $1.8 million during 1995, compared with $1.6 million
for 1994.
 
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights" ("SFAS
122"), which applies prospectively to financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 31, 1995. SFAS 122 amends SFAS 65, "Accounting for
Certain Mortgage Banking Activities". SFAS 122 requires that a mortgage banking
enterprise recognize, as separate assets, rights to service mortgage loans,
however those servicing rights are acquired. SFAS 122 eliminates the previously
existing accounting distinction between servicing rights acquired through
purchase transactions and those acquired through loan originations. SFAS 122
also requires that a mortgage banking entity assess its capitalized mortgage
servicing rights ("MSRs") periodically for impairment, based on the fair value
of those rights. Valley has determined that there will be no material impact
expected on the financial position or results of operations of Valley as a
result of adopting this statement prospectively during 1996.
 
     Other expenses were $24.5 million in 1995 compared to $22.2 million in
1994. Advertising and marketing expense increased $427 thousand to $2.9 million,
data processing expense increased $395 thousand to $1.8 million, other real
estate owned expense decreased $153 thousand to $1.2 million, stationary expense
increased $88 thousand to $1.2 million, postage and delivery expense increased
$247 thousand to $1.8 million, legal expense increased $158 thousand to $1.4
million, and telecommunication expense increased $218 thousand to $1.4 million.
 
     The efficiency ratio measures a bank's gross operating expense as a
percentage of fully-taxable equivalent net interest income and other
non-interest income without taking into account security gains and losses and
other non-recurring items. Valley's efficiency ratio as of December 31, 1995 is
43.6%, one of the lowest in the industry, compared with an efficiency ratio for
1994 and 1993 of 43.2% and 43.9%, respectively. Valley strives to control its
efficiency ratio and expenses as a means of producing increased earnings for its
shareholders.
 
     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), which is effective beginning in 1996. SFAS 123
allows companies either to continue to account for stock-based employee
compensation plans under existing accounting standards or adopt a fair value
based method of accounting as defined in the new standard. Valley will continue
to follow the existing accounting standards for these plans. As a result, the
new standard is not expected to have an impact on Valley.

INCOME TAXES
 
     Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income increased to 38.3% in
1995 compared to 37.5% in 1994. This increase was attributable to a decrease in
tax-exempt interest income and an increase in state tax expense.
 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),
"Accounting for Income Taxes," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board in February 1992. Valley adopted SFAS No. 109 prospectively as of January
1, 1993. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes
reduced net income by $402 thousand and is reported separately in the
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 1993.

     Managing net interest margin continues to be one of the most important
factors in maximizing earnings. Through its Asset/Liability Policy, Valley
strives to maintain a consistent net interest rate differential by managing the
sensitivity and repricing of its assets and liabilities to interest rate
fluctuations.
 
     Valley seeks to achieve a sufficient level of rate sensitive assets to
equal its rate sensitive liabilities, and analyzes the maturity and repricing of
earning assets and sources of funds at various intervals. The level by which
repricing earning assets exceed or are exceeded by repricing sources of funds is
expressed as a ratio and dollar value (interest sensitivity gap) and is used as
a measure of interest rate risk.

     At December 31, 1995, rate sensitive assets exceeded rate sensitive
liabilities at the 90 day interval and resulted in a positive gap of $750.0
million or a ratio of 1.46:1. Rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive
assets at the 91 to 365 day interval by $420.3 million or a ratio of .30:1 and
resulted in a negative gap. The total positive gap repricing within 365 days as
of December 31, 1995 is $329.7 million or 1.15:1. Management does not view these
amounts as presenting an unusually high risk potential, although no assurances
can be given that Valley is not at risk from rate increases or decreases.
 
     The above gap results take into account repricing and maturities of assets
and liabilities, but fail to consider the interest rate sensitivities of those
asset and liability accounts. Management has prepared for its use an income
simulation model to project future net interest income streams in light of the
current gap position. Management has also prepared for its use alternative
scenarios to measure levels of net interest income associated with various
changes in interest rates. According to this computer model, an interest rate
increase of 300 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points resulted in an
impact on future net interest income which is consistent with target levels
contained in Valley's Asset/Liability Policy. Management cannot provide any
assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on Valley's net
interest income.
 
LIQUIDITY
 
     Liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow
needs as they become due. Maintaining a level of liquid funds through
asset-liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a
reasonable cost. On the asset side, liquid funds are maintained in the form of
cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, investments securities held to
maturity maturing within one year, securities available for sale and loans held
for sale. At December 31, 1995, liquid assets amounted to $1.5 billion, as
compared to $950.0 million at December 31, 1994. This represents 34.1% and 22.9%
of earning assets, and 32.1% and 21.5% of total assets at December 31, 1995 and
year-end 1994, respectively.
 
     On the liability side, the primary source of funds available to meet
liquidity needs is Valley's core deposit base, which generally excludes
certificates of deposit over $100 thousand. Core deposits averaged approximately
$3.05 billion and $3.14 billion at December 31, 1995 and year-end 1994,
respectively, representing 70.6% and 76.3% of average earning assets. Short term
borrowings and large dollar certificates of deposit, generally those over $100
thousand, are used as supplemental funding sources during periods when growth in
the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earning assets. Additional
liquidity is derived from scheduled loan and investment payments of principal
and interest, as well as prepayments received. Proceeds from the sales of
investment securities available for sale were $105.3 million, and proceeds of
$265.8 million were generated from investment maturities. Purchases of
investment securities were $200.0 million. Short term borrowings and
certificates of deposit over $100 thousand amounted to $465.8 million and $377.7
million, on average, for the year ending December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
 
     Lakeland had advances outstanding with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
York ("FHLB") which were assigned to VNB as part of the merger. During early
1996, VNB was approved as a member of the FHLB. VNB intends to utilize
borrowings from the FHLB as a source of funds for its asset growth and
asset/liability management. These advances are collateralized by pledges of FHLB
stock and a blanket assignment of qualifying mortgage loans. As of December 31,
1995, Valley had outstanding advances of $28.5 million.
 
     The following table lists, by maturity, all certificates of deposit of
$100,000 and over at December 31, 1995. These certificates of deposit are
generated primarily from core deposit customers and are not brokered funds.

     Valley's cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders.
This cash need is routinely satisfied by dividends collected from its subsidiary
bank. Projected cash flows from this source are expected to be adequate to pay
dividends, given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of
its subsidiary.

     Valley's investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. government and federal
agency securities, tax-exempt issues of states and municipalities, mortgage
backed securities and equity and other securities. There were no securities in
the name of any one issuer exceeding 10% of shareholders' equity, except for
securities issued by the United States and its political subdivisions and
agencies. The portfolio generates substantial interest income which serves as a
source of liquidity. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon
the current assessment of long and short term economic and financial conditions,
including the interest rate environment and other statement of financial
condition components.

     As of December 31, 1995 Valley has $1.1 billion of securities available for
sale compared with $696.4 million at December 31, 1994. Those securities are
recorded at their fair value on an aggregate basis. If the aggregate fair value
of these securities should decline below cost, then the value would be written
down to market. As of December 31, 1995 the investment securities available for
sale had an unrealized gain of $3.7 million, net of deferred taxes, compared to
an unrealized loss of $17.8 million, net of deferred taxes, at December 31,
1994. This change was primarily due to an increase in prices, resulting from a
decreasing interest rate environment. These securities are not considered
trading account securities, which may be sold on a continuous basis, but rather
securities which may be sold to meet the various liquidity and interest rate
requirements of Valley.
 
     Pursuant to the provisions and implementation guidance contained within the
special report "A Guide to Implementation of Statement 115 on Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", on December 29, 1995 Valley
reassessed the classification of all securities within its portfolio and
transferred $516.9 million from its held to maturity investment portfolio to its
available for sale portfolio. These securities had a market value of $521.9
million which resulted in Valley recording an unrealized gain on securities
available for sale, net of tax, within shareholders' equity of $3.0 million.

</TABLE>
 
     The composition of Valley's loan portfolio continues to change due to the
local economy and loan demand. Commercial lending increased by the largest
percentage during both 1995 and 1994, and installment loans and commercial
mortgage loans have continued their steady increase. Residential loans increased
steadily throughout 1994, but slowed considerably as interest rates began to
rise in 1994. The increase in installment loans is reflective of Valley's
increased market penetration in automobile lending. There is no guarantee that
the level of lending will continue at this brisk pace during 1996.
 
     Residential mortgage loans represent 36.4% of the loan portfolio.
Installment loans, including predominantly automobile and credit card loans,
totalled $731.8 million at December 31, 1995, increasing by $81.4 million over
1994 or 12.5% and representing 26.2% of the loan portfolio. Commercial mortgages
increased 8.4% or $47.7 million from December 1994 to December 1995, and
commercial loans increased 17.9% or $53.5 million from December 1994 to December
1995.
 
     Valley has continued to offer various types of fixed rate residential
mortgage loans and is also offering a large array of adjustable rate loans.
During 1993 Valley periodically sold some of its 15 year fixed rate loans into
the secondary market, allowing Valley to keep its portfolio mixed between fixed
rate and variable rate loans, as well as maintaining a shorter maturity of its
portfolio. Beginning in 1994 and continuing into 1995
 
                                       19
<PAGE>   22
 
Valley decided to keep its residential mortgage loans being originated so that
the portfolio could grow as demand by Valley for loans increased.
 
     Installment loans outstanding at year end include automobile loans referred
to VNB by a major insurance company, which are subject to Valley's underwriting
criteria. Approximately 52% of the automobile loan portfolio and 12% of the
total loan portfolio outstanding at December 31, 1995 represent loans originated
by VNB through this referral program. Over the last several years the amount of
loans referred through this program has grown. VNB intends to extend this
program, as all approvals were received in late 1995 to establish a finance
company in Toronto, Canada. The new finance company will make consumer loans,
primarily auto loans, in several provinces in Canada. VNB anticipates that the
Canadian finance company will become operational in the first quarter of 1996.
 
     VNB is a credit card issuer and has initiated several successful affinity
programs during 1994 and 1995, primarily with local municipalities in New
Jersey. In late 1995, VNB signed a letter of intent with a proposed partner for
a substantial co-branding credit card program. VNB anticipates this program, if
it occurs, could add a significant number of credit card accounts to VNB within
two years. The program is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and
if the parties reach a definitive agreement, VNB anticipates this program will
begin in the second quarter of 1996. Management can offer no assurance that VNB
and its proposed partner will enter into a definitive agreement.
 
     Much of Valley's lending is in Northern New Jersey. However, efforts are
made to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to
guard against a downward turn in any one economic sector. There were no loan
concentrations at December 31, 1995 other than those disclosed above.
 
     The following table reflects the maturity distribution of the commercial
and construction loan portfolio as of December 31, 1995:

</TABLE>
 
     Prior to maturity of each loan, Valley generally conducts a review which
normally includes an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and, if
applicable, a review of the adequacy of collateral. A rollover of the loan at
maturity may require a principal paydown.
 
     As part of the acquisition of Rock Bank during 1994, VNB became a preferred
Small Business Administration ("SBA") lender with authority to make loans
without the prior approval of the SBA. Approximately 70% of each loan is
guaranteed by the SBA and may be sold into the secondary market, with the
balance retained in VNB's portfolio. VNB intends to expand this area of lending
as it provides a solid source of fee income and loans with floating interest
rates tied to the prime lending rate.
 
     During 1995, VNB originated approximately $13.8 million of SBA loans and
sold $4.5 million. At December 31, 1995, $28.7 million of SBA loans were held in
VNB's portfolio and VNB serviced approximately $38.7 million of SBA loans at
December 31, 1995.
 
     It is not known if the trend of increased lending will continue. VNB
continues to take advantage of loan demand in those sectors of the economy where
it is most prevalent.
 
NON-PERFORMING ASSETS
 
     Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans and other real estate owned
(OREO). Loans are generally placed on a non-accrual status when they become past
due in excess of 90 days as to payment of
 
                                       20
<PAGE>   23
 
principal or interest. Exceptions to the non-accrual policy may be permitted if
the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection. OREO
is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate. OREO is
reported at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of acquisition and at
the lower of fair value, less estimated costs to sell, or cost thereafter.
 
     Non-performing assets continued to decrease, and totalled $18.8 million at
December 31, 1995 compared with $30.3 million at December 31, 1994, a decrease
of $11.5 million, or 37.8%. Non-performing assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, amounted to 0.67% and 1.16% of loans and other real estate owned.

ASSET QUALITY AND RISK ELEMENTS
 
     Lending is one of the most important functions performed by Valley, and by
its very nature, lending is also the most complicated, risky and profitable part
of Valley's business. A separate credit department is responsible for risk
assessment, credit file maintenance and periodically evaluating overall
creditworthiness of a borrower. Additionally, efforts are made to limit
concentrations of credit within the loan portfolio so as to minimize the impact
of a downturn in any one economic sector. Valley's portfolio, in total, is
diversified as to type of borrower and loan. Most of Valley's portfolio is in
northern New Jersey, presenting a geographical and credit risk if there were a
significant downturn of the economy within New Jersey.
 
     Management realizes that some degree of risk must be expected in the normal
course of lending activities. Reserves are maintained to absorb such potential
loan and off-balance sheet credit losses. The allowance for loan losses and
related provision are an expression of management's evaluation of the credit
portfolio and economic climate.

</TABLE>
 
     The allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level necessary
to absorb potential loan losses and other credit risk related charge-offs. It is
the result of an analysis which relates outstanding balances to expected reserve
levels required to absorb future credit losses. Current economic problems are
addressed through management's assessment of anticipated changes in the regional
economic climate, changes in composition and volume of the loan portfolio and
variances in levels of classified loans, non-performing assets and other past
due amounts. Additional factors include consideration of exposure to loss
including size of credit, existence and nature of collateral, credit record,
profitability and general economic conditions.
 
     During the year, continued emphasis was placed on the current economic
climate and the condition of the real estate market in the Northern New Jersey
area. Management addressed these current economic conditions and applied that
information to changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The decline in
non-performing assets, coupled with the continued recovery of the economy, among
other things, was responsible for the decision to decrease the provision from
$5.2 million in 1994 to $2.7 million in 1995.

</TABLE>
 
     At December 31, 1995 the allowance for loan losses amounted to $39.7
million or 1.42% of loans, net of unearned income, as compared to $42.0 million
or 1.62% at year-end 1994.
 
     The allowance is adjusted by provisions charged against income and loans
charged-off, net of recoveries. Net loan charge-offs were $5.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1995 compared with $4.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. Charge-offs from the Lakeland merger added approximately $2.7
million to total net charge-offs during 1995. The ratio of net charge-offs to
average loans amounted to 0.18% for 1995 compared with 0.19% for 1994.
 
     Although substantially all risk elements at December 31, 1995 have been
disclosed in the categories presented above, Management believes that the
current economic conditions may affect the ability of certain borrowers to
comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real estate and
commercial loans. As part of the analysis of the loan portfolio by management,
it has been determined that there are approximately $5.5 million in potential
problem loans at December 31, 1995 which have not been classified as
non-accrual, past due or restructured. Potential problem loans are defined as
performing loans for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of
such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may
result in a nonperforming loan. Approximately $1.3 million has been provided for
in the allowance for loan losses for these potential problem loans. There can be
no assurance that Valley has identified all of its problem loans. At December
31, 1994, Valley had identified approximately $8.0 million of problem loans.
 
     In May of 1993, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 118 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of
a Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosure" which applies to financial statements
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. These Statements require
that impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical
expedient, at the loan's observable market price or at the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. There was no material impact on
the financial position or results of operations as a result of Valley adopting
these statements during 1995.
 
CAPITAL ADEQUACY
 
     A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its
shareholders' equity, which should expand in close proportion to asset growth.
At December 31, 1995, shareholders' equity totalled $400.2 million or 8.7% of
total assets, compared with $350.6 million or 7.9% at year-end 1994. Valley has
achieved steady internal capital generation throughout the past five years.
 
     Risk-based guidelines define a two-tier capital framework. Tier 1 capital
consists of common shareholders' equity less disallowed intangibles, while Total
risk-based capital consists of Tier 1 capital and the allowance for loan losses
up to 1.25% of risk-adjusted assets. Risk-adjusted assets are determined by
assigning various levels of risk to different categories of assets and
off-balance sheet activities.

     Valley's capital position at December 31, 1995 under risk-based capital
guidelines was $392.1 million, or 13.9% of risk-weighted assets, for Tier 1
capital and $427.4 million, or 15.1% for Total risked-based capital. The
comparable ratios at December 31, 1994 were 14.0.% for Tier 1 capital and 15.2.%
for Total risk-based capital. Valley's ratios at December 31, 1995 are above the
"well capitalized" requirements, which require Tier I capital of at least 6% and
Total risk-based capital of 10%. The Federal Reserve Board requires "well
capitalized" bank holding companies to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of
5.0%. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Valley was in compliance with the leverage
requirement having a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.4% and 8.2%, respectively.
 
     The primary source of capital growth is through retention of earnings.
Valley's rate of earnings retention, derived by dividing undistributed earnings
by net income, was 43.5% at December 31, 1995, compared to 50.7% at December 31,
1994. Cash dividends declared amounted to $.99 per share, equivalent to a
dividend payout ratio of 56.5%, up from the 49.3% for the year 1994. The current
quarterly dividend rate of $.25 per share provides for an annual rate of $1.00
per share. Valley's Board of Directors continues to believe that cash dividends
are an important component of shareholder value and that at its current level of
performance and capital, Valley expects to continue its current dividend policy
of a quarterly distribution of earnings to its shareholders.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- 1994 COMPARED TO 1993
 
     Valley reported net income for 1994 of $64.6 million, or $1.83 per share,
compared to the $65.0 million, or $1.87 per share earned in 1993 (the per share
amounts have been restated to give effect to a 5% stock dividend in 1995, a 10%
stock dividend in 1994 and a five for four stock split in 1993).
 
     Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis rose $9.5 million, or 5.4% to
$183.9 million in 1994. The increase in 1994 was due primarily to the movement
of funds from taxable investments to higher yielding interest earning loans.
Average loan balances increased $322.4 million, earning an average rate of
8.07%, while taxable investments which earned an average of 6.20%, decreased
$173.6 million. The net interest margin remained unchanged for 1994 at 4.48%
compared to 4.49% for 1993.
 
     The provision for loan losses totaled $5.2 million in 1994 compared with
$8.0 million in 1993. The decline in nonperforming assets coupled with the
continued recovery of the economy among other things was responsible for the
decrease.
 
     Non-interest income in 1994 amounted to $24.0 million, a decrease of $4.0
million, or 14.4% compared with 1993. Excluding securities gains of $6.0 million
in 1994 and $7.5 million in 1993, total non-interest income totaled $18.0 in
1994 compared with $20.5 in 1993. The decrease in non-interest income resulted
primarily from a decrease in gains on the sale of loans of $3.0 million and a
decline in mortgage servicing fees by MSI of $500 thousand. These decreases were
partially offset by a $500 thousand increase in service charges on deposit
accounts.
 
     Non-interest expense totalled $90.6 million in 1994, an increase of $4.9
million, or 5.7% compared with 1993. Excluding merger expenses of $4.7 million
included in 1994 for the acquisition of Lakeland First Financial Group (see
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Acquisitions, Note 2), total
non-interest expense remained unchanged in 1994 compared to 1993. Salaries and
employee benefit expense increased $3.8 million or 9.6%. FDIC insurance premiums
increased $293 thousand or 3.6% during 1994 and was attributable to the growth
of deposits in 1994. Net occupancy expense, and furniture and equipment expense
increased $1.3 million, or 10.8%, which is indicative of the growth of
operations during 1994. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $2.4 million
or 43.1% representing the decrease in amortization of purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (NOTE 1)
 
  Basis of Presentation
 
     The consolidated financial statements of Valley National Bancorp and its
wholly-owned subsidiary ("Valley") include the accounts of its principal
commercial bank subsidiary, Valley National Bank ("VNB") and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. The financial statements of prior years have been restated to
include Lakeland First Financial Group ("LFG"), which was acquired on June 30,
1995 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interest. Certain
reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements for
1994 and 1993 to conform to the classifications presented for 1995.
 
     In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the statements of condition and results of
operations for the periods indicated. Actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to
significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the allowance
for possible loan losses and the valuation of other real estate owned. In
connection with the determination of these allowances, management generally
obtains independent appraisals.
 
  Statement of Cash Flows
 
     The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented using the indirect
method. Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks.
 
  Investment Securities
 
     Valley adopted prospectively on January 1, 1994 Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investment in
Debt and Equity Securities". Under the provisions of SFAS 115, investments will
be classified into three categories: held to maturity, available for sale and
trading.
 
     Investment securities held to maturity, except for equity securities, are
carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts by using the interest method over the term of the investment.
 
     Management has identified those investment securities which may be sold
prior to maturity. These investment securities are classified as available for
sale on the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and are
recorded at fair value on an aggregate basis and unrealized holding gains and
losses (net of related tax effects) on such securities are excluded from
earnings, but are included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net
of deferred tax.
 
     Transfers of securities between investment categories are at fair value as
of the transfer date with the accounting treatment of unrealized gains and
losses determined by the category into which the security is transferred.
 
     Realized gains or losses on the sale of investment securities are
recognized by the specific identification method and shown as a separate
component of non-interest income.
 
  Loans and Loan Fees
 
     Loans are stated net of unearned income. Unearned income on discounted
loans is recognized based upon methods which approximate a level yield. Loan
origination and commitment fees, net of related costs, are deferred and
amortized as an adjustment of loan yield over the estimated lives of the loans
approximating the effective interest method.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
     On January 1, 1995, Valley adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 118 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income
Recognition and Disclosures," ("SFAS 118"). Valley has chosen to maintain its
existing income recognition policies with respect to non-accrual loans.
 
     Interest income is not accrued on loans where interest or principal is 90
days or more past due or if in management's judgement the ultimate
collectibility of the interest is doubtful. Exceptions may be made if the loan
is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection. When a loan is
placed on non-accrual, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest
is reversed and charged against current income. Payments received on non-accrual
loans are applied against principal. A loan may only be restored to an accruing
basis when it again becomes well secured and in the process of collection and
all past due amounts have been collected.
 
     On January 1, 1995, Valley adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS
114"). SFAS 114 requires that the value of an impaired loan be measured based
upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans
effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. Smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively
evaluated for impairment, such as residential mortgage loans and installment
loans, are specifically excluded from the impaired loan portfolio. Valley has
defined the population of impaired loans to be all non-accrual loans, consisting
primarily of commercial real estate loans. The impaired loan portfolio is
primarily collateral dependent, as defined by SFAS 114. Impaired loans are
individually assessed to determine that each loan's carrying value is not in
excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the
expected future cash flows.
 
     Valley originates loans guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration("SBA"). The principal amount of these loans is guaranteed up to
70% by the SBA. Valley may sell the guaranteed portions of these loans and
retain the unguaranteed portions as well as the rights to service the loans.
Gains are recorded on loan sales based on premiums paid by the purchasers.
 
  Allowance for Possible Loan Losses
 
     The allowance for possible loan losses ("allowance") is increased through
provisions charged against current earnings and additionally by crediting
amounts of recoveries received, if any, on previously charged-off loans. The
allowance is reduced by charge-offs on loans which are determined to be a loss,
in accordance with established policies when all efforts of collection have been
exhausted.
 
     The allowance is maintained at a level necessary to absorb potential loan
losses and other credit risk related charge-offs. It is the result of an
analysis which relates outstanding balances to expected reserve levels required
to absorb future credit losses. Current and economic problems are addressed
through management's assessment of anticipated changes in the regional economic
climate, changes in composition and volume of the loan portfolio and variances
in levels of classified loans, non-performing loans and other past due amounts.
 
  Premises and Equipment
 
     Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization computed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or
estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Major improvements are
capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as
incurred. Upon retirement or disposition, any gain or loss is credited or
charged to operations.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
  Other Real Estate Owned
 
     Real estate formally acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans is
classified as other real estate owned. These assets are recorded at the lower of
cost or fair value at the time of acquisition, with any excess charged to the
allowance for loan losses. Subsequently, other real estate owned is carried at
the lower of fair value, less estimated costs to sell, or cost.
 
     An allowance for other real estate owned has been established to maintain
these properties at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell.
Other real estate owned is shown net of the allowance. The allowance is
established through charges to other real estate owned expense.
 
  Intangible Assets
 
     Intangible assets resulting from acquisitions under the purchase method of
accounting consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill, which was
recorded prior to 1987, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25
years. Core deposit intangibles are amortized on accelerated methods over the
estimated lives of the assets. Goodwill and core deposit intangibles are
included in other assets.
 
  Mortgage Servicing
 
     Servicing fee income, representing reimbursement for loan administrative
services performed on contractually serviced mortgages, are credited to income
as earned.
 
     Purchased mortgage servicing rights are capitalized and amortized over the
estimated lives of related loans and approximate the amount by which the present
value of estimated future servicing revenues exceeds the present value of
expected servicing costs.
 
  Income Taxes
 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),
"Accounting for Income Taxes", required a change from the deferred method under
APB Opinion 11 to the asset and liability method of SFAS 109. Deferred income
taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, Valley adopted SFAS 109 prospectively and has
reported the cumulative effect of that change in method of accounting for income
taxes in the 1993 consolidated statement of income.
 
  Earnings Per Share
 
     Earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during each period. All share and per share
amounts have been restated to reflect the five percent stock dividend on May 2,
1995, the ten percent stock dividend on May 3, 1994 and the five for four stock
split on April 16, 1993. Shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants
are not included in the calculation of earnings per share since their effect is
not material.
 
  Treasury Stock
 
     Treasury stock is recorded using the cost method and accordingly is
presented as an unallocated reduction of shareholders' equity.

ACQUISITIONS (NOTE 2)
 
     On June 30, 1995, Valley acquired by merger the $671 million asset Lakeland
First Financial Group, Inc. ("LFG"), based in Succasunna, New Jersey and its
sixteen branch subsidiary, Lakeland Savings Bank ("Lakeland"). Each share of LFG
common stock outstanding was converted into 1.286 shares of Valley common stock,
resulting in the issuance by Valley of 5,136,446 shares of Valley common stock.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. Prior to the
merger, Lakeland's fiscal year ended on June 30th. In recording the pooling of
interests combination, LFG's statement of financial condition as of June 30,
1995 was combined with Valley's statement of financial condition as of December
31, 1994. LFG's statements of income for the years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994,
were combined with Valley's statements of income for the years ended December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. An adjustment has been made to shareholders'
equity to eliminate the effect of including LFG's results of operations for the
six months ended June 30, 1995 in both the year ended December 31, 1995 and the
year ended December 31, 1994. The consolidated financial statements of Valley
include the accounts of LFG for all periods presented. Separate results of the
combining companies are as follows:

     On February 28, 1995, Valley acquired American Union Bank ("American"),
headquartered in Union, New Jersey, with two branches and approximately $58
million in assets. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 288,734 shares of
Valley common stock and was accounted for using the pooling of interests method
of accounting. The financial statements for Valley have not been restated as
they would not have been materially different from those presented. American's
financial statements are included in Valley's consolidated financial statements
as of January 1, 1995. Each share of common stock of American was exchanged for
0.50 shares of Valley common stock.
 
     On November 30, 1994, Valley acquired approximately $190 million in assets
of Rock Financial Corporation ("RFC"), based in North Plainfield, New Jersey and
its five branch subsidiary, Rock Bank ("Rock"). Each share of RFC common stock
outstanding was converted into 1.85 shares of Valley common stock for a total of
approximately 1.7 million shares. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
pooling of interests and the consolidated financial statements of Valley include
the accounts of RFC for all periods presented.
 
     On June 18, 1993, Valley issued approximately 421,000 shares of its common
stock at a cost of $10,962,000 in exchange for approximately 661,000 shares of
common stock of Peoples Bancorp ("Peoples") of Fairfield, New Jersey, a New
Jersey corporation and a registered bank holding company of Peoples Bank,
National Association, a banking association. The merger was accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting, and as such, the consolidated financial
statements include the results of operations and assets and liabilities of
Peoples from June 18, 1993 forward. The proforma results of operations for the
period January 1

  Bonus Plan
 
     VNB and its subsidiaries award incentive and merit bonuses to its officers
and employees based upon a percentage of the covered employees compensation and
determined by the achievement of certain performance objectives. Amounts charged
to salaries expense during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $1,265,000, $1,495,000 and

  Savings Plan
 
     VNB maintains a contribution matching 401K Savings and Investment Plan.
This plan covers eligible employees of VNB and its subsidiaries. The 401K plan
allows employees to contribute from 1% to 12% of their salary with VNB matching
a certain percentage out of its current years earnings with the distribution of
VNB's contributions subject to a vesting schedule. 401K expense for 1995, 1994
and 1993 amounts to $396,000, $586,000 and $663,000, respectively.
 
  Stock Incentive Plan
 
     Valley maintains a stock incentive plan pursuant to which 1,847,030 shares
of common stock have been authorized for issuance to certain key employees in
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock
awards. Shares of Valley's common stock may be purchased under qualified and
non-qualified stock options at 100 percent and 80 percent, respectively, of the
fair market value of such shares on the date of the grant. The options granted
under this plan are, in general, exercisable not earlier than one year after the
date of grant, and expire not more than ten years after the date of the grant,
and are subject to a vesting schedule. Changes in total options outstanding
during 1995, 1994 and 1993 are as follows:

  Financial Instruments With Off-Balance Sheet Risk
 
     In the ordinary course of business of meeting the financial needs of its
customers, Valley, through its subsidiary VNB, is a party to various financial
instruments which are properly not reflected in the consolidated financial
statements. These financial instruments include standby and commercial letters
of credit, unused portions of lines of credit and commitments to extend various
types of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial
statements. The commitment or contract amount of these instruments is an
indicator of VNB's level of involvement in each type of instrument as well as
the exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party
to the financial instrument. VNB seeks to limit any exposure of credit loss by
applying the same credit underwriting standards, including credit review,
interest rates and collateral requirements or personal guarantees, as for
on-balance sheet lending facilities.
 
     The following table provides a summary of financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk at December 31, 1995 and 1994:

     Standby letters of credit represent the guarantee by VNB of the obligations
or performance of a customer in the event the customer is unable to meet or
perform its obligations to a third party. Obligations to advance funds under
commitments to extend credit, including commitments under unused lines of
credit, are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of
any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have specified
expiration dates, which may be extended upon request, or other termination
clauses and generally require payment of a fee.
 
     The amounts set forth above do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements as it is anticipated that many of these commitments will expire
without being fully drawn upon. Most of VNB's lending activity is to customers
within the state of New Jersey.

  Litigation
 
     In the normal course of business, Valley may be a party to various
outstanding legal proceedings and claims. In the opinion of management, the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of Valley will not be
materially affected by the outcome of such legal proceedings and claims.
 
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (NOTE 15)
 
  Dividend Restrictions
 
     VNB, a national banking association, is subject to a limitation in the
amount of dividends it may pay to Valley, VNB's only shareholder. Prior approval
by the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") is required to the extent the total
of all dividends to be declared by VNB in any calendar year exceeds net profits,
as defined, for that year combined with its retained net profits from the
preceding two calendar years, less any transfers to capital surplus. Under this
limitation, VNB could declare dividends in 1996 without prior approval of the
OCC of up to $59,540,000 plus an amount equal to VNB's net profits for 1996 to
the date of such dividend declaration.
 
  Treasury Stock
 
     During 1995 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of Valley's common stock. As of December 31, 1995 the company has
purchased 563,160 shares, all of which have been reissued under the company's
stock option plan and expired warrant program.
 
  Warrants for Purchase of Common Stock
 
     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement between Valley and Mayflower Financial
Corp. ("Mayflower") during 1990, Valley issued 449,883 warrants valued at
approximately $225,000 in exchange for all issued and outstanding common shares
of Mayflower. The warrants, which became exercisable on June 30, 1991 and
expired on December 31, 1995, provided the warrant holder the right to acquire
2.1656 shares of Valley's common stock at a price of $27.50 per warrant. As of
December 31, 1995 approximately 430,000 warrants were exchanged for
approximately 931,000 shares of Valley common stock and approximately 20,000
warrants expired without being exercised.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (NOTE 18)
 
     Limitations: The fair value estimates made at December 31, 1995 and 1994
were based on pertinent market data and relevant information on the financial
instrument at that time. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire portion of the
financial instruments. Because no market exists for a portion of the financial
instruments, fair value estimates may be based on judgments regarding future
expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of
various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective
in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and
therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the estimates.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
     Fair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. For instance, Valley has certain fee-generating business
lines (e.g. its mortgage servicing operation and trust department) that were not
considered in these estimates since these activities are not financial
instruments. In addition, the tax implications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered in many of the estimates.
 
     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments:
 
     Cash and short-term investments: For such short-term investments, the
carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
 
     Investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available
for sale: Fair values are based on quoted market prices.
 
     Loans: Fair values were estimated by obtaining quoted market prices, when
available. The fair value of other loans were estimated by discounting the
future cash flows using market discount rates that reflect the credit and
interest-rate risk inherent in the loan.
 
     Deposit liabilities: Current carrying amounts approximate estimated fair
value of demand deposits and savings accounts. The fair value of time deposits
was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows using estimated
rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturity.
 
     Short term liabilities: Current carrying amounts approximate estimated fair
value.
 
     Other borrowings: The fair value was estimated by discounting future cash
flows based on rates currently available for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturity.
 
     The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments
were as follows at December 31, 1995 and 1994:

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Valley National Bancorp:
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Valley National Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995
and 1994 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1995. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did
not audit the consolidated statement of income of Lakeland First Financial Group
for the year ended December 31, 1993 which statement reflects total net interest
income constituting 13% of the related consolidated total. That statement was
audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Lakeland First
Financial Group, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Valley National Bancorp and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
 
     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Valley
National Bancorp and subsidiaries adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" in 1994
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" in 1993.

                                                                   EXHIBIT (10)E

                             SPLIT-DOLLAR AGREEMENT

                  AGREEMENT made and entered as of the 7th day of July, 1995, by
and between VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORPORATION, a New Jersey corporation, with
principal offices and place of business in the State of New Jersey (the
"Corporation"), VALLEY NATIONAL BANK AS TRUSTEE UNDER THE GERALD H. LIPKIN AND
LINDA I. LIPKIN 1995 IRREVOCABLE TRUST AGREEMENT DATED JULY 7, 1995 (the
"Trust"), GERALD H. LIPKIN, an individual residing at 3 Stonehedge, Montville,
New Jersey (the "Employee") and LINDA LIPKIN, his wife ("Mrs. Lipkin").

                             W I T N E S S E T H :

                  WHEREAS, the Employee is employed by the Corporation; and

                  WHEREAS, the Employee wishes to provide second to die life
insurance protection in the net amount of $1,000,000 for his estate in the event
of the death of Employee and his wife, which is described in Exhibit A attached
hereto and by this reference made a part hereof (the "Policy"), and which was
issued by The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (the "Insurer"); and

                  WHEREAS, the Corporation is willing to pay the annual premiums
due on the Policy until it is fully paid, in return for a waiver by the Employee
of his coverage under the Corporation's group term policy, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth; and

                  WHEREAS, the Policy was purchased by the Trust and the Trust
is the owner of the Policy and, as such, possesses all incidents of ownership in
and to the Policy; and

                  WHEREAS, the Corporation wishes to have the Policy
collaterally assigned to it by the Trust, in order to secure the repayment of
the amounts which it will pay toward the premiums on the Policy.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual promises contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                  1.      Policy and Assignment. The Trust has purchased the
Policy from the Insurer in the initial total face amount of $1,300,000. The
parties hereto have taken all necessary action to cause the Insurer to issue the
Policy, and shall take any further action which may be necessary to cause the
Policy to conform to the provisions of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree
that the
<PAGE>   2
                                      -2-

Policy shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the
collateral assignment filed with the Insurer relating to the Policy, a copy of
which is annexed hereto as Exhibit B (the "Assignment").

                  2.      Trust Is Owner of Policy. The Trust shall be the sole
and absolute owner of the Policy, and may exercise all ownership rights granted
to the owner thereof by the terms of the Policy, except as may otherwise be
provided herein and in the Assignment.

                  3.      Obligations.

                            (a)     Corporation's Payment Obligations. On or
before the due date of each Policy premium, or within the grace period provided
therein, the Corporation shall pay the entire premium due to the Insurer, and
shall, upon request, promptly furnish the Employee evidence of timely payment of
such premium. The Corporation shall annually furnish the Employee a statement of
the amount of income reportable by the Employee for federal and state income tax
purposes, if any, as a result of its payment of such sum. The obligation of the
Corporation to pay the Policy premiums shall cease at the earlier of (the
"Payment Period") (i) the death of both the Employee and Mrs. Lipkin, or (ii)
the payment of Policy premiums for a number of years, such that the Policy is
fully paid (i.e., no further premiums are due thereunder to maintain a
$1,000,000 death benefit), the Corporation is repaid from the Policy all of the
Policy premiums it paid (without interest) and the Policy will pay a death
benefit to the beneficiaries of $1,000,000 (the "Fully Paid Period"). The Policy
illustrations show the Fully Paid Period to be eleven (11) years with a
repayment to the Corporation in year 15. The parties recognize that the Fully
Paid Period may be more or less than that shown in the illustrations. All the
Policy premiums paid by the Corporation hereunder are referred to as the
"Aggregate Policy Premiums". The Corporation shall pay the Policy premiums
hereunder, regardless of whether the Employee continues to be employed by the
Corporation, dies or the Corporation has any other offset to the payment;
provided, however, the Corporation may cease making the payments if the Employee
is terminated by the Corporation for "Cause", as defined in the
Change-in-Control Agreement (as hereafter defined in Section 11).

                            (b)     Maintenance of Policy Until Repayment. The
Trust, the Employee and Mrs. Lipkin agree to maintain the Policy until the
Corporation is repaid from the Policy in full (without interest) the Aggregate
Policy Premiums.

                  4.      Collateral Assignment of Policy to Corporation. To
secure the repayment to the Corporation of the amounts payable to it hereunder,
the Trust has, contemporaneously herewith, assigned the Policy to the
Corporation as collateral, a copy of which is
<PAGE>   3
                                      -3-

annexed hereto as Exhibit B. The parties hereto agree to take all action
necessary to cause the Assignment to conform to the provisions of this Agreement
and the forms used by the Insurer.

                  5.      Rights of Parties in Policy.

                            (a)     Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Trust may not sell, assign, transfer, borrow against, surrender, cancel or
dispose of the Policy, nor make any election in respect thereof, without the
express written consent of the Corporation, and any such act shall be deemed to
be null and void.

                            (b)     The Employee and Mrs. Lipkin have exercised
the right to absolutely and irrevocably give to the Trust all of their right,
title and interest in and to the Policy, subject to the Assignment. The
Corporation shall treat the Trust as the sole owner of all of the Employee's
right, title and interest in and to the Policy, subject to this Agreement and
the Corporation's rights under the Assignment. The Employee and Mrs. Lipkin have
no right, title or interest in and to the Policy, all such rights being vested
in and exercisable only by the Trust. The Trust shall have no further right to
give or otherwise transfer any interest in the Policy.

                            (c)     During the term of this Agreement, except as
expressly provided herein, the Corporation agrees that it shall not be entitled
either to withdraw any of the cash surrender value ("Cash Value") from the
Policy, or borrow such funds, using the Policy as security therefor.

                  6.      Death Benefits.

                            (a)     Collection of Death Benefits. Upon the death
of the Employee and Mrs. Lipkin, the Corporation shall promptly take all action
necessary to obtain the death benefit (the "Death Benefit") provided under the
Policy.

                            (b)     Repayment to the Corporation from Death
Benefits. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive that amount of the Death
Benefit equal to (the "Corporation Death Benefit Amount") the greater of (i) the
excess of the Death Benefit over $1,000,000, or (ii) the Aggregate Policy
Premiums (without interest). The balance of the Death Benefit, if any, shall be
paid directly to the beneficiary or beneficiaries ("Beneficiary") in the manner
and in the amount or amounts provided in the beneficiary designation provision
of the Policy. In no event shall the amount payable to the Corporation exceed
the Death Benefit. No amount shall be paid from the Death Benefit to the
Beneficiary until the Corporation has been paid the Corporation Death Benefit
Amount. The parties hereto agree that the beneficiary designation provision of
the Policy shall conform to the provisions hereof.

                                      -4-

                  7.      Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the
earliest of the following event:

                            (a)     Repayment to the Corporation from the Policy
of the Aggregate Policy Premiums at the end of the Fully Paid Period from the
Cash Value, or paid up Policy additions or a Policy loan or otherwise; or

                            (b)     Repayment to the Corporation of the
Corporation Death Benefit Amount from the Death Benefit; or

                            (c)     Mutual agreement of the Trust and the
Corporation, with the consent of the Employee (or Mrs. Lipkin if the Employee
has died).

                  8.      Repayment to Corporation at End of Fully Paid Period.
If the Policy continues without the payment of the Death Benefit through the
Fully Paid Period, the Corporation shall be entitled to be repaid from the
Policy as soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Fully Paid Period, the
Aggregate Policy Premiums by means of the surrender of a portion of the Cash
Value or paid-up Policy additions or a Policy loan or otherwise. The parties
hereto agree to cause the Corporation to be so repaid as soon as possible after
the Fully Paid Period.

                  9.      Insurer Rights. The Insurer shall be fully discharged
from its obligations under the Policy by payment of the Death Benefit to the
Beneficiary, subject to the terms and conditions of the Policy. In no event
shall the Insurer be considered a party to this Agreement, or any modification
or amendment hereof. No provision of this Agreement, nor of any modification or
amendment hereof, shall in any way be construed as enlarging, changing, varying,
or in any other way affecting the obligations of the Insurer as expressly
provided in the Policy, except insofar as the provisions hereof are made a part
of the Policy by the Collateral Assignment executed by the Employee and filed
with the Insurer in connection herewith.

                  10.     Procedures.

                            (a)     Valley National Bank is hereby designated
the "Named Fiduciary" under this Agreement.

                            (b)     The Named Fiduciary shall control and manage
the Policy. Such responsibilities may be allocated to other persons, named in a
written instrument spelling out to whom and which responsibilities have been
delegated.

                  The following claims procedure are available for this Policy:
<PAGE>   5
                                      -5-

                                      (1)     Claims Procedure. The Trust or the
         Beneficiary and Corporation shall make claim and execute such forms as
         required under the Policy and to be sent to the Insurer as required
         under the Policy. Should the Insurer deny the claim, the parties may
         request the Insurer to review the decision under the Insurer's standard
         review procedures.

                                      (2)     Notification and Content of
         Decision. Notice of the decision to deny the claim in whole or in part
         shall be furnished to the claimant by the Insurer within a reasonable
         period of time after the claim has been filed.

                                      The notification shall set forth the
         reason for the denial, reference to the pertinent part of the policy or
         plan provisions on which the denial is based. The Claimant may request
         a description of information necessary to perfect the claim and an
         explanation of claim review procedures.

                                      (3)     Review Procedure. There is no
         independent review procedure.  The purpose of the review procedure set
         forth herein is to provide a means to contest a claim denial under the
         terms of the Policy.  The Corporation, Trust or the Beneficiary may:

                                             (A)   Request a review upon written
                  application to the Insurer;

                                             (B)   Request a description of
                  information necessary to perfect the claim; and

                                             (C)   May submit issues and
                  comments in writing.

                  11.     Employee Waiver of Other Insurance Rights. Subject to
the terms hereof, the Employee hereby waives any and all rights Employee has to
have the Corporation (or its subsidiaries) provide life insurance on the life of
the Employee during his employment with the Corporation (or its subsidiaries) or
thereafter, and any successor in interest to the Corporation, including, but not
limited to, any rights under a policy or employment manual, under the
Change-in-Control Agreement (the "Change-in-Control Agreement") between the
Corporation and the Employee dated January 1, 1995 (and any amendment or
supplement thereto) under the Severance Agreement (the "Severance Agreement"),
dated August 17, 1994, between the Corporation and the Employee and any other
claims arising out of such agreements due to the lack of such group life
insurance.

                  12.     Taxes. The Employee recognizes that he or the Trust
may be required to pay federal, state and local income taxes on the value of the
benefits conveyed to him or the Trust hereunder, and the Corporation is not
liable to the Employee or the Trust for such taxes.

                                      -6-

                  13.     Trust Agreement. The Corporation has agreed to cause
its attorneys to draft a trust agreement to create the Trust to which the
Employee has transferred the Policy, the preparation of the Trust to be at the
cost and expense of the Corporation. The Employee hereby assigns its rights to
have the Corporation pay the premiums on the Policy to the Trust.

                  14.     Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement and the
Assignment constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
matters covered hereby and revokes any prior agreements or understandings
whether oral or written, with respect to the matters covered hereby. This
Agreement may not be amended, altered or modified, except by a written
instrument signed by the Trust, the Corporation and the Employee (except after
the death of the Employee, the consent of Mrs. Lipkin is required), or their
respective successors or assigns, and may not be otherwise terminated except as
provided herein.

                  15.     Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Corporation and its successors and
assigns, and the Employee, his successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and beneficiaries.

                  16.     Notices. Any notice, consent or demand required or
permitted to be given under the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing, and shall be signed by the party giving or making the same. If such
notice, consent or demand is mailed to a party hereto, it shall be sent by
United States certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to such party's last
known address as shown on the records of the Corporation. The date of such
mailing shall be deemed the date of notice, consent or demand.
