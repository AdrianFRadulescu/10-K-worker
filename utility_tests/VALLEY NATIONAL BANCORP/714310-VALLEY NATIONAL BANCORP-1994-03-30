                                                PART I
Item 1.    BUSINESS

a)  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORP

Valley National Bancorp (Valley) is a bank holding company organized on 
May 2, 1983, under the laws of the State of New Jersey and registered with
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956.  Its principal business activities are restricted to 
those permissible by Bank Holding Companies under the Bank 
Act of 1956, as amended, and include the management and control of Valley 
National Bank (VNB).

As of December 31, 1993, Valley's subsidiaries operated 59 full service
banking branches located throughout northern New Jersey.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On June 18, 1993, Valley issued approximately 421,000 shares of its 
common stock at a cost of $10,962,000 in exchange for approximately
661,000 shares of common stock of PeoplesBancorp ("Peoples") of 
Fairfield, New Jersey, a New Jersey Corporation and a registered bank
holding company of Peoples Bank, National Association, a banking 
association.  The merger was accounted for under the purchase method of 
accounting.

The acquisition of Peoples resulted in the following statement of condition 
increases as of the acquisition date:

Investment securities.............................................$ 47,472,000
Loans, net of unearned income.....................................$138,459,000
Total deposits....................................................$204,825,000

SUBSIDIARIES

VNB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valley, is a national association 
established in 1927 under the laws of the United States.  VNB provides a full
 range of commercial and retail bank services, including the acceptance of
 demand, savings and time deposits; extension of
consumer, real estate, S.B.A. and other commercial credits; and offers full
 personal and corporate trust services, as well as pension and other fiduciary 
services.  VNB operates 59 full service branch offices in five (5) New Jersey
 Counties.

Valley Investment Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of VNB, was 
organized on December 27, 1984, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Its 
business activities include holding, maintaining, and managing tangible
 investment assets.  These assets include a tax-exempt
money market fund, state and municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury Notes, U.S. Agency 
Bonds,mortgage-backed securities and mortgages secured by real estate 
situated outside of the State of Delaware.

VNB Mortgage Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of VNB, was organized 
on March 28,1989, under the laws of the State of New Jersey.  Its primary 
business activities include servicing residential mortgage loan portfolios for 
VNB and various investors.

BNV Realty Incorporated, a wholly-owned subsidiary of VNB, was organized on 
August 16, 1991, under the laws of the state of New Jersey.  Its primary
 business activities are limited to holding and disposing of real estate VNB
 may acquire as other real estate owned.

VN Investment Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of VNB, was organized on 
October 28, 1993,under the laws of the State of New Jersey.  Its business 
activities include holding,maintaining, and managing tangible investment
 assets.  These assets include U.S. Agency Bonds
and mortgage-backed securities.






Mayflower Financial Corporation ("Mayflower") is a savings and loan holding 
company for Mayflower Savings Bank, S.L.A., (MSB) a New Jersey-chartered 
stock savings bank, which operated two (2) full-service offices located in 
Livingston, New Jersey.  Mayflower was incorporated in April 1988, under the
 laws of the State of Delaware, as a stock corporation,at the direction of 
the Board of Directors of MSB for the purpose of becoming
company which would own all of the outstanding capital stock of MSB upon its 
conversion from the mutual-to-stock form of organization.

MSB was organized in 1921 as a New Jersey chartered mutual savings and loan 
association.  MSB converted to the stock form of organization and sold all of
 its outstanding capital stock to Mayflower in August 1988.  Valley acquired
 Mayflower and MSB as of December 31, 1990.  As of
the close of business, January 31, 1993, Mayflower Financial Corporation
 ("Mayflower") and its wholly-owned savings and loan subsidiary, Mayflower 
Savings Bank ("MSB") were merged into
Valley and VNB, respectively.

COMPETITION

Vigorous competition for loans and deposit accounts exists in all the major 
areas where Valley, or any of its subsidiary companies are presently engaged
 in business.  Competition for banking services is based on price, product 
type, service quality and convenience of
location.  VNB and its subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, other 
financial institutions such as savings banks, savings and loan associations, 
mortgage companies, leasing companies, finance companies and a variety of 
financial service and advisory companies.

EMPLOYEES

At year-end 1993, VNB and its subsidiaries employed 1,081 full-time equivalent
 persons.Management considers relations with employees to be satisfactory.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Valley and VNB are subject to regulation and supervision by federal bank 
regulatory agencies. Valley is regulated and examined by the Federal 
Reserve Board and VNB is regulated and
examined by the Comptroller of the Currency.  There are a variety of 
statutory and regulatory restrictions governing the relations among 
Valley and VNB.

The payment of dividends by VNB to Valley is restricted under the National Bank
 Act.  The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the
 dividends for the year exceed the net profits, as defined in the Act, of
 that year plus the retained net profits for the
preceding two years.  In addition, a national bank's capital surplus must be 
equal to or exceed the stated capital for its common stock, or else the bank 
must make certain transfers from retained earnings to capital surplus.

The Banking Affiliates Act of 1982 severely restricts loans and extensions
 of credit by VNB to Valley and its affiliates (except affiliates which are
 banks).  In general, such loans
must be secured by collateral having a market value ranging from 100% to 130% 
of the loan, depending upon the type of collateral.

Furthermore, the aggregate of all loans from VNB to Valley and its affiliates in
 the aggregate may not exceed 20% of VNB's capital stock and surplus and, 
singly to Valley or any affiliate, may not exceed 10% of VNB's capital stock 
and surplus.  Similarly, the Banking Affiliates Act of 1982 also restricts 
VNB in the purchase of securities issued by, the
acceptance as loan collateral of securities issued by, the purchase of assets
 from, and the issuance of a guarantee or standby letter-of-credit on behalf of,
 Valley or any of its affiliates.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, Valley may not acquire directly or 
indirectly more than
5% of the voting shares of, or substantially all of the assets of, any bank 
without the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  Valley cannot acquire any bank located 
outside New
Jersey unless the law of such other state specifically permits the acquisition.





As of January 1, 1988, New Jersey law permits New Jersey banking organizations 
to acquire or
be acquired by banking organizations in other states on a "reciprocal" basis 
(i.e., provided
the other state's laws permit New Jersey banking organizations to acquire 
banking
organizations in that state on substantially the same terms and conditions 
applicable to
banking acquisitions solely within the state).

Generally, the Bank Holding Company Act limits the business of a bank holding
 company and its
affiliates to banking, managing or controlling banks, and furnishing or 
performing services
for banks controlled by the holding company.  The major exception to this rule 
is that a bank
holding company directly or through a subsidiary may engage in non-banking 
activities which
the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or
 managing or
controlling banks so as to be a proper incident thereto.  The Federal Reserve
 under its
Regulation "Y" has restricted such activities to things such as lease financing,
 mortgage
banking, investment advice, certain data processing services and discount 
brokerage services
and ownership of a savings and loan association.

The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC")
 and the FDIC
have issued risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations.  The 
objective of
these efforts was to provide a more uniform capital framework that is 
sensitive to
differences in risk profiles among banking companies.  Below is a list of such
 requirements
and shows Valley and VNB's ratios as of December 31, 1993.

(2) For qualification as a well-capitalized institution.

On August 9, 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement
 Act of 1989
("FIRREA") was enacted.  FIRREA established new capital standards and enhanced
 regulatory
oversight of the thrift industry.  Under FIRREA, banks are now permitted to 
acquire all
thrifts and may convert such acquired thrifts into commercial bank branches.  
In such a
conversion the thrift may have to pay insurance fund exit and entrance fees to 
the FDIC.  

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") was
 enacted in
December 1991.  FDICIA identifies the following capital standard categories for
 financial
institutions:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, 
significantly
undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  FDICIA imposes progressively
 more
restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions 
depending on the
category in which an institution is classified.  Pursuant to FDICIA, 
undercapitalized
institutions must submit recapitalization plans, and a company controlling a 
failing
institution must guarantee such institutions's compliance with its plan.  
FDICIA also
required the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital 
standards for
safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset 
quality and
executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial 
institution that
does not meet such standards.  The FDIC has adopted many of these regulations. 

The deposits of VNB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC.  
Accordingly, VNB is
subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Bank Insurance Fund 
(the "BIF") of
the FDIC.  Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC established a risk-based insurance 
assessment system.
This approach is designed to ensure that a banking institution's insurance 
assessment is
based on three factors:  the probability that the applicable insurance fund 
will incur a loss
from the institution; the likely amount of the loss; and the revenue needs of 
the insurance
fund.

Under the risk-based assessment system, each BIF member institution is assigned
 to one of
nine assessment risk classifications based on its capital ratios and supervisory
 evaluations. 
The lowest risk institutions presently pay deposit insurance at a rate of .23% 
of domestic
deposits while the highest risk institutions are assessed at the rate of .31% of
 domestic
deposits.  Each institution's classification under the system is reexamined 
semiannually. 
In addition, the FDIC is authorized to increase or decrease such rates on a 
semiannual basis. 
The Bank presently pays a premium of .23%.

Efforts are made to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type
 of borrower and loan to
    guard against a downward turn in any one economic sector.


B.  MATURITIES AND SENSITIVITIES OF LOANS TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES - The 
following
        table sets forth Valley's commercial loans and real estate construction
 loans as of
        December 31, 1993:

The majority of payments due after 1 year represent loans with floating 
interest rates.

Prior to maturity of each loan, Valley generally conducts a review which 
normally includes an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and, if 
applicable, a
review of the adequacy of collateral.  A rollover of the loan at maturity may 
require         a principal paydown.

    C.  RISK ELEMENTS

1.NON ACCRUAL, PAST DUE AND RESTRUCTURED LOANS - The following table sets 
   forth Valley's problem loans for each of the past five years:

($ in thousands)                 1993      1992      1991      1990      1989  
Loans on non-accrual basis...$ 18,535  $ 21,371  $ 25,837  $ 19,713  $  2,414
Loans past due in excess of
90 days and still accruing.     8,498    11,096    10,506     7,640     6,205  
                             $ 27,033  $ 32,467  $ 36,343  $ 27,353  $  8,619

The amount of interest income that would have been recorded on non-accrual 
loans in        1993 had payments remained in accordance with the original 
contractual terms        approximated $2,158,000, while the actual amount of
 interest income recorded on these
        types of assets in 1993 totalled $439,000, resulting in lost interest
 income of $1,719,000.

Loans are generally placed on a non-accrual status when they become past due in
excess of 90 days as to payment of principal or interest.  Exceptions may be
 made if
the loan is sufficiently collaterized and in the process of collection. 
Additionally, loans may be transferred to non-accrual before they are past due 
more
than 90 days if, in management's judgment, the ultimate collectiblity of the 
interest
is doubtful.  A loan may only be restored to an accruing basis when it again 
becomes
well secured and in the process of collection and all past due amounts have been
collected.  Generally, all accrued but unpaid interest at the date a loan is 
placed on a non-accrual status is reversed against current earnings unless 
the aggregate amount of the principal outstanding and accrued interest on the 
loan is sufficiently        supported by the value of the underlying 
collateral.  Subsequent payments received
on non-accrual loans are applied as a reduction of principal amounts
 outstanding.

2.  POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS - Although substantially all risk elements at 
December 31, 1993 have been disclosed in the categories presented above, 
Management believes that the current economic conditions may affect the 
ability of certain borrowers to comply with the contractual repayment terms 
on certain real estate  and commercial loans.  As part of the analysis of 
the loan portfolio by
management, it has been determined that there are approximately $46.8 million in
potential problem loans at December 31, 1993 which have not been classified as
non-accrual, past due or restructured.  Potential problem loans are defined as
performing loans for which management believes that the borrower's ability to
repay the loan may be impaired.  Of this total $5.3 million of loans were
acquired in the Peoples merger. $38.0 million of these loans are considered to
be adequately collaterized and supported by personal guarantees.  Approximately
$3.1 million has been provided for in the allowance for loan losses for these
potential problem loans.  There can be no assurance that Valley has identified
all of its problem loans.  At December 31, 1992, Valley had identified
approximately $30.7 million of problems loans.

        3.  FOREIGN OUTSTANDINGS - None.

4.  LOAN CONCENTRATIONS - There were no loan concentrations at December 31, 1993
other than those disclosed in section III A. above.  Valley's lending activities
 are primarily concentrated within the northern section of New Jersey.  For
additional information, see Loan Portfolio on page 25 of the 1993 Annual Report
to Shareholders.

    D.  OTHER INTEREST BEARING ASSETS - None.

IV.SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE - The following table sets forth the

</TABLE>
The allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to 
absorb      potential loan losses and other credit risk related charge-offs.  
It is the result of      an analysis which relates outstanding balances to 
expected reserve levels required to
      absorb future credit losses.  Current economic problems are addressed 
through      management's assessment of anticipated changes in the regional 
economic climate,      changes in composition and volume of the loan portfolio
 and variances in levels of      classified loans, non-performing assets and 
other past due amounts.  Additional factors
      include consideration of exposure to loss including size of credit, 
existence and
nature of collateral, credit record, profitability and general economic 
conditions.  

The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan 
losses to      specific loan categories for the past five years:

      For additional information, see Asset Quality and Risk Elements on 
page 20 of the 1993
      Annual Report to Shareholders.

      Net charge-offs decreased during 1993 as a result of improved current 
economic
      conditions.  The amount of anticipated charge-offs for 1994 is estimated
 to be
      consistent with 1993.

V.    DEPOSITS - The classification of average deposits is incorporated by

Item 2.    Properties
 At present Valley owns no real property, but utilizes the offices and space 
provided        by VNB at 615 Main Avenue, Passaic, New Jersey and 1445 Valley 
Road, Wayne, New       Jersey.

VNB operates from its administrative headquarters and three other locations, 59
branch offices and two warehouses.  VNB owns the warehouses and 28 banking 
offices,        including its main office and leases 31 branch offices, 
including the administrative
        headquarters.  During 1993 VNB acquired a 62,000 square foot office 
building adjacent
        to its administrative headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey.  As space 
becomes available,
 VNB will begin using the building, as early as 1994, to consolidate 
sections of its        operations.

loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders, (ii) not in good
faith or involving a knowing violation of law, or (iii) resulting
in receipt by such person of an improper personal benefit.  If the
New Jersey Business Corporation Act is amended after approval by
the shareholders of this provision to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors
or officers, then the liability of a director and/or officer of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the New Jersey Business Corporation Act as so amended.

     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the
shareholders of the Corporation or otherwise shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.




     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Gerald H. Lipkin, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the Valley National Bancorp, has executed this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation on behalf of Valley National
Bancorp on this 22nd day of March, 1994.

              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The purpose of this analysis is to provide the reader with
information relevant to understanding and assessing Valley National
Bancorp's ("Valley") results of operations for each of the past
three years and financial condition for each of the past two years. 
In order to fully appreciate this analysis the reader is encouraged
to review the consolidated financial statements and statistical
data found in the following pages of this annual report.

In 1993, Valley achieved record growth in earnings due primarily to
an improved net interest margin, a significant improvement in asset
quality as non-performing assets declined, and continuation of its
acquisition strategy by acquiring the $223.2 million, seven branch
Peoples Bank, NA on June 18, 1993. Income for 1993, after the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, was $54.2
million, or $2.25 per share, reflecting growth of 28.6% on a per
share basis when compared to $41.6 million, or $1.75 per share for
1992. 

The efficiency ratio measures a bank's gross operating expense as
a percentage of fully-taxable equivalent net interest income and
other non-interest income without taking into account security
gains and losses and other non-recurring items. Valley's efficiency
ratio as of December 31, 1993 is 43.8%, one of the lowest in the
industry. This compares with an efficiency ratio for 1992 of 46.7%,
which increased from the 1991 ratio of 44.7% due to the
acquisitions during 1991 and 1992.  Valley strives to control its
efficiency ratio and expenses as a means of producing increased
earnings for its shareholders.  

Earnings Summary

Net income grew to $54.2 million, or $2.25 per share in 1993
compared with $41.6 million or $1.75 per share in 1992 (the 1992
per share amounts have been restated to give effect to a five for
four stock split in 1993).  This increase is largely attributable
to an increase in net interest income of $21.3 million or 18.6%,
and a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $10.0 million or
62.5% . This was offset by a decrease in other operating income of
$3.8 million or 13.3% and was further offset by increased operating
expenses in all non-interest expense categories, due partially to
the acquisition of Peoples Bank in 1993.  The return on average
assets increased in 1993 to 1.64% from 1.38% in 1992, while the
return on average equity increased to 22.0% in 1993 from 19.9% at
year-end 1992.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the largest source of Valley's operating
income.  Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to
$143.8 million for 1993 as compared to $122.0 million for 1992. 
The increase in 1993 was due primarily to the significant decrease
in interest rates on all interest bearing deposit accounts of 109
basis points, which was greater than the decline of 70 basis points
on all interest earning assets. This caused the net interest margin
to increase 30 basis points to 4.62% for 1993 compared to 4.32% for
all of 1992.

Average interest earning assets increased $287.4 million in 1993,
or 10.2% over the 1992 amount.  This increase was mainly the result
of the acquisition of Peoples during June of 1993 with loans and
investments acquired of approximately $185.9 million.  The average
balance of taxable investment securities held to maturity and
available for sale increased by $21.3 million or 1.9% over the 1992
average balance.  Non-taxable investments increased $50.0 million
or 25.1% taking advantage of the increased yield available over
taxable investments.  Residential mortgage loans and automobile
loans have increased steadily during 1993 and continue to be the
largest source of loan volume.  Average loans, including loans held
for sale, increased $224.2 million or 15.6% in 1993 over 1992. The
average rate on loans, including loans held for sale, decreased 77
basis points, but combined with the increase in average loan
volume, interest income on loans for 1993 increased by $7.4 million
over 1992.

Average interest-bearing liabilities grew 8.3% or $203.4 million
and was due mainly to the 1993 acquisition of Peoples.  Falling
deposit interest rates prompted many customers to switch their
deposit funds into savings accounts from term certificates of
deposit, which caused an increase in average savings deposit
balances of 20.4% during 1993 over 1992, while average time
deposits decreased 4.9% during the same period.  Average demand
deposits continued to grow and increased by $58.8 million or 19.2%
over 1992 balances.

The net interest margin increased to 4.62% in 1993 from 4.32% in
1992 which was substantially the result of changes in market
interest rates.  The increase in the net interest margin of 30
basis points, coupled with the increase in average earning assets
over average interest-bearing liabilities, was the basis for the
increase in net interest income.


Non-Interest Income

Non-interest income continues to represent a considerable source of
income for Valley.  Excluding gains on securities transactions and
the one-time gain of $6.4 million on the sale of loans in 1992,
total non-interest income amounted to $18.0 million in 1993
compared with $16.8 million in 1992, representing an increase of
$1.2 million or 7.4% from year to year. 

Service charges on deposit accounts increased $1.4 million or 33.6%
from 1992 to 1993.  Increased volume due to the Peoples seven 
branch acquisition and increased fees charged on deposit accounts
generated a majority of this increase.

Fees from mortgage servicing decreased by 13.3% from $4.4 million
in 1992 to $3.8 million in 1993.  These fees represent gross
servicing fees and related ancillary fees for servicing mortgage
portfolios by VNB Mortgage Services, Inc. ("MSI"), VNB's mortgage
servicing subsidiary.  During 1992 additional servicing portfolios
were acquired totalling $394.5 million, while two small portfolios
totalling approximately $21.3 million were acquired during 1993. 
As of December 31, 1993 MSI serviced a total of $1.17 billion of
loans, of which $467.0 million are serviced for VNB.  The portfolio
declined during 1993 as a result of large amounts of prepayments,
which were partially offset by Valley's loan origination volume. 
Declining interest rates were responsible for  the large amount of
prepayments and the volume of originations.  As a result of these
prepayments, amortization expense was increased  to reduce the
unamortized balance of purchased mortgage servicing rights in line
with the portfolio balance and the expected future cash flows.  An
analysis is completed quarterly to determine necessary amortization
expense, based on all principal payments.  Continued low interest
rates may prompt further prepayments, producing a reduction of
MSI's future net income as a result of additional amortization
expense and reduced servicing fees.  

Gains on the sales of loans were $2.6 million for 1993 compared to
$7.9 million for 1992. During 1993 Valley sold fixed rate 15-year
and 30-year loans as part of its ongoing program to sell higher
interest-rate risk, fixed rate loans, and as a result recorded
gains of $2.6 million on these sales.  During 1992 Valley sold
loans acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") in
1991 to a third party investor and recorded a $6.4 million gain
from the sale of these loans.  Also during 1992, Valley sold 30-
year fixed rate mortgage loans and recorded a gain of $1.4 million. 
These loans were sold to help reduce interest rate risk by selling
long term fixed rate assets.  Loans are sold during the year based
upon loan to value ratio and maturity, and are classified as loans
held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial condition.
It is expected that this sale activity will continue in the future.

Other non-interest income totalled $5.5 million in 1993, compared
with $6.2 million for 1992, a decrease of 10.6% resulting from the
reduction of transactions with the RTC.  Fee income on various
services increased slightly in addition to the net rental income
for a building purchased during 1993.  Valley expects to generate
additional fee income by offering annuity and mutual fund products
in early 1994. 

Net gains on securities transactions in 1993 and 1992 amounted to
$7.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively.  This was the outcome
of restructuring the investment portfolio to alter maturities, due
to declining interest rates and heavy prepayment activity on
mortgage backed securities.


Non-Interest Expense

Non-interest expense totalled $70.9 million for the year, $6.1
million, or 9.4% above the 1992 level.  The branch staff and office
facilities for the seven branches acquired from Peoples account for
a large portion of the increase in non-interest expense.  The
largest component of non-interest expense is salaries and employee
benefit expense which totalled $32.4 million in 1993 compared to
$30.0 million in 1992, an increase of $2.4 million or 8.1%.  At
December 31, 1993, full-time equivalent staff was approximately
1,081, compared to approximately 973 at the end of 1992. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") adopted FASB 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" effective for calendar year 1993.  There is no effect on
Valley's results of operations based on Valley's minimal payment of
postretirement benefits.  In addition, FASB 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" was issued in November 1992
and is effective for calendar year 1994.  The statement provides
standards for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment, but before retirement.  The effect of
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on
Valley's future results of operations. 

Insurance premiums assessed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") increased by $1.0 million, or 18.2% to $6.7
million in 1993, from $5.7 million in 1992.  This resulted from the
deposits acquired in connection with the Peoples acquisition.  The
current rate charged for insurance by the FDIC with respect to
Valley, is .23% of deposits and has been at that level since
September 1991. Overall, assessment rates can range from .23% for
well capitalized institutions with no supervisory concerns to .31%
for undercapitalized institutions with substantial supervisory
concerns. 

Net occupancy expense increased to $6.3 million in 1993 from $5.4
million in 1992.  The increase of $897 thousand represents
additional rent, utilities, tax and maintenance expense on
facilities acquired during 1993 and 1992.  During the second
quarter of 1993 Valley acquired a 62,000 square foot building for
$3.3 million located adjacent to its current administrative
headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey. This facility is currently
occupied by various tenants and will initially result in net rental
income to Valley.  As space becomes available, Valley will begin
using the building to consolidate sections of its operations into
closer proximity with the administrative headquarters. As Valley's
utilization of the space begins in 1994, the net income from rents
will decrease and occupancy expense will increase.

Furniture and equipment expense increased $438 thousand, or 11.9%,
which is again indicative of the 1993 and 1992 acquisitions.  This
includes equipment depreciation, maintenance and repairs.

Amortization of intangible assets increased to $5.0 million in 1993
from $4.1 million in 1992, representing an increase of $890
thousand, or 21.6%.  The majority of this increase, as discussed
previously in relation to fees from mortgage servicing represents
amortization of purchased mortgage servicing rights of $3.7 million
during 1993, compared with $2.8 million for 1992, an increase of
$922 thousand, or 33.0%.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income rose to 35.2%
in 1993 compared to 33.9% in 1992.  This increase was attributable
to the change in the federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%
effective January 1, 1993. A new investment subsidiary was
established during the latter part of 1993 to hold investment
securities to maturity. This subsidiary is expected to have a
positive effect on 1994 net income due to the lower tax rate
presently imposed under state law on investment companies.  

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,"Accounting for
Income Taxes," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board in February 1992.  Statement 109 requires a change from the
deferred method under APB Opinion 11 to the asset and liability
method.  Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, and
their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.  Under Statement 109, the
effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Valley adopted SFAS No. 109 prospectively as of January 1, 1993.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes
reduced net income by $402 thousand and is reported separately in
the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December
31, 1993.

FUNDS MANAGEMENT

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Managing net interest margin continues to be the single most
important factor in maximizing earnings.  Through its
Asset/Liability Policy, Valley strives to maintain a consistent net
interest rate differential by managing the sensitivity and
repricing of its assets and liabilities to interest rate
fluctuations.

Valley seeks to achieve a sufficient level of rate sensitive assets
to equal its rate sensitive liabilities, and analyzes the maturity
and repricing of earning assets and sources of funds at various
intervals.  The level by which repricing earning assets exceed or
are exceeded by repricing sources of funds is expressed as a ratio
and dollar value (interest sensitivity gap) and is used as a
measure of interest rate risk.  

At December 31, 1993, rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate
sensitive assets at the 90 day interval and resulted in a negative
gap of $111 million or a ratio of .91:1.  Rate sensitive assets
exceeded rate sensitive liabilities at the 91 to 365 day interval
by $1.5 million or a ratio of 1.0:1 and resulted in a small
positive gap.  The total negative gap repricing within 365 days as
of December 31, 1993 is $109.4 million or .93:1.  In view of the
present economic climate, management does not view these amounts as
presenting an unusually high risk potential, although no assurances
can be given that Valley is not at risk from rate increases or
decreases.

The above gap results take into account repricing and maturities of
assets and liabilities, but fails to consider the interest rate
sensitivities of those asset and liability accounts.  Management
has prepared for its use an income simulation model to project
future net interest income streams in light of the current gap
position.  Management has also prepared....... 13.93        13.34        11.76
