                                     PART I

Item 1. Business

     Vanguard Real Estate Fund I, A Sales-Commission-Free Income Properties
Fund (the "Fund"), was organized on September 10, 1986 as a Massachusetts
business trust and is a qualified finite-life real estate investment trust
("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The Fund has
no employees.  The Fund's Declaration of Trust precludes the Fund from
reinvesting net proceeds from the sale or repayment of its real estate
investments after December 31, 1993 and contemplates the liquidation of all
the Fund's investments after a period of approximately seven to twelve
years following the completion of its initial public offering, or between
June 30, 1994 and 1999, respectively.

     On December 12, 1994, the Fund's Board of Trustees adopted a Plan of
Liquidation and Termination (the  Liquidation Plan ).  The Trustee's
decision to adopt the Liquidation Plan at this point in the Fund's
initially contemplated liquidation period was driven by several factors,
including real estate market conditions affecting each investment in the
Fund's portfolio and tax considerations affecting real estate investment
trusts.  The Liquidation Plan provides that the Fund will dispose of all of
its assets, wind up its affairs, pay or adequately provide for the payment
of all of its liabilities and distribute for the benefit of its
shareholders all of the Fund's assets over 24 months, in complete
cancellation and redemption of all issued and outstanding shares of
beneficial interest.  Under the Liquidation Plan, the Fund's Adviser,
Aldrich, Eastman and Waltch, L.P., Trustees and officers are authorized and
directed to take any and all actions as may be necessary or convenient to
market the assets of the Fund and convert them into a form that may be
distributed to shareholders.  The Liquidation Plan provides that the Fund's
assets may be sold, conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed of when and
on such terms and conditions as are deemed by the Trustees to be in the
best interests of the Fund and the shareholders.

     The Fund is currently in the process of liquidating its real estate
investments and distributing the net proceeds to its shareholders in
accordance with the Liquidation Plan.  At December 31, 1994, the Fund held
investments in four income-producing properties or portfolios, including
three commercial properties (consisting of one office complex located
outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and shopping centers located in
Torrance, California and Durham, North Carolina) and one residential
apartment complex located in Montgomery County, Maryland.   It is
contemplated that the Fund will be completely liquidated and dissolved by
December 12, 1996.  To the extent that the Fund has not disposed of all of
its assets or made provision for all of its liabilities on December 12,
1996, the Fund intends to form a liquidating trust, the beneficiaries of
which will be the shareholders of the Fund.  All assets and liabilities of
the Fund not previously disposed of and discharged will be transferred to
the liquidating trust.  Shares of the Fund would no longer be traded and the
beneficial interests in the liquidating trust would not be readily
transferable.   As of February 28, 1995, approximately $41 million was
invested in real estate assets, of which $28 million (68%) consisted of real 
estate owned directly, $11 million (27%) consisted of a mortgage loan
investment, and $2 million (5%) consisted of marketable securities.

     Pending disposition of the Fund's real estate investments pursuant to
the Liquidation Plan, the Fund's real estate investments will continue to be
subject to competition from existing commercial, industrial, and residential
properties and will be subject to competition from properties that are
developed in the future.  The REIT provisions of the Code impose certain
financial, investment and operational restrictions that are not applicable
to competing entities that are not REITs.

     Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, in disposing of real estate
investments, the Fund is in competition with other domestic institutional
investors, including commercial banks and other financial institutions,
insurance companies, pensions and other retirement funds, mortgage bankers,
other real estate investment trusts, real estate brokers, developers and
various types of foreign investors who may be seeking to dispose of real
estate investments.  The principal factors of competition for the
disposition of the mortgage loan receivable include the base interest rate,
contingent interest rate and the amount of loan relative to the value of
the underlying property.  In the case of leased properties which the Fund
owns or which secure Fund investments, the marketability of the investments
is also affected by how rental rates, lease terms, free rent concessions
and tenant improvement allowances compare with those in local markets.

     Pursuant to a Services Agreement dated December 23, 1986 (the
"Services Agreement") between the Fund and The Vanguard Group, Inc. (the
"Sponsor"), the Sponsor has been retained to provide administrative
services for the Fund, including the maintenance of financial records,
oversight of the performance of outside service providers and the
preparation and distribution of communications to shareholders, etc., and
to supervise its day-to-day business affairs.  Pursuant to an Advisory
Agreement dated December 23, 1986 (as amended, the "Advisory Agreement")
between the Fund and Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch, Inc. (the "Adviser"), the
Adviser has been retained to advise the Fund in connection with the
evaluation, selection, management and disposition of its real estate
investments.  For additional information concerning the Sponsor, the
Adviser, the Services Agreement and the Advisory Agreement, see Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Financial
Statements, and Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

                                     2
<PAGE>

     The Fund has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Code.  The Fund
intends to operate in a manner that will continue to maintain its
qualification as a REIT during its liquidation period.


     For additional information regarding the Fund's Liquidation Plan,
investments, operations, and other significant events, see Item 2,
Properties, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

* In late September 1994, the Fund exercised its call right with respect to
  its Plaza del Amo mortgage loan investment.  As a result, the entire balance
  of the loan, less the unpaid balance of the senior mortgage on the Plaza
  property, was due and payable on March 26, 1995.  The borrower failed to
  tender payment of the outstanding loan balance on March 26, 1995 and is
  now in default under the terms of the loan.  The Fund and the
  borrower are currently negotiating in an effort to seek a resolution of
  the default, which resolution may include satisfaction of the loan by
  means of  a transfer of title of the property to the Fund in lieu of
  foreclosure.  Since, as of the exercise of the call right and as of
  December 31, 1994 the appraised value of the Plaza property securing the
  loan was in excess of the mortgage loan's current carrying value, no loss
  is currently expected to be incurred by the Fund as a result of the
  default.  The borrower is also expected to continue to pay all interest
  due until transfer of the property to the Fund.

     Set forth below is a summary of the general competitive conditions for
those properties whose book value is ten percent or more of the Fund's
total assets as of December 31, 1994, or whose gross revenues are ten
percent or more of the aggregate gross revenues of the Fund for the year
ended December 31, 1994.
  
Plaza del Amo
-------------

     Plaza Del Amo is a neighborhood shopping center located in Torrance,
California, a highly dense trade area (3-mile ring) with approximately
215,000 residents.  Torrance is a submarket of the South Bay area of Southern
California, where the economy, seriously undermined by the recent recession
in the defense and aerospace industries, is showing the initial signs of
recovery after a 4 1/2 year downturn.    Population growth of 3.9% over the
past five years has improved significantly and is currently outpacing
Los Angeles County's rate (3.0%).  Household incomes have lagged behind those
of the Los Angeles market.  Per capita and the median household income grew 
10.3% and 6.3% over the past five years in the trade area versus 13.2% and
6.8%, respectively, in Los Angeles.  While Torrance is a mature city with
relatively little population growth projected over the next five years,
retail sales are beginning to increase again.  In 1994, retail sales grew
approximately 4%; however retail construction permit activity has decreased
by approximately 14%.  Current vacancy rates for retail space are at 10%.
The only planned project in Torrance is a Kmart 500,000 square foot center.
Market rental rates currently range from $1.70 per square foot to $1.90 per
square foot monthly.

Oakcreek Village
----------------

     Oakcreek Village is a neighborhood shopping center located in Durham,
North Carolina.  Annual population growth has been approximately 2% over
the past three years; while households have grown over 11% during that time.
The median household income has grown approximately 22% in the last five
years while per capita income increased approximately 27% during that time.
The market vacancy rate remains tight at only 3%.  Market rental rates have
risen at an annual average rate of 7% over the past two years, from  $9.50-
$11.50 per square foot NNN (triple net leases) to $10.50-$13.50 per square 
foot NNN.

Sheffield Forest Apartments
---------------------------

     Sheffield Forest is a 256-unit multi-family apartment complex located
in Silver Springs, Maryland.  Employment growth in 1994 for the area was
approximately 1.8%.  The combination of no new apartment deliveries in 1994
coupled with strong rental demand has pushed the market vacancy rate below
5%.  There was no significant rent growth in 1994; however, due to the low
vacancy and limited apartment development, the outlook for rent growth
is positive.  Current monthly market rents are approximately $.75-$1.10 per
square foot.

Minnesota Portfolio
-------------------

     The Minnesota Portfolio currently consists of one office building and
one retail/service center building located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul
suburbs of Shoreview and Roseville, respectively.  The Minneapolis/St. Paul
unemployment rate of 3.4% is lower than the national rate of 6.5%. 
Population growth in Shoreview is expected to be nearly 2% over the next
year.  Current market vacancy rates for Shoreview and Roseville are 7.3% and
8.4%, respectively.  Annual market rental rates are $8.50 per square foot and
$6.25 per square foot.

(f)  Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, depreciation on real
     estate owned was computed using the straight-line method over 40 years
     for buildings and costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition
     of real estate investments were deferred and amortized on a straight-
     line basis over the life of the loan for mortgage loan investments and
     the life of the property for equity investments.  Subsequent to
     adoption of the Liquidation Plan, no depreciation or amortization
     expense related to the Fund's owned real estate and acquisition costs
     is recognized since the Fund's real estate investments are considered
     to be held for sale.

     of the partnership interests of the borrower to the Fund in full

(a)  The Fund advanced $7,750,000 to enter into a shared-appreciation,
wraparound, mortgage loan secured by the Plaza del Amo Shopping Center
( Plaza ).  In addition, Plaza secures two existing senior mortgage loans,
which at the time of investment had an aggregate outstanding balance of
$2,896,000.  The funds advanced plus these two existing senior mortgages
resulted in a total wraparound loan of $10,646,000.  Upon repayment of the
loan, the Fund is entitled to a share of Plaza's appreciation, if any,
equal to 50% of Plaza's fair market value in excess of the original balance
of the wraparound loan.  In late September 1994, the Fund exercised its
call right with respect to the Plaza loan and, therefore, the entire
balance of the loan, less the unpaid balance of the senior mortgage on the
property, becomes due and payable six months from the exercise of the call
right.

ANNUAL REPORT 1994

                  THE VANGUARD VOYAGE . . . STAYING THE COURSE
<PAGE>   2
                              CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

FELLOW SHAREHOLDER:

     Vanguard Real Estate Fund I enjoyed a solid year during 1994. The Fund
completed the sale of its largest asset, Seattle Industrials, at a handsome
profit. Net proceeds from the sale of this property and a smaller one in
Minnesota, totaling some $35.3 million, represented the majority of the Fund's
year-end distribution of $3.69 per share. In December, the Board of Trustees
formally adopted a plan of liquidation calling for the disposition of our
remaining assets and distribution of net proceeds to shareholders by the end of
1996.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

For the year, net income per share amounted to $1.12 per share, compared to
$.30 per share in 1993. Net income was boosted by the net gains realized on
property sales, notably the Seattle properties, of $.85 per share.

        A better guide to the cash flow provided by the Fund's properties is
"funds from operations," which excludes the impact of capital gains and adds
back to net income amortization, depreciation and provisions for losses. Funds
from operations totaled $.51 per share, which compares to $.69 per share in
1993. There were three main reasons for the decline in funds from operations:
(i) the liquidation of our Carmel office investment late in 1993, and the
subsequent return to shareholders of $1.00 per share capital at year-end 1993;
(ii) the October 1994 sale of our Seattle investment which had produced a 
substantial portion of the Fund's cash flow; and (iii) the drop in cash flow 
from our Sheffield Forest property which was converted from a mortgage 
investment to equity ownership. (After the conversion, the Fund expended 
substantial amounts to improve the property's competitive position and future 
rental prospects.)

        The Fund made four distributions in 1994. The first three were paid at
the regular quarterly rate of $.15 per share. The fourth, paid in late December,
amounted to $3.69 per share, bringing the total distributions for the year to
$4.14 per share. Effectively, the final distribution reflected a return of
capital to shareholders from net proceeds of property sales. Aggregating this
payment along with previous returns of proceeds, the amount of capital at work
since the Fund's inception has been cut by approximately two-thirds. The Fund's
ability to generate income in the future has been reduced correspondingly.
Accordingly, we would expect to reduce the quarterly distribution to
approximately $.05-$.06 per share in 1995, down from the level of $.15 per share
we have maintained since inception in 1987.

        For tax purposes, the $3.69 per share distribution paid after the
adoption of the plan of liquidation is considered a liquidating distribution
which is nontaxable to shareholders (to the extent a shareholder has a remaining
tax cost basis). Of the remaining $.45 per share paid in 1994, $.10 per share is
taxable ($.09 per share as a long-term capital gain, $.01 per share as ordinary

income) and $.35 per share represents a non-taxable return of capital.

THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO

The Fund made good progress on its property portfolio during 1994. As
noted, the highlight of the year was the sale, on October 3, of our Seattle
Industrials property (consisting of over one million square feet of warehouse
space), for net proceeds of $30.1 million. This sale was completed at a price
substantially higher than our 1993 year-end valuation, and some 35% higher than
the cost of the property when purchased in January 1988. The Fund had benefited
over the years from a high level of income on this property. However, we believe
the sale price was attractive, especially given the substantial risk associated
with the scheduled 1997 expiration of the leases, all dependent on a single
tenant.

        In other transactions during the year, the Fund also sold, in August,
the Deluxe Check building in Minnesota for net proceeds of $5.2 million. The
Fund recorded a loss of some $1.1 million on this sale. In April, the Fund took
control of the Sheffield Forest apartment complex in the Washington, D.C. area,
a property on which we had previously held a mortgage loan. Net cash flow from
the property declined during the year, in part due to needed maintenance and
improvements made at the recommendation of our Adviser, Aldrich, Eastman &
Waltch, L.P. (AEW).

        After the year's two sales, the remaining property portfolio is small,
consisting of our participating mortgage investment in the Plaza del Amo
shopping center in Torrance, California and equity investments in Sheffield
Forest Apartments, the Oakcreek Village shopping center in Durham, North
Carolina, and two very small properties remaining in our Minnesota Portfolio.
Occupancy throughout the portfolio remains high at 98% overall, as detailed in
the table on page 5. For further details on the Fund's investments, please see
the letter from our Adviser beginning on page 5.

MEASURES OF VALUE

At each year end, we provide you with an update on the estimated value of
the Fund's investments. This valuation is based on the lower of the opinions
provided by independent appraisers and our Adviser. For year-end 1994, the
estimated fair market value was $3.79 per share. This amount is of course lower
than the $7.15 per share reported to you at year-end 1993, principally as a
result of 1994 distributions from property sales. Adjusting the year-end
valuation for 1994 distributions in excess of funds from operations ($3.63 per
share), the Fund's fair market value remained steady in 1994.

        We have also provided, on page 27, an estimate of the Fund's liquidation
value which takes into account the substantial costs of completing real estate
sales. Based on the fair market value of $3.79 per share, we would expect the
Fund to net approximately $3.73 per share after all costs if the properties were
sold in the current environment. Of course, we would stress that these
valuations are merely estimates and the eventual net sales proceeds may be
higher or lower.

        I would note that, again in 1994, there is a discrepancy between the
appraisers' and AEW's estimate of fair market value, with the appraisers'
valuations being in aggregate some 7% higher than the reported figure. This
disparity confirms how imprecise real estate valuations really are. In the end,
the only valid valuation is a completed transaction price.

        Reflecting the substantial year-end distribution, the secondary market
trading price of the Fund's shares declined in December. The last trade of the
year on the American Stock Exchange was completed at $3.75 per share. Adjusting
this price for the Fund's year-end distribution from net sales proceeds, the
trading price is nearly identical to the $7.38 per share level at the end of
1993.

Russell-NCREIF Index for the years 1988-1994.]

LONGER-TERM PERFORMANCE

In total return terms--that is taking into account income and capital
change--1994 was a strong year for Vanguard Real Estate Fund I. The Fund's total
return (calculated on the basis of our year-end 1993 valuation of $7.15 per
share) was +10.9%, which compares favorably to the return of +6.7% for the
Russell-NCREIF Index of pension real estate portfolios (one of the few indexes
available to measure real estate performance).

        The chart at the top of the page illustrates the Fund's performance
since its inception in 1987. The Fund's return has been very competitive with
the Index over its lifetime. However, in absolute terms, the Fund's returns have
indeed been modest. We calculate the Fund's return to have been approximately
4.7% annually without the benefit of reinvested distributions. If we include the
effect of reinvestment of distributions at the U.S. Treasury bill rate, the
total return would have been 4.8% annually (versus 2.1% for the Index).

        With the return of capital each year, we recognize it may be getting a
little difficult to keep track of the Fund's results. The chart on page 4 may
make the task easier by showing the annual year-end appraised value per share
since inception (1987), as well as the annual and cumulative distributions each
year. In sum, the combined value of the Fund's cumulative distributions,
excluding the benefit of any earnings on reinvested distributions, and the
year-end 1994 appraised value per share amounts to $13.54 which compares to the
original offering price of $10 per share.

THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION

As you know, Vanguard Real Estate Fund I is a finite-life real estate
investment trust, established in 1987 with an expected life of seven to twelve
years. Now in the eighth year of operations, we have completed the sale of our
largest holding and believe it is appropriate to adopt a "plan of liquidation
and termination." This plan calls for the Fund to sell its remaining investments
over the course of 1995 and 1996, returning net proceeds to shareholders and
terminating REIT operations at the end of the period.

        The plan has beneficial tax implications for the Fund's taxable
shareholders. Because of the formal plan filed with the Internal Revenue
Service, all distributions made in accordance with the plan after its adoption,
including 1994's year-end distribution, are considered "liquidating
distributions." Such distributions are treated as a return of capital to
shareholders in that they effectively serve to reduce tax cost basis.
Accordingly, no taxes are owed on these distributions until such time as a
shareholder's tax cost basis is reduced to zero. Thereafter, additional payments
from the Fund are taxable as capital gains, not as ordinary income.

        The plan reflects our expectation that the remaining investments held by
the Fund can be sold on a favorable basis over the course of the

next two years. Of course, real estate market conditions or local property 
circumstances may change such that it may not be appropriate to sell a 
property within this timeframe. In such case, any remaining properties may be 
transferred into a "liquidating trust" in which shareholders would maintain 
beneficial interest, continuing to receive the net income earned on the 
assets until eventual sale.

        Over the remaining life of the Fund, our attention, and that of our
Adviser, will continue to be focused on maximizing the value you receive from
your investment. I look forward to reporting to you on our ongoing progress.

                      REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER

PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW

Late in the year, the Fund's Board of Trustees adopted a plan of
liquidation. Consistent with this approach, we have been working to position
each of the assets so as to generate the maximum potential sales proceeds. With
respect to the Fund's fee-owned properties, this means maintaining high
occupancy levels, completing capital improvements that will add value to the
assets, and minimizing expenses so as to maximize net operating income (NOI).
NOI is a key factor in the market pricing of real estate assets.

        Two of the Fund's assets were sold during the final half of 1994. In
August, we completed the sale of the Deluxe Check Building, which had been part
of the three-property Minnesota Portfolio (Minneapolis area, Minnesota). The
gross sale price was $5,550,000, or 2% higher than the Fund's most recent
valuation of the asset, albeit at a loss from its original purchase price. In
October, the Fund's largest asset, Seattle Industrials (Seattle and Kent,
Washington), was sold at a price that exceeded the Fund's most recent appraised
value by about 18%. The investment produced a 15% annual rate of return to the
Fund over its seven-year holding period. We also have taken steps, by exercising
a call right, to liquidate the Fund's only debt investment, a wraparound
mortgage loan secured by Plaza del Amo (Torrance, California).

        All of the assets in the Fund's remaining portfolio are well-leased and
stable. Occupancy ranges from 96% to 100%. On a combined basis, 1994 net
operating income for the remaining assets was 4% below budget, due primarily to
slower than expected leasing of the remaining space at Oakcreek Village (Durham,
North Carolina) and higher than anticipated costs associated with the Fund's
April 1994 acquisition of title to Sheffield Forest (Silver Spring, Maryland).

        The remaining two properties in the Minnesota Portfolio are currently
being marketed for sale, and we expect to begin the marketing of Sheffield
Forest and Oakcreek Village in the second and fourth quarters of 1995,
respectively.

VALUATION

Once again this year, the value of each property in which the Fund holds an
interest was thoroughly reviewed by both AEW and by independent appraisers prior
to year end. The lower of the two amounts is then used in determining the fair
market value of the Fund's assets. On a combined basis, the independently
appraised value of the Fund's remaining properties increased by about 4%;
however, AEW's opinion of value remained unchanged.

PROPERTY HIGHLIGHTS

The Fund took title to Sheffield Forest in April 1994. Since then, we have
hired a new property manager and stabilized the property's occupancy and
operations. Maintenance items that had been neglected by the former owner (the
Fund's borrower), such as painting, public area renovations and landscaping,
have been addressed. Leasing efforts have been reinvigorated, and occupancy

has improved from 93% at the end of 1993 to 96%. Since the Fund took title to 
the property, average monthly rents have increased by almost 4%.

        At Oakcreek Village, much of our effort during the year has focused on
positioning the center to compete effectively with a new retail center currently
under construction nearby. All leases that expired in 1994 were renewed
successfully, and 1,600 square feet of new leasing was completed. Early renewal
discussions are underway with several tenants whose leases expire in 1995 and
1996.

        As a result of the Fund's exercise of its call right, discussions are
underway with the borrower at Plaza del Amo regarding repayment of the Fund's
loan. It is unlikely that the borrower, who has until late March 1995 to repay
the loan, will be able to refinance the full amount of the debt. However, the
appraised value of the property collateralizing the loan is in excess of the
outstanding mortgage, and, therefore, we anticipate satisfactory recovery of
this investment via a sale of the center, a partial refinancing coupled with the
investment of additional capital by the borrower, or a transfer of title to the
Fund.

        The two properties that now comprise the Minnesota Portfolio are 100%
leased, and operations are stable. Both properties are being actively marketed
for sale.

Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch, L.P.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


A.    GENERAL DESCRIPTION: Vanguard Real Estate Fund I, A Sales-Commission-Free
Income Properties Fund (the "Fund"), a Massachusetts business trust established
in 1987, is a qualified finite-life real estate investment trust ("REIT") under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Fund's Declaration of Trust precludes the
Fund from reinvesting net proceeds from the sale or repayment of its real estate
investments in additional real estate investments after December 31, 1993 and
contemplates the liquidation of all of the Fund's investments after a period of
approximately seven to twelve years following completion of its initial public
offering. On December 12, 1994, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved a Plan of
Liquidation and Termination (the "Liquidation Plan"). The Liquidation Plan
provides that the Fund will dispose of all of its assets, wind up its affairs,
pay or adequately provide for the payment of all of its liabilities and
distribute for the benefit of its shareholders all of the Fund's assets over 24
months in complete cancellation and redemption of all issued and outstanding
shares of beneficial interest. The Liquidation Plan provides that the Fund's
assets may be sold, conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed of when and on
such terms and conditions as are deemed by the Trustees to be in the best
interests of the Fund and the shareholders. It is contemplated that the Fund
will be completely liquidated and dissolved by December 12, 1996. To the extent
that the Fund has not disposed of all of its assets or made provision for all of
its liabilities on December 12, 1996, the Fund intends to form a liquidating
trust, the beneficiaries of which will be the shareholders of the Fund. All
assets and liabilities not disposed of and discharged will be transferred to the
liquidating trust. Shares of the Fund would no longer be traded and the
beneficial interests in the liquidating trust would not be readily transferable.

        The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code during the Fund's liquidation period.

B.    The following significant accounting policies are in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles for real estate investment trusts. 
Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of 
financial statements.

1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The Fund's financial statements have been prepared 
    on the basis of a going concern using historical cost. In December 1994, 
    upon adoption of the Liquidation Plan, the Fund considered all of its 
    remaining investments as held for sale and reduced the carrying value of 
    such investments to the extent that each investment's then-current 
    carrying value exceeded its estimated net realizable value, defined as 
    estimated fair market value less selling costs.

2.  ORGANIZATION COSTS: Costs incurred in conjunction with the organization of 
    the Fund were deferred and were amortized on a straight-line basis over a 
    60-month period from the date the Fund commenced operations.

3.  INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE: Real estate directly owned by the Fund is 
    carried at cost less accumulated provisions for depreciation and estimated 
    losses. Major renovations are capitalized, and routine maintenance and 
    repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

        During 1993 and part of 1994, the Fund held mortgage loan investments
    accounted for as in-substance foreclosed assets. In general, property is
    deemed to be an in-substance foreclosed asset when a debtor has little or no
    equity in the collateral and proceeds for repayment of the loan can be
    expected to come only from the sale or operation of the collateral. Although
    legal title to such property had not been obtained, the Fund is considered
    to have substantially the same risks and rewards as a mortgagee.

4.  REVENUE RECOGNITION: Rental income is accrued as rents are due. For those
    operating leases that provide for rental concessions or fixed escalation
    increases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    term of the lease. For those operating leases that provide for reimbursement
    of expenses for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, utilities and
    insurance, income is recognized in the period in which the expenses are
    incurred.


                                      12
<PAGE>   14
        Mortgage interest income is recorded based on the annual effective yield
    of the respective loans. For mortgage loans treated for accounting purposes
    as in-substance foreclosed assets, revenue is recognized only to the extent
    of cash receipts.

5.  PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE LOSSES: Provision for possible losses is provided 
    for estimated losses based upon management's regular evaluation of the 
    recoverability of each investment in the portfolio. Except for investments 
    considered to be held-for-sale, management's evaluation included 
    consideration of cash flows during each investment's estimated remaining 
    holding period. Provisions for possible losses are recorded as direct 
    write downs of the carrying value of direct ownership investments and 
    mortgage loans receivable at the time such investments are deemed to be 
    in-substance foreclosed assets. Subsequent provisions to reduce the 
    carrying value of in-substance foreclosed assets are included in the 
    allowance for possible losses.

6.  DEPRECIATION AND ACQUISITION COSTS: Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation
    Plan, depreciation on real estate owned was computed using the straight-line
    method over 40 years for buildings and costs incurred in conjunction with
    the acquisition of real estate investments were deferred and amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the life of the loan for mortgage loan investments
    and the life of the property for equity investments. Subsequent to adoption
    of the Liquidation Plan, no depreciation or amortization expense related to
    the Fund's owned real estate and acquisition costs is recognized since the
    Fund's real estate investments are considered to be held-for-sale assets.

7.  SHORT-TERM AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS: Investments in marketable
    securities, including Vanguard Money Market Reserves-Prime Portfolio, are
    carried at the lower of cost or market. Temporary cash investments are
    carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value. The Fund's
    temporary cash investments consisted of certificates of deposit at December
    31, 1994.

8.  CASH EQUIVALENTS: For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Fund 
    considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original 
    maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents.

9.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a
    real estate investment trust and to distribute, at a minimum, all of its
    taxable income. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes is
    required in the financial statements. Differences between net income
    determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    taxable income before dividend distributions result primarily from timing
    differences relating to the accounting for the provision for possible
    losses, depreciation on tenant improvements, and certain rental income.

10. PER SHARE AMOUNTS: The calculation of the Fund's net income per share is
    based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
    year. Income, capital gain, liquidating and return of capital distributions
    per share represent actual distributions made during the year.

C.    Under the terms of an agreement expiring December 31, 1995, as amended, 
the Fund pays Aldrich, Eastman and Waltch, L.P. (the "Adviser") an annual 
investment advisory fee equal to .5% of the average fair market value of the 
Fund's real estate investments. The Fund also pays the Adviser investment 
transaction fees generally equal to an amount ranging from 1.5% to 2% of the 
proceeds realized from its real estate investments and to .65% of the proceeds 
realized from refinancing mortgage loans outstanding. Pursuant to an amendment 
of the agreement dated September 2, 1994, investment transaction fees will be 
equal to 1.5% of the proceeds realized from real estate investments unless 
such proceeds exceed an agreed-upon target amount above the investment's March 
31, 1994 appraised value, in which case investment transaction fees will be 
equal to 2% of such proceeds. At December 31, 1994, the associated investment 
transaction fee percentage for all of the Fund's real estate investments, if 
sold at their current appraised value, would be 1.5%. The Fund incurred real 
estate investment transaction fees of $724,000 and $270,000, respectively, for 
the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993. The Fund did not incur real estate 
investment transaction fees during the year ended December 31, 1992.

D.    Under the terms of an agreement expiring December 31, 1995, the Fund 
pays The Vanguard Group, Inc. (the "Sponsor") an administrative fee calculated 
at an annual percentage rate of the average fair market value of the Fund's real
estate investments and temporary cash investments (excluding investments in
Vanguard Money Market Reserves-Prime Portfolio). The administrative fee
represents an effective annual rate of .4% of the average fair market value of
such investments for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.

E.    The Fund's wholly-owned direct real estate investments consisted of the

(1) The Fund sold Seattle Industrial Parks ("Seattle") on October 3, 1994, for a
contract price of $31,850,000. In addition to a 2% disposition fee paid to the
Fund's Adviser, the Fund also paid a sales incentive fee of $520,000 to the
Seattle property manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the purchaser, in
connection with the sale of Seattle. 

(2) On August 17, 1994, the Fund sold the Deluxe Check, or Arden Hills, 
building in its Minnesota Portfolio for $5,550,000. Deluxe Check, purchased in 
February 1988, was the largest of three buildings in the Minnesota Portfolio. 
The Fund realized a loss of $1,137,000 on the sale of the building, $1,070,000 
of which was recognized via a write down of the investment's carrying value 
in the second quarter of 1994. 

(3) On April 13, 1994, the Fund obtained title to Sheffield Forest Apartments 
(see Note F). 

(4) Upon adoption of the Liquidation Plan in December 1994, the Fund's 
management wrote down the carrying value of its three direct ownership 
investments to reflect the effect of their held-for-sale status on management's 
assessment of the investments' recoverability.

(1) Classified as an in-substance foreclosed asset.

      Upon repayment of the Plaza del Amo loan, the Fund is entitled to a share
of the property's appreciation, if any, equal to 50% of Plaza del Amo's fair
market value in excess of the original wraparound mortgage loan balance of $10.6
million. In late September 1994, the Fund exercised its call right with respect
to the Plaza loan and, therefore, the entire balance of the loan, less the
unpaid balance of the senior mortgage on the property (see Note H), becomes due
and payable six months from the exercise of the call right. As of the date of
the exercise of the call right and at December 31, 1994, the appraised value of
the Plaza property was in excess of the mortgage loan's carrying value and,
accordingly, no provision for possible losses has been recorded with respect to
this investment.

      On April 13, 1994, the Fund obtained title to Sheffield Forest Apartments
("Sheffield") via a transfer of all of the partnership interests of the borrower
in full satisfaction of the mortgage loan outstanding. The borrower that
formerly owned and operated Sheffield funded, pursuant to a guarantee which
expired on December 7, 1993, interest on the mortgage loan secured by the
Sheffield property in excess of cash flow generated by the property during 1993.
The Fund and the borrower were unable to reach satisfactory restructuring terms
on the loan, and the borrower defaulted on the loan in January 1994 by making
only a partial payment of its then-due interest installment. This investment,
which had been written down to its estimated fair value minus selling costs at
December 31, 1993, was reclassified as a direct ownership investment at the date
of transfer. No additional loss was required to be recorded at the date of the
transfer since the allowance for possible losses previously recorded
sufficiently reduced the carrying value of the Sheffield investment to its net
realizable value.

      In 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 (SFAS 114), "Accounting by Creditors for
the Impairment of a Loan." Adoption of SFAS 114 is required for the year
beginning January 1, 1995. It requires that loans, such as the Fund's mortgage
loan receivable, if impaired, be measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or as a
practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of
the collateral. Because the Fund already recognizes such reductions of value, if
present, through its provision for possible losses, adoption of SFAS 114 is not
expected to have a significant effect on the Fund's financial position or
results of operations.

      In addition to the provision for possible losses recorded through the
allowance account, $1,920,000 was charged to the provision for losses in 1994 to

I.    In the first quarter of 1993, the Fund defaulted on its mortgage loan
obligation secured by the Citadel II investment in Orlando, Florida. During the
period of default, the net cash flow generated from the property's operations
were remitted to the lender on a monthly basis, under terms of a cash flow
agreement. Accordingly, the Fund did not realize any net income or receive any
cash flow from the property during the default period. The Fund's Adviser had
previously approached the lender in an effort to restructure the loan; however,
a restructuring satisfactory to both the Fund and the lender could not be
achieved. Accordingly, on September 1, 1993, the Fund ceded title of the
property to the lender in full satisfaction of amounts due under the
non-recourse mortgage loan obligation. Since the Citadel II investment had
previously been written down to the remaining principal balance of the loan, no
additional loss on this investment was recognized in the year ended December 31,
1993.

      Total minimum future rentals do not include contingent rentals under
certain leases based upon lessees' sales volumes. Contingent rentals aggregating
$4,000, $37,000, and $30,000 were received during 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively. Certain leases also require lessees to pay all or a portion of
real estate taxes and operating costs.

K.    During the fourth quarter of 1990, the Fund's Board of Trustees authorized
the Fund to repurchase in the open market from time to time up to 500,000 of the
Fund's outstanding shares. As of December 31, 1994, 413,725 shares have been
repurchased at an aggregate cost of $3,134,000.

        Valuation allowances of $125,000 and $14,000, respectively, were
recorded to reduce the carrying value of the securities to their respective
market values at December 31, 1994 and 1993. During 1993, four other RTC REMIC
securities were purchased and subsequently sold at a realized gain of $8,000.
Such gain, determined based on the cost of the specific securities sold, is
included in mortgage interest income for the year ended December 31, 1993.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders and Trustees of
Vanguard Real Estate Fund I

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of
operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Vanguard Real Estate Fund I
(the "Fund") at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

As explained in Note A to the financial statements, on December 12, 1994, the
Fund's Board of Trustees approved a Plan of Liquidation and Termination which
will result in the sale or disposition of all of the assets of the Fund, the
payment or provision for all liabilities of the Fund, and the distribution to
shareholders of the remaining proceeds in a complete liquidation and dissolution
of the Fund. The Fund's management currently anticipates that such liquidation
and dissolution of the Fund will occur on or before December 12, 1996.

(a) Funds from operations is calculated by adding back depreciation,
    amortization, and the Fund's provision for possible losses to income (loss)
    before net gain on sales of investments. Funds from operations should not be
    considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Fund's
    operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

(b) Net income per share is calculated based upon the weighted average number of
    shares outstanding during the year. Income, capital gain, liquidating and
    return of capital distributions per share designations are made based on
    their treatment for Federal income tax purposes and represent actual
    distributions made during the year.

(c) Net of accumulated depreciation, the allowance for possible losses and
    reductions in carrying value recorded via the provision for possible losses.



                      MARKET AND DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION

The Fund's Shares of Beneficial Interest ("Shares") are traded on the American
Stock Exchange under the symbol "VRO." As of December 31, 1994, there were
approximately 15,621 shareholders of record of the Fund's Shares.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

        Vanguard Real Estate Fund I, A Sales-Commission-Free Income Properties
Fund (the "Fund"), a Massachusetts business trust established in 1987, is a
qualified finite-life real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. The Fund's current real estate investments include both
direct ownership properties and a shared appreciation mortgage and consist of
three income-producing commercial properties (comprised of one office building
and two shopping centers) and one income-producing residential apartment
complex. Geographically, the Fund's investments are located in each of the North
Central, Pacific Southwest and Mideast regions. The Fund's Declaration of Trust
precludes the Fund from reinvesting net proceeds from the sale or repayment of
its real estate investments in additional real estate investments after December
31, 1993 and contemplates the liquidation of all of the Fund's investments after
a period of approximately seven to twelve years following completion of its
initial public offering, or between June 30, 1994 and 1999, respectively.

        On December 12, 1994, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved a Plan of
Liquidation and Termination (the "Liquidation Plan"). The Trustee's decision to
adopt the Liquidation Plan at this point in the Fund's initially contemplated
liquidation period was driven by several factors, including real estate market
conditions affecting each investment in the Fund's portfolio and tax
considerations affecting real estate investment trusts. The Liquidation Plan
provides that the Fund will dispose of all of its assets, wind up its affairs,
pay or adequately provide for the payment of all of its liabilities and
distribute for the benefit of its shareholders all of the Fund's assets over 24
months, in complete cancellation and redemption of all issued and outstanding
shares of beneficial interest. Under the Liquidation Plan, the Fund's Adviser,
Aldrich, Eastman and Waltch, L.P., Trustees and officers are authorized and
directed to take any and all actions as may be necessary or convenient to market
the assets of the Fund and convert them into a form that may be distributed to
shareholders. The Liquidation Plan provides that the Fund's assets may be sold,
conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed of when and on such terms and
conditions as are deemed by the Trustees to be in the best interests of the Fund
and the shareholders.

        The Fund is currently in the process of liquidating its real estate
investments and distributing the net proceeds to its shareholders in accordance
with the Liquidation Plan. It is contemplated that the Fund will be completely
liquidated and dissolved by December 12, 1996. To the extent that the Fund has
not disposed of all of its assets or made provision for all of its liabilities
on December 12, 1996, the Fund intends to form a liquidating trust, the
beneficiaries of which will be the shareholders of the Fund. All assets and
liabilities of the Fund not previously disposed of and discharged will be
transferred to the liquidating trust. See "Distributions" and "Liquidity and
Capital Resources."

        In late September 1994, the Fund exercised its call right with respect
to its Plaza del Amo wrap-around mortgage loan investment and, therefore, the
entire balance of the loan, less the unpaid balance of the senior mortgage on
the Plaza property, becomes due and payable in late March 1995. As of the date
of the exercise of the call right and at December 31, 1994, the appraised value
of the Plaza property was in excess of the mortgage loan investment's carrying
value.

        The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code during the Fund's liquidation period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1994 as compared to 1993

        Net Income

        For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Fund earned net income of
$12,382,000, or $1.12 per share, as compared to net income of $3,338,000, or
$.30 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1993. Net income for the year
ended December 31, 1994 included a net gain on sales of investments of
$9,412,000, or $.85 per share, resulting from a gain of $9,479,000, or $.86 per
share, realized from the Fund's October 3, 1994 sale of its Seattle Industrial
Park investment for a contract price of 


                                      21
<PAGE>   23

$31,850,000. This gain was partially offset by a loss of $67,000, or $.01 per 
share, on the Fund's August 17, 1994 sale of the Deluxe Check, or Arden Hills, 
building (the largest of the three buildings in its Minnesota Portfolio)
for a contract price of $5,550,000. Including a charge to the provision for
possible losses of $1,070,000 in the second quarter of 1994 to reduce the
carrying value of this building to its estimated net realizable value, the
Fund's realized loss on the Deluxe Check sale aggregated $1,137,000. In
connection with the Seattle sale, and in accordance with the terms of the Fund's
advisory agreement, the Fund paid a disposition fee of $616,000, representing 2%
of the net proceeds of the transaction, to its Adviser. The Fund also paid a
sales incentive fee of $520,000 to the Seattle property manager, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the purchaser. In connection with the Deluxe Check sale, the Fund
paid its Adviser a disposition fee of $108,000, representing 2% of the net
proceeds of the transaction.

        The Fund's net income before net gain on sales of investments for the
year ended December 31, 1994, was $2,970,000, or $.27 per share, as compared to
net income before net gain on sales of investments for the year ended December
31, 1993 of $3,338,000, or $.30 per share, representing a decrease in net income
of $368,000. This decrease, as more fully described below, primarily reflects
decreases in net rental income, net income from in-substance foreclosed assets
and mortgage interest income. These decreases in net income were partially
offset by (i) a provision for possible losses of $1,630,000 in 1994 as compared
to $3,263,000 for 1993, (ii) an increase in short-term investment income; and
(iii) a decrease in administrative expenses, in each case as compared to such
items in 1993 and excluding results from the Fund's Citadel II investment, to
which title was transferred on September 1, 1993.

        For comparison purposes, results from Citadel II have been excluded
since the Fund did not realize net income, or recognize a loss, related to
Citadel II in 1993. In January 1993, the Fund defaulted on a mortgage loan
obligation secured by its Citadel II office building investment in Orlando,
Florida. In September 1993, the Fund ceded title to Citadel II to the lender in
full satisfaction of amounts due under the non-recourse mortgage loan. This
investment had been written down to the remaining principal balance of the loan
as of December 31, 1992. In addition, during the period of default, the net cash
flow generated from the property's operations was remitted to the lender.
Accordingly, the Fund did not realize any net income related to Citadel II in
1993. The excess of Citadel II's expenses over its net income for the year ended
December 31, 1993 of $465,000 was charged off to the Fund's provision for
possible losses, resulting in net income of zero related to Citadel II in 1993.

        Provisions for Possible Losses

        The Fund's 1994 provision for possible losses in the amount of
$1,630,000 ($1,920,000 net of charge-offs of $290,000 recorded during 1994) was
recorded to (i) write down the carrying value of the Fund's investment in the
Deluxe Check building to its estimated net realizable value and, (ii) write down
the carrying value of the Fund's remaining three direct ownership
investments--Oakcreek Village, Sheffield Forest Apartments and the two remaining
buildings in the Minnesota Portfolio--upon adoption of the Fund's Liquidation
Plan to their estimated net realizable values. The Fund's 1993 provision for
possible losses was recorded to write down the carrying value of two of the
Fund's then-in-substance foreclosed asset investments, Sheffield and Carmel.

        The provision for possible losses is based upon management's regular
evaluation of the recoverability of each investment in the portfolio. Prior to
the adoption of the Liquidation Plan on December 12, 1994, management's
evaluation of recoverability was based upon (i) the Adviser's analysis of
current property values (adjusted for estimated selling costs), (ii) independent
appraisals, and (iii) management's estimate of cash flows during each
investment's remaining holding period. Upon adoption of the Liquidation Plan,
the Fund's remaining real estate investments are considered to be held for sale,
rather than for the production of income, and, accordingly, are, for purposes of
assessing their recoverability, considered to have no remaining holding period.
A provision for possible losses of 



                                      22

<PAGE>   24

$850,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994 to reflect the effect of the
held-for-sale status on the Fund's three remaining direct ownership investments.
Since the appraised value of the property securing the Fund's Plaza del Amo
mortgage loan investment exceeds the loan receivable balance at December 31,
1994 , the loan's carrying value was not reduced as a result of the adoption of
the Liquidation Plan. With respect to Deluxe Check, during the second quarter of
1994, Fund management, based on information provided by the Fund's Adviser,
shortened the estimated remaining holding period for this building (which
was subsequently sold in the third quarter of 1994) and recorded a provision for
possible losses in the amount of $1,070,000.

        The Fund's management believes that the provisions recorded to write
down the carrying values of its remaining direct ownership investments are
adequate at December 31, 1994; however, the provisions are based on estimates
and actual results may vary from current estimates.

        Net Rental Income

        Net rental income (rental income less real estate taxes and property
operating expenses) decreased by $372,000, or 7%, from $4,989,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1993 to $4,617,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994. This
decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of Seattle and Deluxe Check,
which generated for the Fund net rental income of $2,398,000 and $439,000,
respectively, during their respective 1994 holding periods, as compared to
$3,172,000 and $640,000, respectively, for the full year in 1993. This decline
was partially offset by the net rental income generated for the Fund in 1994 by
the Sheffield Forest Apartment complex, to which the Fund obtained title on
April 13, 1994 as described in Note F to the accompanying financial statements.
This investment, which was classified as an in-substance foreclosed asset during
all of 1993, provided net rental income of $495,000 from April 13 through
December 31, 1994.

        At each of December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993, the overall
occupancy rate of the Fund's direct real estate investments, excluding
Sheffield, was 97%. The occupancy rate of Sheffield was 96% and 93% at December
31, 1994 and December 31, 1993, respectively. The occupancy rate of the property
underlying the Fund's Plaza del Amo mortgage loan investment was 99% and 98% at
December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993, respectively. Leases for 4% of the
rentable space of the properties directly owned by the Fund, excluding
Sheffield, and for 6% at the property underlying the Plaza del Amo mortgage
investment expire during 1995, respectively. Leases for units at Sheffield are
generally for one-year terms or less as is customary for apartment leases. The
Fund's Adviser is currently working to renew leases and to identify new tenants
for space covered by leases that have expired or are expiring. However, there
can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to maintain its current occupancy
and level of income.

        Net Income From In-Substance Foreclosed Assets

        Net income from in-substance foreclosed assets decreased by $2,180,000,
or 87%, from $2,499,000 in the year ended December 31, 1993 to $319,000 in the
year ended December 31, 1994. This decrease was primarily a result of: (i) the
discounted payoff in late July 1993 of the Carmel mortgage loan investment,
which had been classified as an in-substance foreclosed asset since 1991 and
which contributed $915,000 in net income for the year ended December 31, 1993,
and (ii) the Fund obtaining title to Sheffield in April 1994. Sheffield provided
net income of $1,584,000 as an in-substance foreclosed asset in 1993, as
compared to $319,000 during the period in 1994 prior to the Fund obtaining title
to the property, at which time it was reclassified from an in-substance
foreclosed asset to a direct ownership investment.



                                      23

<PAGE>   25
        Mortgage Interest Income

        Mortgage interest income decreased by $178,000, or 14%, from $1,279,000
in 1993 to $1,101,000 in 1994. This decrease was primarily due to: (i) a
decrease of $ 63,000 in interest income earned from the Fund's investments in
RTC-issued mortgage-backed securities; and (ii) valuation adjustments totaling
$111,000 recorded during 1994 to reduce the carrying value of such
mortgage-backed securities. Interest income earned from mortgage-backed
securities decreased as a result of a lower average investment balance of such
securities in 1994 as compared to 1993. Valuation adjustments to reduce the
carrying value of such securities have been recorded to reflect reductions in
the market value of these investments resulting from increases in prevailing
interest rates. These investments were acquired as an additional temporary
investment vehicle for excess working capital reserve balances.

        Investment Income From Short-Term Investments

        Investment income from short-term investments increased by $453,000,
from $367,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 to $820,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1994. This increase is primarily due to income from the
investment of the proceeds made available by the sales of the Deluxe Check
building in August 1994 and Seattle Industrial Parks in October 1994 and an
increase in prevailing short-term interest rates in 1994 as compared to 1993.

        Administrative Expenses

        Administrative expenses decreased by $187,000, or 17%, from $1,128,000
for the year ended December 31, 1993 to $941,000 for the year ended December 31,
1994. This decrease was primarily due to lower advisory and administrative fees
payable in the 1994 period, which fees are based on average invested real estate
assets. The Fund's average assets invested in real estate decreased during 1994
due to (i) the payoff of the Carmel investment and subsequent distribution of
the proceeds to shareholders in 1993 and (ii) the sale of the Deluxe Check and
Seattle investments in 1994.

        Exclusive of the amounts related to Citadel II, depreciation and
amortization expense and mortgage interest expense decreased by $80,000 and
$9,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1994 as compared to such
expenses for the year ended December 31, 1993.

1993 as compared to 1992

        For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Fund earned net income of
$3,338,000, or $.30 per share, compared to net income for the year ended
December 31, 1992, of $1,345,000, or $.12 per share. As more fully described
below, this increase in net income reflects: (i) a 1993 provision for possible
losses of $2,798,000 as compared to $4,501,000 in 1992; (ii) an increase in net
rental income and mortgage interest income; (iii) a decrease in net income from
then in-substance foreclosed assets and investment income from short-term
investments; and (iv) a decrease in mortgage interest expense, in each case as
compared to such items in 1992.

        The 1993 provision for possible losses in the amount of $2,798,000
($3,500,000 net of charge-offs of $702,000 recorded during 1993) was recorded to
write down the carrying value of two of the Fund's then-classified in-substance
foreclosed assets, Sheffield and Carmel. The Fund's provision for possible
losses recorded in 1992 reduced the carrying value of the Citadel II investment
to the remaining principal balance of the loan secured by this investment.

        Net rental income (rental income less real estate taxes and property
operating expenses) increased by $195,000, or 4%, from $5,457,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1992, to $5,652,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.
This increase in net rental income was attributable primarily to an increase of
$538,000, or 20%, in the net rental income from the Fund's Seattle investment
which increased from $2,634,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992, to
$3,172,000 for the comparable 



                                      24
<PAGE>   26
period of 1993. This increase was due to a 57% increase in the rental rates on 
one of the major leases (502,500 square feet), which was renewed in the fourth 
quarter of 1992 for a term of five years.

        In addition, net rental income at the Fund's Oakcreek investment
increased by $95,000, or 11%, from $875,000 for the year ended December 31,
1992, to $970,000 for the comparable period of 1993.

        Increases in the net rental income of Seattle and Oakcreek were offset
by a decrease of $442,000 in net rental income from Citadel II. In consideration
of several factors resulting from weak local market conditions in the Orlando
airport area, including; (i) insufficient net rental income in 1992 to cover
debt service on the non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Citadel II; (ii) the
expected continuation of such debt service deficits over the next several years;
and (iii) a decline in the appraised value of the property to a point below the
outstanding principal balance of the loan at December 31, 1992, the Fund
defaulted on the mortgage loan obligation secured by Citadel II in the first
quarter of 1993. During the period of default, the net cash flow generated from
the property's operations were remitted to the lender on a monthly basis under
terms of a cash flow agreement. Accordingly, the Fund did not realize any net
income or receive any cash flow from the property during the default period. On
September 1, 1993, the Fund ceded title of the property to the lender in full
satisfaction of amounts due under the non-recourse mortgage loan obligation.
Since the Citadel II investment had previously been written down to the
remaining principal balance of the loan, no loss on this transaction was
recognized in the year ended December 31, 1993. Net rental income at Citadel II
decreased from $1,105,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992, to $663,000 for
the comparable period of 1993, reflecting the disposition of the property on
September 1, 1993, and, to a lesser extent, the lower average occupancy rate and
lower rental rates on lease renewals during the eight-month period ended August
31, 1993, as compared to the comparable period of 1992.

        Mortgage interest income increased by $173,000, or 16%, from $1,106,000
in the year ended December 31, 1992, to $1,279,000 in the year ended December
31, 1993. In early June 1993, the Fund began acquiring RTC-issued
mortgage-backed securities as an additional temporary investment vehicle for
excess working capital reserve balances. Income of $174,000 earned on these
investments during the year ended December 31, 1993, is included in Mortgage
Interest Income.

        Net income from in-substance foreclosed assets decreased by $638,000, or
20%, primarily as a result of the discounted payoff in late July 1993, of the
Carmel mortgage loan investment, which had been classified as an in-substance
foreclosed asset in 1991.

        Investment income from short-term and other investments decreased by
$77,000, or 17%, as compared to such income in the comparable period of 1992,
primarily as a result of a decrease in the average amount of short-term
investments for the year ended December 31, 1993, as compared to such
investments during the same period of 1992.

        Mortgage interest expense decreased by $403,000, or 28%, primarily as a
result of the Fund's ceding title to its Citadel II investment on September 1,
1993, in full satisfaction of the non-recourse mortgage loan obligation secured
by the Citadel II property.

DISTRIBUTIONS

        Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan on December 12, 1994, the
Fund's policy was to distribute, at a minimum, all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Subsequent to adoption of the Liquidation Plan, the Fund's
Trustees will also seek to distribute net proceeds from the liquidation of the
Fund's investments at such time and, in such amounts, which is, in the opinion
of the Trustees, in the best interests of the Fund's shareholders. In
establishing distribution rates, the Fund's Trustees consider the operating
performance of the Fund, the Fund's cash position and aggregate future cash
requirements. Total distributions declared by the Fund in 1994 aggregated
$45,622,000, or $4.14 per share, compared to distributions in the amount of
$18,629,000, or $1.69 per share, and $7,694,000, or $.69 per share, made in 1993
and 1992, respectively. Distributions to shareholders in 1994 included three



                                      25
<PAGE>   27
quarterly distributions at $.15 per share, and a $40,662,000, or $3.69 per
share, liquidating distribution made at year end pursuant to the Liquidation
Plan. This liquidating distribution resulted primarily from the Fund's sale of
(i) its Seattle investment in October 1994 and (ii) the Deluxe Check building in
the Minnesota Portfolio in August 1994. Since the Fund had formally commenced
its liquidation period, the Trustees believed it was in the best interests of
shareholders to return the majority of its cash to shareholders with the
year-end distribution. In determining the amount of such distribution, the Fund
estimated its aggregate future cash requirements necessary to: (i) fund its
capital and tenant improvement and leasing programs necessary to maintain the
value of its property investments, (ii) maintain its minimum working capital
reserve requirement and (iii) make its principal payments on mortgage loan debt
outstanding during the estimated remaining liquidation period for all of the
Fund's investments. Except for the amount of such estimated future requirements,
all cash held by the Fund as of year end was distributed to shareholders.

        All, or a significant portion of, the past three years' distributions
(excluding the year-end 1994 liquidating distribution of $3.69 per share)
represented a return of shareholder's capital. Return of capital and liquidating
distributions are non taxable to a shareholder to the extent the shareholder has
remaining tax cost basis in the Fund's shares. Return of capital distributions
aggregated $3,899,000, or $.35 per share, $18,629,000, or $1.69 per share, and
$1,364,000, or $.12 per share, for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

        During the Fund's liquidation period, its ability to make quarterly
distributions will be dependent upon its financial condition, earnings and cash
flow, cash position and future working capital requirements. As a result of the
1994 property sales, and the subsequent year-end liquidating distribution of the
proceeds from such sales, the book value of the Fund's shares has been
significantly reduced. Accordingly, the amount of future income the Fund may be
expected to generate has also been reduced. Further, as a result of the adoption
of the Liquidation Plan, the Fund's remaining investments are being held for
sale, rather than the production of income, and, accordingly, income from
operations can be expected to decline throughout the Fund's liquidation period.
In addition, the cumulative amount of the Fund's three 1994 quarterly
distributions paid to shareholders prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan
in the amount of $4,960,000 exceeded funds from operations (defined as net
income, plus depreciation and the provision for possible losses) for the nine
months ended September 30, 1994 by $401,000. In the opinion of the Trustees, the
Fund had adequate working capital reserves to make such distributions and thus
to maintain the Fund's regular quarterly distribution rate of $.15 per share
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 1994. However, with respect to
the Fund's future distribution policy, in determining the amount of the
liquidating year-end distribution to shareholders as described above, it was, in
the opinion of the Trustees, in the best interests of shareholders to
distribute, rather than retain, available working capital reserves which would
otherwise be necessary to maintain future quarterly distributions at the rate of
$.15 per share.

        As a result of the factors cited in the preceding paragraph, future
quarterly liquidating distributions to shareholders, excluding any amounts
distributed from net proceeds from property sales, will be largely dependent
upon the amount of funds from operations generated by the Fund during its
liquidation period. Funds from operations are generated from the operations of
the Fund's direct real estate investments and interest income on short-term
investments and mortgage loans. Accordingly, unfavorable economic conditions,
vacancies, environmental requirements, reductions in prevailing short-term
interest rates or increases in major expenses such as energy, insurance, and
real estate taxes during the liquidation period could have an adverse impact
upon the Fund's future funds from operations and distributions to shareholders.
The exact amount of quarterly distributions to shareholders will be determined
by the Trustees based on the Fund's actual results of operations and cash
position. The timing and amount of distributions of net proceeds from property
sales to shareholders will be determined by the Trustees as such amounts are
realized and based on relevant considerations such as the Fund's then current
results of operations, cash position, and future working capital requirements.

        Under the Liquidation Plan, the Fund intends to sell or otherwise
dispose of its real estate investments. In disposing of real estate investments,
the Fund is in competition with other domestic institutional investors,
including commercial banks and other financial institutions, insurance
companies, pensions and other retirement funds, mortgage bankers, other real
estate investment trusts, real estate brokers, developers and various types of
foreign investors who may be seeking to dispose of real estate investments. The
principal factors of competition for the disposition of the mortgage loan
receivable include the base interest rate, contingent interest rate and the
amount of loan relative to the value of the underlying property. In the case of
leased properties which the Fund owns or which secure Fund investments, the
marketability of the investments is also affected by how rental rates, lease
terms, free-rent concessions and tenant improvements allowances compare with
those in local markets.

        If the Fund's remaining real estate investments are sold or disposed of
prior to December 12, 1996, it is the Fund's intention to make a final
liquidating distribution, or distributions, prior to that date. Any assets which
have not been distributed as of December 12, 1996, will be contributed to a
liquidating trust, of which the shareholders will be the beneficiaries. The
shares of the Fund would no longer be traded and the beneficial interests in the
liquidating trust would not be readily transferable.

        The schedule below sets forth the pro forma cash available for
distribution (per share) to Fund shareholders as if the Fund were liquidated on
December 31, 1994 pursuant to the Liquidation Plan. Gross proceeds on sale of
properties assumes that the Fund's properties are sold for their appraised
values at December 31, 1994. Since appraised values are based on estimates, no
assurance can be given that sales could have been transacted at their appraised
values at December 31, 1994 and actual gross sales amounts may vary from
appraised amounts. Gross proceeds on sales of properties are reduced by an
estimated provision of 4.5% of the gross selling price for commissions, expenses
and state and local taxes to arrive at net sales proceeds. Repayment of mortgage
loan receivable includes $.04 per share relating to a shared appreciation
provision on the loan receivable. Such amount represents 50% of the excess of
the December 31, 1994 appraised value of the property underlying the mortgage
loan over the original loan balance, or its December 31, 1994 carrying value. No
consideration has been made for cash flow from operations from the Fund's
investments during their remaining holding periods prior to their sale or
disposition. All other amounts shown are based on their respective historical
carrying values at December 31, 1994.

        The calculation of the pro forma cash available for distribution (per
share) set forth above assumes that the Fund will continue to qualify as a real
estate investment trust during the entire liquidation period and, therefore, no
provision has been made for federal income taxes. The above calculation also
assumes that all of the Fund's assets are sold or distributed prior to December
12, 1996, and does not reflect any incremental costs or expenses associated with
establishing and operating a liquidating trust. It is possible that the sale of
the remaining assets cannot be completed by December 12, 1996, in which case the
assumptions regarding the timing and costs required to complete the liquidation
would need to be revised.

        Caution should be used in relying on the above pro forma estimate, which
assumes the continuation of reasonably stable economic conditions during the
remaining liquidation period and depends, among other factors, on the level of
capital available for investment in real estate, interest rates, and the demand
for real estate and mortgage investments. While the Fund's management, Trustees
and Adviser believe the assumptions and projections used in arriving at this
estimate of pro forma cash available for distribution (per share) are
reasonable, there can be no assurance that such assumptions will in fact prove
correct. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that actual sales or
dispositions of particular assets will not be at prices which vary materially
from management's current estimates of net liquidation values.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        As a matter of policy, the Fund seeks to maintain working capital
reserves in an amount not less than $2,300,000, which amount constitutes 2% of
the gross proceeds of the Fund's initial offering. Working capital reserves are
defined as cash and cash equivalents, including the Fund's investment in
marketable securities, and other working assets expected to be realized over
the next year, less liabilities expected to be paid over the next year.
Working capital reserves at December 31, 1994, after payment of the $3.69 per
share liquidating distribution discussed above, aggregated approximately $5.7
million, representing 5.0% of the initial public offering proceeds, compared
to working capital reserves of $8.5 million at December 31, 1993, which
represented 7.4% of the Fund's initial offering proceeds. 

        During the fourth quarter of 1990, the Fund instituted a share
repurchase program. Under the program, the Fund is authorized to repurchase in
the open market from time to time up to 500,000 of the Fund's outstanding
shares. As of December 31, 1994, 413,725 shares have been repurchased at an
aggregate cost of $3,134,000. No shares have been repurchased since September
1993 and the Fund's management,in consideration of the Liquidation Plan, does
not expect the Fund to repurchase any further shares.

        The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a real estate investment
trust under the Internal Revenue Code and distribute all of its taxable income.
The Fund's management considers the Fund's liquidity, as well as its ability
to generate cash, as adequate to meet its presently foreseeable operating and
shareholder distribution requirements and to fund its capital improvements.

     4.   PAYMENT OF DEBTS.  Prior to any final distribution to its
Shareholders, the Fund shall promptly pay or provide for the payment or
satisfaction of all debts, expenses, taxes, liabilities (whether known,
unascertained, contingent or unmatured) and all other obligations of the
Fund, including expenses of dissolution, liquidation and termination of
existence.

     5.   LIQUIDATION DISTRIBUTION.  Following the payment or provision for
the payment or satisfaction of the Fund's liabilities and obligations
pursuant to paragraph 3 above, the Fund shall distribute its remaining cash
and assets to Shareholders of the Fund in such amounts and at such times as
shall be determined by the Trustees in their sole discretion and consistent
with the Fund's Declaration of Trust and its maintaining its status as a
"real estate investment trust" under the Code.  Distributions may be made
in installments from time to time or as a whole.  Upon payment of the
liquidation distribution (or final liquidation distribution, if made in
installments), each Shareholder of the Fund shall be given notice to
deliver to the Fund, or to a trust to which the assets of the Fund may have
been transferred, the certificates representing all of the shares of the
Fund owned by such Shareholder.  The cash of the Fund as determined under
paragraphs 4 and 5 above shall be divided among the Shareholders on a pro
rata basis.  If a Shareholder's certificate of shares of beneficial
interest in the Fund has been lost, stolen or destroyed, such Shareholder
may be required to furnish the Fund with satisfactory evidence of the loss,
theft or destruction thereof, together with a reasonable undertaking or
indemnity satisfactory to the Fund, as a condition to the receipt of any
distribution.  The complete liquidation of the Fund shall be completed
within 24 months of the date of the adoption of this Plan of Liquidation.

     6.   TERMINATION.  As promptly as practicable after the payment of or
provision for the payment or satisfaction of all liabilities and
obligations of the Company, and upon the taking of any act required to be
taken under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Fund shall
be terminated in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.

     7.   CESSATION OF BUSINESS.  After the adoption of this Plan of
Liquidation, the Fund shall not engage in any business activities except
for the purposes of preserving the values of its assets, adjusting and
winding up its business affairs, and making any liquidation distribution in
accordance with the Plan of Liquidation.  The Trustees now in office and,
at their pleasure, the officers of the Fund, shall continue in office
solely for these purposes.  Unless and until the decision to proceed with
the Plan of Liquidation is reversed by the Fund's Trustees, no new business
operations will be explored or undertaken by the Fund.

     8.   POWER OF THE TRUSTEES.  The Trustees and, if authorized by the
Trustees, the officers of the Fund, shall have authority to do or authorize
any and all acts and things as provided for in this Plan of Liquidation and
any and all such further acts and things as they may consider desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Plan of Liquidation, including the execution
and filing of all such certificates, documents, information returns, tax
returns, and other documents which may be necessary or appropriate to
implement this Plan of Liquidation.  The Trustees may authorize such
variations from or amendments to the provisions of this Plan of Liquidation
as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the complete liquidation,
dissolution and termination of existence of the Fund, and the distribution
of its assets to its Shareholders in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  The death, resignation, or other disability
of any Trustees, or officer of the Fund shall not impair the authority of
the surviving or remaining Trustees or officers to exercise any of the
powers provided for in the Plan of Liquidation.  Upon such death,
resignation, or other disability, the surviving or remaining Trustees, or,
if there be none, the surviving or remaining officers, shall have authority
to fill the vacancy or vacancies created, but the failure to fill such
vacancy or vacancies shall not impair the authority of the surviving or
remaining Trustees or officers to exercise any of the powers provided for
in this Plan of Liquidation.



                                       7
<PAGE>
     After the effective date of termination of the Fund, the Trustees
shall continue to act as Trustees and shall have full power to wind up and
settle the Fund's affairs, and the Fund shall cease to carry on business
except to the extent necessary for the beneficial winding up thereof.  The
powers and duties of the Trustees of the Fund shall include, but are not
limited to, the following acts in the name and on behalf of the Fund:  (a)
to elect officers and employ agents and attorneys to liquidate or wind up
its affairs; (b) to continue the conduct of the business of the Fund only
insofar as necessary for the disposal or winding up thereof; (c) to carry
out contracts and collect, pay, compromise and settle debts for or against
the Fund; (d) to defend suits brought against the Fund; (e) to sue in the
name of the Fund for all sums due or owing to the Fund or to recover any of
its property; and (f) in general, to make contracts and to do any and all
things in the name of the Fund which may be proper or convenient for the
purposes of winding up, settling and liquidating the affairs of the Fund.

     9.   LIQUIDATING TRUST.  If advisable for any reason to complete the
liquidation and distribution of the Fund's assets to the Shareholders of
the Fund, and subject to approval of the liquidating trustee by
Shareholders of the Fund if such approval is deemed advisable by the
Trustees, the Trustees may at any time (including after its dissolution)
transfer to a liquidating trust any or all remaining assets of the Fund. 
The liquidating trust will succeed to all of the then-remaining assets of
the Fund, including the reserve for contingent or unsatisfied liabilities
and obligations of the Fund and any liabilities and obligations of the Fund
expressly not assumed by any purchaser of the Fund's assets.  The sole
purposes of the liquidating trust will be to prosecute and defend suits by
or against the Fund, to enable the Fund to settle and close the business of
the Fund, to dispose of and convey the assets of the Fund, to satisfy the
remaining liabilities and obligations of the Fund, and to distribute the
remaining cash to the Fund's Shareholders.  The Trustees may appoint a
trustee or trustees to act as trustee or trustees of the liquidating trust
on such terms and conditions as the Trustees determine.  It is intended
that any liquidating trust so established qualify as a "liquidating trust",
as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation 301.7701-4(d).

     In the event it is determined by a majority of the Trustees that an
entity or entities different in form but similar in purpose to a
liquidating trust, such as an escrow or partnership, is more appropriate to
the administration and completion of the liquidation, then the Trustees
shall take all steps necessary to establish such other entity or entities. 
Such an entity or entities shall be administered, to the extent possible,
in the same manner as provided with respect to the liquidating trust
contemplated above.

     10.  AMENDMENTS.  The Trustees of the Fund may modify or amend this
Plan of Liquidation and, prior to the final termination of the Trust, may
abandon this Plan of Liquidation without further action to the extent
permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

     11.  INDEMNIFICATION OR INSURANCE.  The obligation of the Fund to
indemnify and reimburse its trustees, officers, employees or affiliates
pursuant to Section 7.4 of the Fund's Declaration of Trust or otherwise
shall survive the liquidation and dissolution of the Fund, but may be
satisfied only out of the assets of any reserve fund or liquidating trust
which has assumed the liability therefor or the proceeds of insurance
therefor, but not from distributions made to shareholders.  The Trustees
shall have the power and authority after the termination of the Fund to
purchase, continue and maintain insurance as may be necessary to cover the
Fund's indemnification obligations, and the Trustees also shall have the
power and authority to satisfy any of the indemnification obligations of
the Fund out of the assets of the Fund, including assets held by an agent
or a trust or other entity.

     12.  COSTS.  The Trustees are authorized, empowered and directed to
pay all legal, accounting, printing, appraisal and other fees and expenses
of persons rendering services to the Fund in connection with adoption
and/or implementation of this Plan of Liquidation.

<PAGE>
     13.  AGENT FOR SHAREHOLDERS.  In order to effect a final distribution
of its remaining cash and investments to its Shareholders, the appropriate
officers of the Fund are hereby authorized to appoint an agent for
Shareholders of the Fund, if such action is deemed advisable by the
Trustees.  The Fund shall deliver to such agent for the Shareholders the
cash to be distributed to the Shareholders as determined under paragraph 4
above.  Such liquidation distribution will be distributable to the
Shareholders by the agent for Shareholders as soon as practicable after
receipt of the funds from the Fund to those Shareholders who have delivered
their certificates representing shares of the Fund or other satisfactory
evidence as provided for in paragraph 4 above.  The remainder of such cash
will be held for the account of those Shareholders who have not delivered
their share certificates or other satisfactory evidence.  No interest shall
accrue at any time on any cash held by the agent for Shareholders.

     14.  APPROVAL AND EFFECTIVE DATE.  In accordance with the provisions
of Section 8.1 of the Declaration of Trust, this Plan of Liquidation shall
be and become effective upon its approval by a majority of Trustees of the
Fund then in office (including a majority of Unaffiliated Trustees).

operation of the Land or Improvements (the "Personal Property").

     (d) All of Seller's rights in all leases and other occupancy
agreements, if any, covering any portion of the Land or Improvements (the
"Tenant Leases") including Seller's rights to any Tenant Deposits (herein
so called) and prepaid rent, and any and all guarantees of and security for
the Tenant Leases.

     (e) All of Seller's right, title and interest, if any, in all
intangible assets of any nature relating to the Land, the Improvements or

and service marks used by Seller in connection with the Real Property
(collectively, the "Intangible Property").

     (f) All of Seller's rights, if any, in all service and other contracts

     The Land, Improvements and Appurtenances are hereinafter sometimes

Personal Property, Tenant Leases, Tenant Deposits, Intangible Property and
Property Contracts are hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as
the "Property."

     This Contract is executed upon the following terms and conditions:

     1.  PURCHASE PRICE.  The Purchase Price for the Property shall be
Thirty-One Million Three Hundred Thirty Thousand Dollars ($31,330,000). 
The Purchase Price shall be paid in cash at Closing.   Purchaser and Seller
each acknowledge that there is little or no Personal Property included in
the Property and that the entire Purchase Price shall be allocated to the
Real Property.

     2.  EARNEST MONEY.  Within two (2) days following the final execution
of this Contract, Purchaser shall deposit with Chicago Title Insurance
Company, 1800 Columbia Center, 701 Fifth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98104
(the "Title Company") as a good faith deposit the sum of Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($300,000) (the "Earnest Money").  Purchaser's failure to
timely deposit the Earnest Money shall entitle Seller, at Seller's option,
to terminate this Contract.  The Earnest Money shall be invested in a
federally insured financial institution of Purchaser's choice and all
interest on the Earnest Money shall become a part of the Earnest Money.  If
this Contract closes, the Earnest Money shall be applied to the Purchase
Price; otherwise, the Earnest Money shall be disposed of as provided for
elsewhere in this Contract.  

     3.  SURVEY.  Seller has heretofore furnished to Purchaser and
Purchaser hereby acknowledges receipt of the following Surveys (herein so
called, and individually called a "Survey"):

     (a) With respect to Parcel 1, a Survey prepared by Stephen A.
Hitchings of Bush, Roed and Hitchings, Inc., P.S., Civil Engineers and Land
Surveyors, dated December 21, 1987, Job No. 87306.

     (b) With respect to Parcels 2 and 3, a Survey prepared by Stephen A.
Hitchings of Bush, Roed and Hitchings, Inc., P.S., Civil Engineers and Land
Surveyors, dated December 14, 1987, Job No. 80091.

     Purchaser accepts these Surveys and Seller, within twenty (20) days
after the date of this Contract, shall cause the Surveys to be updated and
recertified to Purchaser, Seller, and Title Company as of a current date in
such a manner as to allow the Title Company to provide an extended coverage
owner's title insurance policy.

     4.  TITLE COMMITMENT.  Within twenty (20) days after the date of this
Contract, Seller agrees, at Seller's sole expense, to cause to be furnished
to Purchaser a current title commitment for an extended coverage owner's
title insurance policy (the "Commitment") issued through the Title Company,
setting forth the state of title to the Real Property and all exceptions,
including easements, restrictions, rights-of-way, covenants, reservations
and other conditions, if any, affecting the Real Property which would
appear in an owner's title policy if issued, together with legible copies
of all instruments creating such exceptions.  

     5.  PURCHASER'S REVIEW AND APPROVAL.  Purchaser shall have ten (10)
days (the "Review Period") after Purchaser receives the last to be received
among the Commitment, the copies of the instruments creating such
exceptions, and the updated and recertified Surveys in which to notify
Seller of any objections Purchaser may have to any of the items shown on
the Commitment or Surveys.  Any exceptions or conditions to which Purchaser
does not object shall be considered as "Permitted Exceptions."  If
Purchaser notifies Seller of unacceptable exceptions or conditions as
herein provided, Seller shall have twenty (20) days thereafter (the "Cure
Period") in which to eliminate or modify such unacceptable exceptions or
conditions, but Seller shall have no obligation to do so.  In the event
Seller fails or chooses not to eliminate or modify such unacceptable
exceptions or conditions to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser within
said Cure Period, then in such event, this Contract shall automatically
terminate unless Purchaser waives in writing each uncured exception or
condition within five (5) days following the Cure Period and the Earnest
Money shall be immediately returned to Purchaser by the Title Company and
the parties hereto shall have no further obligations one to the other
hereunder.  If Purchaser waives all such exceptions and conditions by
giving such written notice to Seller within the five-day period provided,
then Purchaser shall be deemed conclusively to have waived all exceptions
and conditions which Seller has not cured or agreed to cure, and all such
exceptions and conditions shall be included in the term  "Permitted
Exceptions."

     6.  INSPECTION.  During the pendency of this Contract, Purchaser shall
have access to the Real Property for the purpose of conducting such
inspections, investigations, soil tests, environmental audits, engineering
and feasibility studies of the Real Property as Purchaser deems necessary
or advisable in connection with the purchase of the Property.  Further,
Seller agrees to make available to Purchaser or to its duly authorized
agents or representatives, the originals of all Tenant Leases and all
applicable books and records relating to the Real Property and the
operation and maintenance thereof.  Such items may be examined at all
reasonable times during normal business hours.  In this regard, Seller
agrees that during the pendency of this Contract, Purchaser and its agents
and representatives shall be entitled to enter upon the Real Property for
inspection and examination; provided, however, that:  (i) neither Purchaser
nor its agents shall interfere with Seller's operation of the Real Property
or any tenant's occupancy of same; (ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for
any damages to the property or injuries to persons caused by Purchaser or
Purchaser's agents and representatives; (iii) Purchaser shall, at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, restore the Real Property to its
condition prior to Purchaser's inspection and testing of same; (iv) if this
Contract does not close for reasons other than Seller's default, Purchaser
shall furnish to Seller copies of all reports, test results, etc. obtained
by Purchaser in the conduct of Purchaser's inspection and testing (without
representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied); and (v)
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any
loss, cost, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys fees and
court costs, suffered or incurred by Seller as a result of any activities
conducted by Purchaser, its agents, employees, contractors or
representatives on or about the Real Property.  Purchaser's obligations
contained in this paragraph shall survive the Closing or other termination
of this Contract.

     12. PURCHASER'S OBLIGATIONS AT CLOSING.  At the Closing, Purchaser

     (a) The Purchase Price by wire transfer to an account designated by

     (b) An assumption by which Purchaser assumes the obligations of Seller

     13. PRORATIONS.  At the Closing, the following items shall be adjusted
or prorated between Seller and Purchaser:

     (a) MINIMUM MONTHLY RENTS.  All minimum monthly rents and base rents
due under the Tenant Leases for the month in which the Closing occurs shall
be prorated as of the Closing Date on the basis of the sums actually
collected by Seller prior to Closing.  At Closing, Seller shall furnish to
Purchaser a complete and correct schedule of all minimum monthly rents and
base rents which are then due and payable but which have not been paid. 
From and after the Closing, all rent collections shall be applied first to
current rents and then to delinquent rents, and the portion thereof due to
Seller shall be remitted to Seller if and when collected; however,
Purchaser shall have no obligation to Seller to collect any such unpaid
rents, but Seller shall be permitted to pursue collection directly against
the tenants for delinquent rent.  Any prepaid rents for periods subsequent
to the month in which Closing occurs shall be paid to Purchaser.

     (b) OPERATING EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS; OPERATING EXPENSES.  With
respect to payments ("CAM Payments") under the Tenant Leases to reimburse
the lessor for expenses of operating the Property (other than Taxes and
Insurance Costs) ("CAM Expenses"), Seller shall prepare an accounting at
Closing comparing (i) the CAM Payments received to the Closing Date for the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs plus the amount of the CAM
Expenses allocable to unleased space for such period (i.e. based on the
ratio in which the leasable area of the unleased space bears to the entire
leasable area in the Improvements), and (ii) the CAM Expenses incurred to
the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.  If the
amount determined in (i) is greater than the amount determined in (ii),
Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit against the Purchase Price in the
amount of such excess.  If, however, the amount determined in (ii) is
greater than the amount determined in (i), Purchaser shall pay such
difference to Seller if and when such amount is collected by Purchaser from
the tenants.  In that connection, Purchaser agrees to invoice the tenants
for year-end adjustments in accordance with their respective Tenant Leases
for the amount due as set out in Seller's and Purchaser's respective books
and records, provided Purchaser shall have no obligation to Seller to
collect any such unpaid amounts.  To the extent only a portion of the
amount due from any tenant is actually collected for such year-end
adjustments, such amount shall be prorated between Seller and Purchaser
based upon the amount owed to each party during their respective periods of
ownership.  Seller shall be responsible for paying all CAM Expenses
incurred prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be responsible for
paying for all CAM Expenses incurred from and after the Closing Date.

     (c) TAX PAYMENTS; TAXES.  Seller has paid, or prior to Closing will
pay, all tax payments due on the Property in the calendar year 1994. 
Purchaser will assume the payment of all tax payments due in any calendar
year after 1994.  Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for its pro rata share
of the tax payments made in 1994 based on that portion of the calendar year
1994 that falls after the Closing Date.  With respect to payments  received
from tenants under the Tenant Leases to reimburse Seller for real estate,
ad-valorem and personal property taxes and other state, county and
municipal taxes, charges and assessments, Seller shall prepare an
accounting at Closing showing such payments  received under the Tenant
Leases during 1994.  To the extent such amount exceeds the 1994 taxes
allocable to Seller, Purchaser will receive a credit at Closing for the
excess and to the extent the amounts so received were insufficient to cover
the 1994 taxes allocated to Seller, Seller shall receive a credit for such
deficiency.

     (d) INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS; INSURANCE COSTS.  With respect to
payments (the "Insurance Payments") under the Tenant Leases to reimburse
the lessor for premiums for insurance policies carried by lessor covering
the Property (the "Insurance Costs"), Seller shall prepare an accounting at
Closing comparing (i) the amount of the Insurance Payments received by
Seller to the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs plus the amount of the Insurance Costs allocable to the unleased
space for such period, and (ii) the amount of the Insurance Costs earned to
the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.  If the
amount determined in (i) above is greater than the amount determined in
(ii) above, Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit against the Purchase
Price in the amount of such excess.  If, however, the amount determined in
(ii) is greater than the amount determined in (i) above, Purchaser shall
pay such excess to Seller if and when such amount is collected by Purchaser
from the tenants under the Tenant Leases.  In that connection, Purchaser
agrees to invoice the tenants for year-end adjustments in accordance with
their respective Tenant Leases for the amount due as set out in Seller's
and Purchaser's respective books and records, provided Purchaser shall have
no obligation to Seller to collect any such unpaid amounts.  To the extent
only a portion of the amount due from any tenant is actually collected for
such year-end adjustments, such amount shall be prorated between Seller and
Purchaser based upon the amounts owed each party during their respective
periods of ownership.  Seller's insurance policies shall be cancelled as of
the Closing Date as to the Property and Seller shall be entitled to the
unearned Insurance Costs.

     (e) SECURITY DEPOSITS.  Seller shall pay to Purchaser, in cash at
Closing, the amount of any Tenant Deposits under the provisions of any
Tenant Lease.  Purchaser shall assume and agree to pay all Tenant Deposits
to such tenants upon and subject to the terms of the applicable Tenant
Leases.

     (f) UTILITIES.  All utility services (other than those contracted for
directly by the tenants) shall be terminated by Seller as of the Closing
Date, and Purchaser acknowledges that it shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser prior to Closing to make application for and to obtain
continuation of such utility services in the name and for the account of
Purchaser as of the Closing Date.  If any provider of a public utility to
the Property is holding a deposit in connection therewith as of the Closing
Date, Seller shall retain all right to the return of such deposit(s).

     (g) POST CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.  In the event any adjustments pursuant
to this Paragraph 13 are, subsequent to Closing, found to be erroneous,
then either party hereto who is entitled to additional monies shall invoice
the other party for such additional amounts as may be owing, and such
amount shall be paid within ten (10) days from receipt of the invoice.

     14. POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY.  Possession of the Property shall be
delivered to Purchaser by Seller at the Closing, subject only to the rights
of tenants and subtenants, as tenants only, under the Tenant Leases and the
Permitted Exceptions.  Seller and Purchaser covenant and agree to execute,
at Closing, a written notice of the acquisition of the Property by
Purchaser, in sufficient copies for transmittal to all tenants affected by
the sale and purchase of the Property and properly addressed to all such
tenants.  Such notice shall be prepared by Purchaser and approved by
Seller, notifying the tenants of the sale and transfer and containing
appropriate instructions relating to the payment of future rentals, the
giving of future notices, and other matters reasonably required by
Purchaser or required by law.  Unless a different procedure is required by
applicable law, in which event such laws shall be controlling, Seller
agrees to transmit or otherwise deliver such letters to the tenants, and
evidence of such delivery to Purchaser on the first business day  after the
Closing.  If Seller fails to deliver such evidence to Purchaser, Purchaser
shall have the right to deliver such letters to the tenants.

     15. CLOSING COSTS.  Seller shall pay all survey costs; the premium for
the Title Policy; and all transfer, documentary and stamp fees.  Each party
shall pay its own attorneys' fees and the parties shall share equally all
escrow fees.  Purchaser shall pay all recording fees.  All other closing
costs and expenses in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Contract shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in the manner in which such
costs and expenses are customarily allocated between the parties at
closings of Real Property similar to the Real Property in the area in which
the real property is located.
 
     16. SELLER'S DEFAULT.  In the event of Seller's default hereunder,
Purchaser may, at Purchaser's option and as Purchaser's sole remedy,
either:  (i) terminate this Contract by giving written notice to Seller in
which event the Earnest Money will be immediately returned to Purchaser by
the Title Company and the parties shall have no further obligation one to
the other hereunder (except for Purchaser's indemnity obligations in
Paragraph 6 above); or (ii) enforce specific performance hereunder. 
Purchaser may not sue Seller for damages.

     17. PURCHASER'S DEFAULT.  In the event Purchaser fails, without legal
excuse, to complete the purchase of the Property, the Earnest Money made by
the Purchaser shall be forfeited to the Seller as the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Seller for such failure.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of this paragraph, nothing contained herein shall limit Seller's
right to recover damages and pursue all other legal remedies available to
it in the event Purchaser fails to indemnify Seller for damages resulting
from Purchaser's activities in and about the property pursuant to Paragraph
6 above.  

     18. NOTICE.  Any notice or document required to be delivered hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective when delivered and shall
be deemed delivered when actually received, or, if earlier and whether or
not received, four days after it is deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, certified or registered mail (with or without return
receipt requested) addressed to the parties hereto at the respective
addresses set out opposite their names below, or at such other address as
they have heretofore specified by written notice delivered in accordance

with respect to the Property.  Purchaser has been expressly advised by

Property utilizing experts as Purchaser deems to be necessary for an
independent assessment of all environmental liability and risk with respect
to the Property.  Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, having
been given the opportunity to inspect the Property, Purchaser is relying
solely on its own investigation of the Property and not on any information
provided or to be provided by Seller and hereby covenants for itself and

defined) or the common law, or any other applicable laws related to the
Property.  Hazardous Materials shall include, without limitation, any

or threatens to cause a nuisance on the Property or adjacent property or
poses or threatens to pose a hazard to the health or safety of persons on

from the Property, could constitute a trespass.  

     For purposes of this Contract, the term "Environmental Requirements"
shall mean all laws, ordinances, statutes, codes, rules, regulations,
agreements, judgments, orders and decrees now or hereafter enacted,
promulgated or amended, of the United States, the states, the counties, the

damage, cost or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorney's fees) paid or incurred by Purchaser by reason of any claim to
any broker's, finder's or other fee in connection with this transaction by
any party claiming by, through or under Seller.  Purchaser agrees to
indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless from any loss, liability, damage,
cost or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees)

or other fee in connection with this transaction by any party claiming by,
through or under Purchaser.  Purchaser acknowledges that at the time of the
execution of this Contract, the Seller advised Purchaser by this writing
that Purchaser should have an abstract covering the Real Property examined
by an attorney of Purchaser's own selection.  

     30. EXCULPATION OF TRUST.  This Contract is executed by the
undersigned, not individually but as a trustee of AEW #105 Trust created
under a Declaration of Trust, in the exercise of the power and authority
conferred upon and vested in the undersigned as trustee.  It is expressly
understood and agreed by every party now or hereafter claiming any right or
