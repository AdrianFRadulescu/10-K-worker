                           PART I

Item 1.  Business

         USAA Real Estate Income Investments II Limited Partnership,
(the Partnership) is a limited partnership formed in August 1987
under the Texas Revised Limited Partnership Act.  The Partnership
has three principal business objectives:  (i) preserve and protect
the Partnership's capital; (ii) provide the Limited Partners with
quarterly distributions of Net Cash from Operations; and (iii)
obtain long-term appreciation in the value of the Properties.  The
Partnership was formed to (i) invest in a diversified portfolio of
income-producing multi-family residential and commercial properties
and/or (ii) make one or more participating first mortgage loans. 
Pursuant to the agreement of the Partnership, to the extent
possible (i) all acquisitions of real property are made for cash
and (ii) all participating first mortgage loans earn fixed interest
and contain participation rights in the underlying property's cash
flow and net proceeds of sale or refinancing and other items, or
both.

         Defined terms contained herein shall have the meaning set
forth in the Glossary contained in the Partnership's Prospectus
dated February 11, 1988, filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) attached 
hereto as Exhibit 99.a.

         The Partnership sold $13,570,500 of Limited Partnership
Interests (27,141 Interests at $500 per Interest) from the
commencement of the offering of its Interests February 11, 1988
through the termination of the offering, January 30, 1989.

         Proceeds available to the Partnership for investment were
used to acquire the Continental Plastic Containers Buildings on
April 21, 1989.  The Partnership also invested in the Combined
Capital Resources Joint Venture (the joint venture), the owner of
a participating first mortgage loan secured by Sequoia Plaza -
Building I.  The joint venture's investment in the mortgage loan
was converted to ownership of the underlying property in August
1991 through foreclosure on the mortgage loan.  The Partnership
purchased its final property, Bowater Communication Papers Building
on July 24, 1989.

         Competitive conditions for the Partnership's properties and
the property owned by the joint venture for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1995 were as follows:

         Continental Plastic Containers Buildings (Continental
Buildings) are a manufacturing and distribution facility made up of
two industrial bulk warehouse buildings.  These buildings are 100%
leased to Continental Plastic Containers, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Continental Can Company, Inc. which manufactures and
distributes metal cans, plastic bottles and packaging equipment. 
One of the primary strengths of this property is its location in
Elk Grove Village, Illinois which is within one-half mile of O'Hare
International Airport, accessible to interstate highways and 15
miles from the Chicago, Illinois city limits. 

<PAGE>
         On March 24, 1995, Continental Plastic Containers, Inc.
renewed and extended the lease at the Continental Buildings for
fifteen years with an expiration of July 2010.  As part of this
renewal, the Partnership has agreed to construct an addition of
approximately 45,200 square feet to the existing building. 
Construction of the addition is underway with final completion
estimated to be in December 1995.  The cost of these improvements
is estimated to be $1,700,000 to be funded from the working capital
reserve.  In order to avoid borrowing to fund the construction of
the addition and maintain working capital at an adequate level for
operations, distributions to partners were reduced to $7.00 per
unit for the distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 1995.

         The Continental Buildings are located in the Northwest Cook
County submarket of the Chicago Metropolitan Area market.  This
submarket has a total inventory of 120 million square feet.  The
available space as of June 1995 was 9 million square feet which was
down as compared to 9.5 million square feet as of June 1994.  This
equated to an occupancy rate of approximately 93% as of June 1995
for the Northwest Cook County submarket.

         Bowater Communication Papers Building (Bowater) is a
111,720 square foot industrial warehouse building in Lakeland,
Florida and is 100% leased under a triple net lease to Bowater
Communication Papers, Inc. which expires in 1999.  Bowater
Communication Papers, Inc. is a manufacturer of continuous business
forms, including computer stock and word processing forms.  Under
terms of the lease with Bowater Communication Papers, the lease
rate on the Partnership property will increase each year by the
rate of the Consumer Price Index, up to a maximum of 5.5% per year,
through the lease expiration in 1999.  The annual rate of $3.79 per
square foot was increased to $3.91 per square foot in July 1995.

         Bowater is located within the West Quadrant of the Lakeland
market. Total inventory of industrial/warehouse space in the
Lakeland market totaled approximately 19.5 million square feet with
approximately 1.2 million square feet available.  This resulted in
an occupancy rate of 94% as of July 1995 in the Lakeland market.

         Within the West Quadrant submarket, total inventory of
industrial/warehouse space was approximately 8.2 million square
feet with approximately .8 million square feet available.  This
equated to an occupancy rate of 90% as of July 1995 in the West
Quadrant submarket.

         Sequoia Plaza - Building I (Sequoia), Arlington, Virginia
was acquired on August 20, 1991 through foreclosure on the
underlying mortgaged property.  This transaction converted the
asset held by Combined Capital Resources Joint Venture, a joint
venture between the Partnership and USAA Real Estate Equities,
Inc., from a mortgage loan to real property.  The building is a
149,696 square foot office building located near the intersection
of Route 50 and Washington Boulevard with access to Washington,
D.C. via the Potomac river bridges, the George Washington Memorial
Parkway and Interstate Highways 95 and 66.  In addition, the

<PAGE>
building is located within nine minutes from Rosslyn, Virginia,
three minutes from the Pentagon and eight minutes from the
Washington, D.C. National Airport.  Sequoia, which was 99% leased
as of June 30, 1995, is 89% occupied by Logicon, Inc., a publicly-
held company which provides electronic systems and high-technology
services to government and industry.  Logicon, Inc.'s lease expires
in April 2008.

          The Northern Virginia market, where Sequoia is located,
compiled over 1.1 million square feet of positive leasing activity
during the first half of the year.  The overall occupancy for
Arlington County was at 95.7% as of June 1995.

         See "Item 2. Properties" for information pertaining to the
status of the Partnership's properties.

         The Partnership is engaged solely in the business of real
estate investment; therefore, presentation of information about
industry segments is not applicable.

         The Partnership has no employees.

         The General Partner ("General Partner") of the Partnership
is USAA Investors II, Inc., a Texas corporation.  The General
Partner maintains general responsibility for management of the
Partnership's business.

Item 5.  Market for the Registrant's Limited Partnership Interests
         and Related Security Holder Matters

         There is no established public market for the Limited
Partnership Interests ("the Interests"), and it is not anticipated
that a public market will develop.  Upon request, Real Estate
Investor Services, a department in USAA Real Estate Company, may
assist an investor desiring to transfer his Interests.  The
purchase price for the Interests upon resale and any other terms of
a resale transaction will be subject to negotiation between the
buyer and the seller.  The limited market for the Interests could
affect the value of the Interests.

          Condition and Results of Operations


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At June 30, 1995, the Partnership had cash of $48,582 and temporary
investments of $1,958,789.  Included in the Partnership's cash and
cash equivalents was the working capital reserve.  Accounts
receivable consisted of amounts due from a tenant.  Deferred
charges and other assets included an acquisition fee paid to USAA
Investors II, Inc. on the joint venture interest, deferred rent
resulting from recognition of income as required by generally
accepted accounting principles and prepaid insurance.  Accounts
payable consisted primarily of amounts due to affiliates for
reimbursable expenses.  Accrued expenses and other liabilities
consisted of prepaid rent, property tax accruals and a security
deposit. 

On August 20, 1991, the Combined Capital Resources Joint Venture
(the joint venture) acquired the Sequoia Plaza - Building I, the
underlying mortgaged property by foreclosure.  This transaction
converted the joint venture's investment from a mortgage loan to
real property.  As the fair value of the asset approximated the
mortgage, no loss was recorded on this transaction.  This event did
not have a material negative impact on the Partnership's cash flow
but reduced the equity in earnings from the joint venture due to
depreciation expense on the property.  

Total cash distributions to partners for the year ended June 30,
1995 decreased as compared to the year ended June 30, 1994. 
Distributions were reduced to $7.00 per unit as of the quarter
ended March 31, 1995.  Distributions were decreased in order to
avoid borrowing to fund the construction of the addition at the
Continental Plastic Buildings and maintain working capital at an
adequate level for operations.  Management will continue to monitor
Partnership cash requirements.

On March 24, 1995, Continental Plastic Containers, Inc. renewed and
extended the lease at the Continental Plastic Buildings for fifteen
years with an expiration of July 2010.  As part of the renewal, the
Partnership has agreed to construct an addition of approximately
45,200 square feet to the existing building.  The cost of these
improvements is estimated to be $1,700,000 to be funded from the
working capital reserve.

Future liquidity is expected to result from the temporary
investment of working capital funds, cash generated from the
operations of the properties and ultimately through the liquidation
of such properties. 


<PAGE>
During the past few years, the crisis in the financial service
industry has contributed to a depressed real estate market.  The
Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was established to assist the
Savings and Loan industry in the disposition of real estate
acquired through defaulted loans.  The RTC and financial
institutions have flooded the real estate market with properties
offered at deep discounts.  These discounts have had a general
depressing effect on real estate values.  The Partnership has only
indirectly been adversely affected by these market conditions.  The
Partnership's strategy of investing in triple-net leased properties
with long term leases and credit worthy tenants has provided a
hedge against the current real estate market.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the three-year period ended June 30, 1995, income was generated
from rental income from the income-producing rental properties,
interest income earned on the funds in temporary investments and
earnings from the joint venture interest.  

Expenses incurred during each of the years in the three-year period
ended June 30, 1995 were associated with the operations of the
Partnership's properties and various other costs required for the
administration of the Partnership.

Rental properties at June 30, 1995 decreased from June 30, 1994 due
to depreciation offset slightly by preliminary building addition
costs at Continental Plastic.  The investment in the joint venture
decreased by the amount of distributions received from the joint
venture offset by increases as a result of equity in earnings of
the joint venture which were derived from the net income of the
Sequoia Plaza - Building I property.  Accounts receivable decreased
due to payment of reimbursable expenses by a tenant.  Accrued
expenses and other liabilities at June 30, 1995 increased from June
30, 1994 as a result of an increase in prepaid rent.

Rental income increases for each of the years in the three-year
period ended June 30, 1995 were attributable to rent increases
based on CPI (Consumer Price Index) at Bowater.  Equity in earnings
were higher in 1995 and 1994 as compared to 1993 due to increased
net income of the joint venture.  

A higher cash balance and an increase in interest rates resulted in
an increase in interest income for 1995 as compared to 1994.  A
higher cash balance accounted for the increase in interest income
for 1994 as compared to 1993.

General and administrative expenses for 1995 increased as compared
to 1994 due to an increase in state filing fees and higher charges
for the preparation of federal and state returns.  The increase in
general and administrative expenses for 1994 as compared to 1993
was due to expenses incurred to market the Continental Plastic
Buildings for sale.


<PAGE>
INFLATION

An increase in inflation could affect the Partnership's investments
through increases in the costs of operating and maintaining the
properties and in various administrative costs of Partnership
operations.  The adverse effect inflation may have on operating
expenses would be offset to some extent by contractual increases in
rental rates and tenant reimbursement of expenses incurred at the
Partnership's properties.  If high occupancy levels are maintained
at the properties, increases in rental income should offset
increasing property operating expenses with a minimal effect on
operating income.  Inflationary trends may also enhance the
ultimate selling price of the Partnership's properties.

                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       JUNE 30, 1995, 1994 AND 1993


1.  Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  USAA Real Estate Income Investments II Limited Partnership is
  engaged solely in the business of real estate investment;
  therefore, presentation of information about industry
  segments is not applicable.

  The General Partner, USAA Investors II, Inc., is a wholly-
  owned subsidiary of USAA Real Estate Company, which is a
  wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Capital Corporation, which is
  a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Services Automobile
  Association (USAA).

  Rental properties are valued at cost.  The carrying amount of
  a property is not changed for temporary fluctuations in value
  unless the carrying value is believed to be permanently
  impaired.  In 1995, the Partnership adopted the provisions of
  Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
  "Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-
  lived Assets to be Disposed of," (Statement 121).  Statement
  121 provides guidance for determining impairment of long-
  lived assets utilizing undiscounted future cash flows.  Based
  on the provisions of Statement 121, the Partnership's long-
  lived assets, real estate and improvements, are not
  considered impaired.  The adoption of this Statement had no
  financial statement impact.

  The Partnership's investment in Combined Capital Resources
  Joint Venture is accounted for on the equity method.  The
  Partnership has a 7.275% interest and USAA Real Estate
  Equities, Inc. has a 92.725% interest.  Both partners have
  joint control of the joint venture.

  For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, all highly
  liquid marketable securities that have a maturity at purchase
  of three months or less and money market mutual funds are
  considered to be cash equivalents.  

  Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of
  the properties using the straight-line method.  The estimated
  lives of the buildings and improvements are 30 years (31.5
  years for Federal income tax purposes).

  Acquisition fees related to the investment in joint venture
  are being amortized over the remaining life of the building
  (note 4).

<PAGE>
  Rental income is recognized under the operating method,
  whereby aggregate rentals are reported on the straight-line
  basis over the life of the lease.  Rental income recognized
  was $48,746 less than the amount per lease agreements for the
  years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994 and $3,896 less for 1993.

  Deferred charges consisted primarily of deferred rent
  resulting from recognition of income as required by generally
  accepted accounting principles.

  No provision or credit for income taxes has been made as the
  liability for such taxes is that of the Partners rather than
  the Partnership.  The Partnership files its tax return each
  calendar year on an accrual basis.  

  For financial reporting purposes, net income is allocated 10%
  to the General Partner and 90% to the Limited Partners.  Net
  income per limited partnership interest is based upon the
  limited partnership interests outstanding at the end of the
  period and net income allocated to the Limited Partners.
  
  Cash distributions per limited partnership interest were
  $33.25 for the year ended June 30, 1995 and $35.00 for the
  years ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 and were based on the
  limited partnership interests outstanding at each quarter end
  and the cash distributions allocated to Limited Partners.


2.  Partnership Agreement

  Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, Net Cash
  from Operations shall be allocated and paid 10% to the
  General Partner and 90% to the Limited Partners.   Any Net
  Cash from Operations received by a Limited Partner shall
  count toward his 6% cumulative Preferred Return (10% as to
  that portion of Partnership funds invested in mortgage
  loans), as defined in the Partnership Agreement. Net Proceeds
  from Sales or Refinancings shall be allocated and paid 1% to
  the General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners until the
  Limited Partners have been returned their Original Invested
  Capital plus their Preferred Return.  Second, Net Proceeds
  from Sales or Refinancings shall be allocated and paid to the
  General Partner in payment of any unpaid Subordinated
  Disposition Fee.  Third, Net Proceeds from Sales or
  Refinancings shall be allocated and paid 90% to the Limited
  Partners and 10% to the General Partner.

  Generally, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
  credit from operations will be allocated 90% to the Limited
  Partners and 10% to the General Partner.  Net gain or net
  loss from the sale or other disposition of a Property shall
  be allocated as described in the Partnership Agreement.

3.  Rental Properties

4.  Investment in Joint Venture

  On September 28, 1988, the Partnership entered into the
  Combined Capital Resources Joint Venture (the joint venture)
  with USAA Real Estate Company (REALCO), an affiliate of the
  General Partner, for the ownership and operation of income-
  producing properties and participating first mortgage loans. 
  The joint venture is structured in a manner which grants
  joint control of the joint venture to both partners, but
  which gives REALCO the responsibility of conducting the
  ordinary and usual day-to-day management of the joint venture
  property.

  The initial joint venture investment was a participating
  first mortgage on the Sequoia Plaza - Building I in an amount
  of $30,927,000 which was originally extended by REALCO on May
  23, 1988.  On June 30, 1989, the Partnership invested
  $2,250,000 in this participating first mortgage which was
  paid directly to REALCO with the understanding that such sum
  would be the Partnership's capital contribution to the joint
  venture and would reduce REALCO's  contribution.  As a
  result, REALCO's contribution became $28,677,000.  REALCO's
  joint venture interest is 92.725% and the Partnership's joint
  venture interest is 7.275%.

  On March 27, 1990, REALCO sold its joint venture interest to
  USAA Real Estate Equities, Inc, a real estate investment
  trust, which is majority-owned by REALCO.  All other terms
  and conditions contained in the joint venture agreement
  remain as originally written and amended.

  On August 20, 1991, the Combined Capital Resources Joint
  Venture acquired the underlying mortgaged property through
  foreclosure.  This transaction converted the joint venture's
  investment from a mortgage loan to real property.  As the
  fair value of the asset approximated the mortgage loan and
  other receivables, no loss was recorded on this transaction. 
  This event did not have a material negative impact on the
  Partnership's cash flow but has reduced the equity in
  earnings from the joint venture due to depreciation expense
  on the property.

  Combined Capital Resources Joint Venture as of June 30, 1995

5.  Minimum Future Rentals

   Minimum future rentals are cash payments to be received
   under non-cancelable leases over the lease terms and do not
   necessarily represent rental income under generally accepted
   accounting principles.  Rental income reported in the
   Statements of Income is recognized under the operating
   method, whereby aggregate rentals are reported as income
   over the life of the lease.  The Partnership's rental
   properties are leased for four to fifteen years under
   triple-net leases whereby the tenants pay all operating
   expenses.  Approximate minimum future rentals are as
   follows:


                   1996                $  1,137,000 
                   1997                   1,178,000  
                   1998                   1,178,000
                   1999                   1,178,000
                   2000                     746,000
                   Thereafter             9,390,000
                                       $ 14,807,000


6.  Transactions with Affiliates

(1)    Reimbursement of expenses represents amounts paid or accrued
       as reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of the
       Partnership at actual cost and does not include any mark-up
       or items normally considered as overhead.


7.  Major Customer Information

   The Partnership owns two single-tenant industrial complexes. 
   The lease agreements between the Partnership and these
   tenants (a manufacturer of plastic bottles and a
   manufacturer of business forms) are absolute triple net
   lease arrangements whereby the lessee is required to make
   all payments for expenses related to the use and occupation
   of the leased premises including real estate taxes and
   assessments, property and liability insurance, repairs and
   maintenance, utilities and other operating costs associated
   with the property.  Accordingly, net operating income for
   1995, 1994 and 1993 reflects only rental income and excludes
   all expenses directly related to the operations of the
   properties as payments for such expenses are made directly
   by the respective lessees.

<PAGE>   
   For the year ended June 30, 1995, the Partnership recorded
   $593,829 and $434,864 of rental income from two single
   tenants which represents 58% and 42%, respectively, of the
   total rental income.

   For the year ended June 30, 1994, the Partnership recorded
   $593,829 and $425,171 of rental income from two single
   tenants which represents 58% and 42%, respectively, of total
   rental income.

   For the year ended June 30, 1993, the Partnership recorded
   $593,829 and $411,552 of rental income from two single
   tenants which represents 59% and 41%, respectively, of total
   rental income.


8.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
   payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate
   fair value because of the short-term nature of these
   instruments.

9.  Commitment

   In 1995 the Partnership completed negotiations with a tenant
   to expand the facilities under lease and to extend the term
   of the lease.  The original lease expiration has been
   extended from April 1998 to July 2010.  The Partnership has
   committed to funding approximately $1.7 million to provide
   approximately 45,200 square feet of additional area.  The
   expansion is expected to be completed in December 1995,
   utilizing existing working capital to fund the construction.

for depreciation), (ii) amounts set aside for reasonable reserves
plus any earnings thereon, (iii) payments on the Partnership's
other current obligations (other than the Management Fee),
including the Mortgage Loan Servicing Fee and (iv) any earnings

     "Nonrecourse Deductions":  Partnership losses or deductions
attributable to Nonrecourse Liabilities which for each
Partnership taxable year shall equal in the aggregate for the

Nonrecourse Deductions for a Partnership taxable year shall
consist first of depreciation or cost recovery deductions with
respect to items of Partnership property subject to one or more
Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership to the extent of the
increase in Partnership Minimum Gain attributable to the
Nonrecourse Liabilities to which each such item of property is
subject, with the remainder of such Nonrecourse Deductions, if
any, made up of a pro rata portion of the Partnership's other
items of deduction or loss for that taxable year.  If, however,

<PAGE>
such depreciation or cost recovery deductions exceed the net
increase in Partnership Minimum Gain, a proportional share of
each such deduction shall constitute a Nonrecourse Deduction.  If
the net increase in Partnership Minimum Gain during a Partnership
taxable year exceeds the total amount of items of Partnership
loss or deduction for such taxable year then an amount of
Partnership loss and deduction for the Partnership's next
succeeding taxable year (or years) equal to such excess shall
constitute Nonrecourse Deductions, as if there had been a net
increase in Partnership Minimum Gain during such succeeding
taxable year (or years) in the amount of such excess.

     "Nonrecourse Liability":  A liability of the Partnership (or
portion thereof) with respect to which none of the Partners (or

Partnership's assets subject to the liability).

     "Organizational and Offering Expenses":  Expenses incurred
in connection with the organization of the Partnership and the
offering of the Interests including selling commissions, legal
fees, accounting fees, escrow fees, printing costs, filing and

     "Partnership":  The partnership formed and continued under
the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership
attached as Exhibit A.

     "Partnership Minimum Gain":  The amount determined by
computing, with respect to each Nonrecourse Liability, the amount
of gain, if any, that would be realized by the Partnership if it
disposed of (in a taxable transaction) the Property subject to
such liability in full satisfaction thereof, and by then
aggregating the amounts so computed.

     "Partner's Share of Partnership Minimum Gain":  As to any
Partner at the end of any Partnership taxable year, the amount
equal to the aggregate Nonrecourse Deductions allocated to such
Partner (and such Partner's predecessors in interest) up to that
time, less such Partners (and such predecessor's) aggregate share
of the net decreases in Partnership Minimum Gain up to that time. 
A Partner's share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during a Partnership taxable year equals an amount that bears the
same relation to the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during such year as such Partner's Share of Partnership Minimum
Gain at the end of the prior taxable year of the Partnership
bears to the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain at the end of
such prior year.

<PAGE>
     "Preferred Return":  The cumulative non-compounded preferred
return to each Limited Partner equal to 6% per annum in the case
of investments in properties or (10% per annum as to that portion
of the Partnership funds invested in mortgage loans, weighted on
a daily average basis for the period) on his Average Annual
Unreturned Invested Capital payable from either distributions of
Net Cash from Operations or Net Proceeds from Sales or
Refinancings or both.  Such cumulative preferred return shall be
calculated from the date the owner of such Interests is admitted
as a Limited Partner.

                                          Partner shall receive an

                                          in its capital account. 
                                          See "Income and Losses

(1)  See "The Offering."

(2)  The Sales Agent shall receive a nonaccountable expense
     allocation for Organizational and Offering Expenses in an
     amount equal to 2% of gross offering proceeds.  The Sales
     Agent shall pay all Organizational and Offering Expenses
     excluding selling commissions in excess of such amount.

(3)  The Partnership may invest offering proceeds, including
     working capital reserves, from time to time in a money market
     fund sponsored by USAA Investment Management Company for which
     the advisory fee shall be paid annually.  See "Investment
     Objectives and Policies--Preliminary Investments."  On an
     annualized basis, this Advisory Fee is equal to 1/2% of the
     registered investment company's first $50,000,000 Annual Net
     Assets; 2/5% of the registered investment company's Annual Net
     Assets over $50,000,000 but not over $100,000,000; and 3/10%
     of that portion of the registered investment company's Annual
     net Assets over $100,000,000.

(4)  At a minimum, an amount equal to 87% of the Limited Partners'
     capital contributions (including a 3% working capital reserve)
     will be committed to investment in properties.  For purposes
     hereof, capital contributions are deemed to be committed to
     investment in properties to the extent such capital
     contributions are used to make or invest in mortgage loans or
     are actually paid or allocated to the purchase, development,
     construction or improvement of properties acquired by the
     Partnership (including the funding of working capital reserves
     (except that working capital reserves in excess of 5% of gross
     offering proceeds shall not be included) and other cash
     payments such as interest and taxes but excluding Front-End
     Fees.)  The remaining capital contributions not committed to
     investment in properties are available for the payment of
     Front-End Fees consisting of Organizational and Offering
     Expenses, Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses, and real
     estate broker commissions. See "Estimated Use of Proceeds."

(5)  The General Partner or its Affiliates may be reimbursed for
     (a) the actual cost of goods and materials used for or by the
     Partnership and obtained from an entity that is not an
     Affiliate of the General Partner; (b) salaries and related
     salary expenses for services which could be performed directly
     for the Partnership by independent parties, including legal,
     accounting, transfer agent, data processing, duplicating and
     administration of investor accounts; and (c) the cost of
     Partnership reports and communications to investors.  No
     reimbursement shall be permitted for services for which the
     General Partner or Affiliates receive a separate fee or for
     (i) salaries, related salary expenses, traveling expenses, and
     other administrative items incurred by any Controlling Persons
     or which are not directly attributable to the rendering of
     services to the Partnership and (ii) any indirect expenses
     incurred in performing services for the Partnership, such as
     rent or depreciation, utilities, capital equipment, and other

<PAGE>
     administrative items.  "Controlling Person" for this purpose
     shall mean any person, regardless of title, who performs
     executive or senior management functions for the General
     Partner or Affiliates similar to those of directors, executive
     management and senior management, or any person who either
     holds 5% or more equity interest in the General Partner or
     Affiliates or has the power to direct or cause the direction
     of the General Partner or Affiliates, whether through the
     ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise, or,
     in the absence of a specific role or title, any person having
     the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
     level employees and policies of the General Partner or
     Affiliates.  It is not intended that every person who carries
     a title such as vice president, senior vice president,
     secretary or treasurer be included in the definition of
     Controlling Person.  In no event shall any amount charged to
     the Partnership as a reimbursable expense by the General
     Partner exceed the lesser of the actual cost of such services,
     or 90% of the amount which the Partnership would be required
     to pay to independent parties for comparable services in the
     same geographic location.  Reimbursements are also allowable
     for certain Organizational and Offering Expenses and
     expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition of
     the Properties by the Partnership.

(6)  Any prediction of such dollar amount would necessarily involve
     assumptions of future events that cannot be determined at this
     time.

(7)  The Partnership Agreement permits the General Partner or any
     Affiliate of the General Partner to make a loan to the
     Partnership if the interest and other similar charges or fees
     on any such loan are not in excess of the amounts which would
     be charged by unaffiliated lending institutions on comparable
     loans for the same purpose in the same locality but not in
     excess of 2% above the prime rate quoted from time to time
     during the term of the loan by Chase Manhattan Bank of New
     York City, New York, such amount charged not to exceed 12% per
     annum.

(8)  See "Income and Losses and Cash Distributions."

(9)  The General Partner is entitled to receive an annual Mortgage
     Loan Servicing Fee equal to 1/4 of 1% of the maximum amount
     funded or to be funded by the Partnership in Mortgage Loans.

(10) Subordinated Disposition Fees payable to the General Partner
     for services in connection with the sale of Properties shall
     be cumulative but shall be paid only after the Limited
     Partners have been returned their Original Invested Capital
     plus their Preferred Return from either Net Cash from
     Operations or Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings.  If an
     unaffiliated broker participates in the sale of one or more of
     the Properties, the subordination requirement will apply only

<PAGE>
     to the fee, if any, earned by the General Partner.  The total
     of all real estate fees payable to all parties in connection
     with the sale of one or more of the Properties, including the
     Subordinated Disposition Fee, shall not exceed the lesser of 
     a competitive real estate fee which is reasonable, customary
     and competitive in light of the size, type and location of the 
     Properties or 6% of the sales price of the Properties.


     An Affiliate of the General Partner may provide insurance
brokerage services in connection with obtaining insurance on the
Properties so long as the cost of providing such service, including
cost of the insurance, is no greater than the lowest quote obtained
from two unaffiliated insurance agencies and the coverage and terms
are likewise comparable.  In no event may such services be provided
by any such Affiliate unless it is independently engaged in the
business of providing such services to parties unaffiliated with
the General Partner and at least 75% of its insurance brokerage
service gross revenue is derived from parties unaffiliated with the
General Partner.

     It is contemplated as of the date hereof that the Properties
will be managed by unaffiliated management firms, and by Affiliates
of the General Partner as necessary, or by operating partners in
situations where the partnership is a partner or joint venturer. 
Affiliates of the General Partner are presently engaged in
providing property management services for prior RealCo sponsored
partnerships and may in the future provide such services to the
Partnership for some or all of the Properties.  The Partnership
Agreement permits the Partnership to obtain property management
services from the General Partner or one or more Affiliates of the
General Partner and in the event such services are provided the
compensation therefor will not exceed the lesser of the rates
prevailing for comparable services in the same geographic area or
(i) 5% of gross revenues from each residential property (included
in such 5% are fees for leasing and related services), (ii) 6% of
gross revenues from each industrial and commercial property if
leasing and related services are performed, (iii) 3% of gross
revenues from each industrial and commercial property if no leasing
and related services are performed, and (iv) 1% of gross revenues 
from each industrial and commercial property leased on a long-term
(10 years or more) net basis (except for a one-time initial leasing
fee of 3% of the gross revenues in each lease payable over the
first five full years of the original term of the lease).  The
actual amount of such compensation, if any, is not determinable at
this time.

     Front-End Fees consisting of Organizational and Offering
Expenses, Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses shall in no
event exceed 13% of the gross offering proceeds.

                INCOME AND LOSSES AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
                                    

NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS
     The Partnership Agreement prohibits the reinvestment (or
investment) of Net Cash from Operations available for distribution,
except as a temporary investment pending distribution to Partners. 
The availability of Net Cash from Operations is subject to (i)
payment of the Partnership's operating expenses (without deduction
for depreciation), (ii) amounts set aside to maintain a reasonable
working capital reserve (see "Investment Objectives and Policies--
Working Capital Reserve") and (iii) payment of the Partnership's
other current obligations, including the Mortgage Loan Servicing
Fee.  See "Management Compensation" for details on calculation of
the Mortgage Loan Servicing Fee.

     Distribution of Net Cash from Operations will be made 10% to
the General Partner as the Management Fee and 90% to the Limited
Partners.  Any Net Cash from Operations received by a Limited
Partner shall count toward his 6% cumulative Preferred Return (10%
per annum as to that portion of Partnership funds invested in
mortgage loans, weighted on a daily average basis for the period.) 
Distributions of Net Cash from Operations to Limited Partners will
be made quarterly, at the discretion of the General Partner and,
except for the first distribution, will be apportioned to the
Limited Partners of record on the last day of the calendar quarter
immediately preceding such distribution in proportion to the number
of Interests owned by each Limited Partner as of that date.  The
first distribution of Net Cash from Operations will be apportioned
to each Limited Partner of record on the last day of the calendar
quarter immediately preceding such distribution in the ratio that 
(i) the number of Interests held by each such Limited Partner
multiplied by the number of days that such Interests were
outstanding through the last day of the calendar quarter
immediately preceding such distribution bears to (ii) the sum for
all Interests of the product computed in (i).  The ultimate amount
of any of such distributions will depend upon attaining and
thereafter maintaining operating income and expenses of Properties
at levels permitting such distributions.

NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES OR REFINANCINGS
     During the two-year period commencing on the date of this
Prospectus, any cash received on the sale or refinancing of any
Property or the prepayment of any Mortgage Loan may, in the
discretion of the General Partner, either be distributed or
reinvested in other properties or used to make mortgage loans. 
Thereafter, Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings will not be
invested or reinvested in any property or investment other than the
Properties and/or the Mortgage Loans, except as a temporary
investment pending distribution to Partners.  Net Proceeds from
Sales or Refinancings, other than as part of the liquidation of the
Partnership, will be distributed as follows:
          (i) First, 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the
     Limited Partners until the Limited Partners have been returned
     their Original Invested Capital from Net Proceeds from Sales

<PAGE>
     or Refinancings, plus their Preferred Return from either
     distributions of Net Cash from Operations or Net Proceeds from
     Sales or Refinancings;
          (ii) Second, to the General Partner until it has received
     all unpaid Subordinated Disposition Fees; and
          (iii) Third, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
     General Partner.  However, distributions in liquidation of the
     Partnership will be made in proportion to and in an amount
     equal to the Partners' positive capital account balances.  For
     a discussion of the calculation of Subordinated Disposition
     Fees, see "Management Compensation."

     Distribution of Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings, if
any, will be in such amounts and at such times as the General
Partner may determine.  The amount of each distribution of Net
Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings to Limited Partners will be
apportioned and paid to the Limited Partners of record as of the
last day of the calendar month in which such Net Proceeds from
Sales or Refinancings were received by the Partnership as follows:
          (i) First, an amount equal to the unreturned Original
     Invested Capital of all Limited Partners shall be distributed
     in proportion to the unreturned Original Invested Capital of
     each such Limited Partner;
          (ii) Second, an amount equal to the unpaid Preferred
     Return of all Limited Partners shall be distributed in
     proportion to the unpaid Preferred Return of each such Limited
     Partner;
          (iii) Third, the balance shall be distributed in
     proportion to the number of Interests owned by each Limited
     Partner, except that Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings
     from the disposition of the last of the Properties and
     Mortgage Loans generally will be apportioned in proportion to
     each Limited Partner's positive capital account balance.


ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND LOSSES
     On and after the Initial Admittance Date, except as otherwise
provided herein, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit from operations will be allocated 10% to the General Partner
and 90% to the Limited Partners.

     Net gain from the sale or other disposition of a Property or
Mortgage Loan is generally allocated as follows:

          (i) First, to the Partners in an amount up to and in
     proportion with any negative balances in their respective
     capital accounts in excess of each respective Partner's Share
     of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of the taxable year
     for which the allocation is made;

          (ii) Second, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the
     General Partner for all taxable years ending before the
     Limited Partners have been returned their Original Invested
     Capital and have been paid to their Preferred Return.  For the
     taxable year during which distributions of Net Proceeds from

<PAGE>
     Sales or Refinancings to Limited Partners are sufficient to
     return to the Limited Partners their Original Invested
     Capital, plus their Preferred Return, net gain is allocated
     99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner in
     the minimum amount necessary, if any, so that the capital
     account balances of the Limited Partners equal the amounts of
     their respective unreturned Original Invested Capital plus
     their unpaid Preferred Return less their respective Partner's
     Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of such
     taxable year;

          (iii) Third, to the Partners in the minimum amount
     necessary, if any, so that the aggregate balance in the
     capital accounts of the Limited Partners in excess of an
     amount equal to the excess of the sum of their unreturned
     Original Invested Capital and their unpaid Preferred Return
     over the aggregate of the Limited Partners' Share of
     Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of the taxable year for
     which the allocation is made, and the balance in the capital
     account of the General Partner in excess of 1.01% of an amount
     equal to the excess of the sum of the Limited Partners'
     unreturned Original Invested Capital and their unpaid
     Preferred Return over the aggregate of the Limited Partners'
     Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of the taxable
     year for which the allocation is made, is in the ratio of 90
     to 10; and

          (iv) Fourth, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
     General Partner.

     To the extent ordinary income from recapture of depreciation
is incurred upon the sale or other disposition of a Property, such
ordinary income shall be allocated, to the extent possible, to the
Partners as a portion of their net gain allocated to the extent
such Partners received the benefit of the depreciation deduction
resulting in such ordinary income from recapture of depreciation.

     Net loss from the sale or other disposition of a Property or
Mortgage Loan is generally allocated between the Limited Partners
and the General Partner as follows:

          (i) First, if any gain has been allocated pursuant to
     subparagraph (ii) or (iii) of the preceding paragraph, then
     100% to the General Partner in the minimum amount necessary,
     if any, so that the aggregate balance in the capital accounts
     of the Limited Partners in excess of an amount equal to the
     excess of the sum of their unreturned Original Invested
     Capital and their unpaid Preferred Return over the aggregate
     of the Limited Partners' Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as
     of the end of the taxable year for which the allocation is
     made, and the balance in the capital account of the General
     Partner in excess of 1.01% of an amount equal to the excess of
     the sum of the Limited Partners' unreturned Original Invested
     Capital and their unpaid Preferred Return over the aggregate
     of the Limited Partners' Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as
     of the end of the taxable year for which the allocation is
     made, is in the ratio of 90 to 10;


<PAGE>
          (ii) Second, if any gain has been allocated pursuant to
     subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of the preceding paragraph, then
     10% to the General Partner and 90% to the Limited Partners
     until the aggregate balance in the capital accounts of the
     Limited Partners is equal to the excess of the sum of their
     unreturned Original Invested Capital and their unpaid
     Preferred Return over the aggregate of the Limited Partners'
     Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of the taxable
     year for which the allocation is made; and

          (iii) Third, 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the
     Limited Partners.

Special rules apply to the allocation of income, gain, loss and
deductions in certain circumstances.  See Section 9.4 of the
Partnership Agreement.


     Except for Interests which are transferred during a taxable
year, in general, income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
allocated to the Limited Partners shall be computed annually and
apportioned to the Limited Partners of record at the end of each
taxable year in proportion to the number of Interests owned by each
Limited Partner as of that date.  Allocations to Limited Partners
attributable to periods before the Final Closing Date shall be
computed by an interim closing of the books as of the end of the
day immediately preceding each admittance date of Additional
Limited Partners and at the end of any taxable year during such
periods and shall be apportioned to the Limited Partners of record 
as of the end of the day immediately preceding each such admittance
date of Additional Limited Partners or on the last day of such
taxable year in proportion to the number of Interests owned by each
such Limited Partner as of each such date.  Allocations of gain and
loss resulting from a sale of a Property shall be apportioned to
those Limited Partners of record on the date the Partnership
recognizes such gain or loss and who are entitled to allocations of
gain or loss under Section 9.4 of the Partnership Agreement.  In
the event of a transfer of an Interest, each item of Partnership
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit attributable to the
transferred Interest is generally allocated on an equal daily basis
to the owner of such Interest on the basis of the number of days
that such person was the owner of such Interest; except that net
gain or net loss from the sale or other disposition of a Property
is allocated to the owner of the Interest as of the date that such
net gain or net loss is recognized by the Partnership.

     There are circumstances in which a Limited Partner in any year
may be allocated more taxable income than he would receive in
distributions of cash.  See "Federal Income Tax Aspects--Taxable
Income in Excess of Cash Distributions."

     The General Partner may amend the provisions of the
Partnership Agreement as appropriate as a result of the
promulgation of final Treasury Regulations under Sections 704 and
706 of the Code, if in the opinion of counsel such an amendment is

<PAGE>
advisable to reflect allocations among the Limited Partners and the
General Partner consistent with those regulations.  See "Federal
Income Tax Aspects--Allocations of Income and Loss."  For a more
detailed description of the allocations under the Partnership
Agreement, see Article IX of the Partnership Agreement.


CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

     Each Partner shall have a capital account which shall be
increased by the amount of such Partner's capital contribution to
the Partnership and the amount of any income or gain allocated to
such Partner and shall be decreased by the amount of any
syndication cost, other nondeductible and deductible expense, loss
or deduction allocated to such Partner and the amount of all
distributions to such Partner.  The capital accounts shall be
established and maintained in accordance with federal income tax
principles as set forth in Treasury Regulations.

     The General Partner is required to contribute, immediately
prior to the termination of the Partnership, cash equal to the
lesser of (i) the deficit balance in its capital account or (ii)
the excess of 1.01% of all Limited Partners' Original Invested
Capital over the amount of capital previously contributed by the
General Partner.  A deficit in a Partner's capital account is not
considered an asset of the Partnership.


SOURCES AND CHARACTER OF CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS

     See "Investment Objectives and Policies--Working Capital
Reserve" for information pertaining to the characterization of
distributions from the working capital or other reserve as Net
Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings in the event there is a
distribution from the working capital or other reserve that results
in the reduction of such reserve below 3% of gross proceeds from
the offering, the amount initially reserved therefor.
