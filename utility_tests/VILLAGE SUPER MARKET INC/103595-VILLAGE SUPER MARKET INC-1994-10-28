 Part I
                             ITEM I.  BUSINESS
GENERAL

 The Company operates a chain of 21 ShopRite supermarkets, 15 of which
are located in northern New Jersey, 1 of which is in northeastern
Pennsylvania and 5 of which are in the southern shore area of New
Jersey.  
 In addition, the Company operates two former ShopRite stores under a
"Village Market" format as described below.  The Company's membership in
Wakefern Food Corporation ("Wakefern"), the nation's largest retailer
owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite name, provides the
Company many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution and
advertising associated with chains of greater size and geographic reach. 
The Company believes that the regional nature of its business and the
continuity of its management under the leadership of its founding family
have permitted the Company to operate with greater flexibility and
responsiveness to the demographic characteristics of the communities
served by its stores.

 The Company seeks to generate high sales volume by offering a wide
variety of high quality products at consistently low prices.  The
Company attempts to efficiently utilize its selling space, gives
continuing attention to the decor and format of its stores and tailors
each store's product mix to the preferences of the local community.  The
Company concentrates on development of superstores, which, in addition
to their larger size (an average of 50,000 total square feet, including
office and storage space, compared with an average of 30,000 total
square feet for conventional supermarkets), feature such higher margin
specialty service departments as an on-site bakery, an expanded
delicatessen, a fresh seafood section and, in most cases, a prescription
pharmacy.  Superstores also offer an expanded selection of higher margin
non-food items such as cut flowers, health and beauty aids, greeting
cards, videocassette rentals and small appliances.   The two most recent
superstores also include a warehouse section featuring products in giant
sizes.  The following table shows the percentage of the Company's sales
allocable to various product categories during each of the periods
indicated as well as the number of the Company's superstores and
percentage of selling square feet allocable to these stores during each
of these periods:

</TABLE>

<PAGE 3> 

 Because of its increased size and broader product mix, a superstore
can satisfy a greater percentage of a customer's weekly shopping needs
and, as a result, the typical superstore generally has a higher volume
of sales per square foot and sales per customer than a conventional
supermarket.  In addition, because of their greater total sales volume
and increased percentage of their sales allocable to higher margin
items, superstores generally operate more profitably than conventional
supermarkets.

 A variety of factors affect the profitability of each of the
Company's stores including local competitors, size, access and parking,
lease terms, management supervision, and the strength of the ShopRite
trademark in the local community.  The Company continually evaluates
individual stores to decide whether they should be closed.  Accordingly,
the Orange, Maplewood, Kingston, Morristown and Easton stores have been
sold since December 1991.  In addition, two stores were converted to a
"Village Market" format designed to reduce costs and increase margins in
lower volume locations. 

 The Company operates a separate liquor store adjacent to one Company
supermarket.

DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION

 The Company is engaged in a continuing program to upgrade and expand 
its supermarket chain.  This program has included major store
remodelings as well as the opening or acquisition of additional stores. 
When remodeling, the Company has sought, whenever possible, to increase
the amount of selling space in its stores and, where feasible within
existing site limitations, to convert conventional supermarkets to
superstores.  The Company completed one major expansion and remodel in
fiscal 1994 and two smaller expansions.  The Company has budgeted
$8,000,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 1995.  The major planned
expenditures are the expansion and remodel of the Chester store and the
beginning of the expansion of the Absecon store.

 In the last five years, the Company has added one new store and
completed five remodels.  The Company's goal has been to open an average
of one new superstore and conduct a major remodel of one store each
year.  However, because of delays associated with increased governmental
regulations, including sewage moratoriums and environmental cleanup
regulations effecting sites and the lack of recent activity by real
estate developers, the Company has been unable to open the desired
number of new stores.  Additional store remodelings and sites for new
stores are in various stages of development.  The Company will also
consider additional acquisitions should appropriate opportunities arise.

<PAGE 4>

WAKEFERN

 The Company is the second largest member of Wakefern (owning 17.2% of
Wakefern's outstanding stock) and two of the Company's principal
shareholders were founders of Wakefern.  Wakefern, which was organized
in 1946, is the nation's largest retailer-owned food cooperative.  There
are presently 30 individual member companies and 180 supermarkets which
comprise the Wakefern cooperative.  Only Wakefern and member companies
are entitled to use the ShopRite name and trademark, purchase their
product requirements and participate in ShopRite advertising and
promotional programs and its computerized purchasing, warehousing and
distribution services.

 The principal benefits to the Company from its relationship with 
Wakefern are the use of the ShopRite name and trademark, volume
purchasing, ShopRite private label products, distribution and
warehousing on a cooperative basis, and ShopRite advertising and
promotional programs.  The Company believes that the ShopRite name is
widely recognized by its customers and is a factor in those customers'
decisions about where to shop.  In addition, Wakefern can purchase large
quantities and varieties of products at favorable prices which it can
then pass on to its members.  These benefits are important to the
Company's success.

 Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each of its
stockholders a share of the earnings of Wakefern in proportion to the
dollar volume of business done by the stockholder with Wakefern during
each fiscal year.

 While Wakefern has a substantial professional staff, it operates as a
member cooperative.  Executives of most members make contributions of
time to the business of Wakefern.  Senior executives of the Company
spend a significant amount of their time working on various Wakefern
committees which oversee and direct Wakefern purchases and other
programs.

 Most of the Company's advertising is developed and placed by
Wakefern's professional advertising staff.  Wakefern is responsible for
all television, radio and major newspaper advertisements.  Wakefern
bills its members by various formulas which distribute advertising costs
in accordance with the estimated proportional benefits to each member
from such advertising.  The Company also places Wakefern developed
materials with local newspapers.

 Wakefern operates warehouses and distribution facilities in
Elizabeth, New Jersey; Dayton, New Jersey; Wallkill, New York; and South
Brunswick, New Jersey.  Each member is obligated to purchase from
Wakefern a minimum of 85% of its requirements for products offered by
Wakefern until ten years from the date that stockholders representing
75% of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders request
the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be terminated.  If this purchase
obligation is not met, the member is required to pay Wakefern's profit
contribution shortfall attributable to this failure.  This agreement
also makes unapproved changes in control of the Company and sale of the

 <PAGE 5>

Company or of individual Company stores, except to a qualified
successor, financially prohibitive by requiring the Company in such
cases to pay Wakefern the profit contribution shortfall attributable to
the sale of store or change in control. Such payments were waived by
Wakefern in connection with the sale of the Orange, Maplewood, Kingston
and Morristown stores.  A "qualified successor" must be or agree to
become a member of Wakefern and may not own or operate any supermarkets
other than ShopRite supermarkets, in the states of New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine or the District of Columbia
or own or operate more than 25 non-ShopRite supermarkets in any other
locations in the United States.  

 Wakefern, under circumstances specified in its bylaws, may refuse to
sell merchandise to, and may repurchase the Wakefern stock of, any
member.  Such circumstances include certain unapproved transfers by a
member of its supermarket business or its capital stock in Wakefern,
unapproved acquisition by a member of certain supermarket or grocery
wholesale supply businesses, the material breach by a member of any
provision of the bylaws of Wakefern or any agreement with Wakefern or a
determination by Wakefern that the continued supplying of merchandise or
services to such member would adversely affect Wakefern.

 Any material change in Wakefern's method of operation or a
termination or material modification of the Company's relationship with
Wakefern following expiration of the above agreements or otherwise (none
of which are contemplated or considered likely) might have an adverse
impact on the conduct of the Company's business and could involve
additional expense for the Company.  The failure of any Wakefern member
to fulfill its obligations under these agreements or a member's
insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs
to remaining members.

 Wakefern owns and operates 23 supermarkets.  The Company believes
that Wakefern may consider purchasing additional stores in the future
from non-members and from existing members who may desire to sell their
stores for financial, estate planning or other reasons.  The Company
also understands that Wakefern may consider opening and operating new
ShopRite supermarkets as well.

 Wakefern does not prescribe geographical franchise areas to its
members.  The specific locations at which the Company, other members of
Wakefern or Wakefern itself may open new units under the ShopRite name
are, however, subject to the approval of Wakefern's Site Development
Committee.  This committee is composed of persons who are not employees
or members of Wakefern and from whose decision to deny a site
application may be appealed to the Wakefern Board of Directors. 
Wakefern assists its members in their site selection by providing
appropriate demographic data, volume projections and projections of the
impact of the proposed market on existing member supermarkets in the
area.

 Each member's Wakefern stock (including the Company's) is pledged to
Wakefern to secure all of that member's obligations to Wakefern. 

<PAGE 6>

Moreover, every owner of 5% or more of the voting stock of a member
(including six members of the Sumas family) must personally guarantee
prompt payment of all amounts due Wakefern from that member.  Wakefern
does not own any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.

 Each of Wakefern's members is required to make capital contributions
to Wakefern based on the number of stores operated by that member (and
to a limited extent the sales volume generated by those stores).  As
additional stores are opened or acquired by a member (including the
Company), additional capital must be contributed by it to Wakefern.  On
occasion, as its business needs have required, Wakefern has increased
the per-store capital contributions required of its members.  Wakefern
has in the past permitted these increases in required capital to be paid
in installments over a period of time.  The Company is required to
invest approximately $1,065,000 over approximately the next four years. 

TECHNOLOGY

 The Company considers automation and computerization important to its
operations and competitive position.  All stores have scanning checkout
systems that improve pricing accuracy, enhance productivity and reduce
checkout time for customers.  Over the last three years, the company 
installed IBM RS/6000 computers and satellite communications in each
store.  Using the RS/6000 system, the Company offers customers debit and
credit card payment options in all stores.  In addition, the Company is
utilizing a computer generated ordering system in ten stores, which is
designed to reduce inventory levels and out of stock conditions, enhance
shelf space utilization, and reduce labor costs.  

 The Company's commitment to advanced scanning systems has enabled it
to participate in Price Plus, ShopRite's preferred customer program. 
Customers receive electronic discounts by presenting a scanable Price
Plus card.  In addition, the Company began using Clip Less coupons in
1994.  Customers need only present their Price Plus card to receive the
value of our in-ad coupons.  Also, target marketing programs using this
technology are presently being developed.  The Company is currently in
the process of converting our customers separate Price Plus and check
cashing cards to a single universal card.  In addition to customer
convenience, the new card provides the Company with improved ability to
limit the acceptance of bad checks.  

 The Company utilizes a direct store delivery system, consisting of
personal computers and hand held scanners, for most items not purchased
through Wakefern in order to provide equivalent cost and retail price
control over these products.  Six stores have implemented CAO (Computer
Assisted Ordering), which uses hand held terminals to read UPC codes on
shelf tags to re-order products.  In addition, certain in-store
department records are computerized, including the records of all
pharmacy departments.  In certain stores, meat, seafood and delicatessen
prices are maintained on computer for automatic weighing and pricing. 
Furthermore, a substantial majority of the Company's stores have
computerized time and attendance and work scheduling systems and several
also have computerized energy management systems.  The Company seeks to
design its stores to use energy efficiently, including recycling waste
 
<PAGE 7>

heat generated by refrigeration equipment for heating and other
purposes.

COMPETITION

 The supermarket business is highly competitive.  Industry profit
margins are narrow, consequently earnings are dependent on high sales
volume and operating efficiency.  The Company is in direct competition
with national, regional and local chains as well as independent
supermarkets, warehouse clubs, drug stores, discount department stores
and convenience stores.  The principal methods of competition utilized
by the Company are low pricing, courteous, quick service to the
customer, quality products and consistent availability of a wide variety
of merchandise including the ShopRite private label.  The Company
believes its regional focus and the continuity of its management by the
Sumas family permit it to operate with greater flexibility in tailoring
the products offered in each store to the demographics of the
communities they serve as compared to national and larger regional
chains.  The Company's principal competitors are Pathmark, A & P,
Foodtown, King's, Grand Union and Acme.  Many of the Company's
competitors have financial resources substantially greater than those of
the Company.

LABOR

 As of October 6, 1994, the Company employed approximately 3,800
persons, of whom approximately 2,300 worked part-time.  Approximately
85% of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  The Company was affected by a labor dispute with its
largest union in fiscal 1993 which was settled with a new four year
contract.   A contract with one large union expires December 31, 1994. 
Most of the Company's competitors in New Jersey are similarly unionized. 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

 While the Company must secure a variety of health and food
distribution permits for the conduct of its business, it does not
believe that such regulation is material to its operations.  The
Company's pharmacy departments are subject to state regulation and
licensed pharmacists must be on duty at all times.  The Company's liquor
operation is also subject to regulation by state and municipal
administrative authorities.  The Company does not presently anticipate
expanding its liquor operations.  Compliance with statutes regulating
the discharge of materials into the environment is not expected to have
a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive
position in fiscal 1995 and 1996.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

 The Company owns the sites of five of its supermarkets (containing
304,000 square feet of total space), all of which are free-standing
stores, except the Egg Harbor store, which is part of a shopping center. 
The Company also owns the site of the former Easton and Maplewood
stores.  The Maplewood property is leased to another operator and the

<PAGE 8>

Easton store is currently being marketed.  The remaining eighteen
supermarkets (containing 792,000 square feet of total space) are leased,
with initial lease terms generally ranging from 20 to 30 years, usually
with renewal options.  Eleven of these leased stores are located in
strip shopping centers and the remaining seven are free-standing stores. 
Except with respect to one lease between the Company and certain related
parties, none of the Company's leases expire before 1997.  The annual
rent, including capitalized leases, for all of the Company's leased
facilities for the year ended July 30, 1994 was approximately
$6,100,000.  The Company is a limited partner in two partnerships, each
of which owns a shopping center in which one of the Company's leased
supermarkets is located.  The Company also is a general partner in a
general partnership that is a lessor of one of the Company's free-
standing supermarkets.

EXHIBIT NO. 28A
                Village Super Market, Inc., Reports Results
            For the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended July 30, 1994



Springfield, NJ - October 6, 1994 - Village Super Market, Inc. reported sales 
and a net loss for the fourth quarter ended July 30, 1994, Perry Sumas, 
President announced today.

In the fourth quarter, sales decreased 7.8% to $187,842,000.  The Company had a
net loss of $249,000 compared to a net loss of $127,000 in the fourth quarter of
the prior year.

In reviewing the quarter, Mr. Sumas reported that the net loss for the quarter
was due to flat same store sales, lower than expected gross margins and 
increased payroll costs.  Sales decreased in the current quarter due to the 
prior year containing a fifteenth week as compared to the current year's 
fourteen weeks and the closing of a store in the current year.  Same store 
sales were flat in the current quarter, despite a comparison to a year ago 
quarter that included a strike at six stores, due to the sluggish economy and 
competitive openings.

For the full year, the net loss was $807,000, which includes an increase to net
income of $400,000 for the cumulative effect of a change in the method of
accounting for income taxes.  This compares with net income in the prior year of
$1,437,000, which included a $1,022,000 gain on the sale of a store.  Sales for
the full year decreased 2.6% to $695,070,000.  The sales decrease is due to the
prior year containing 53 weeks and the impact of closed stores.  Same store 
sales for the year increased 1.3%.  

   The net loss in fiscal 1994 compared to net income in the prior year is
principally attributable to increased promotional spending, chiefly couponing,
in the second and third quarter of this year.  Although the additional 
promotional spending was partially responsible for increased same store sales 
in those quarters, a larger sales increase was expected in order to offset the 
costs of these coupons.  In addition, gross margin percentages were lower than 
expected, fringe benefit and payroll costs increased and a loss was incurred on 
the sale of the Morristown store.  

At July 30, 1994, the Company was not in compliance with certain financial
covenants in its bank agreement and its private placement agreement.  The 
Company expects to receive a waiver of the financial covenant and an amendment 
of its loan agreement with the banks.  The Company is also not in compliance 
with a financial covenant in a debt agreement with another lender.  This does 
not constitute an event of default; however, until this ratio is met or a waiver
obtained, the Company is prevented from borrowing additional funds, declaring
dividends and executing new leases.

EXHIBIT NO. 28B  
                           THIRD QUARTER REPORT

To our shareholders:
        
The Company had a net loss of $1,131,000 in the third quarter ended April 23, 
1994. This compared with net income of $182,000 in the third quarter of the 
prior year. The loss for the quarter was principally attributable to an 
increase in promotional spending, chiefly couponing.  Also contributing to the 
loss in the third quarter were lower than expected gross margins, increased 
fringe benefit costs and an increase in the loss recorded on the sale of the 
Morristown store.

For the first nine months of fiscal 1994, the net loss was $558,000, which 
includes an increase to net income of $400,000 for the cumulative effect of the 
change in the method of accounting for income taxes.  This compares with net 
income in the prior year of $1,563,000, which includes a gain, net of tax, of 
$1,022,000 on the sale of a store.

Sales for the third quarter were $171,776,000, an increase of 1.4% from the 
prior year.  Same store sales increased 2.8% this quarter, which was partially
offset by lower sales from stores closed since one year ago.  Same store sales 
increased in the third quarter as a result of additional promotional spending 
and possibly some improvement in the local economy.  Sales for the nine month 
period were $507,228,000, a slight decrease from the prior year.  Same store 
sales increased 1.7% for the nine months, which was offset by stores closed 
since a year ago.

Gross margins as a percentage of sales for both the quarter and nine month 
period were 24.4% compared with 24.3% in both corresponding prior year periods. 
High levels of sale item penetration and price competition in the marketplace 
have prevented further increases in gross margins.

Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter 
and nine month period were 23.5% and 22.8%, respectively, compared with 22.2% 
in both corresponding prior year periods.  The principal reason for these 
increases was the higher level of promotional spending, chiefly couponing, 
which began in the second quarter and increased further in the third quarter.  
Although the additional promotional spending was partially responsible for the 
increase in same store sales, a larger sales increase was expected in order to 
offset the costs of these coupons. Inclement weather contributed to the lower 
than expected sales and also increased snow removal costs.  In addition, 
fringe benefit costs increased.

A loss of $81,000 on the sale of the Morristown store was recorded in the first
quarter of fiscal 1994.  An additional loss of $300,000 was recorded in the 
current quarter due to the failure of the Company's former sub-lessee to make 
required rent payments.

On March 29, 1994 the Company replaced its expired $20,000,000 revolving/term 
loan agreement with a new $30,000,000 loan agreement with two banks.  The new 
agreement consists of a $10,000,000 term loan, a $12,000,000 revolving loan and 
a $8,000,000 convertible revolving loan.  At April 23, 1994 the only balance 
outstanding on this facility was the $10,000,000 term loan.  The $12,000,000 
revolving loan, which can be used for any purpose except new store 
construction,  matures March 31, 1997.  The $8,000,000 convertible revolving 
loan is to be used  only for capital expenditures and can be used through 
December 31, 1995.

<PAGE 22>

At April 23, 1994, the Company did not meet financial ratios required by the 
above debt agreement and an additional debt agreement with a total of three 
lenders.  This constitutes and event of default under these agreements.  The 
Company is engaged in discussions with these lenders regarding this situation.  
Without the consent of the two banks, the Company will not be allowed to borrow 
under the $8,000,000 convertible revolving loan portion of the credit facility 
described above.  Without a waiver from another lender, the Company would be pre
vented from borrowing additional funds, executing new leases or declaring 
dividends.  
As a result of the events of default described above, the Company has 
reclassified $22,100,000 of long-term debt as a current liability in the April 
23, 1994 balance sheet.  There is no indication at this time that any of the 
three lenders intend to request immediate payment of these amounts.
The Company is currently in the process of remodeling two stores.  A remodel and
expansion of an additional store is planned to begin shortly.  A planned 
expenditure for 1994 had been the purchase of land for a new superstore.  
As this store has not yet received planning board approval, this expenditure has
been rescheduled for fiscal 1995.

                                         Respectfully,

Dear Fellow Shareholders

     Fiscal 1994 was a disappointment. We suffered a net loss before an
accounting change of $1,206,690, or $.42 per share. Sales decreased 2.6% to
$695,070,272 due to two store closings and one less week in this fiscal year.
     A major portion of the loss was attributable to increased promotional
spending, mostly coupons, in the second and third quarters. Although this
spending increase was partly responsible for increased same store sales in those
quarters, a larger sales increase was expected to offset the coupon costs. The
sluggish economy, new competitive entries and inclement weather last winter
limited the annual same store sales increase to 1.3% despite the higher
promotional spending. Also contributing to the net loss for the year were lower
than expected gross margins, increased fringe benefit and payroll costs and a
loss on closing the Morristown store.
     We expect a slight decline in same store sales in fiscal 1995 due to 
current and anticipated competitive openings. Despite this, we intend to 
improve our performance in 1995. We are reviewing all of our business activities
in an effort to reduce our cost structure and increase customer satisfaction.
     What have we done so far? We closed our Easton store in August. This is the
fifth underfacilitated, unprofitable store we have closed in three years. We
re-evaluated the effectiveness of our advertising and coupon programs and made
adjustments where appropriate to reduce our overall promotional costs. We
recently reduced our supervisory headcount. We have redeployed floor space in 
two stores by closing unprofitable departments and are evaluating several 
departments in other stores. We continue to seek more effective utilization of 
store hours worked to satisfy customer needs, and have seen some improvement in 
operating efficiencies in recent months.
     We continue to utilize our investment in technology to better satisfy
customers as well as to achieve efficiencies. We completed the rollout of debit
and credit card payment options at all of our ShopRite stores this year. Over 
10% of our sales dollars are now paid for by customers with the convenience of a
credit or debit card.
     ShopRite began using Clip Less coupons this spring. Customers need only
present their free Price Plus card to receive the value of our coupons no more
cutting out coupons. In addition to being more customer friendly, Clip Less
coupons are more efficient for us to process.
     We are currently in the process of converting our customers' separate Price
Plus and check-cashing cards to a single, more convenient Universal card. In
addition to customer convenience, the new Universal card provides us with
improved ability to limit the acceptance of bad checks. Ten stores have begun to
use computer generated ordering, which is designed to reduce inventory levels 
and out of stock conditions, enhance shelf space utilization and reduce labor 
costs.
     We recently completed a major expansion and remodel of the Stirling store
and smaller improvements at the Hillsborough and Somers Point stores. Major
expansions of the Chester and Absecon stores are scheduled for fiscal 1995.
     We thank our employees for their efforts in working through our current
problems and we thank our shareholders for their support.


James Sumas,                                  Perry Sumas,
Chairman of the Board                         President

     Sales decreased $18,786,000 in fiscal 1994. Sales decreased $13,100,000
as a result of the prior year containing 53 weeks. The sale of the Morristown 
and Kingston stores caused decreased sales of $13,900,000. Offsetting these 
declines, was a same store sales increase of 1.3%. Although same store sales 
increased in the middle part of the fiscal year due to increased promotional 
spending, the sluggish economy and new competitive entries held same store sales
flat in the fourth quarter. Sales decreased $1,200,000 in fiscal 1993. The sales
of the Kingston and Maplewood stores in early fiscal 1993 resulted in decreased 
sales of $28,400,000. A two week labor dispute at six stores reduced sales by
approximately $2,300,000.  These decreases were offset by an increase in sales 
of $13,100,000 as fiscal year 1993 contained fifty-three weeks. In addition, a 
full years operation of the Elizabeth store, opened in December 1991, resulted
in increased sales of $16,100,000. Same store sales were flat in 1993 due to the
sluggish economy and increased competition. 
     Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly in fiscal 1994 as
a result of aggressive buying practices. High levels of sale item penetration 
and price competition in the marketplace prevented further increases in gross
margins in fiscal 1994, and caused margins to decline in fiscal 1993.
     Operating and administrative expenses in fiscal 1994 were slightly lower 
due to store closings and one less week of operations but increased by .46 as a
percentage of sales. Approximately half of this increase was due to higher 
levels of promotional spending, chiefly coupons, in the middle part of the year.
Although this additional promotional spending was partially responsible for the
increase in same store sales, a larger sales increase was expected in order to
offset the cost of these coupons. Inclement weather contributed to the lower
than expected sales and also increased snow removal costs. In addition, workers'
compensation, health care and payroll costs increased. Operating and
administrative expenses in fiscal 1993 were approximately the same as the prior
year in both dollar and percentage of sales terms. Increased costs for health
care, workers' compensation and costs associated with the labor dispute were
offset by reduced supply and rental costs. Payroll costs, excluding benefits,
were the same as the prior year as contractual increases under collective 
bargain agreements were offset by reductions in hours worked due to operating
efficiencies.
     Interest expense decreased in 1994 and 1993 due to declining debt levels 
and lower interest rates.
     The Company continuously reviews its portfolio of stores to determine which
should be improved upon and which no longer fit the Company's plans. 
Accordingly, the equipment and leasehold of the Morristown store was sold on 
October 6, 1993 for $87,000 plus the cost of inventory. A loss of $354,000 was 
recorded in fiscal 1994 to reflect store operations through the date of closing,
the effect of the sale transaction and a reserve for estimated future rental 
payments due as a result of the failure of the Company's former sublessee to 
make required rent payments. The Easton store was closed on August 30, 1994. The
Company expects to sell or lease this Company owned property during fiscal 
1995. The Kingston and Maplewood stores were sold in early fiscal 1993 for net 
proceeds of $2,234,000, plus the cost of inventory. A gain in the amount of 
$1,696,000 before taxes was realized on these transactions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

     Sales were not materially effected by inflation in 1994 and 1993. The
Company has historically been able to pass along  inflationary increases in 
its direct product costs through increased selling prices. However, operating 
and administrative costs, particularly payroll and fringe benefits, have 
continued to increase in recent years despite the lack of inflation in food 
prices. The competitive climate has prevented the Company from increasing gross 
margins to compensate for increased operating costs. As a result, the Company 
has experienced declining profitability in the last few years. A continuation of
the current trend of increased price competition, higher wage and benefit 
costs and a sluggish economy could prevent the Company from increasing its 
operating margins and profitability.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     Current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4,100,000, $2,303,000 and
$3,617,000 at the end of fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Working
capital ratios at the same dates were .90, .95  and .92 to one. The Company's 
working capital needs are reduced by its high rate of inventory turnover 
(twenty times in fiscal 1994) and because the warehousing and distribution 
arrangements accorded to the Company as a member of Wakefern permit it to 
minimize inventory levels. The Starn's stores generate greater sales during the 
summer months due to their location in the southern shore region of New Jersey. 
This seasonality serves to offset the slight decline in sales experienced 
during the summer months by the majority of the Company's other stores, 
resulting in a more level distribution of working capital requirements 
throughout the year.
     Capital expenditures in 1994 were $5,974,000. The major expenditure was the
expansion and remodel of the Stirling store. The remainder of capital
expenditures included smaller expansions of the Hillsborough and Somers Point 
stores. The Company has budgeted approximately $8,000,000 for capital 
expenditures in fiscal 1995.  The major planned expenditures are the 
expansion and remodel of the Chester store and the beginning of the expansion 
of the Absecon store. The Company expects to finance these expenditures through 
internally generated funds and borrowing under its credit facility.
     The Company has historically financed capital expenditures through cash
provided by operations supplemented by bank borrowings. Aggregate capital
expenditures for the three years ended July 30, 1994 were $22,445,000. During
the same period of time, net long-term borrowings decreased by $2,615,000. The
ability to finance expansion through operational cash flow is reflected in the
ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization, which is currently 41.3%, 
slightly lower than three years ago.
     On March 29, 1994 the Company replaced its expired $20,000,000 revolving/
term loan agreement with a new loan agreement with two banks. The new 
agreement consists of a $10,000,000 term loan and a $12,000,000 revolving loan. 
At July 30, 1994 the Company did not meet the interest coverage ratio required 
under this agreement. On October 21, 1994, the Company obtained a waiver of the 
covenant violation and an amendment of the loan agreement. The Company believes 
that it will be in compliance with these modified covenants for the remaining 
term of the agreement. 
     At July 30, 1994, the Company did not meet a cash flow-to-fixed charge
coverage ratio contained in two other debt agreements with one lender. This does
not constitute an event of default. However, until this ratio is met or unless a
waiver is obtained, the agreements prevent the Company from borrowing additional
funds (other than the Company's revolving loan), declaring dividends and 
executing new leases.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 _ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of consolidation
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Village 
Super Market, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. 
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Fiscal year
     The Company and its subsidiaries utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on
the last Saturday in the month of July. Fiscal 1993 contains 53 weeks. Fiscal
1994 and 1992 contain 52 weeks.
Industry segment
     The Company consists of one operating segment, the retail sale of food and
non-food products.
Reclassifications
     Certain amounts have been reclassified in the 1993 and 1992 financial
statements to conform to the 1994 financial statement presentation.
Cash and cash equivalents
     Cash and cash equivalents includes interest bearing, overnight deposits 
with Wakefern in the amount of $5,200,000 and $4,800,000 at July 30, 1994 and 
July 31,1993, respectively.
Merchandise inventories
     Merchandise inventories are carried at cost, which is not in excess of
market. Cost is determined as follows:
     Grocery and non-foods _ last-in, first-out (LIFO) (retail less departmental
gross profit mark-up).
     Meat and all other perishables _ first-in, first-out (FIFO).
     Dairy, frozen foods and liquor _ FIFO (retail less departmental gross 
profit mark-up).
Property, equipment and fixtures
     Property, equipment and fixtures are recorded at cost. Interest cost
incurred to finance construction is capitalized as part of such cost. 
Renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expenses
as incurred.
     Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives of thirty years for buildings, ten years for store fixtures and equipment,
and three years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over ten 
years. Capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of
the related lease term or the economic lives of the related assets.
     When assets are sold or retired, their cost and accumulated depreciation 
are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the 
financial statements.
Store opening and closing costs
     All store opening costs are expensed as incurred. Provisions are made for
losses resulting from store closings at the time of closing.
Leases
     Leases which meet certain criteria are classified as capital leases, and
assets and liabilities are recorded at amounts equal to the lesser of the 
present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased 
properties at the inception of the respective leases. Such assets are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the related lease terms or the 
economic lives of the related assets. Amounts representing interest expense 
relating to the lease obligations are recorded to affect constant rates of 
interest over the terms of the leases. Leases which do not qualify as capital 
leases are classified as operating leases, and related rentals are charged to 
expense as incurred. 
Goodwill
     Goodwill arising after October 31, 1970 is being amortized over forty 
years. The Company does not amortize goodwill amounting to approximately 
$2,900,000 acquired prior to October 31, 1970 since, in management's opinion, 
the value of such intangibles has not diminished. Accumulated amortization of
goodwill amounted to $2,274,250 and $2,007,970 at July 30, 1994 and July 31, 
1993, respectively.
Other intangibles
     Other intangibles include the fair value of a favorable lease and 
trademarks acquired in a business acquisition. Other intangibles are being 
amortized over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of other intangibles amounted
to $2,029,999 and $1,776,249 at July 30, 1994 and July 31, 1993, respectively.
Income taxes
     Effective August 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," (SFAS 109) which
requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on 
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect. As permitted by SFAS 
109, the Company has elected not to restate the financial statements of any 
prior periods.

NOTE 1 _ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Net income (loss) per share
     Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by 
the weighted average number of all common shares outstanding during the periods
presented which was 2,909,876 in 1994, 1993 and 1992. Stock options are not
included in the calculation as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive or would
not result in a material dilution of net income (loss) per share.


NOTE 2 _ INVENTORIES

     Merchandise inventories are comprised as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                   July 30,       July 31,

</TABLE>

     If the FIFO method of inventory accounting had been used rather than LIFO,
inventories would have been   $6,467,653 and $5,811,307 higher than reported in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Interest cost capitalized amounted to $200,000 in 1992 (none in 1994 and
1993).

NOTE 4 _ RELATED PARTY INFORMATION
     The Company's investment in its principal supplier, Wakefern Food Corp.
("Wakefern"), which is operated on a cooperative basis for its stockholder
members, is less than 20% of the outstanding shares of Wakefern. The investment
is pledged as collateral for any obligations to Wakefern. In addition, this 
obligation is personally guaranteed by the principal shareholders of the 
Company. The Company is obligated to purchase 85% of its primary merchandise 
requirements from Wakefern until ten years from the date that stockholders 
representing 75% of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders 
request the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be terminated.
     The Company's merchandise purchases from Wakefern approximated 
$490,447,000, $489,658,000 and $484,516,000 during fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 
1992, respectively. Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each 
member a share of earnings of Wakefern in proportion to the dollar volume of 
business done by the member with Wakefern during the year. Patronage dividends, 
which are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales, amounted to approximately 
1.1% of sales in 1994, 1.0% in 1993 and .9% in 1992.

NOTE 4 _ RELATED PARTY INFORMATION (continued)
     Wakefern has increased from time to time the required investment in its
common stock for each supermarket owned by a member, with the exact amount per 
store computed in accordance with a formula based on the volume of each store's
purchases from Wakefern. As a result, the Company is required to invest 
approximately $1,065,000 over approximately the next four years. The Company 
will receive additional shares of common stock to the extent paid for at the 
end of each fiscal year (September 30) of Wakefern calculated at the then book 
value of such shares.  The payments together with any stock issued thereunder, 
at the option of Wakefern, may be null and void and all payments on this 
subscription shall become the property of Wakefern in the event the Company 
does not complete the payment of this subscription in a timely manner.

     On March 29, 1994 the Company entered into a new loan agreement with two
banks. The agreement consists of a $10,000,000 term loan and a $12,000,000
revolving loan. The $12,000,000 revolving loan, which can be used for any 
purpose except new store construction, matures March 31, 1997 and carries 
interest at prime plus .5%.
     At July 30, 1994 the Company did not meet the interest coverage ratio
required under this agreement. However, on October 21, 1994 the covenant 
violation was waived and the agreement amended to lower the covenant 
requirements for the remainder of the agreement. In addition to interest 
coverage requirements, this agreement also contains restrictive covenants 
which,  among other matters, specify total debt levels, maintenance of net 
worth, cash flow coverage ratios, limitation on payment of dividends and 
limitation of capital expenditures.
     At July 30, 1994 the Company did not meet a cash flow-to-fixed charge
coverage ratio contained in two other debt agreements with one lender. This 
does not constitute an event of default. However, until this ratio is met or
unless a waiver is obtained, the agreements prevent the Company from borrowning 
additional funds (other than under the Company's revolving loan), declaring 
dividends and executing new leases.
     Interest paid amounted to $4,095,616, $4,496,835 and $5,212,971 in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 6 _ INCOME TAXES
     Effective August 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 (see note 1). 
The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 as of August 1, 1993 was to 
decrease net loss by $400,000 ($.14 per share). There was no effect of the 
change in accounting on pretax income for the year ended July 30, 1994. The 
components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are:

</TABLE>
     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company's deferred tax liabilites and assets as of July 30, 1994 are as 
follows:

<TABLE>

     Deferred tax liabilities:
     <S>                                      <C>

     Total deferred tax assets                 3,450,967

     Net deferred tax liability               $4,010,332

</TABLE>
     
     A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that 
some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In management's 
opinion, in view of the Company's previous, current and projected taxable 
income, such tax assets will more likely than not be fully realized. 
Accordingly, no valuation allowance was deemed to be required upon adoption and
at July 30, 1994.
     The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax
rate as follows:

<TABLE>

                                         1994      1993     1992

     Effective income tax rate          (37.7%)   39.3%     39.0%     

</TABLE>
     During 1993 and 1992, deferred income taxes were provided for significant
timing differences in the recognition of expenses for tax and financial 
statement purposes. The principal components of deferred tax expense (benefit) 
in 1993 and 1992 are depreciation 1993_$(354,000) and 1992_$(250,000) and 
accrued liabilities 1993_$128,000 and 1992_$(374,000). 

     The Company has approximately $900,000 of alternative minimum tax credits
that may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has approximately 
$200,000 of targeted jobs tax credits and $275,000 of net operating losses 
that can be carried forward fifteen years.

     Income taxes paid amounted to approximately $192,000, $1,917,000 and
$1,005,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 7 _ LONG-TERM LEASES

Description of leasing arrangements
     The Company conducts a major part of its operations from leased facilities,
with the majority of initial lease terms ranging from 20 to 30 years. All of the
Company's leases expire through fiscal 2059.
     Most of the Company's leases contain renewal options of five years each.
These options enable the Company to retain the use of facilities in desirable
operating areas. Management expects that in the normal course of business, 
leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. The Company is obligated
under all leases to pay for utilities and liability insurance, and under 
certain leases to pay additional rentals based on real estate taxes, 
maintenance, insurance and a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated 
amounts.
     Future minimum lease payments by year and in the aggregate for all
non-cancelable leases with initial terms of one year or more consisted of the
following at July 30, 1994:

Related party leases
     The Company currently leases three supermarkets and its office facility 
from realty firms partly or wholly-owned by officers of the Company. The 
Company paid aggregate rentals under these leases, including minimum rent and 
contingent rent, of approximately $1,215,000, $1,039,000 and $1,249,000 for 
fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. In addition, three supermarkets 
are leased from partnerships in which the Company is a partner.

NOTE 8 _ COMMON STOCK

     Class A common stock has one vote per share and is entitled to cash
dividends as declared 54% greater than those paid on the Class B common stock. 
Class B common stock has ten votes per share. Class B common stock is not 
transferable except to another holder of Class B common stock or by will or 
under the laws of intestacy or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation approving the transfer. Shares of Class B common 
stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis for Class A common stock.

     The Company has an Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan under which
both incentive and nonstatutory options to purchase up to 150,000 shares of the
Company's Class A common stock may be granted to officers and employees of the
Company as designated by the Board of Directors. The plan requires incentive
stock options to be granted at an exercise price equaling the fair market 
value of the Company's stock at the date of grant (110% if the optionee holds 
more than 10% of the voting stock of the Company), while nonstatutory options 
may be granted at an exercise price less than market value. All options granted 
to date are at an exercise price equal to the fair value at the date of grant. 
All options outstanding at July 30, 1994 expire on December 6, 1997. There were 
no transactions in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992. There are 130,000 options 
outstanding and exercisable at an average price of $8.00 at July 30, 1994.

NOTE 9 _ PENSION PLANS

     The Company sponsors three defined benefit pension plans covering
administrative personnel and members of two unions. Employees covered under the
administrative pension benefit plan earn benefits based upon percentages of
annual compensation. Employees covered under the union pension benefit plans 
earn benefits based on a fixed amount for each year of service. The Company's
funding policy is to pay at least the minimum contribution required by the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

     Net periodic pension cost for the three plans included the following
components:

NOTE 10 _ COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is under contract to purchase a tract of land, contingent upon
receiving all approvals, on which it plans to construct a superstore.
     The Company is involved in litigation incidental to the normal course of
business. Company management is of the opinion that insurance coverage is
adequate and final disposition should not materially affect the consolidated 
financial position of the Company.

               AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO LOAN AGREEMENT

     
         This Amendment No. 1 to Loan Agreement ("Amendment") is made
as of October 21, 1994 by and among NEW JERSEY NATIONAL BANK, a New Jersey
banking corporation having its principal place of business at 51 John F. Kennedy
Parkway, Short Hills, New Jersey 07078 ("NJNB"), CHEMICAL BANK NEW JERSEY,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association having an office at East 36
Midland Avenue, Paramus, New Jersey 07652 ("CBNJ", each of CBNJ and NJNB
individually a "Bank" and collectively the "Banks"); NJNB, as agent for the 
Banks (the "Agent") and VILLAGE SUPER MARKET, INC., a New Jersey corporation 
having its principal place of business at 733 Mountain Avenue, Springfield, 
New Jersey 07081 (the "Borrower").

WITNESSETH:

     Background and Purpose.  Pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated March 29, 
1994 (the "Original Agreement", the Original Agreement as the Letter Agreement
and this Amendment No. 1 is referred to as the "Loan Agreement"), the Banks 
agreed to provide to the Borrower a Revolving Loan, a Team Loan and a 
Convertible Revolving Loan in the original aggregate principal am of up to 
$30,000,000, all as further described in the Original Agreement Borrower has 
defaulted under the Loan Agreement, entitling the Banks payment of the Loan.  
Borrower has now requested that the Bank waive such defaults and amend the 
Original Agreement, as the Borrower is currently projecting additional breaches 
absent this Amendment.  The Banks are willing to amend the Original Agreement 
as requested by Borrower on the terms set forth herein.  Section 12.2 of the 
Loan Agreement provides that any amendment thereto must be in writing and signed
by a duly authorized officer of each Bank.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual covenants and representation herein contained, the parties hereto
agree to modify and amend the Original Agreement as follows:

         1.  DEFINITIONS.  

         The following definitions set forth in Section I of the
Original Agreement are hereby amended and restated in their entirety as follows:

              (a)  "Loan Agreement" shall mean the
         Original Agreement, as it may be amended or supplemented
         from time to time, including but not limited to the
         amendment set forth in the Letter Agreement and this
         Amendment No. 1.
    
              (b)  "Loan Document(s)" mean the Loan
         Agreement (including the Letter Agreement and this Amendment
         No. 1 and any other amendments thereto) and all documents,
         notes, assignments, certificates and agreements of any kind
         listed, described or referenced by the Closing Memorandum
         annexed to the Original Agreement as Exhibit A, or in this
         Amendment No. 1 or otherwise executed in connection with the
         Original Agreement, this Amendment or any future amendment.

<PAGE 2>
For purposes of this Amendment No. 1, "Letter Agreement" means the letter
agreement among the Borrower and the Banks dated July 7, 1994 arising from
defaults by Borrower in the April 1994 Fiscal Quarter. 

         2.  WAIVERS.  The Banks hereby waive the following known
defaults of Borrower:  (a) a breach of the Tangible Net Worth covenant as at
October 1994 provided for at Section 7.11(b) of the Loan Agreement (based upon
the Borrower's representation to the Banks and the Agent that its Tangible Net
Worth at the end of October 1994 will be approximately $38,000,000), (b) a
breach of the EBIT/Interest Ratio Covenant as of April and July 1994 provided
for in Section 7.13 of the Loan Agreement, PROVIDED HOWEVER, the Banks do not
hereby waive and do not hereby make any commitment to waive, any other default
(if any) of the terms and conditions of the Original Agreement as amended by
this Amendment No. 1 nor as to any time period subsequent to the period
ending October 29, 1994 and the Borrower has no expectation of any such
waiver.  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any prior waivers by the 
Banks of Events of Default by Borrower shall afford the Borrower no 
expectation whatsoever that the Banks will be willing to waive or to consider
the waiver of any Events of Default arising after the date hereof.  

         3.  AMENDED COVENANTS.  (a)  Section 7.13 of the Original
Agreement is hereby amended by modifying and restating that section of the
Original Agreement in its entirety as follows:
    
              "7.13  EBIT to Interest Ratio.  As to the
    Companies on a consolidated basis, maintain an EBIT to Interest Ratio
    measured as of the end of each Fiscal Quarter of at least the following
    ratio for the Fiscal Quarters listed below:

One and Twenty Five Hundredths to One
(1.25:1);      (C)  October 1994 Fifty Five Hundredths to One

(1.07:1);      (G)  October 1995 One and Nine Hundredths to One
(1.09:1);      (H)  January 1996 One and Eleven Hundredths to One
(1:11:1);      (I)  April 1996 One and Thirteen Hundredths to One

<PAGE 3>
(1:13:1);      (J)  July and October 1996 and January and April 1997
									           One and Fifteen Hundredths to One
(1:15:1);      (K)  July and October 1997 and January and April 1998
                    One and Twenty Two Hundredths to One
(1:22:1);      (L)  July 1998 and each Fiscal Quarter thereafter
                    One and Twenty Five Hundredths to One (1.25:1)."     


              (b)  Section 8.13 of the Original Agreement is hereby 
amended by modifying and restating that section of the Original Agreement 
in its entirety as follows:
    
              "8.13  Capital Expenditures.  Permit the
    aggregate sum of the consolidated Capital Expenditures of the Companies
    made in any Fiscal Year listed below to exceed the following amounts:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
    
                                                 Maximum Amount of 
                                                 Aggregate Capital
                                                 Expenditures for      
    Fiscal Year Ending                           for Fiscal Year   
    <S>                                          <C>
    July 1994                                    $12,500,000
    July 1995                                      8,000,000  
    July 1996                                      7,000,000
    July 1997                                      6,000,000
    July 1998 or thereafter                        6,000,000

</TABLE>
     
    provided, however, that for Fiscal Year 1997 and thereafter, the Borrower
    may submit a Capital Expenditure budget for more than $6 million to the
    Banks, which may become the Capital Expenditure Budget for such Fiscal Year
    after approval by the Banks in their absolute and unfettered discretion. 
    Furthermore, to the extent that the Companies' Capital Expenditures in any
    Fiscal Year, commencing with the Fiscal Year ending July 1995, are less
    than the amounts set forth above, the "unused amounts" (the excess of the
    permitted amount of Capital Expenditures for such Fiscal Year above the
    Companies' actual Capital Expenditures for such Fiscal Year) may be rolled
    over into the next Fiscal Year only, thereby increasing the Capital
    Expenditures permitted for the next Fiscal Year (but not for any other
    subsequent Fiscal Year).  

              (c)  The Borrower has been negotiating to
    acquire a certain property in Westfield, New Jersey (the "Westfield
    Property").  At the Borrower's request, the Banks agree that, if the
    Borrower acquires the Westfield Property on terms previously disclosed to
    the Banks, the amount paid for the acquisition of the Westfield Property
    will not be counted or included for purposes of determining compliance with
    the Capital Expenditure covenant of Section 8.13, as amended herein.  The
    Borrower agrees that capital expenditures related to the Westfield

<PAGE 4>

    Property, if any, other than the initial acquisition of the real estate,
    would be subject to the Capital Expenditure limitations of Section 8.13.

         4.  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.  (a) Section 2.12 of the Original
Agreement is hereby amended to increase the interest rate on the Revolving Loan
by twenty-five (25) Basis Points by modifying and restating that section of the
Original Agreement in its entirety as follows:

         "2.12     Interest Rates For Revolving Loan.
    
         The Borrower agrees to pay interest on the unpaid portion of
    Revolving Loans as follows:
    
              (A)  for Prime Loans at a fluctuating rate equal to the Prime
    Rate in effect from time to time plus Fifty (50) Basis Points.
    
The increased interest rate shall be effective immediately as of the date of 
this Amendment No. 1.

         (b)  Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Borrower agreed that its
right to request Convertible Revolving Loans, and the Banks' obligation to make
advances under Section IV of the Original Agreement, was terminated.  The
Borrower and the Banks hereby reconfirm that Section IV of the Original 
Agreement is deleted and of no further force or effect.

         (c)  Notwithstanding anything in the Original Agreement to the
contrary, including but not limited to Sections 2.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.12, or 5.8, the
use by Borrower of the Eurodollar Rate is suspended, the Borrower shall have no
right and no ability to make Eurodollar Loans or to elect to have the Eurodollar
Rate apply to any loan or borrowing without the prior written consent of both
Banks, which consent may be given or denied at the sole and unfettered 
discretion of each Bank.  The Borrower understands and agrees that neither
Bank expects to consent to any Eurodollar Loan or to the use of the
Eurodollar Rate in the foreseeable future.

         (d)  Within ten (10) days of the date hereof, the Company shall
deliver to the Agent and the Banks the  Company's audited financial statements
for the year ended July 29, 1994.  The Company represents and warrants to the
Agent and the Banks that such audited financial statements shall be consistent
with estimates of the Company's net income and net worth previously given to the
Agent and the Banks.

         5.  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT.  This Amendment shall become effective on
the date that the Agent and Banks shall have received each of the following, in
form and substance satisfactory to the Banks, the Agent and its counsel:

              (a)  The Amendment.  The Amendment duly executed, and
    delivered to the Agent and the Banks;

    legal fees and other costs incurred by the Agent in connection with the

    Agreement;
    
              (c)  Waiver Fee.  Payment of a waiver fee of $20,000 to the
    Agent (which fee shall be paid by the Agent $10,000 to NJNB and $10,000 to

              (d)  Traveler's.  A letter from the chief financial officer of
