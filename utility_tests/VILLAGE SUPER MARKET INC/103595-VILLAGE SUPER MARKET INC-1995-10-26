                                  Part I

                             ITEM I.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     The Company operates a chain of 21 ShopRite supermarkets, 15 of which are
located in northern New Jersey, 1 of which is in north-eastern Pennsylvania and 
5 of which are in the southern shore area of New Jersey.  

      In addition, the Company operates two former ShopRite stores  under a
"Village Market" format as described below.  The Company's membership in 
Wakefern Food Corporation ("Wakefern"), the nation's largest retailer owned food
cooperative and owner of the ShopRite name, provides the Company many of the
economies of scale in purchasing, distribution and advertising associated with
chains of greater size and geographic reach. 

     The Company believes that the regional nature of its business and the
continuity of its management under the leadership of its founding family have
permitted the Company to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness to
the demographic characteristics of the communities served by its stores.

      The Company seeks to generate high sales volume by offering a wide variety
of high quality products at consistently low prices. The Company attempts to
efficiently utilize its selling space, gives continuing attention to the decor
and format of its stores and tailors each store's product mix to the preferences
of the local community. The Company concentrates on development of superstores,
which, in addition to their larger size (an average of 50,000 total square feet,
including office and storage space, compared with an average of 30,000 total
square feet for conventional supermarkets), feature such higher margin specialty
service departments as an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen, a fresh
seafood section and, in most cases, a prescription pharmacy.  Superstores also
offer an expanded selection of higher margin non-food items such as cut flowers,
health and beauty aids, greeting cards, videocassette rentals and small
appliances. Two recent superstores also include a warehouse section featuring
products in giant sizes.  The following table shows the percentage of the
Company's sales allocable to various product categories during each of the
periods indicated as well as the number of the Company's superstores and
percentage of selling square feet allocable to these stores during each of these
periods:

</TABLE>

      Because of its increased size and broader product mix, a superstore can
satisfy a greater percentage of a customer's weekly shopping needs and, as a
result, the typical superstore generally has a higher volume of sales per square
foot and sales per customer than a conventional supermarket.  In addition,
because of their greater total sales volume and increased percentage of their
sales allocable to higher margin items, superstores generally operate more
profitably than conventional supermarkets.

      A variety of factors affect the profitability of each of the Company's
stores including local competitors, size, access and parking, lease terms,
management supervision, and the strength of the ShopRite trademark in the local
community.  The Company continually evaluates individual stores to decide 
whether they should be closed.  Accordingly, the Orange, Maplewood, Kingston, 
Morristown and Easton stores have been closed since December 1991.  In 
addition, two stores were converted to a "Village Market" format designed to 
reduce costs and increase margins in lower volume locations. 

      The Company operates a separate liquor store adjacent to one Company
supermarket.

DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION

      The Company is engaged in a continuing program to upgrade and expand its
supermarket chain. This program has included major store remodelings as well as
the opening or acquisition of additional stores.  When remodeling, the Company
has sought, whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its
stores and, where feasible within existing site limitations, to convert
conventional supermarkets to superstores. The Company completed one major
expansion and remodel in fiscal 1995. The Company has budgeted $8,000,000 for
capital expenditures in fiscal 1996. The major planned expenditures are the
expansion and remodel of the Absecon store and the beginning of the expansion of
the Livingston store.

      In the last five years, the Company has added one new store and completed
five remodels. The Company's goal has been to open an  average of one new
superstore and conduct a major remodel of one store each year. However, because
of delays associated with increased governmental regulations, including sewage
moratoriums and  environmental cleanup regulations effecting sites and the lack
of recent activity by real estate developers, the Company has been unable to 
open the desired number of new stores.  Additional store  remodelings and sites 
for new stores are in various stages of development.  The Company will also 
consider additional acquisitions should appropriate opportunities arise.


WAKEFERN

      The Company is the second largest member of Wakefern (owning 16.8% of
Wakefern's outstanding stock) and two of the Company's principal shareholders
were founders of Wakefern. Wakefern, which was organized in 1946, is the 
nation's largest retailer-owned food cooperative. There are presently 32 
individual member companies and 183 supermarkets which comprise the Wakefern 
cooperative. Only Wakefern and member companies are entitled to use the 
ShopRite name and trademark, purchase their product requirements and 
participate in ShopRite advertising and promotional programs and its 
computerized purchasing, warehousing and distribution services.

      The principal benefits to the Company from its relationship with Wakefern
are the use of the ShopRite name and trademark, volume purchasing, ShopRite
private label products, distribution and warehousing on a cooperative basis, and
ShopRite advertising and promotional programs. The Company believes that the
ShopRite name is widely recognized by its customers and is a factor in those
customers' decisions about where to shop. In addition, Wakefern can purchase
large quantities and varieties of products at favorable prices which it can then
pass on to its members. These benefits are important to the Company's success.

      Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each of its stockholders
a share of the earnings of Wakefern in proportion to the dollar volume of
business done by the stockholder with Wakefern during each fiscal year.

      While Wakefern has a substantial professional staff, it operates as a
member cooperative.  Executives of most members make contributions of time to 
the business of Wakefern. Senior executives of the Company spend a significant 
amount of their time working on various Wakefern committees which oversee and 
direct Wakefern purchases and other programs.

      Most of the Company's advertising is developed and placed by Wakefern's
professional advertising staff. Wakefern is responsible for all television, 
radio and major newspaper advertisements. Wakefern bills its members by various
formulas which distribute advertising costs in accordance with the estimated
proportional benefits to each member from such advertising. The Company also
places Wakefern developed materials with local newspapers.

     Wakefern operates warehouses and distribution facilities in Elizabeth, New
Jersey; Dayton, New Jersey; Wallkill, New York; and South Brunswick, New Jersey.
Each member is obligated to purchase from Wakefern a minimum of 85% of its
requirements for products offered by Wakefern until ten years from the date that
stockholders representing 75% of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those
stockholders request the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be terminated.  If this
purchase obligation is not met, the member is required to pay Wakefern's profit
contribution shortfall attributable to this failure. This agreement also makes
unapproved changes in control of the Company and sale of the Company or of
individual Company stores, except to a qualified successor, financially
prohibitive by requiring the Company in such cases to pay Wakefern the profit
contribution shortfall attributable to the sale of store or change in control.
Such payments were waived by Wakefern in connection with the sale of the Orange,
Maplewood, Kingston and Morristown stores.  A "qualified successor" must be or
agree to become a member of Wakefern and may not own or operate any supermarkets
other than ShopRite supermarkets, in the states of New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine or the District of Columbia or own or
operate more than 25 non-ShopRite supermarkets in any other locations in the
United States.  

     Wakefern, under circumstances specified in its bylaws, may refuse to sell
merchandise to, and may repurchase the Wakefern stock of, any member.  Such
circumstances include certain unapproved transfers by a member of its 
supermarket business or its capital stock in Wakefern, unapproved acquisition 
by a member of certain supermarket or grocery wholesale supply businesses, 
the material breach by a member of any provision of the bylaws of Wakefern or 
any agreement with Wakefern or a determination by Wakefern that the continued 
supplying of merchandise or services to such member would adversely affect 
Wakefern.

     Any material change in Wakefern's method of operation or a termination or
material modification of the Company's relationship with Wakefern following
expiration of the above agreements or otherwise (none of which are contemplated
or considered likely) might have an adverse impact on the conduct of the
Company's business and could involve additional expense for the Company.  The
failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations under these agreements
or a member's insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased
costs to remaining members.

     Wakefern owns and operates 22 supermarkets. The Company believes that
Wakefern may consider purchasing additional stores in the future from non-
members and from existing members who may desire to sell their stores for 
financial, estate planning or other reasons. The Company also understands that 
Wakefern may consider opening and operating new ShopRite supermarkets as well.

     Wakefern does not prescribe geographical franchise areas to its members. 
The specific locations at which the Company, other members of Wakefern or
Wakefern itself may open new units under the ShopRite name are, however, 
subject to the approval of Wakefern's Site Development Committee. This 
committee is composed of persons who are not employees or members of Wakefern 
and from whose decision to deny a site application may be appealed to the 
Wakefern Board of Directors. Wakefern assists its members in their site 
selection by providing appropriate demographic data, volume projections and 
projections of the impact of the proposed market on existing member supermarkets
in the area.

     Each member's Wakefern stock (including the Company's) is pledged to
Wakefern to secure all of that member's obligations to Wakefern.  Moreover, 
every owner of 5% or more of the voting stock of a member (including five 
members of the Sumas family) must personally guarantee prompt payment of all 
amounts due Wakefern from that member.  Wakefern does not own any securities 
of the Company or its subsidiaries.

     Each of Wakefern's members is required to make capital contributions to
Wakefern based on the number of stores operated by that member (and to a limited
extent the sales volume generated by those stores).  As additional stores are
opened or acquired by a member (including the Company), additional capital must
be contributed by it to Wakefern.  On occasion, as its business needs have
required, Wakefern has increased the per-store capital contributions required of
its members.  Wakefern has in the past permitted these increases in required
capital to be paid in installments over a period of time.  The Company is
required to invest approximately $820,000 over approximately the next three
years. 

TECHNOLOGY

     The Company considers automation and computerization important to its
operations and competitive position.  All stores have scanning checkout systems
that improve pricing accuracy, enhance productivity and reduce checkout time for
customers.  Over the last several years, the company installed IBM RS/6000
computers and satellite communications in each store.  Using the RS/6000 system,
the Company offers customers debit and credit card payment options in all 
stores.  In addition, the Company is utilizing a computer generated ordering 
system in twenty stores, which is designed to reduce inventory levels and out 
of stock conditions, enhance shelf space utilization, and reduce labor costs.   

     The Company's commitment to advanced scanning systems has enabled it to
participate in Price Plus, ShopRite's preferred customer program.  Customers
receive electronic discounts by presenting a scannable Price Plus card.  In
addition, the Company began using Clip Less coupons in 1994.  Customers need 
only present their Price Plus card to receive the value of our in-ad coupons.  
Also, target marketing programs using this technology are presently being 
developed.  The Company has converted our customers separate Price Plus and 
check cashing cards to a single universal card.  In addition to customer 
convenience, the new card provides the Company with improved ability to limit 
the acceptance of bad checks.  

     The Company utilizes a direct store delivery system, consisting of personal
computers and hand held scanners, for most items not purchased through Wakefern
in order to provide equivalent cost and retail price control over these 
products.  In addition, certain in-store department records are computerized, 
including the records of all pharmacy departments.  In certain stores, meat, 
seafood and delicatessen prices are maintained on computer for automatic 
weighing and pricing.  Furthermore, all stores have computerized time and 
attendance systems and most also have computerized energy management systems.  
The Company seeks to design its stores to use energy efficiently, including 
recycling waste heat generated by refrigeration equipment for heating and other 
purposes.

COMPETITION

     The supermarket business is highly competitive.  Industry profit margins
are narrow, consequently earnings are dependent on high sales volume and
operating efficiency.  The Company is in direct competition with national,
regional and local chains as well as independent supermarkets, warehouse clubs,
drug stores, discount department stores and convenience stores.  The principal
methods of competition utilized by the Company are low pricing, courteous, quick
service to the customer, quality products and consistent availability of a wide
variety of merchandise including the ShopRite private label.  The Company
believes its regional focus and the continuity of its management by the Sumas
family permit it to operate with greater flexibility in tailoring the products
offered in each store to the demographics of the communities they serve as
compared to national and larger regional chains.  The Company's principal
competitors are Pathmark, A & P, Foodtown, King's, Grand Union and Acme.  Many 
of the Company's competitors have financial resources substantially greater 
than those of the Company.

LABOR

     As of October 6, 1995, the Company employed approximately 3,750 persons, 
of whom approximately 2,400 worked part-time.  Approximately 86% of the 
Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The 
Company was affected by a labor dispute with its largest union in fiscal 1993 
which was settled with a new four year contract.  A contract with one union 
expires in fiscal 1996.   Most of the Company's competitors in New Jersey are
similarly unionized. 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

     While the Company must secure a variety of health and food distribution
permits for the conduct of its business, it does not believe that such
regulation is material to its operations.  The Company's pharmacy departments
are subject to state regulation and licensed pharmacists must be on duty at
all times.  The Company's liquor operation is also subject to regulation by
state and municipal administrative authorities.  The Company does not
presently anticipate expanding its liquor operations.  Compliance with
statutes regulating the discharge of materials into the environment is not
expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings and
competitive position in fiscal 1996 and 1997.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The Company owns the sites of five of its supermarkets (containing
304,000 square feet of total space), all of which are free-standing stores,
except the Egg Harbor store, which is part of a shopping center.  The Company
also owns the site of the former Easton and Maplewood stores. The Maplewood
property is under contract for sale to the current tenant and the Easton store
is currently being marketed. The remaining eighteen supermarkets (containing
800,000 square feet of total space) are leased, with initial lease terms
generally ranging from 20 to 30 years, usually with renewal options.  Eleven
of these leased stores are located in strip shopping centers and the remaining
seven are free-standing stores. Except with respect to one lease between the
Company and certain related parties, none of the Company's leases expire
before 1997. The annual rent, including capitalized leases, for all of the
Company's leased facilities for the year ended July 29, 1995 was approximately
$5,700,000. The Company is a limited partner in two partnerships, each of
which owns a shopping center in which one of the Company's leased supermarkets
is located. The Company also is a general partner in a general partnership
that is a lessor of one of the Company's free-standing supermarkets.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        No material legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

        No matters submitted to shareholders in the fourth quarter.

                VILLAGE SUPER MARKET, INC. REPORTS RESULTS
            FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED JULY 29, 1995

Springfield, N.J. - October 3, 1995 - Village Super Market, Inc.
reported sales and net income for the fourth quarter and year
ended July 29, 1995, Perry Sumas, President announced today.

Net income was $352,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995
compared to a net loss of $249,000 in the prior year. Fourth
quarter sales were $173,699,000, a decline of 7.5% from the prior
year. Sales decreased due to the current years fourth quarter
containing 13 weeks compared to 14 weeks one year ago and a store
closing one year ago.

In reviewing the quarter, Mr. Sumas attributed the improved
results compared to a year ago to higher gross margins. Operating
expenses as a percentage of sales were the same as a year ago as
decreases in payroll costs were offset by increased supply and
coupon costs. Same store sales increased by .7% in the quarter.  

Net income for the full fiscal year was $578,000 compared to a
net loss before the impact of an accounting change of $1,207,000
in the prior year. Sales for the year were $677,322,000 a decline
of 2.6% from the prior year. Sales declined due to a store closed
in August 1994 and a same store sales decrease of .7%.  Same
store sales declined due to the impact of new competitive
entries, continued sluggishness in the economy and comparison to
a prior year period that included higher promotional spending.
The improvement in net income in fiscal 1995, despite lower same
store sales is due to higher gross margins, and lower payroll and
coupon costs, partially offset by higher supply costs.  

Village Super Market, Inc. operates a chain of twenty-three
supermarkets under the ShopRite name in New Jersey and Eastern
Pennsylvania.  The following table summarizes Village's results
for the quarter and year ended July 29, 1995.

cumulative effect of an accounting change in the prior year.  The
results for both the quarter and nine month periods are
substantially improved from a year ago, despite lower sales, due
to more efficient use of labor and reduced promotional costs.

Sales in the third quarter decreased 4.3% from the prior year to
$164,453,000.  Sales were lower due to the closing of the Easton store 
in August 1994.  Also, same store sales decreased 1.3% in the third
quarter. Same store sales declined due to the impact of new
competitive entries, continued sluggishness in the economy and
comparison to a prior year period that included higher
promotional spending.

Sales for the nine month period were $503,624,000, a decrease of
 .7% from the prior year.  Sales decreased due to the store closed
and lower same store sales of 1.1%. This decrease was partially
offset by the current year containing 39 weeks compared to 38
weeks in the prior year. 

Gross margins as a percentage of sales for the quarter and nine
month period were 24.6% and 24.4%, respectively, compared with
24.4% in both of the corresponding prior year periods.  The
improvement in gross margin percentage in the third quarter was
due to the increased mix of sales in high margin perishable
departments.  Price competition in the marketplace and continued
high levels of sale item penetration have prevented further
increases in gross margins throughout fiscal 1995.

Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
for the quarter and nine periods decreased to 23.0% and 22.4%,
respectively, compared with 23.5% and 22.8%, respectively, in the
corresponding prior year periods.  These improvements were due to
lower promotional costs and lower store payroll costs than one
year ago, partially offset by higher supply costs.

The Company completed expansions and remodels of the Stirling,
Hillsborough and Chester stores this year.  An expansion of the
Absecon store has begun.  The following table summarizes
Village's results for the quarter and nine month periods ended
April 29, 1995.

Village Super Market, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Dear Fellow Shareholders

        We are pleased to report net income of $578,000, or $.20 per share, in 
fiscal 1995.  This compares with a net loss before an accounting change of 
$1,207,000 in 1994.  Sales decreased 2.6% to $677,322,000 due to the closing of 
the Easton store and a same store sales decline of .7%.

        A year ago we expressed how disappointed we were with the 1994 
results and explained the corrective actions we were taking. Happily, we 
achieved the expense reductions we expected. Payroll costs declined due to 
more efficient use of hours worked and promotional costs were also reduced. 
These improvements and an increase in gross margins resulted in the 
turnaround in 1995, despite lower same store sales.

        Our marketing areas continue to experience increased competition. 
During 1995 four competitors opened stores in markets we serve. We expect 
this trend to continue, resulting in limited improvement in same store sales. 
Our focus will remain on updating our store base, reducing our cost structure 
and satisfying our customers' needs.

        We completed an expansion of the Chester store this year. The Chester 
store and the three stores remodeled in 1994 are meeting our performance 
expectations. We recently began a major expansion of the Absecon store. The 
Livingston store is scheduled for a major remodel next spring. We also 
continue to pursue approval of a new store in Garwood/Westfield.

        As part of ShopRite's continuing commitment to customer satisfaction, 
comprehensive consumer marketing surveys were performed this year by a 
consultant. The information obtained from these surveys has been used to 
improve training programs and to enhance employees' and management's 
understanding of customer needs and priorities.

        Customer needs and thus the supermarket have continued to change over 
the years. With the prevalence of two-income families and the struggle to 
find enough time in the day, we have responded by increasing our offerings of 
foods to go and packaged salads.  We expect these and similar responses to 
changing customer needs to be growth areas.

        We thank our employees for their hard work in restoring profitability 
after a difficult year and our shareholders for their patience and support.


James Sumas,                                           Perry Sumas,

Village Super Market, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Nicholas J. Sumas
1903 - 1995
       
      Village Supermarket lost its co-founder, Nicholas Sumas, this year. 
Mr. Nick, as he was known to members of the Village family, served as Chairman 
of the Board from its incorporation until 1989. He also served as President and 
CEO until 1973.
    
      Nick emigrated to the United States in 1920 from Vithos, Greece. In 1937, 
with his brother Perry, he opened a small produce market that later became the 
first Village Super Market in South Orange, New Jersey. A decade later they 
joined several other small food markets to form the ShopRite food cooperative, 
Wakefern Food Corporation. Nick served as President of Wakefern in 1954 and 
1955.

      Throughout his life Nick supported his church and community with the 
same dedication and enthusiasm that he devoted to the company he founded. He 
served as President of St. Constantine and Helen Church in Orange from 1956 to 
1966. Nick created the Sumas Foundation, which funded a library for the 
children of St. Basils Academy in Garrison, NY. His leadership and guidance 
will be sorely missed by all of us at Village.

</TABLE>

        Sales decreased $17,748,000 in fiscal 1995. The closing of the Easton
store in August 1994 decreased sales by $11,600,000. In addition, same store 
sales decreased by .7% due to the effects of new competitive entries, 
continued sluggishness in the economy and comparison to a prior year period 
that included higher promotional spending. Sales decreased $18,786,000 in 
fiscal 1994. Sales decreased $13,100,000 as a result of the prior year 
containing 53 weeks. The sale of the Morristown and Kingston stores caused 
decreased sales of $13,900,000. Offsetting these declines was a same store 
sales increase of 1.3%. Although same store sales increased in the 
middle part of the fiscal year due to increased promotional spending, 
the sluggish economy and new competitive entries held same store sales 
flat in the fourth quarter.
        
        Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal 1995 
and 1994 as a result of aggressive buying practices. High levels of sale 
item penetration and price competition in the marketplace prevented further 
increases in gross margins.
        
        Operating and administrative expenses in fiscal 1995 declined 
by .3 as a percentage of sales. This improvement was due to lower payroll 
and coupon costs, partially offset by increased supply costs. Payroll 
costs declined, despite an increase in pay rate per hour, due to a 
reduction in same store hours worked. Operating and administrative expenses 
in fiscal 1994 were slightly lower due to store closings and one less week 
of operations but increased .46 as a percentage of sales. Approximately 
half of this increase was due to higher levels of promotional spending, 
chiefly coupons, in the middle part of the year. Although this additional 
promotional spending was partially responsible for the increase in same 
store sales, a larger sales increase was expected in order to offset the 
cost of these coupons. In addition, workers' compensation, health care 
and payroll costs increased.
        
        Interest expense increased in 1995 due to higher variable interest 
rates. Interest expense decreased in 1994 due to declining debt levels and 
lower interest rates.
        
        Net income was $578,000 in fiscal 1995 compared to a net loss before 
the cumulative effect of accounting change of $1,207,000 in fiscal 1994. 
This improvement is primarily attributable to reductions in payroll and 
coupon costs and improved gross margins.
        
        The Easton store was closed on August 30, 1994. The Company is 
pursuing selling or leasing this company owned property. A charge to 
operations in the amount of $200,000 is included in the 1995 results from 
the closing of the store. The equipment and leasehold of the Morristown 
store was sold on October 6, 1993 for $87,000 plus the cost of inventory. 
A loss of $354,000 was recorded in fiscal 1994 and an additional loss of 
$300,000 was recorded in fiscal 1995 for additional rent and disposal costs 
that were incurred as a result of the sublessee's failure to make rent 
payments.



Village Super Market, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

       Sales were not materially affected by inflation in 1995 and 1994. 
The Company has historically been able to pass along inflationary increases 
in its direct product costs through increased selling prices. However, 
operating and administrative costs have increased in some recent years 
despite the lack of inflation in food prices. The competitive climate has 
at times prevented the Company from increasing gross margins to compensate 
for increased operating costs. As a result, the Company had experienced 
declining profitability prior to 1995. A continuation of the recent trend 
of increased price competition, higher wage and benefit costs and a sluggish 
economy could prevent the Company from increasing its operating margins and 
profitability.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
        
        Current liabilities exceeded current assets by $3,755,000, $4,100,000
and $2,303,000 at the end of fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. 
Working capital ratios at the same dates were .91, .90  and .95 to one, 
respectively. The Company's working capital needs are reduced by its high rate 
of inventory turnover (twenty-one times in fiscal 1995) and because the 
warehousing and distribution arrangements accorded to the Company as a member 
of Wakefern permit it to minimize inventory levels and sell most merchandise 
before payment is required. The Starn's stores generate greater sales during 
the summer months due to their location in the southern shore region of New 
Jersey. This seasonality serves to offset the slight decline in sales 
experienced during the summer months by the majority of the Company's other 
stores, resulting in a more level distribution of working capital require-
ments throughout the year.

        Capital expenditures in 1995 were $6,588,000. The major expenditure 
was the expansion and remodeling of the Chester store. The remainder of 
capital expenditures included the start of the expansion of the Absecon store 
and amounts expended in an effort to obtain approvals for a new store. The 
Company has budgeted approximately $8,000,000 for capital expenditures in 
fiscal 1996. The major planned expenditures are the expansion and remodeling 
of the Absecon store and the beginning of the expansion of the Livingston 
store. The Company expects to finance these expenditures through internally 
generated funds and borrowing under its credit facility. 

        The Company has historically financed capital expenditures through 
cash provided by operations supplemented by bank borrowings. Aggregate 
capital expenditures for the three years ended July 29, 1995 were $14,539,000. 
During the same period of time, net long-term borrowings decreased by 
$10,075,000. The ability to finance expansion through operational cash flow 
is reflected in the ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization, which 
is currently 39.7% compared with 46.8% three years ago.
        
        In addition to operating cash flow, the Company's primary source of 
liquidity during 1996 is expected to be borrowings under the $12,000,000 
revolving loan credit facility. At July 29, 1995, the Company had borrowed 
$7,000,000 under this facility. The Company was in full compliance with all 
terms and restrictive covenants of this debt agreement, as amended, during 
fiscal 1995 and expects to be in compliance for the remaining term of the 
agreement.
        
        At July 29, 1995, the Company did not meet a cash flow-to-fixed 
charge coverage ratio contained in two other debt agreements with one lender. 
This does not constitute an event of default. However, until this ratio is 
met or unless a waiver is obtained, the agreements prevent the Company from 
borrowing additional funds (other than the Company's revolving loan), 
declaring dividends and executing new leases.

Village Super Market, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Village 
Super Market, Inc. and its subsidiary, which is wholly owned. Intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

FISCAL YEAR
  
  The Company and its subsidiaries utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending 
on the last Saturday in the month of July. Fiscal 1995 and 1994 contain 52 
weeks. Fiscal 1993 contained 53 weeks. 

INDUSTRY SEGMENT
  
  The Company consists of one operating segment, the retail sale of food 
and non-food products.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
  
  Certain amounts have been reclassified in the 1994 and 1993 financial 
statements to conform to the 1995 financial statement presentation.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
        
  Cash and cash equivalents includes interest bearing, overnight deposits 
with Wakefern in the amount of $6,900,000 and $5,200,000 at July 29, 1995 
and July 30, 1994, respectively.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES
        
  Merchandise inventories are carried at cost, which is not in excess of 
market. Cost is determined as follows:
        
  Grocery and non-foods - last-in, first-out (LIFO) (retail less 
departmental gross profit mark-up).
        
  Meat and all other perishables - first-in, first-out (FIFO).
        
  Dairy, frozen foods and liquor - FIFO (retail less departmental gross 
profit mark-up).

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND FIXTURES
        
  Property, equipment and fixtures are recorded at cost. Interest cost 
incurred to finance construction is capitalized as part of such cost. 
Renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are 
expensed as incurred.
        
  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful 
lives of thirty years for buildings, ten years for store fixtures and 
equipment, and three years for vehicles. Leasehold improvements are 
amortized over ten to twenty years. Capital leases are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the related lease term or the 
economic lives of the related assets.
       
  When assets are sold or retired, their cost and accumulated depreciation 
are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the 
financial statements.

STORE OPENING AND CLOSING COSTS
  
  All store opening costs are expensed as incurred. Provisions are made for 
losses resulting from store closings at the time of closing.

LEASES
  
  Leases which meet certain criteria are classified as capital leases, and 
assets and liabilities are recorded at amounts equal to the lesser of the 
present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased 
properties at the inception of the respective leases. Such assets are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the related lease 
terms or the economic lives of the related assets. Amounts representing 
interest expense relating to the lease obligations are recorded to affect 
constant rates of interest over the terms of the leases. Leases which do 
not qualify as capital leases are classified as operating leases, and 
related rentals are charged to expense as incurred.

GOODWILL
  
  Goodwill arising after October 31, 1970 is being amortized over forty 
years. The Company does not amortize goodwill amounting to approximately 
$2,900,000 acquired prior to October 31, 1970 since, in management's opinion, 
the value of such intangibles has not diminished. Accumulated amortization 
of goodwill amounted to $2,540,530 and $2,274,250 at July 29, 1995 and 
July 30, 1994, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the 
recoverability of unamortized amounts of goodwill utilizing relevant cash 
flow and profitability information.

OTHER INTANGIBLES
  
  Other intangibles include the fair value of a favorable lease and 
trademarks acquired in a business acquisition. Other intangibles are being 
amortized over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of other intangibles 
amounted to $2,283,749 and $2,029,999 at July 29, 1995 and July 30, 1994, 
respectively.

INCOME TAXES
 
  Effective August 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), which 
requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes. 
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based 
on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and are measured using the tax rates in effect. As permitted by 
SFAS 109, the Company has elected not to restate the financial statements of 
any prior periods.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
  
  Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by 
the weighted average number of all common shares outstanding during the 
periods presented which was 2,909,876 in 1995, 1994 and 1993. Stock options 
are not included in the calculation as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive 
or would not result in a material dilution of net income (loss) per share.

NOTE 2 - INVENTORIES

  Merchandise inventories are comprised as follows:

   If the FIFO method of inventory accounting had been used rather than LIFO, 
inventories would have been $6,812,530 and $6,467,653 higher than reported 
in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY INFORMATION
        
  The Company's investment in its principal supplier, Wakefern Food Corp. 
("Wakefern"), which is operated on a cooperative basis for its stockholder 
members, is less than 20% of the outstanding shares of Wakefern. The 
investment is pledged as collateral for any obligations to Wakefern. In 
addition, this obligation is personally guaranteed by the principal 
shareholders of the Company. The Company is obligated to purchase 85% of 
its primary merchandise requirements from Wakefern until ten years from the 
date that stockholders representing 75% of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern 
that those stockholders request the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be 
terminated. The Company's merchandise purchases from Wakefern approximated 
$484,491,000, $490,447,000 and $489,658,000 during fiscal years 1995, 1994 
and 1993, respectively. Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to 
each member a share of earnings of Wakefern in proportion to the dollar 
volume of business done by the member with Wakefern during the year. 
Patronage dividends, which are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales, 
amounted to $8,223,000, $7,702,000 and $6,897,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, 
respectively.

  Wakefern has increased from time to time the required investment in its 
common stock for each supermarket owned by a member, with the exact amount 
per store computed in accordance with a formula based on the volume of each 
store's purchases from Wakefern. As a result, the Company is required to 
invest approximately $820,000 over approximately the next three years. The 
Company will receive additional shares of common stock to the extent paid 
for at the end of each fiscal year (September 30) of Wakefern calculated at 
the then book value of such shares. The payments together with any stock 
issued thereunder, at the option of Wakefern, may be null and void and all 
payments on this subscription shall become the property of Wakefern in the 
event the Company does not complete the payment of this subscription in a 
timely manner.

  On March 29, 1994 the Company entered into a new loan agreement with two 
banks. The agreement consists of a $10,000,000 term loan and a $12,000,000 
revolving loan. The $12,000,000 revolving loan, which can be used for any 
purpose except new store construction, matures March 31, 1997 and carries 
interest at prime plus .5 %.
        
  At July 29, 1995 the Company was in compliance with all terms and 
restrictive covenants of this debt agreement, as amended. This agreement 
contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, specify total 
debt levels, maintenance of net worth, interest coverage ratios, cash flow 
coverage ratios, limitation on payment of dividends and limitation of capital 
expenditures.
        
  At July 29, 1995 the Company did not meet a cash flow-to-fixed charge 
coverage ratio contained in two other debt agreements with one lender. This 
does not constitute an event of default. However, until this ratio is met or 
unless a waiver is obtained, the agreements prevent the Company from borrowing 
additional funds (other than under the Company's revolving loan), declaring 
dividends and executing new leases.
  
  Interest paid amounted to $4,073,646, $4,095,616 and $4,496,835 in 1995, 
1994 and 1993, respectively.

</TABLE>
                 
  A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that 
some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In management's 
opinion, in view of the Company's previous, current and projected taxable 
income, such tax assets will more likely than not be fully realized. 
Accordingly, no valuation allowance was deemed to be required at July 29, 
1995 and July 30, 1994.

  The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal income 
tax rate as follows:

  Effective income tax rate             36.7%     (37.7%)      39.3%  

</TABLE>

  During 1993 deferred income taxes were provided for significant timing 
differences in the recognition of expenses for tax and financial statement 
purposes. The principal components of deferred tax expense (benefit) in 1993 
are depreciation - $(354,000) and accrued liabilities - $128,000.              

  The Company has approximately $500,000 of alternative minimum tax credits 
that may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has approximately 
$400,000 of targeted jobs tax credits that can be carried forward fifteen 
years.

  No income taxes were paid in 1995. Income taxes paid amounted to 
approximately $192,000 and $1,917,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

NOTE 7 - LONG-TERM LEASES

DESCRIPTION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
        
   The Company conducts a major part of its operations from leased facilities, 
with the majority of initial lease terms ranging from 20 to 30 years. All of 
the Company's leases expire through fiscal 2059.
   
   Most of the Company's leases contain renewal options of five years each. 
These options enable the Company to retain the use of facilities in desirable 
operating areas. Management expects that in the normal course of business, 
leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. The Company is obligated 
under all leases to pay for utilities and liability insurance, and under 
certain leases to pay additional amounts based on real estate taxes, 
maintenance, insurance and a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated 
amounts.

   Future minimum lease payments by year and in the aggregate for all 
non-cancelable leases with initial terms of one year or more consisted of the 
following at July 29, 1995:

RELATED PARTY LEASES
  
  The Company currently leases three supermarkets and its office facility 
from realty firms partly or wholly-owned by officers of the Company. The 
Company paid aggregate rentals under these leases, including minimum rent 
and contingent rent, of approximately $1,128,000, $1,215,000 and $1,039,000 
for fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. In addition, three 
supermarkets are leased from partnerships in which the Company is a partner.

NOTE 8 - COMMON STOCK

  Class A common stock has one vote per share and is entitled to cash 
dividends as declared 54% greater than those paid on the Class B common 
stock. Class B common stock has ten votes per share. Class B common stock 
is not transferrable except to another holder of Class B common stock or 
by will or under the laws of intestacy or pursuant to a resolution of the 
Board of Directors of the Company approving the transfer. Shares of Class B 
common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis for Class A common 
stock.

  The Company has an Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan under 
which both incentive and nonstatutory options to purchase up to 150,000 
shares of the Company's Class A common stock may be granted to officers 
and employees of the Company as designated by the Board of Directors. The 
plan requires incentive stock options to be granted at an exercise price 
equalling the fair market value of the Company's stock at the date of grant 
(110% if the optionee holds more than 10% of the voting stock of the Company), 
while nonstatutory options may be granted at an exercise price less than 
market value. All options granted to date are at an exercise price equal to 
the fair value at the date of grant. All options outstanding at July 29, 1995 
expire on December 6, 1997. There were no transactions in fiscal 1995, 1994 
and 1993. There are 130,000 options outstanding and exercisable at an average 
price of $8.00 at July 29, 1995.

NOTE 9 - PENSION PLANS

  The Company sponsors three defined benefit pension plans covering 
administrative personnel and members of two unions. Employees covered under 
the administrative pension benefit plan earn benefits based upon percentages 
of annual compensation. Employees covered under the union pension benefit 
plans earn benefits based on a fixed amount for each year of service. The 
Company's funding policy is to pay at least the minimum contribution required 
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

  Net periodic pension cost for the three plans included the following 
components:

    Expected rate of return on plan assets                8 to 8.5%

  The Company also participates in several multiemployer pension plans for 
which the 1995, 1994 and 1993 contributions were $1,785,000, $1,814,000 and 
$1,822,000, respectively.

NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  The Company is under contract to purchase a tract of land, contingent upon 
receiving all approvals, on which it plans to construct a superstore. Costs 
incurred related to this project are included in construction in progress as 
the Company believes such costs will be recoverable from the development of 
the property. 
        
  The Company's general liability insurer can make premium calls for premiums 
paid for the years ended December 1, 1992 through December 1, 1994. Based on 
advice from the insurer, the Company has recorded liabilities for the 
estimated premium calls. 
        
  The Company is involved in litigation incidental to the normal course of 
business. Company management is of the opinion that insurance coverage is 
adequate and final disposition should not materially affect the consolidated 
financial position of the Company.
