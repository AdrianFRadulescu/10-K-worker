Item 1.     Business.

          Winthrop  Partners  80  Limited  Partnership  (the  "Partnership"),  a
     limited  partnership,  was organized under the Uniform Limited  Partnership
     Act of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  on February  5, 1980,  for the
     purpose of owning and leasing  commercial and industrial  real  properties.
     The Partnership was initially capitalized with contributions of $1,000 from
     each of the two  General  Partners  and  $5,000  from the  Initial  Limited
     Partner.  On  February  21,  1980,  the  Partnership  filed a  Registration
     Statement on Form S-11 (the  "Registration  Statement") with the Securities
     and  Exchange  Commission  (the  "Commission")  with  respect  to a  public
     offering of 50,000  units of limited  partnership  interest  ("Units") at a
     purchase  price  of $500  per  Unit  (an  aggregate  of  $25,000,000).  The
     Registration Statement was declared effective on June 9, 1980. The offering
     terminated  in  February  1981,  at which time 45,636  Units,  representing
     capital  contributions  from  Limited  Partners  of  $22,818,000,  had been
     subscribed for.

          The Partnership's  General Partners are One Winthrop Properties,  Inc.
     (the  "Managing  General  Partner") and  Linnaeus-Hampshire  Realty Limited
     Partnership  (formerly  known  as  Linnaeus-Hampshire  Realty  Company)(the
     "Associate  General  Partner").   One  Winthrop   Properties,   Inc.  is  a
     Massachusetts  corporation  which  is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of First
     Winthrop  Corporation ("First Winthrop"),  a Delaware  corporation which is
     wholly  owned by  Winthrop  Financial  Associates,  A  Limited  Partnership
     ("WFA"),  a Maryland  public  limited  partnership.  The Associate  General
     Partner was a  Massachusetts  general  partnership  until 1990, when it was
     converted  to  a  Massachusetts  limited  partnership.  Mr.  Halleran  is a
     director of First  Winthrop and One Winthrop  Properties,  Inc. The general
     partner of the Associate General Partner is Arthur J. Halleran, Jr.

          Until  December  22,  1994,  Mr.  Halleran  was also the sole  general
     partner of Linnaeus  Associates Limited  Partnership  ("Linnaeus") which is
     the sole  general  partner of WFA. On  December  22,  1994,  pursuant to an
     Investment  Agreement  entered into among Nomura Asset Capital  Corporation
     ("NACC"),  Mr.  Halleran  and certain  other  individuals  who comprise the
     senior management of WFA, the general partnership  interest in Linnaeus was
     transferred to W.L. Realty, L.P. ("W.L. Realty"). W.L. Realty is a Delaware
     limited  partnership,  the general partner of which is A.I. Realty Company,
     LLC  ("Realtyco").  The equity securities of Realtyco are currently held by
     certain  employees of NACC.  Such  securities  are subject to a call option
     agreement  pursuant to which NACC may, at any time,  elect to purchase such
     securities for $1.00.

          The  Partnership's  only business is owning and leasing  improved real
     estate.  The  Partner-  ship's  investment   objectives  and  policies  are
     described  at  pages  16-23  of its  Prospectus  dated  June 9,  1980  (the
     "Prospectus") under the caption "Investment Objectives and Policies," which
     description  is attached  hereto as an Exhibit and  incorporated  herein by
     this  reference.  The Prospectus was filed with the Commission  pursuant to
     Rule 424(b) on June 19, 1980.

          In December 1981, the Partnership  completed its investment of the net
     proceeds  of the Li- mited  Partners'  capital  contributions,  other  than
     approximately  $200,000  originally  set  aside  as  reserves,  in 18  real
     properties.  The Partnership's  current reserves of approximately  $250,000
     are invested in money market instruments.  Seven properties have been sold:
     one in 1989, two in 1991, two in 1992 and two in 1993. See,  "Disposition,"
     below.  Many of the  properties  are lo-  cated  in  areas  with  depressed
     economies,  making potential  purchasers  concerned about a possible rental
     reduction  when  existing  leases  expire.  The  Partnership's  future cash
     distributions  will include  ongoing  disbursements  from rental income and
     one-time disbursements of sale proceeds.  Rental income will be affected by
     the terms of any new  leases,  any tenant  improvement  and  leasing  costs
     associated  with renewing  leases with existing  tenants or signing  leases
     with new tenants, the loss of rent during any period when a property is not
     under lease and the loss of rent after a property is sold. Distributions of
     sale  proceeds  will  be made  as a  partial  return  of  capital.  Per the
     Partnership  Agreement,  sale  proceeds  are  distributed  100% to  limited
     partners  until they have  received  their $500 per unit  original  Capital
     Contribution. The general partners' 8% share of sale proceeds would be paid
     subsequently. The following table contains descriptions of the remaining 11
     properties, the terms of acquisition,  the tenants to which they are leased
     and the terms of the leases.

     (1)  Includes acquisition fees and expenses.

     (2)  All leases  commenced on date of purchase by the  Partnership,  except
          the lease with Motorola, Inc. which commenced on September 29, 1989.


     (3)  Definitions: Triple Net - All operating expenses paid by tenant.

          %    Rent -  Additional  rent payable by tenant in excess of base rent
               if annual gross sales exceed certain minimum levels.

          Step Rent - Rent payable by tenant periodically increases over time.


     (4)  During 1987 Dairymart  became  associated  with The Lawson Company and
          all Lawson Company stores changed their name to Dairymart.


     (5)  Additional percentage rent of $52,919 was received in 1994.


     (6)  In 1989, after the original tenant,  Duckwall-Alco Stores, Inc., filed
          for  bankruptcy  protection,  a new lease for a one-year term with the
          new tenant, Motorola, Inc., was entered into. The lease was amended in
          1990 and 1991.


     (7)  In 1989, after the tenant filed for bankruptcy protection,  this lease
          was renegotiated providing the tenant with the option to terminate the
          lease in 1992,  1995 and 1998.  The annual  base rent  reflects a rent
          increase in 1991.  Additional  percentage rent of $688 was received in
          1993 and no percentage rent was received in 1994.


     (8)  Additional  percentage  rent of $203,473  was  received  in 1994.  The
          Partnership  modified the existing base,  effective  November 1994, by
          increasing  the annual  base lease  payment by $150,000  reducing  the
          percentage  rents by $150,000  and  allowing  Wal-Mart to sublease the
          property to another retail operator.


     (9)  Additional  percentage  rent of $181,636  was  received  in 1994.  The
          tenant  vacated the store in 1994.  The  Partnership  will continue to
          receive  base rent but does not  expect  to  receive  percentage  rent
          payments in the future.



          The Partnership  owns the fee interest in each of these properties and
     acquired all of the properties solely with Partnership  capital and without
     any  mortgage  financing.   All  of  these  properties  are  commercial  or
     industrial in nature.  Each of these properties is under a triple net lease
     to a single tenant.  The initial terms of the original leases were at least
     ten years  from the date of  acquisition.  Each of the  tenants is a public
     company or a subsidiary of a public company.

          Tenants with 1994 rental payments,  including percentage rents, of 10%
     or more of the Partnership's total annual revenue, are as follows: Wal-Mart
     Stores,  Inc.  store in Victoria,  Texas,  30%;  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc. in
     Bowling Green, Kentucky, 24%; Toys "R" Us, Inc. in Livingston,  New Jersey,
     15%; and Toys "R" Us, Inc. in Beaumont, Texas, 13%. The Partnership expects
     the percentage of the total  Partnership  income from Wal-mart in Victoria,
     Texas to be reduced  in the  future.  The  Partnership  expects  the rental
     payments  from the  other  tenants  to  amount  to  approximately  the same
     respective percentages of the Partnership's total income in 1995.

          The  tenants  under  the  leases  have  exclusive   control  over  the
     day-to-day  business  operations  conducted  at the  Properties  as well as
     decisions with respect to the initiation of any  development or renovations
     at the Properties.  The  Partnership  has limited  approval rights over any
     such renovation  programs  proposed by the tenants.  The Partnership has no
     responsibility for any maintenance, repairs or improvements associated with
     these  Properties.  In  addition,  the  tenants  are  responsible  for  all
     insurance requirements and the payment of real estate taxes directly to the
     taxing authorities.

          In the  opinion  of the  general  partners  of  the  Partnership,  the
     Properties are adequately covered by insurance.

          Each  retail  tenant is subject to  competition  from other  companies
     offering  similar  products in the locations of the property leased by such
     tenant. In addition,  the Partnership  anticipates that it would be subject
     to  significant  competition  in attracting  tenants upon the expiration or
     termination of any of the leases of its properties.  The Partnership has no
     control over the tenants' responses to competitive conditions impacting the
     businesses operated by the tenants at each of the properties.

Item 2.       Properties.

          The Partnership  sold seven  properties and owns the remaining  eleven
     properties.  A discussion  of the  disposition  of the seven  properties is
     found below.  In addition,  please refer to the table in Item. 1. Business,
     which contains  descriptions of the remaining eleven properties,  the terms
     of their  acquisition,  the tenants to which they are leased, and the terms
     of the leases.

Disposition of Seven of the Partnership's Properties

          1. Circuit City, Gaithersburg,  MD. The sale of the property closed on
     September  28,  1989.  The  property was sold to a third party for $970,000
     which is an increase  over the original  purchase  price of  $512,127.  The
     cash-on-cash  return provided by the property during its holding period was
     approximately   19%  per  annum,   taking  into   account   the   quarterly
     distributions attributable to the property and the profit incurred on sale.
     The  Partnership's   original  investment  in  this  property   represented
     approximately  2.5%  of the  initial  offering  proceeds.  The  Partnership
     distributed  to the limited  partners all of the net proceeds with the 1989
     Third Quarter  distribution.  On a per-unit  basis,  $10.21 was a return of
     capital and $9.91 was profit, totaling $20.12 per unit.

          2. Electric Power Research Institute,  Charlotte,  NC. The sale of the
     property  closed on January 15, 1991.  The property was sold for $4,750,000
     which is an increase over the original  purchase price of  $4,167,774.  The
     cash-on-cash  return provided by the property during its holding period was
     approximately   11%  per  annum,   taking  into   account   the   quarterly
     distributions attributable to the property and the profit incurred on sale.
     The  Partnership's   original  investment  in  this  property   represented
     approximately  20.57% of the initial  offering  proceeds.  The  Partnership
     distributed  to the limited  partners all of the net proceeds with the 1991
     First  Quarter  distribution.  On a  per-unit  basis,  $91 was a return  of
     capital and $13 was profit, totalling $104 per unit.

          3. NCNB,  Johnston,  NC. The sale of the  property  closed on July 29,
     1991. The property was sold to a third party for $65,000 which is less than
     the original purchase price of $242,572 because the property was vacant and
     offered little  potential for  appreciating  in value.  The Partnership had
     been  unsuccessful in finding a new tenant for this property which had been
     vacant since 1990.  While the NCNB Corporation was obligated to make rental
     payments  through the original term, the term was to expire on November 13,
     1991.  If the  building  had  not  been  sold,  the  Partnership  would  be
     responsible for the payment of real estate taxes and insurance premiums for
     the  property  and  would  not be  receiving  any  rental  income  from the
     property.  The  cash-on-cash  return  provided by the  property  during its
     holding  period was  approximately  3% per annum,  taking into  account the
     quarterly  distributions  attributable  to the  property  and  the  loss of
     capital  incurred on sale. The  Partnership's  original  investment in this
     property  represented  approximately 1.2% of the initial offering proceeds.
     The Partnership distributed all of the net proceeds to the limited partners
     with the 1991 Third Quarter  distribution.  On a per-unit basis,  $1.34 was
     distributed as a return of capital.

          4. NCNB,  Beaufort,  SC. The sale of the  property  closed on July 24,
     1992. The property was sold to a third party for  $1,300,000  which is less
     than the  original  purchase  price of  $1,804,227,  because  the  property
     offered little potential for appreciating in value. The cash-on-cash return
     provided by the property during its holding period was approximately 6% per
     annum, taking into account the quarterly distributions  attributable to the
     property and the return of capital upon sale.  The  Partnership's  original
     investment in this property  represented  approximately 8.9% of the initial
     offering proceeds. The Partnership  distributed to the limited partners all
     of the net proceeds with the 1992 Third Quarter distribution. On a per-unit
     basis, $28.26 was a return of capital.

          5. NCNB, Anderson, SC. The sale of the property closed on September 4,
     1992.  The property  was sold to a third party for  $250,000  which is less
     than the  original  purchase  price of  $362,296,  because the property was
     vacant  and  offered  little  potential  for appre-  ciating in value.  The
     cash-on-cash  return provided by the property during its holding period was
     approximately 7% per annum, taking into account the quarterly distributions
     attributable  to the  property  and the  return of capital  upon sale.  The
     Partnership's    original   investment   in   this   property   represented
     approximately  1.8%  of the  initial  offering  proceeds.  The  Partnership
     distributed  to the limited  partners all of the net proceeds with the 1992
     Third Quarter distribution. On a per-unit basis, $5.04 was distributed as a
     return of capital.

          6.  Dairy  Mart,  Berkley,  MI.  The sale of this  property  closed on
     September  8, 1993,  with the proceeds  included in the Third  Quarter 1993
     distribution  paid  on  November  13,  1993.  The  property  was  sold  for
     approximately  $120,000  which is less than the original  purchase price of
     $185,097, because the property offered little potential for appreciating in
     value.  The cash-on cash return provided by the property during its holding
     period was approximately 7.2% per annum,  taking into account the quarterly
     distributions  attributable  to the property and the return of capital upon
     sale. The Partnership's  original  investment in this property  represented
     approximately  1%  of  the  initial  offering  proceeds.   The  Partnership
     distributed   all  of  the  net  proceeds   with  the  1993  Third  Quarter
     distribution.  On a per-unit  basis,  $2.61 was  distributed as a return of
     capital.

          7. NCNB, Greenville,  SC. The sale of the property closed on September
     30, 1993 with the proceeds  included in the Third Quarter 1993 distribution
     paid on November 13, 1993. The property was sold for approximately $345,000
     which is less than the original  purchase  price of  $816,822,  because the
     property was vacant and offered little potential for appreciating in value.
     The cash-on cash return  provided by the property during its holding period
     was  approximately  5.3% per  annum,  taking  into  account  the  quarterly
     distributions attributable to the property and the loss of capital incurred
     on sale. The Partnership's original investment in this property represented
     approximately  4%  of  the  initial  offering  proceeds.   The  Partnership
     distributed   all  of  the  net  proceeds   with  the  1993  Third  Quarter
     distribution.  On a per-unit  basis,  $6.92 was  distributed as a return of
     capital.

Status of the Partnership's Remaining Properties

          1. Motorola,  Mt. Pleasant,  IA. In 1991, Motorola,  Inc. extended its
     lease at the Mt.  Pleasant,  Iowa property  through  November 30, 1997. The
     annual base rent is $111,600,  increasing to $122,760 on November 30, 1995.
     The  Partnership's   original   investment  in  this  property   represents
     approximately  5% of the initial  offering  proceeds.  The tenant currently
     occupies the property.

          2.  Duckwall-Alco,  Nebraska City, NE. In 1989, after the tenant filed
     for bankruptcy protection, the Partnership renegotiated the lease providing
     the tenant with  options to  terminate on January 31, 1992 January 31, 1995
     and January 31,  1998,  and an  expiration  date of December  22,  2000.  A
     percentage  of the  gross  store  sales  was  paid  to the  Partnership  as
     additional rent and  distributed to investors in the last three years.  The
     Partnership's original investment in this property represents approximately
     5% of the initial  offering  proceeds.  The tenant  currently  occupies the
     property.

          3 through 7.  Dairymart,  five  locations  in Ohio and  Michigan.  The
     original  terms of the  leases  for the five  Dairy  Mart  properties  have
     expired.  Dairy Mart  renewed the leases at the current  lease  rates.  The
     terms of the renewals  are: the  Creston,  Royal Oak and St. Clair  Shores'
     locations  through June 30,  1998;  the Bolivar  location  through June 30,
     1996; and the Ashtabula  location through June 30, 1995. The  Partnership's
     original  investment,   in  the  aggregate  for  all  five  properties,  is
     approximately  4% of the  initial  offering  proceeds.  Each of the tenants
     currently occupies its respective property.

          8 and 9.  Toys "R" Us,  Beaumont,  TX and  Livingston,  NJ.  These two
     leases  expire on January 1, 2001.  Annual sales remain low at the Beaumont
     location; thus, no additional rent was paid to the Partnership in 1994. The
     Livingston location has paid a percentage of gross sales as additional rent
     in each of the last five years. The Partnership's  original investment,  in
     the  aggregate for both  properties,  is  approximately  22% of the initial
     offering  proceeds.  Each of the tenants currently  occupies its respective
     property.

          10.  Wal-Mart,  Bowling Green,  KY. This lease expires on December 23,
     2000.  A  percentage  of  Wal-Mart's  gross  sales  has  been  paid  to the
     Partnership in each of the last eight years as additional  rent. Due to the
     strong local retail market,  Wal-Mart constructed a Wal-Mart Super Store in
     1994  within  two  miles of the  property.  Effective  November  1994,  the
     Partnership  modified the existing  lease  allowing  Wal-Mart to sublet the
     property to another  retail  store,  increasing  the base lease  payment by
     $150,000 and reducing the percentage rents by $150,000.  Beginning in 1995,
     the Partnership does not expect to receive  percentage rents in addition to
     the base rent. Wal-Mart remains liable for all obligations under the lease.
     The Partnership's  original investment in this property is approximately 9%
     of the initial offering proceeds.

          11. Wal-Mart, Victoria, TX. This lease expires on December 23, 2000. A
     percentage  of the gross  store sales has been paid to the  Partnership  in
     each of the last ten years as  additional  rent.  Due to the  strong  local
     retail market,  Wal-Mart  constructed in 1994 a Wal-Mart Super Store within
     two  miles of the  property.  The  tenant  vacated  the  property  in 1994.
     Wal-Mart is obligated to continue to pay the base rental  payment,  but the
     Partnership does not expect to receive  percentage rents in the future. The
     Partnership's  original investment in this property is approximately 15% of
     the initial offering proceeds. The tenant vacated the property in 1994.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings.

          The Partnership is not a party, nor are any of its properties subject,
     to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.       Submission of matters to a vote of securities holders.

  No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders.

                                                     PART III

          Item 5.  Market  Price for  Registrant's  Common  Equity  and  Related
               Stockholder Matters.

     There is no established  public market for the Units.  Trading in the Units
is sporadic and occurs solely through private transactions.

  As of March 14, 1995, there were 1,983 holders of Units.

     The Partnership Agreement requires that any Cash Available for Distribution
(as defined) be distributed  quarterly to the Partners in specified  proportions
and priorities. There are no restrictions on the Partnership's present or future
ability to make distributions of Cash Available for Distribution.  For the years
ended  December  31, 1993 and 1994,  cash  distributions  paid or accrued to the
Limited  Partners as a group  (including the Initial Limited  Partner)  totalled
$1,974,646 and $1,545,117 respectively.

               capital,  and (ii) the disposition of the Berkley, MI property in
               the amount of $6.92, all of which is a return of capital.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
     of Operations.

     The  Partnership  requires  cash to pay  management  fees and  general  and
administrative  expenses.  The  Partnership's  rental  and  interest  income was
sufficient in 1994, and is expected to be sufficient in future years, to pay all
of these  amounts as well as to provide for cash  distributions  to the Partners
from operations.

     Through 1994, the results of the Partnership's operations from year to year
have differed  primarily  because of percentage  rental payments,  variations in
interest income, and sales of properties.  The Partnership  received  percentage
rental  payments  of $173,000 on three of its  properties  in 1989,  $210,007 on
three of its  properties  in 1990,  $234,158 on four of its  properties in 1991,
$284,419 on four of its  properties in 1992,  $367,871 on four of its properties
in 1993 and $438,028 on three of its  properties in 1994.  The  Partnership  has
sold seven properties to date which  significantly  increased the amount of cash
available  for  distribution  with  respect  to the year in which  the sale took
place.  There can be no  assurance as to the timing and amount of any such sales
in the future. The sale of properties  eliminates the rental payments associated
with such properties and, therefore, reduces the cash available for distribution
in future years.





<PAGE>



     In light of the net and long-term  nature of the leases at the  properties,
other than those leased to Duck-wall,  Motorola and Dairymart,  the  Partnership
does  not  expect  the  results  of  its   operations  in  past  years  to  vary
significantly  in 1995 with  respect  to these  properties,  with the  following
exceptions.  First, the lease of one of these  properties  provides for periodic
increases  in the  rental  payments,  and  second,  the  leases  of ten of these
properties  provide for the payment of percentage rents to the Partnership based
upon the  tenant's  gross sales at the  premises in excess of certain  specified
minimum amounts.  The amounts, if any, of percentage rents which will be paid to
the Partnership from these properties in the future is dependent on future sales
volumes of the tenants occupying the Partnership's  properties.  If retail sales
decrease,  the Partnership will receive smaller  percentage rental payments than
the   approximately   $438,028  received  in  1994,  which  would  decrease  the
Partnership's  revenues and net income.  Third, the  Partnership's  depreciation
expense will decrease over time because some of these properties are depreciated
under the  component  method which results in some  building  components  having
shorter useful lives than others.

     Because of the net and long-term nature of the original  leases,  inflation
and changing prices have not significantly  affected the Partnership's  revenues
and net income.  In the future,  the Partnership  expects inflation and changing
prices to affect  the  Partnership's  revenues.  With  respect  to the  Wal-Mart
leases,  the  additional  percentage  rents are expected to be eliminated due to
Wal-Mart  vacating the two  properties  in 1994.  With respect to the  Duckwall,
Motorola and the five Dairy Mart  leases,  the  remaining  terms of the original
leases expire in 1995 to 1998. If a tenant fails to exercise its renewal option,
exercises  its  option to  terminate  its  lease  early or does not renew at the
expiration of the lease term, the Partnership  will be competing for new tenants
in the then current  rental  markets  which may not be able to support  terms as
favorable as those  contained in the  original  lease  options or it may seek to
sell the property.

     Agreement
(2)  WFC  Realty  Co.,  Inc.  holds  ten  $500.00  limited   partnership  units;
     distribution  pursuant  to Section  4.1 and  Schedule A of the  Partnership

     expenditures  for  management  fees,  debt  service  payments  and  capital
     expenditures) pursuant to Section 5.3A (iii) of the Partnership Agreement

     For the year ended December 31, 1994, the  Partnership  allocated  $40,877,
$68,129 and $275 of taxable income to the Managing  General  Partner,  Associate
General Partner and the Initial  Limited  Partner,  respectively.  See Note 3 of
Notes to Financial  Statements for  additional  information  about  transactions
between the Partnership  and the General  Partners and their  affiliates.  There
were no reimbursements made in 1994 to the General Partners or their affiliates.

Item 12.      Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.

 (a)  Security Ownership of certain beneficial owners.

     No person or group is known by the  Partnership to be the beneficial  owner
of more than 5% of the outstanding Units at March 1, 1995. Under the Amended and
Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated as of June 5,
1980 (the  "Partnership  Agreement"),  the voting rights of the Limited Partners
are limited  and,  in some  circumstances,  are subject to the prior  receipt of
certain opinions of counsel or judicial decisions.

          Under the Partnership  Agreement,  the right to manage the business of
     the  Partnership  is vested in the General  Partners and is generally to be
     exercised only by the Managing General Partner, although the consent of the
     Associate  General  Partner  is  required  for all  purchases,  financings,
     refinancings  and sales or other  dispositions  of the  Partnership's  real
     properties and with respect to certain other matters.  See Item 1 above for
     a description of the General Partners.

 (b)  Security ownership of management.

          None of the  partners of WFA nor the  general  partner,  officers  and
     directors of the General Partners owned any Units  beneficially at March 1,
     1995. However, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WFA owns 200 Units.

 (c)  Changes in control.

          There exists no arrangement  known to the Partnership the operation of
     which  may at a  subsequent  date  result  in a change  in  control  of the
     Partnership.

Item 13.          Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

          See Note 3 of Notes to  Financial  Statements  for  information  about
     transactions  between the  Partnership  and the General  Partners and their
     affiliates.  See Item 11 above  for  informa-  tion  concerning  the  fees,
     commissions and cash distributions which the Partnership paid to or accrued
     for the account of the General  Partners and their  affiliates for the year
     ended December 31, 1994.

                                                      PART IV

Item 14.     Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, and Reports on Form 8-K.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



TO WINTHROP PARTNERS 80 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Winthrop Partners 80 Limited
Partnership (a  Massachusetts  limited  partnership) as of December 31, 1994 and
1993,  and the related  statements of income,  changes in partners'  capital and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 1994.
These  financial   statements  and  the  schedule  referred  to  below  are  the
responsibility  of Winthrop  Partners  80 Limited  Partnership  management.  Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and
schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Winthrop Partners 80 Limited
Partnership  as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III listed in Item 14(a)(2) is
the responsibility of Winthrop Partners 80 Limited Partnership management and is
presented  for  purposes  of  complying   with  the   Securities   and  Exchange
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.
This  schedule  has been  subjected to the  auditing  procedures  applied in our
audits of the basic financial  statements and, in our opinion,  is fairly stated
in all material respects, the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1994


1.         ORGANIZATION

     Winthrop  Partners  80  (the  Partnership),   a  limited  partnership,  was
     organized under the Uniform Limited  Partnership Act of the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts  on  February  5, 1980 for the  purpose of owning and leasing
     commercial and industrial real  properties.  The Partnership will terminate
     on  December  31,  2008,  or sooner,  in  accordance  with the terms of the
     Partnership Agreement.


2.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Financial  Statements - The  financial  statements of the  Partnership  are
     prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  in accordance  with  generally
     accepted accounting principles.

     Income  Taxes - No  provision  has been  made for  federal,  state or local
     income taxes in the financial  statements of the Partnership.  Partners are
     required to report on their individual tax returns their allocable share of
     income,  gains,  losses,  deductions  and credits of the  Partnership.  The
     Partnership prepares tax returns on the accrual basis. On May 16, 1980, the
     Internal  Revenue  Service  issued a ruling  that the  Partnership  will be
     classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

     Distributions  to Partners - The cash  distribution  due  Partners  for the
     three  months  ended  December  31, 1994 is  recorded  in the  accompanying
     financial  statements as a liability and a reduction of Partners'  capital.
     As provided  in the  Partnership  Agreement,  quarterly  distributions  are
     payable to Partners within 60 days after the end of the quarter.

     Percentage  Rent - The  Partnership  has entered into  several  leases that
     provide for a minimum annual rent plus additional rent based on percentages
     of sales at the properties  (percentage  rent).  These percentage rents are
     recorded on a cash basis.  For the years ended December 31, 1994,  1993 and
     1992,  the  Partnership  received  percentage  rent totaling  approximately
     $456,230, $357,870 and $284,419, respectively.

     Leases - The  Partnership  leases its real properties and accounts for such
     leases  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial
     Accounting  Standards  No. 13,  "Accounting  for Leases," as amended.  This
     statement  sets forth  specific  criteria for  determining  whether a lease
     should be accounted for as a financing lease or an operating lease.


     (a) Financing Method

          Under this  method,  minimum  lease  payments to be received  plus the
          estimated value of the property at the end of the lease are considered
          to be  the  Partnership's  gross  investment  in the  lease.  Unearned
          income,  representing  the  difference  between gross  investment  and
          actual cost of the leased  property,  is amortized over the lease term
          using the interest  rate implicit in the lease to provide a level rate
          of return over the lease term.


2.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)


          (b) Operating Method

               Under this  method,  revenue  is  recognized  as rental  payments
               become   due,   which  does  not   materially   differ  from  the
               straightline  method.   Expenses  (including   depreciation)  are
               charged to operations as incurred.


               Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents  consist of
               a mutual  fund that  invests  in  treasury  bills and  repurchase
               agreements that mature in three months or less. Cash  equivalents
               are valued at cost, which approximates market value.

               Depreciation  - Component  depreciation  on real estate leased to
               others,  accounted  for under the operating  method,  is computed
               using the straight-line method over the useful life of each class
               of  asset,  which  ranges  from 5 to 35  years.  The  cost of the
               properties  represents the purchase price of the properties  plus
               acquisition  and  closing  costs,  or,  to the  extent  that  the
               property had  previously  been  accounted for under the financing
               method, the depreciable base is the fair market value at the date
               of implementation of operating lease accounting.


3.         CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

               One  Winthrop  Properties,  Inc.  (One  Winthrop),  the  Managing
               General  Partner,   Winthrop   Securities  Co.,  Inc.   (Winthrop
               Securities),  the  selling  agent  for the  Public  Offering  and
               Winthrop  Management,  the manager of the properties,  are wholly
               owned subsidiaries of First Winthrop  Corporation,  which in turn
               is  wholly  owned by  Winthrop  Financial  Associates,  a limited
               partnership (WFA).  Linnaeus Hampshire Realty Company,  the other
               General Partner of the Partnership,  is a general partnership, of
               which some  general  partners  are  partners of WFA.  WFA and its
               affiliates  manage  or  advise  a large  number  of  partnerships
               organized  to invest in real  properties.  WFA has  formed and is
               planning to form, directly or through affiliates, additional real
               estate investment partnerships or other entities, both public and
               private,  some of which  have or may  have  the  same  investment
               objectives as the Partnership.

               Winthrop  Management  is entitled to annual  property  management
               fees,  equal to 1.5% of the  excess  of cash  receipts  over cash
               expenditures  (excluding debt service,  property  management fees
               and capital  expenditures) from each property it manages. For the
               years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, Winthrop Management
               earned $26,155, $25,446 and $28,072,  respectively,  for managing
               the real properties of the Partnership.

               The General  Partners  are entitled to 8% of Cash  Available  for
               Distribution,  subordinated  to a cumulative  priority  quarterly
               distribution to the Limited  Partners.  The General  Partners are
               also entitled to 8% of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds, subordinated
               to certain  priority  distributions  to the  Limited  Partners as
               provided for in the  Partnership  Agreement.  For the years ended
               December 31, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  the  Partnership  has paid or
               accrued   distributions  from  Cash  Available  for  Distribution
               totaling $134,574,  $133,583 and $147,675,  respectively,  to the
               General  Partners.  The proceeds  from the sales of properties in
               1992 and  1993  (see  Note 6) were  distributed  entirely  to the
               Limited Partners.

               During the  liquidation  stage of the  Partnership,  the  General
               Partners   and  their   affiliates   are   entitled   to  receive
               distributions,  subordinated to specified  minimum returns to the
               Limited Partners, as described in the Partnership Agreement.

6.         SALES OF PROPERTIES

               On  September  8, 1993,  the  Partnership  sold the Dairy Mart in
               Berkeley,  Michigan,  for $120,000 in cash,  and on September 30,
               1993,  the  Partnership  sold  the  Greenville,  South  Carolina,
               property for $345,000 in cash. The sales provided $435,582 of net
               proceeds,  which were  distributed  in the fourth quarter of 1993
               and resulted in a net loss of $105,909.

               On July  24,  1992,  the  Partnership  sold the  Beaufort,  South
               Carolina,  property for  $1,300,000 in cash,  and on September 4,
               1992, the Partnership sold the Anderson, South Carolina, property
               for  $250,000  in cash.  The  sales  provided  $1,520,040  of net
               proceeds,  which were  distributed  in the fourth quarter of 1992
               and resulted in a net gain of $279,938.

7.         TAXABLE INCOME

               The Partnership's taxable income for 1994 differs from net income
               for financial reporting purposes primarily due to the differences
               in the methods used for the recognition of  depreciation  and the
               accounting  for certain real property  leases under the financing
               method for financial  reporting purposes and the operating method
               for tax return purposes. Taxable income for 1994 is as follows:
