Item 1.  BUSINESS
         (a) General Development of Business. Dean Witter Multi-Market
Portfolio, L.P. (formerly named Dean Witter Principal Guaranteed Fund
L.P.) (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed to
engage in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and other
commodity interests, including, but not limited to, forward contracts on
foreign currencies and options on futures contracts and physical
commodities.
         Units of limited partnership interest in the Partnership were
registered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 33-
21532) which became effective on June 24, 1988.  The offering of units was
underwritten on a "best efforts" basis by Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
("DWR"), a commodity broker and an affiliated corporation of the
Partnership's General Partner, Demeter Management Corporation ("Demeter"). 
The Partnership commenced operations on August 31, 1988.  On September 30,
1993 the guarantee with respect to the Partnership terminated, Commodity
Corporation (U.S.A.) N.V., the original trading manager of the Partnership
resigned and was replaced by Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management
Inc. ("DWFCM"), an affiliate of DWR and Demeter.  The Partnership was
renamed as indicated above and is trading in a non-guaranteed structure
with all assets committed to trading.  The Partnership's net asset value
per unit, as of December 31, 1995, was $1,080.82 representing a decrease
of 6.37    percent from the net asset value per unit of $1,154.31 at
December 31, 1994.  For a more detailed description of the Partnership's

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Liquidity.  The Partnership's assets are deposited in separate
commodity trading accounts with DWR the commodity broker, and are used by
the Partnership as margin to engage in commodity futures, forward
contracts on foreign currencies and other commodity interest trading.  DWR
holds such assets in either segregated designated depositories or in
securities approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
for investment of customer funds.  The Partnership's assets held by DWR
may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading.  Since the
Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in commodity futures contracts, and
other commodity interests, it is expected that the Partnership will
continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.
         The Partnership's investment in commodity futures contracts and
other commodity interests may be illiquid.  If the price for a futures
contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an
amount equal to the "daily limit", positions in the commodity can neither
be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or
within the limit.  Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved the
daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading.  Such
market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating
its commodity futures positions.
         There is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward
contracts on foreign currencies.  The markets for some world currencies
have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the
Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the
Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such
markets and subjecting it to substantial losses. 
         Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on
redemptions.<PAGE>
         Market Risk.  The Partnership trades futures, options and
forward contracts in interest rates, stock indices, commodities and currencies.
In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Partnership
(market risk) that such contracts may be significantly influenced by
market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such
contracts being less valuable.  If the markets should move against all of
the commodity interest positions held by the Partnership at the same time,
and if the Trading Advisor was unable to offset commodity interest
positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its
assets.  The Partnership has established Trading Policies for liquidity
and leverage which help control market risk.  Both the Trading Advisor and
Demeter monitor the Partnership's trading activities on a daily basis to
ensure compliance with the Trading Policies.  Demeter may (under terms of
the Management Agreement) override the trading instructions of the Trading
Advisor to the extent necessary to comply with the Partnership's Trading
Policies.
         Credit Risk.  In addition to market risk, the Partnership is subject
to credit risk in that a counterparty may not be able to meet its
obligations to the Partnership.  The counterparty of the Partnership for
futures contracts traded in the United States and most foreign exchanges
on which the Partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such
exchange.  In general, clearinghouses are backed by the membership of the
exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its
members or one of its members' customers, and as such, should
significantly reduce this credit risk.  In cases where the Partnership
trades on exchanges where the clearinghouse is not backed by the
membership or when the Partnership enters into off-exchange contracts with
a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the 
<PAGE>
clearinghouse or the counterparty as the case may be.  With respect to
futures contracts, DWR, in its business as an international commodity
broker, constantly monitors the credit-worthiness of the exchanges and
clearing members of the foreign exchanges with which it does business for
clients, including the Partnership.  If DWR believes that there was a
problem with the credit-worthiness of an exchange on which the Partnership
deals, it would so advise Demeter.  With respect to forward contract
trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which
Demeter, together with DWR, have determined to be creditworthy.  As set
forth in the Partnership's Trading Policies, in determining credit-
worthiness, Demeter and DWR consult with the Corporate Credit Department
of DWR.  Currently, the Partnership deals solely with DWR as its
counterparty on forward contracts.  While DWR and Demeter monitor credit-
worthiness and risk involved in dealing on the various exchanges and with
counterparties, there can be no assurance that an exchange or counterparty
will be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. 
         Capital Resources.  The Partnership does not have, nor does it
expect to have, any capital assets.  Redemptions of additional Units in
the future will impact the amount of funds available for investments in
commodity futures, forward contracts on foreign currencies and other
commodity interests in subsequent periods.  As redemptions are at the
discretion of Limited Partners, it is not possible to estimate the amount
and therefore, the impact of future redemptions.
         Results of Operations.  As of December 31, 1995, the Partnership's
total capital was $15,547,338, a decrease of $3,808,992 from the
Partnership's total capital of $19,356,330 at December 31, 1994.  For the

$1,045,666 and total redemptions aggregated $2,763,326.

DEAN WITTER MULTI-MARKET PORTFOLIO
(FORMERLY DEAN WITTER PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND)
ANNUAL REPORT 1995
 
Dear Limited Partner:
 
This marks the eighth annual report for the Dean Witter Multi-Market Portfolio
(the "Fund"). The Fund began the year at a Net Asset Value per Unit of
$1,154.31 and finished the year at a Net Asset Value per Unit of $1,080.82,
reflecting a loss of 6.4%. Since its inception in September 1988, the Fund has
increased by 8.1% (a compound annualized return of 1.1%).
 
The first quarter of 1995 began with losses recorded during January as a result
of trading in the currency and financial futures markets. In currency trading,
an upward move in the value of the most major European currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar, followed by an extremely sharp and sudden reversal late in the
month, resulted in Fund losses. Smaller losses were the result of trading
global interest rate futures. Trading gains were recorded in February and March
as global financial futures prices strengthened, resulting in profits for the
Fund's long stock index and bond futures positions. Additional gains during
February and March were experienced in currency trading due to a strengthening
in the value of the Japanese yen and most major European currencies versus the
U.S dollar.
 
The Fund posted profits during April as a result of a continued upward move in
global financial futures prices. Smaller gains were recorded from trading in
the currency and energy futures markets. Short-term volatile price movement in
the currency and energy markets resulted in losses for the Fund
<PAGE>
 
during May. Additional losses were recorded from trendless price movement in
base metals, as well as in soft commodities. Smaller trading gains recorded in
international interest rate futures offset a portion of these losses. During
June, international bond futures prices retreated from their previous four
month upward trend resulting in losses to the Fund. Additional losses were
recorded in the currency markets from transactions involving the Canadian
dollar, Japanese yen and most major European currencies.
 
Trendless price movement in a majority of the markets traded during July
resulted in losses for the Fund. The most significant losses were experienced
in agricultural futures trading. Smaller losses were experienced from trading
in the financial, metals and energy futures markets. Smaller losses were
recorded by the Fund in August as trading gains in the currency markets were
more than offset by trading losses in U.S. financial futures and commodities
trading. During September, currency trading resulted in losses due primarily to
a sharp and extremely significant reversal in the upward move of the U.S.
dollar relative to most European currencies on September 20 and 21. Energy
futures prices also reversed their previous upward move, resulting in
additional losses for the Fund.
 
Continued trendless price movement in energy futures resulted in losses during
October. Additional losses were recorded in global financial futures and soft
commodities trading as prices in each of these markets moved without consistent
direction. During November, trendless price movement in the currency markets,
as well as in a majority of the other markets traded, resulted in Fund losses
for the month. Energy prices broke out of their previous trendless pattern and
moved higher during December enabling the Fund to record profits from long
positions in oil and gas futures. Additional gains during December were
recorded in agricultural and
<PAGE>
 
financial futures, as well as in soft commodities.
 
Overall, 1995 proved to be a difficult year for the Fund as a result of
extended periods of short-term volatile price movement in a majority of the
traditional commodities futures markets. Trading gains in the financial futures
and currency markets during 1995 offset a portion of the overall losses for the
Fund. We continue to have confidence in the diversified trading approach of
Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc., the Fund's sole Trading Advisor
since September 1993 and believe this confidence is well-founded based on the
longer term track record of other funds traded by Dean Witter Futures &
Currency Management Inc.
 
Should you have any questions concerning this report, please feel free to
contact Demeter Management Corporation at Two World Trade Center, 62nd Floor,
New York, NY 10048, or your Dean Witter Account Executive.
 
I hereby affirm, that to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information
contained in this report is accurate and complete. Past performance is not a
guarantee of future results.

DEAN WITTER MULTI-MARKET PORTFOLIO L.P.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
The Limited Partners and the General Partner:
 
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Dean
Witter Multi-Market Portfolio L.P. (formerly Dean Witter Principal Guaranteed
Fund L.P.) (the "Partnership") as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
statements of operations, changes in partners' capital, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis

DEAN WITTER MULTI-MARKET PORTFOLIO L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
ORGANIZATION--Dean Witter Multi-Market Portfolio L.P. (the "Partnership")
(formerly Dean Witter Principal Guaranteed Fund L.P.) is a limited partnership
organized to engage in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts,
commodity options contracts and forward contracts on foreign currencies. The
general partner for the Partnership is Demeter Management Corporation (the
"General Partner"). The commodity broker is Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ("DWR").
DWR and the General Partner are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Dean Witter,
Discover & Co.
 
Through September 30, 1993, when the Partnership's original guarantee expired,
the General Partner retained Commodities Corporation (U.S.A.) N.V. ("C.C.") as
the trading manager of the Partnership. Effective October 1, 1993, the
Partnership was renamed and Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management
("DWFCM"), was retained as sole trading advisor in a non-guaranteed structure
with all assets committed to trading.
 
The General Partner is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity
of the Partnership and income (losses) are shared by the General and Limited
Partners based upon their proportional ownership interests.
 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements.
 
REVENUE RECOGNITION--Commodity futures contracts, commodity options and forward
contracts on foreign currencies are open commitments until settlement date.
They are valued at market and the resulting unrealized gains and losses are
reflected in income. Monthly, DWR pays the Partnership interest income based
upon 80% of the average daily Net Assets for the month that are allocated for
commodity trading and 100% of the average daily Net Assets for the month that
are not allocated for commodity trading at a rate equal to the average yield on
13-Week U.S. Treasury Bills issued during such month. For purposes of such
interest payments, Net Assets do not include monies due the Partnership on
forward contracts and other commodity interests, but not actually received.
<PAGE>
 
DEAN WITTER MULTI-MARKET PORTFOLIO L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER UNIT--Net income (loss) per Unit is computed using the
weighted average number of units outstanding during the period.
 
EQUITY IN COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNTS--The Partnership's asset "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" consists of cash on deposit at DWR to be
used as margin for trading and the net asset or liability related to unrealized
gains or losses on open contracts. The asset or liability related to the
unrealized gains or losses on forward contracts is presented as a net amount
because the Partnership has a master netting agreement with DWR.
 
BROKERAGE FEES AND RELATED TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS--The monthly brokerage
fee is equal to 3/4 of 1% per month of the Partnership's adjusted month-end Net
Assets, as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement, that are allocated for
commodity trading. Through September 30, 1993, the monthly brokerage fee was
equal to 4/5 of 1%. Transaction fees and costs are accrued on a half-turn
basis.
 
OPERATING EXPENSES--The Partnership incurs a monthly management fee and may
incur an incentive fee. Also, pursuant to a Letter of Credit and Reimbursement
Agreement with C.C. and Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"), the Partnership paid to
Citibank a monthly Letter of Credit fee equal to 1/12 of 1% of the amount
available to be drawn under the letter of credit through the September 30, 1993
expiration of the guarantee. The General Partner and/or DWR bear all other
operating expenses.
 
GUARANTEE--At inception, the Partnership entered into an Agreement of
Guarantee, supported by the above-mentioned letter of credit, with C.C. and
C.C. Guarantee Corporation pursuant to which any Limited Partner who redeemed
Units as of September 30, 1993 (the "Guaranteed Redemption Date") would receive
at least $1,000 for each Unit redeemed. The Partnership's Net Asset Value per
Unit was above $1,000 on September 30, 1993 when the guarantee expired.
 
REDEMPTIONS--Limited Partners may redeem some or all of their Units at 100% of
the Net Asset Value per Unit on the special redemption dates described in the
Limited Partnership Agreement or as of the last day of any fiscal quarter upon
five business days advance notice by redemption form to the General Partner.
 
DISTRIBUTIONS--Distributions, other than on redemptions of Units, are made on a
pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of the General Partner. No distributions
have been made to date.

DEAN WITTER MULTI-MARKET PORTFOLIO L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
INCOME TAXES--No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying
financial statements, as partners are individually responsible for reporting
income or loss based upon their respective share of the Partnership's revenues
and expenses for income tax purposes.
 
DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP--The Partnership will terminate on December 31,
2025 or at an earlier date if certain conditions set forth in the Limited
Partnership Agreement occur.
 
2. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
The Partnership's cash is on deposit with DWR in commodity trading accounts to
meet margin requirements as needed. DWR pays interest on these funds as
described in Note 1. Under its Customer Agreement with DWR the Partnership pays
DWR a monthly brokerage fee as described in Note 1.
 
The General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership and itself, has entered into
a Management Agreement with DWFCM to make all trading decisions for the
Partnership.
 
Compensation to DWFCM by the Partnership consists of a management fee and an
incentive fee as follows:
 
MANAGEMENT FEE--As of the last day of each month, the Partnership pays a
monthly management fee equal to 1/4 of 1% of the Partnership's adjusted Net
Assets, as defined, that are allocated to commodity interest trading accounts
which DWFCM trades on behalf of the Partnership.
 
INCENTIVE FEE--The Partnership will pay a quarterly incentive fee equal to 15%
of the "Trading Profits" as defined, earned by the Partnership as of the end of
each calendar quarter. No incentive fee will be paid until the existing trading
loss carryforward (adjusted for redemptions) has been recovered.
 
Prior to October 1, 1993, C.C. was paid a monthly management fee equal to 1/2
of 1% of the Partnership's Adjusted Net Assets and an annual incentive fee
equal to 20% of the Partnership's "New Appreciation" as defined in the Limited
Partnership Agreement.
 
3. CHANGES IN TRADING ASSETS
 
Pursuant to the now expired Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement,
through September 30, 1993, maximum Net Assets allocable to trading had to be
adjusted periodically due to changes in the net asset value per unit, interest
rates and the time remaining until the guaranteed redemption date. Adjustments

were accomplished by reallocating assets from advisors to a non-traded reserve
account. The assets not allocated to trading advisors earned interest income at
a rate equal to the average yield on 13-week U.S. Treasury Bills and no
management and brokerage fees were charged on such assets.
 
Maximum net assets allocable to trading were adjusted as required throughout
1993 and stood at 37.5% at September 30, 1993.
 
On September 30, 1993, the guarantee and related deleverage provisions expired.
Effective October 1, 1993, 100% of net assets were allocated to trading and
remained at this level through December 31, 1995.
 
4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Partnership trades futures, options and forward contracts in interest
rates, stock indices, commodities, currencies, petroleum, and precious metals.
Futures and forwards represent contracts for delayed delivery of an instrument
at a specified date and price. Risk arises from changes in the value of these
contracts and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the
terms of the contracts. There are numerous factors which may significantly
influence the market value of these contracts, including interest rate
volatility. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, open contracts were:

A portion of the amounts indicated as off-balance-sheet risk in forward foreign
currency contracts is due to offsetting forward commitments to purchase and to
sell the same currency on the same date in the future. These commitments are
economically offsetting, but are not offset in the forward market until the
settlement date.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
The unrealized gains on open contracts are reported as a component of "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" on the Statements of Financial Condition
and totaled $976,590 and $2,530,293 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
 
Of the $976,590 net unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1995,
$1,563,573 related to exchange-traded futures contracts and $(586,983) related
to off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts. Of the $2,530,293 net
unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1994, $1,997,352 related to
exchange-traded futures contracts and $532,941 related to off-exchange-traded
forward currency contracts.
 
Exchange-traded futures contracts held by the Partnership at December 31, 1995
and December 31, 1994 mature through September 1996 and June 1995,
respectively. Off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts held by the
Partnership at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994 mature through February
1996 and March 1995, respectively. The contract amounts in the above table
represent the Partnership's extent of involvement in the particular class of
financial instrument, but not the credit risk associated with counterparty
nonperformance. The credit risk associated with these instruments is limited to
the amounts reflected in the Partnership's Statements of Financial Condition.
 
The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty, with
respect to most of the Partnership's assets, is DWR. Exchange-traded futures
and options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis, with variations in
value settled on a daily basis. DWR, as the futures commission merchant for all
of the Partnership's exchange-traded futures and options contracts, is required
pursuant to regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
segregate from its own assets, and for the sole benefit of its commodity
customers, all funds held by DWR with respect to exchange-traded futures and
option contracts including an amount equal to the net unrealized gain on all
open futures and option contracts which funds totaled $16,447,666 and
$19,151,118 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. With respect to the
Partnership's off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts, there are no
daily settlements of variations in value nor is there any requirement that an
amount equal to the net unrealized gain on open forward and option contracts be
segregated. With respect to those off-exchange-traded forward currency
contracts, the Partnership is at risk to the ability of DWR, the counterparty
on all of such contracts, to perform.
