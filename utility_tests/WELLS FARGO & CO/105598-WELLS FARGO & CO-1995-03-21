DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GENERAL

          Wells Fargo & Company (Parent) is a bank holding company registered
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  Based on assets at
December 31, 1994, it was the 15th largest bank holding company in the United
States.  Its principal subsidiary is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Bank), the seventh
largest bank in the U.S.  Wells Fargo & Company and its subsidiaries are
hereinafter referred to as the Company.

THE BANK

          HISTORY AND GROWTH

          The Bank is the successor to the banking portion of the business
founded by Henry Wells and William G. Fargo in 1852.  That business later
operated the westernmost leg of the Pony Express and ran stagecoach lines in the
western part of the United States.  The California banking business was
separated from the express business in 1905 and was merged in 1960 with American
Trust Company, another of the oldest banks in the Western United States.  The
Bank became Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, in 1968.
Its head office is located in San Francisco, California.

          In 1986, the Company acquired from Midland Bank plc all the common
stock of Crocker National Corporation, a bank holding company whose principal
subsidiary was Crocker National Bank, the 17th largest bank in the U.S. at the
time.  In 1988, the Company acquired Barclays Bank of California with assets of
$1.3 billion.

          In 1990 and 1991, the Company completed the two-phase purchase of the
130-branch California network of Great American Bank (GA), a Federal Savings
Bank.  The Company acquired assets with a GA book value of $5.8 billion.

          Also during 1990, the Company completed the acquisition of four
California banking companies with combined assets of $1.9 billion:  Valley
National Bank of Glendale, Central Pacific Corporation of Bakersfield, the
Torrey Pines Group of Solana Beach and Citizens Holdings and its two banking
subsidiaries in Orange County.

          For further information, see the Line of Business Results section of
the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.

NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES

          The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries that provide various
banking-related services.  In the aggregate, these subsidiaries are not material
to the Company's assets or net income.

COMPETITION

          The Company competes for deposits, loans and other banking services in
its principal geographic market in California, as well as in selected national
markets as opportunities arise.  The banking business is highly competitive and
has become increasingly so in recent years; the industry continues to
consolidate and strong, unregulated competitors have entered core banking
markets with focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments.
These unregulated competitors, such as investment companies, specialized lenders
and multinational financial services companies, compete across geographic
boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to
banking services in nearly all significant products.  These competitive trends
are likely to continue.

          Within the banking industry, ongoing consolidation has increased
pressure on the Company from its most significant competitor in California, Bank
of America, now the second largest bank holding company in the United States.
Moreover, federal and state legislation adopted in recent years has increased
competition by allowing banking organizations from other parts of the country to
enter the Company's core geographic market (see "Supervision and Regulation" for
further discussion of such legislation and the competitive environment in which
the Company operates).

          Among commercial banks, the Bank is presently the second largest
holder of customer deposits in California.  There is no meaningful measure of
overall market share within the broadly defined financial services industry.

MONETARY POLICY

          The earnings of the Company are affected not only by general economic
conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory
authorities in the U.S. and abroad.  In particular, the Federal Reserve System
exerts a substantial influence on interest rates and credit conditions,
primarily through open market operations in U.S. Government securities, varying
the discount rate on member bank borrowings and setting reserve requirements
against deposits.  Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant
effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are
expected to continue to do so in the future.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

          Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Company is required to file
reports of its operations with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and is subject to examination by it.  Further, the Act restricts the
activities in which the Company may engage and the nature of any company in
which the Parent may own more than 5% of the voting shares.  Generally,
permissible activities are limited to banking, the business of managing and
controlling banks, and activities so closely related to banking as determined by
the Board of Governors to be proper incidents thereto.

          Under the Act, the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of
any domestic bank or savings association or the ownership or control of more
than 5% of its voting shares by a bank holding company is subject to prior
approval by the Board of Governors.  In no case, however, may the Board approve
the acquisition by the Parent of the voting shares of, or substantially all
assets of, any bank located outside of California unless such acquisition is
specifically authorized by the laws of the state in which the bank to be
acquired is located or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) arranges
the acquisition under its authority to aid financially troubled banks.  Federal
legislation enacted in 1994 will remove many of the remaining barriers to
interstate expansion and acquisition.  Effective September 29, 1995, bank
holding companies which are adequately capitalized and adequately managed will
be permitted to make interstate acquisitions of banks without regard to state
law restrictions.  Beginning in 1997, the merger of commonly owned banks in
different states will also be permitted, except in states which have passed
legislation to prohibit such mergers.  The new statute will also permit banks to
establish branches outside their home state in states which pass legislation to
permit such interstate branching.

          The Bank is subject to certain restrictions under the Federal Reserve
Act, including restrictions on the terms of transactions between the Bank and
its affiliates and on any extension of credit to its affiliates.  Dividends
payable by the Bank to the Parent without the express approval of the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency are limited by a formula.  For more information
regarding restrictions on loans and dividends by the Bank to its affiliates, see
Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.

          There are various requirements and restrictions in the laws of the
U.S. and California affecting the Bank and its operations, including
restrictions on the amount of its loans and the nature and amount of its
investments, its activities as an underwriter of securities, its opening of
branches and its acquisition of other banks or savings associations.  The Bank,
as a


                                        4


<PAGE>

national bank, is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and the FDIC.

          Major regulatory changes affecting the Bank, banking and the financial
services industry in general have occurred in the last several years and can be
expected to occur increasingly in the future.  Federal banking legislation since
1980 has deregulated interest rate ceilings on deposits at banks and thrift
institutions, has increased the types of accounts that can be offered and has
increased the cost of FDIC insurance of deposits.  Generally, the effect of
these changes has been to increase the Bank's cost of its traditionally
important sources of consumer deposits.  In addition, federal banking
legislation has narrowed the functional distinctions among financial
institutions.  The consumer and commercial banking powers of thrift institutions
have expanded, and state-chartered banks are authorized to engage in all
activities which are permissible for national banks and in certain cases may,
with approval of the FDIC, engage in activities, such as insurance underwriting,
which are not authorized for national banks.

          Non-depository institutions can be expected to increase the extent to
which they act as financial intermediaries, particularly in the area of consumer
credit services.  Large institutional users and sources of credit may also
increase the extent to which they interact directly, meeting business credit
needs outside the banking system.  Furthermore, the geographic constraints on
portions of the financial services industry can be expected to continue to
erode.

          These changes create significant opportunities for the Company, as
well as the financial services industry, to compete in financial markets on a
less-regulated basis.  They also suggest that the Company and, particularly, the
Bank will face new and major competitors in geographic and product markets in
which their operations historically have been protected by banking laws and
regulations.

ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME

          The following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates
for both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Because of
the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is not
possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate.  For this
table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to
these categories in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and
average rate.

          The Securities and Exchange Commission requires the Company to present
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans.  This
ratio was 367% and 178% at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  This ratio
may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to such factors as the
prospects of borrowers and the value and marketability of collateral as well as,
for the nonaccrual portfolio taken as a whole, wide variances from period to
period in terms of delinquency and relationship of book to contractual principal
balance.  (For example, at December 31, 1994 and 1993, the percentage of
nonaccrual loan balances that were current as to payment of principal and
interest were 32% and 50%, respectively.)  Classification of a loan as
nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal of a loan is
uncollectible in whole or in part.  Consequently, the ratio of the allowance for
loan losses to nonaccrual loans, taken alone and without taking into account
numerous additional factors, is not a reliable indicator of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses.  Indicators of the credit quality of the Company's
loan portfolio and the method of determining the allowance for loan losses are
discussed in the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.

ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

          The table on the following page provides a breakdown of the allowance
for loan losses by loan category.  The allocated component of the allowance
reflects inherent losses resulting from the analysis of individual loans and is
developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and
historical loss experience for each loan category and degree of criticism within
each category.  The total of these allocations is then supplemented by the
unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses, which includes
adjustments to the historical loss experience for the various loan categories to
reflect any current conditions that could affect loss recognition.  The
unallocated component includes management's judgmental determination of the
amounts necessary for concentrations, economic uncertainties and other
subjective factors; correspondingly, the relationship of the unallocated
component to the total allowance for loan losses may fluctuate significantly
from period to period.  Although management has allocated the allowance to
specific loan categories, the adequacy of the allowance must be considered in
its entirety.

(1)   In 1992, the calculation method for the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for credit card loans was changed in order
      to better conform  to industry practice, whereby the allocation now approximates 7 months (formerly, 18 to 21 months) of
      projected losses.  Based on the revised method, the estimated allocation for credit card loans would have been reduced (and,
      correspondingly, the unallocated portion of the allowance would have been increased) by about $140 million and $130 million at
      December 31, 1991 and 1990, respectively.
(2)   This amount and any unabsorbed portion of the allocated allowance are also available for any of the above listed loan
      categories.

DEPOSITS

          At December 31, 1994, the contractual principal maturities of domestic
time certificates of deposit and other time deposits issued in amounts of
$100,000 or more were as follows (based on time remaining until maturity):
$522 million maturing in 3 months or less; $227 million over 3 through 6 months;
$396 million over 6 through 12 months and $471 million over 12 months.

          Time certificates of deposit and other time deposits issued by foreign
offices in amounts of $100,000 or more represent substantially all of the
foreign deposit liabilities of $3,540 million at December 31, 1994.

By-Laws governing the calling, notice and place of special meetings of the Board
of Directors shall apply to all meetings of any Committee unless such committee
fixes a time and place for regular meetings, in which case notice for such
meeting shall be unnecessary.  The provisions of these By-Laws regarding actions
taken by the Board of Directors, however called or noticed, shall apply to all

complete record of its proceedings, which shall be available for inspection by

be filled by the Board of Directors.  Directors Emeriti may attend meetings of
the Board of Directors and, if appointed thereto as an advisor by the Board of
Directors, meetings of Committees with the privilege of participating in all

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

          SECTION 1.  ACTION, ETC. OTHER THAN BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE
CORPORATION.  The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, and whether external or internal to the corporation (other than
a judicial action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was an


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Agent (as hereinafter defined) against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by the Agent in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, or any appeal
therein, if the Agent acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe such conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding -- whether by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea
of nolo contendere or its equivalent -- shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the Agent did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or
she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the
Agent had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.  For
purposes of this Article, an "Agent" shall be any director, officer of employee
of the corporation, or any person who, being or having been such a director,
officer or employee, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

          SECTION 2.  ACTION, ETC. BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION.  The
corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed judicial action or suit
brought by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor
by reason of the fact that such person is or was an Agent (as defined above)
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense,
settlement or appeal of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and
in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent the Court
of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

indemnify for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.

          SECTION 3.  DETERMINATION OF RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION OR CONTRIBUTION.
Unless otherwise ordered by a court, any indemnification under Section 1 or 2,
and any contribution under Section 6, of this Article shall be made by the
corporation to an Agent unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made,
either (i) by the Board of Directors acting by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of Directors who were not party to such action, suit or proceeding,
or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or if obtainable and such quorum so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the
stockholders, that such Agent acted in bad faith and in a manner that such Agent
did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation
or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Agent believed or had
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

          SECTION 4.  ADVANCES OF EXPENSES.  Except as limited by Section 5 of
this Article, costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred
by an Agent in defense of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of the
nature referred to in Section 1 or 2 of this Article or any appeal therefrom
shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
matter; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of Delaware then
so requires, such payment shall be made only if the Agent shall undertake to
reimburse the corporation for such payment in the event that it is ultimately
determined, as provided herein, that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

          SECTION 5.  RIGHT OF AGENT TO INDEMNIFICATION OR ADVANCE UPON
APPLICATION; PROCEDURE UPON APPLICATION.  Any indemnification under Section 1 or
2, or advance under Section 4, of this Article shall be made promptly and in any
event within 90 days, upon the written request of the Agent, unless with respect
to an application under said Sections 1 or 2 an adverse determination is
reasonably and promptly made pursuant to Section 3 of this Article or unless
with respect to an application under said Section 4 an adverse determination is
made pursuant to said Section 4.  The right to indemnification or advances as
granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Agent in any court of
competent jurisdiction if the Board of Directors or independent


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

legal counsel improperly denies the claim, in whole or in part, or if no
disposition of such claim is made within 90 days.  It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where any required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation)
that the Agent has not met the standards of conduct which would require the
corporation to indemnify or advance the amount claimed, but the burden of
proving such defense shall be on the corporation.  Neither the failure of the
corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel and the
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances because
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel and the stockholders) that the Agent had not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the Agent had not met the applicable standard of conduct.  The Agent's
costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or
her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall
also be indemnified by the corporation.

          SECTION 6.  CONTRIBUTION.  In the event that the indemnification
provided for in this Article is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to an Agent in whole or in part, then in respect of any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the corporation is
jointly liable with the Agent (or would be if joined in such action, suit or
proceeding), to the extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware
the corporation shall contribute to the amount of expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred and paid or payable by the Agent in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the corporation on the one hand
and the Agent on the other from the transaction from which such action, suit or
proceeding arose and (ii) the relative fault of the corporation on the one hand
and of the Agent on the other in connection with the events which resulted in
such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the corporation on the
one hand and of the Agent on the other shall be determined by


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

reference to, among other things, the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
resulting in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts.

          SECTION 7.  OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.  Indemnification under this
Article shall be provided regardless of when the events alleged to underlie any
action, suit or proceeding may have occurred, shall continue as to a person who
has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.  All rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses under this Article shall be deemed to be provided by a
contract between the corporation and the Agent who serves as such at any time
while these By-Laws and other relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law
of Delaware and other applicable law, if any, are in effect.  Any repeal or
modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.

          SECTION 8.  INSURANCE.  Upon resolution passed by the Board of
Directors, the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was an Agent against any liability asserted against such person
and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
status as such, regardless of whether the corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article.  The corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or
use other means, including without limitation a letter of credit, to ensure the
payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect indemnification as
provided herein.

          SECTION 9.  CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS.  For the purposes of this
Article, references to "the corporation" include all constituent corporations
(including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or
merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who
is or was a director, officer or employee of such a constituent corporation or
who, being or having been such a director, officer or employee, is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this
Article with respect to the resulting or surviving


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

corporation as such person would if he or she had served the resulting or
surviving corporation in the same capacity.

          SECTION 10.  OTHER ENTERPRISES, FINES, AND SERVING AT CORPORATION'S
REQUEST.  For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprise" in
Sections 1 and 9 shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines"
shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the corporation"
shall include any service by an Agent as director, officer, employee, trustee or
agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such
Agent with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants, or
beneficiaries.  A person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not
opposed to the best interest of the corporation" for purposes of this Article.

          SECTION 11.  SAVINGS CLAUSE.  If this Article or any portion hereof
shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then
the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Agent as to expenses
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, finds and amounts paid in settlement with
respect to any action, suit, appeal, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand
jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the
corporation, to the full extent permitted by the applicable portion of this
Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

          SECTION 12.  ACTIONS INITIATED BY AGENT.  Anything to the contrary in
this Article notwithstanding, the corporation shall indemnify any Agent in
connection with an action, suit or proceeding initiated by such Agent (other
than actions, suits, or proceedings commenced pursuant to Section 5 of this
Article) only if such action, suit or proceeding was authorized by the Board of
Directors.

          SECTION 13.  STATUTORY AND OTHER INFORMATION.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Article, the corporation shall indemnify any Agent and
advance expenses incurred by such Agent in any action, suit or proceeding of the
nature referred to in Section 1 or 2 of this Article to the


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same
may be amended from time to time, except that no amount shall be paid pursuant
to this Article in the event of an adverse determination pursuant to Section 3
of this Article or in respect of remuneration to the extent that it shall be
determined to have been paid in violation of law or in respect of amounts owing
under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by any provision of this
Article, including without limitation those rights conferred by the preceding
sentence, shall not be deemed exclusive of, and shall not affect, any other
rights to which an Agent seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under any provision of any law, certificate of incorporation,
by-law, agreement or by any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while serving as an Agent.  The corporation may, by action of
the Board of Directors, provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to
agents of the corporation to the extent deemed appropriate, not to exceed the
scope and effect provided under this Article to directors, officers and
employees.

                                    ARTICLE V

of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the President, an Executive Vice
President, a Senior Vice President, or a Vice President, and (ii) the Treasurer,
an Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary.  Any of the
signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer in the stock transfer book of the corporation, the
registered owner for any share of stock of the corporation shall be treated as
the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notice, and to exercise all
other rights and receive all other


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

entitlements of a stockholder with respect to such share, except as may be
provided otherwise by law.

          SECTION 3.  EXECUTION OF WRITTEN INSTRUMENTS.  All written instruments
shall be binding upon the corporation if signed on its behalf by (i) any two of
the following officers:  the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Vice
Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairmen or the Executive Vice Presidents; or
(ii) any one of the foregoing officers signing jointly with any Senior Vice
President.  Whenever any other officer or person shall be authorized to execute
any agreement, document or instrument by resolution of the Board of Directors,
or by the Chief Executive Officer, or by any two of the officers identified in
the immediately preceding sentence, such execution by such other officer or
person shall be equally binding upon the corporation.

          SECTION 4.  SUBSIDIARY.  As used in these By-Laws the term
"subsidiary" or "subsidiaries" means any corporation 25 percent or more of whose
voting shares is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the corporation,
or any other affiliate of the corporation designated in writing as a subsidiary
of the corporation by the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation.  All such
written designations shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation.

          SECTION 5.  AMENDMENTS.  These By-Laws may be altered, amended or
repealed by a vote of the stockholders entitled to exercise a majority of the
voting power of the corporation, by written consent of such stockholders or by
the Board of Directors.

          SECTION 6.  ANNUAL REPORT.  The Board of Directors shall cause an
annual report to be sent to the stockholders not later than 120 days after the
close of the fiscal year and at least 15 days prior to the annual meeting of
stockholders to be held during the ensuing fiscal year.

          SECTION 7.  CONSTRUCTION.  Unless the context clearly requires it,
nothing in these By-Laws shall be construed as a limitation on any powers or
rights of the corporation, its Directors or its officers provided by the General
Corporation Law of Delaware.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the General


                                      -20-

statute.

          SECTION 9.  NOTICES; WAIVERS.  Whenever, under any provision of the
General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these

notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before

     PURPOSE:   Wells Fargo & Company ("Company") hereby establishes this
Executive Loan Plan ("Plan") pursuant to Article IV, Section 8 of its By-Laws
and Section 315(b) of the California Corporations Code in order to enable the
Company to attract and retain outstanding executives in key management positions
with the Company and its subsidiaries by offering such individuals financial
assistance, either through direct loans from the Company or through Company
guarantees of third-party loans, for such purposes as are described herein.

     ADMINISTRATION:   The Plan shall be administered by the Management
Development and Compensation Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors
of the Company ("Board").  The Committee shall have full authority to adopt
rules, regulations, and guidelines for the proper administration of the Plan and
may appoint one or more officers of the Company or Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(collectively, "Administrators") who shall each have the authority to authorize
extensions or guarantees of loans pursuant to the terms of the Plan and any
rules, regulations, or guidelines adopted hereunder by the Committee.  In no
event, however, shall any individual Administrator participate in the
authorization of the extension or guarantee of any loan in which he or she has
an interest.

     ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE:   Executives of the Company and its
subsidiaries, including officers (whether or not they are directors), may from
time to time request financial assistance from the Company in accordance with
the provisions of this Plan.

     Loans extended or guaranteed may be either mortgage loans or general
purpose loans.   A mortgage loan shall be for the purpose of purchasing or
constructing the executive's principal residence, improving his or her principal
residence, refinancing outstanding indebtedness on his or her principal
residence (including an indebtedness to the Company or one of its subsidiaries),
or a combination thereof.  A general purpose loan shall be for the purpose of
personal household expenses, education or support of dependents, extraordinary
medical or dental expenses of the individual or dependents, expenses relating to
the executive's principal residence, income taxes, or such other purposes as an
Administrator shall deem appropriate; provided that no general purpose loan
shall be made solely for investment purposes.  Loans to acquire shares of common
stock under a stock option plan or similar plan of the Company shall be made
solely in accordance with the terms of such plan and not pursuant to this Plan.

     No financial assistance shall be provided to an executive under the Plan,
unless an Administrator determines that the purpose for which such assistance is
requested is one of the purposes authorized under the Plan and that a Company
loan or guarantee under the Plan on behalf of such executive would be in the
best interests of the

<PAGE>

Company.  The Administrators shall make semiannual reports to the Committee of
loans extended or guaranteed under the Plan.

     EXTENSION OR GUARANTEE OF LOANS:   The Company shall, in accordance with
the authorization of an Administrator, extend a loan to an executive or shall
guarantee a third-party loan to such individual, provided that any such Company
loan or guarantee shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

     1.        The principal balance of a mortgage loan extended or guaranteed
          under the Plan shall not exceed the lesser of one million five hundred
          thousand dollars ($1,500,000) or, when aggregated with all other
          outstanding indebtedness secured by the residence with respect to
          which the loan is made, one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market
          value of such residence.

     2.        The principal balance of a general purpose loan extended or
          guaranteed under the Plan shall not, when aggregated with any
          outstanding general purpose loan extended or guaranteed under the Plan
          to the same executive, exceed the lesser of two hundred fifty thousand
          dollars ($250,000) or one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the
          executive's annual base salary.

     3.        The term of the extended loan or guarantee shall not exceed
          thirty (30) years for a mortgage loan or ten (10) years for a general
          purpose loan.

               If an executive with an outstanding loan under the Plan
          voluntarily terminates employment with Wells Fargo or is discharged
          for gross and willful misconduct, the term of such loan shall end (and
          the entire remaining principal balance and any accrued, unpaid
          interest under such loan shall become payable) on the earlier of (i)
          the end of the original term of the loan or (ii) 120 days following
          termination of employment, unless the Committee determines, in its
          sole discretion and based on extraordinary circumstances, that an
          extension of the term is appropriate.  "Gross and willful misconduct"
          shall include (without limitation) the wrongful appropriation of funds
          of Wells Fargo or the commission of a felony.

     4.        If a direct Company loan is made, the loan shall be evidenced by
          the executive's promissory note made payable to the Company's order.
          Such note shall bear interest at the applicable federal rate in effect
          at the time the loan is made under section 1274(d) of the Internal
          Revenue code of 1954, as amended ("Code"), (or such higher rate as
          shall be necessary to avoid imputation of foregone interest under
          section 7872 of the Code or any successor provision); PROVIDED THAT,
          upon authorization of an Administrator, the interest rate may be
          reduced by up to five (5) percentage points during the period that the
          borrowing executive remains in the employ of the Company or one of its
          subsidiaries.  Principal and interest (if any) on the note may provide
          for payment either in full upon the expiration of the term or

<PAGE>

          from time to time during such term; and the note may be secured or
          nonsecured.

     5.        Such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall specify by
          rule, regulation, or guideline.


The remaining terms of a loan or loan guarantee under the Plan shall be
determined by the authorizing Administrator, provided that such terms shall not
be inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth above.  All direct
Company loans shall be made from the general funds of the Company.

     EFFECTIVE DATE, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION:   This Plan shall become
effective upon adoption by the Board and may be amended from time to time by
action of the Committee.  The Plan shall remain in effect until terminated by
action of the Board or the Committee.

(1)  As defined in Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K.
(2)  These computations are included herein in compliance with Securities and
     Exchange Commission regulations.  However, management believes that fixed
     charge ratios are not meaningful measures for the business of the Company
     because of two factors.  First, even if there were no change in net income,
     the ratios would decline with an increase in the proportion of income which
     is tax-exempt or, conversely, they would increase with a decrease in the
     proportion of income which is tax-exempt.   Second, even if there were no
     change in net income, the ratios would decline if interest income and
     interest expense increase by the same amount due to an increase in the
     level of interest rates or, conversely, they would increase if interest
     income and interest expense decrease by the same amount due to a decrease
     in the level of interest rates.

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

FINANCIAL REVIEW


OVERVIEW
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wells Fargo & Company (Parent) is a bank holding company whose principal
subsidiary is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Bank). In this Annual Report, Wells Fargo
& Company and its subsidiaries are referred to as the Company.

     Net income in 1994 was $841 million, compared with $612 million in 1993, an
increase of 37%. Net income per share was $14.78, compared with $10.10 in 1993,
an increase of 46%. The increase in earnings from a year ago was largely due to
a lower loan loss provision. The percentage increase in per share earnings was
greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the Company's
continuing stock repurchase program.


        [RETURN ON AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (ROA) (GRAPH) (%)] SEE APPENDIX


     [RETURN ON COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (GRAPH) (ROE) (%)] SEE APPENDIX


     Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.62% and return on average common
equity (ROE) was 22.41% in 1994, compared with 1.20% and 16.74%, respectively,
in 1993.
     Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $2,610 million in
1994, compared with $2,659 million a year ago. The Company's net interest margin
was 5.55% for 1994, down from 5.74% in 1993. This decrease was substantially due
to lower hedging income, largely offset by an increase in the rate spread
between loans and deposits.
     Noninterest income increased from $1,093 million in 1993 to $1,200 million
in 1994, an increase of 10%. The growth was primarily due to higher service
charges on deposit accounts and increases in trust and investment services
income.
     Noninterest expense decreased from $2,162 million in 1993 to $2,156 million
in 1994. A major portion of the decrease in noninterest expense was due to a
decrease in foreclosed assets expense, largely offset by higher levels of
incentive compensation.
     The Company's provision for loan losses was $200 million in 1994, compared
with $550 million in 1993. During 1994, net charge-offs were $240 million, or
.70% of average total loans, compared with $495 million, or 1.44%, during 1993.
The allowance for loan losses was $2,082 million, or 5.73% of total loans, at
December 31, 1994, compared with $2,122 million, or 6.41%, at December 31, 1993.
     Total loan balances increased 10% since December 31, 1993, rising to $36.3
billion at December 31, 1994.
     At December 31, 1994, total nonaccrual and restructured loans were $582
million, or 1.6% of total loans, compared with $1,200 million, or 3.6%, at
December 31, 1993. Loans new to nonaccrual in 1994 were $340 million, compared
with $821 million in 1993. At December 31, 1994, an estimated $246 million, or
43%, of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days past due, compared with an
estimated $704 million, or 59%, at December 31, 1993. Foreclosed assets were
$272 million at December 31, 1994, compared with $348 million at December 31,
1993.
     At December 31, 1994, the ratio of common stockholders' equity to total
assets was 6.41%, compared with 7.00% at December 31, 1993. The Company's total
risk-based capital (RBC) ratio at December 31, 1994 was 13.16% and its Tier 1
RBC ratio was 9.09%, exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8% and 4%,
respectively, for bank holding companies and the "well capitalized" guidelines
for banks of 10% and 6%, respectively. The Company's ratios at

<PAGE>

December 31, 1993 were 15.12% and 10.48%, respectively. The Company's leverage
ratios were 6.89% and 7.39% at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
exceeding the minimum regulatory guideline of 3% for bank holding companies and
the well capitalized guideline for banks of 5%.
     The decreases in the risk-based capital and leverage ratios resulted
primarily from the repurchase of 5,122,597 shares of common stock during 1994.
The Company has bought in the past, and will continue to buy, shares to offset
stock issued or expected to be issued under the Company's employee benefit and
dividend reinvestment plans. In addition to these shares, the Board of Directors
authorized in July 1994 the repurchase of up to 5.4 million shares of the
Company's outstanding common stock. This action reflects the Company's strong
capital position and will allow the Company to effectively manage its overall
capital position in the best interest of its shareholders. There is no scheduled
date for completion of the program; the Company will repurchase shares from time
to time, subject to market conditions. It is the Company's current intention,
assuming continued Board authorization, to repurchase shares until the Company
can find investment opportunities that provide sufficient returns. A discussion
of RBC and leverage ratio guidelines is in the Capital Adequacy/Ratios section.
     In the first quarter of 1994, the Board of Directors approved an increase
in the common stock quarterly dividend from $.75 to $1.00 per share. The
quarterly dividend was increased again in January 1995 to $1.15 per share.
     A general economic recovery, of moderate proportions, has taken hold in
California. The Company is directly affected by this recovery due to the fact it
operates predominately in California markets. More industries are reporting
higher sales and profits, the unemployment rate has dropped and confidence
levels have improved. During much of 1994, sales at department stores
strengthened, confirming the favorable results of a recent survey on small
business. New jobs created in 1994 are estimated to be between 150,000 and
200,000, the best showing in four years.
     Business conditions varied widely, reflecting the different economic make-
up of each region.
     Economic activity was strongest in California's Central Valley. This region
has an agribusiness base that continued to prosper and expand during 1994.
Yields and prices remained favorable, while a soft U.S. dollar in overseas
markets helped the exports of fresh and processed foods. The Central Valley also
continued to attract new business and capital from other regions of the state
(and elsewhere) because of its favorable business climate.
     In Southern California, economic activity also improved following a long
and deep recession. However, business conditions were somewhat hesitant and
spotty, but, for the first time since 1990, the region added new jobs. In

addition, department stores reported better sales as incomes improved. The
region's important tourist-entertainment sectors also were stronger. Defense
cuts continued, but at a more moderate pace, while the demand for office space
rose a little resulting in slightly lower vacancy rates.
     The Northern California region also recovered during much of 1994. Home
sales remained buoyant, although by year end, they started to weaken because of
rising mortgage rates. A major improvement took place in the Silicon Valley as
the demand for computer chips and other high-tech products rose sharply. The
area's economy was particularly strengthened by important international
business trade with the Pacific Rim and Mexico that continued to fuel exports.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company has identified seven distinct lines of business for the purposes of
management reporting, as shown in Table 3.
     The line of business results show the financial performance of the major
business units. Line of business results are determined based on the Company's
management accounting process, which assigns balance sheet and income statement
items to each responsible business unit. This process is dynamic and somewhat
subjective. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive,
authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally
accepted accounting principles. The management accounting process measures the
performance of the business lines based on the management structure of the
Company and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other
financial institution. Changes in management structure and/or the allocation
process may result in changes in allocations, transfers and assignments. In that
case, results for prior periods would be restated to allow comparability from
one year to the next.
     The provision for loan losses is allocated based on management's current
assessment of the long-term, normalized net charge-off ratio for each business.
Internal expense allocations are independently negotiated between business units
and, where possible, service and price is measured against comparable services
available in the external marketplace. Equity is allocated based on an
assessment of the inherent risk of each business unit. The ROEs are comparable
across business lines and are measured against the Company's market required
return.
     The following describes the major business units.

THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION GROUP sells and services a complete line of retail
financial products for consumers and small businesses. It encompasses a branch
network (including supermarket branches and banking centers), the 24-hour
Customer Sales and Service Centers (telephone banking), the ATM network and
Wells Fargo ON-LINE, the Company's personal computer banking service. In
addition, Retail Distribution includes product management for the consumer
checking business, which primarily uses the branches as a source of new
customers.
     As part of the ongoing effort to provide higher-convenience, lower-cost
service to customers, the Company opened supermarket branches, which are a more
efficient delivery channel for a full line of retail banking services, and
banking centers in California in 1994. The supermarket banking centers
(modularly designed kiosks equipped

(5) The Wholesale Products Group's average loans include commercial real estate loans of $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion for 1994 and
    1993, respectively, and other commercial loans of $5.9 billion and $5.8 billion for 1994 and 1993, respectively. These loans
    were originated largely by the Company's Commercial Banking Group which deals mostly with middle market borrowers.
(6) Mortgage Lending's average loans include real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans of $8.1 billion and $6.4 billion for 1994
    and 1993, respectively, and junior mortgages and other loans of $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion for 1994 and 1993, respectively.
(7) Equity is allocated to the lines of business based on an assessment of the  inherent risk associated with each business so the
    returns on allocated equity are on a risk-adjusted basis and comparable across business lines.
(8) The risk-adjusted efficiency ratio is defined as noninterest expense plus the cost of capital divided by revenues (net interest
    income and noninterest income) less normalized loan losses.

with ATMs, a customer service telephone and staffed by a banking officer) are
capable of providing substantially all consumer services.
     Pretax income in 1994 for this group increased $76 million to $114 million.
The 1994 results reflect higher deposit service charges and lower net interest
income from lower spreads on checking deposits that were partially offset by
higher balances. Lower occupancy and personnel expenses from reductions in
branch space and the results of reengineering efforts in consumer checking were
partially offset by systems investments in alternative distribution (non-branch)
channels. Noninterest income in 1994 and 1993 included a $14 million and a $36
million accrual, respectively, related to the disposition of owned and leased
premises associated with branch closures. (See Noninterest Income section for
further information.)

THE BUSINESS BANKING GROUP provides a full range of financial services to small
businesses, including credit, deposits, investments, payroll services,
retirement programs, and credit and debit card services. Business Banking
customers include small businesses with annual sales up to $10 million in which
the owner of the business is also the principal financial decision maker.
     Pretax income in 1994 increased $34 million to $124 million due to higher
net interest income resulting from increased lending volumes and higher spreads
on business checking. In addition, the group completed the formation in late
1993 of an alliance with Card Establishment Services (CES) to perform the
processing of the credit and debit card services. The alliance resulted in lower
noninterest income and noninterest expense, but did not result in a material
impact on pretax income. (See Noninterest Income section for further information
regarding CES.)

THE INVESTMENT GROUP is responsible for the sales and management of savings and
investment products, investment management and brokerage services. This includes
the Stagecoach and Overland Express Funds and personal trust, employee benefit
trust and agency assets. It also includes product management for market rate
accounts, savings deposits, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and time
deposits. The Investment Group also includes the Wells Fargo Nikko Investment
Advisors (WFNIA) joint venture and Wells Fargo Insurance Services.
     The Investment Group's pretax income in 1994 declined $25 million to $243
million, resulting from higher incentive compensation expense due to an increase
in sales of approximately $800 million through the Personal Finance Officer
(PFO) program. The increase in compensation was partially offset by higher
annuity sales fees, management fees and net interest income. Fee income did not
keep pace with compensation in 1994 as a higher percentage of the PFO sales were
in no-load funds. No-load funds do not charge a sales fee; revenue is generated
from management fees collected on assets under management. The growth in net
interest income was due to widening spreads on market rate accounts, which
offset a year-over-year decline in balances.

THE REAL ESTATE GROUP provides a complete line of services supporting the
commercial real estate market. Products and services include construction loans
for commercial and residential development, land acquisition and development
loans, secured and unsecured lines of credit, interim financing arrangements for
completed buildings, rehabilitation loans, affordable housing loans and letters
of credit. Secondary market services are provided through the Real Estate
Capital Markets area. Its business includes purchases of distressed loans at a
discount, mezzanine financing, acquisition financing, origination of permanent
loans for securitization, syndications, commercial real estate loan servicing
and real estate pension fund advisory services.
     Pretax income in 1994 increased $50 million to $142 million due to the
improvement in credit quality that resulted in lower credit-related expenses,
including lower foreclosed assets expense.
     Average loans were $6.2 billion in 1994, down from $8.0 billion in 1993.
The decline was primarily due to payments. The current portfolio primarily
consists of construction, other real estate mortgage loans and lines of credit
to developers and to selected real estate investment trusts throughout the
United States.

THE WHOLESALE PRODUCTS GROUP includes the Commercial Banking Group, which serves
businesses headquartered in California with annual sales of $5 to $250 million,
and the Corporate Banking Group, which maintains relationships with major
corporations throughout the United States. The group is responsible for
soliciting and maintaining credit and noncredit relationships with businesses by
offering a variety of products and services including traditional commercial
loans and lines, letters of credit, trade facilities and cash management.
     The improvement in credit quality and an ongoing emphasis on cross-selling
fee-based products contributed to an increase in pretax income of $46 million to
$272 million in 1994.

CONSUMER LENDING offers a full array of consumer loan products. In 1994, this
included $2.7 billion in credit card loans, $1.7 billion in auto financing and
leases, and $1.5 billion in other installment loans and lines of credit.
     Pretax income decreased $4 million in 1994 to $193 million, primarily due
to higher noninterest expense from credit card marketing and costs related to
opening and maintaining a higher number of credit card accounts. This was
partially offset by higher net interest income from wider spreads and higher
credit card balances.

MORTGAGE LENDING provides products in the residential marketplace for home
purchases, refinancing and home equity financing. These products include home
equity

lines of credit, fixed-rate, adjustable-rate (ARM) and fixed initial-rate (FIRM)
mortgage loans.
     In 1994, pretax income for this area decreased by $29 million to $77
million. This was primarily due to lower net interest income resulting from low
start rates on adjustable-rate mortgages and a net runoff of $.5 billion in
junior mortgages and other loans. First mortgage balances grew $1.7 billion
primarily due to a shift in consumer preferences away from 30-year fixed-rate
loans into ARMs, which have generally been held for portfolio purposes. Because
of concerns about the long-run economics of the 1-4 family first mortgage
business, Mortgage Lending has decided to no longer directly offer this product
after the second quarter of 1995. Instead, it is currently expected that
customers will be referred to another financial institution partner who will
originate these loans. A $10 million accrual was made in the fourth quarter of
1994 for the disposition of premises and severance associated with this
decision. Mortgage Lending will continue to originate real estate 1-4 family
junior lien mortgages.

THE OTHER category includes the Company's investment securities portfolio, the
difference between the normalized provision for the line groups and the Company
provision, the net impact of transfer pricing loan and deposit balances, the
cost of external debt, the elimination of intergroup noninterest income and
expense, and any residual effect of unallocated systems and other support
groups. It also includes the impact of asset/liability strategies the Company
has put in place to manage the sensitivity of net interest spreads.
     The increase in pretax income in the Other category was primarily due to a
lower Company loan loss provision. This was partially offset by a decline in net
interest income from lower hedging income from maturing interest rate floor and
swap hedges put in place in 1989 to protect the Company against lower
loan/deposit spreads in a declining rate environment. (For further information,
refer to the Asset/Liability Management section.)



EARNINGS PERFORMANCE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bank generated net income of $863 million and $632 million in 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The Parent (excluding its equity in earnings of subsidiaries) and
its nonbank subsidiaries had net losses of $22 million and $20 million for 1994
and 1993, respectively.


NET INTEREST INCOME
................................................................................

Net interest income is the difference between interest income (which includes
yield-related loan fees) and interest expense. Net interest income on a taxable-
equivalent basis was $2,610 million in 1994, compared with $2,659 million in
1993.
     Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis expressed as a percentage
of average total earning assets is referred to at the net interest margin, which
represents the average net effective yield on earning assets. For 1994, the net
interest margin was 5.55%, compared with 5.74% in 1993.
     Hedging income from derivative contracts decreased $179 million in 1994
compared with 1993, reducing the net interest margin by 39 basis points,
primarily due to maturing interest rate derivative contracts. This was largely
offset by the increase in the rate spread between loans and deposits, which
added 30 basis points to the net interest margin. The additional decline in the
net interest margin was attributed to the lower rates on investment securities
relative to their funding sources. (For further information, refer to the
Asset/Liability Management section.)
     The net interest margin in 1995 is expected to decline modestly, assuming
deposit rates will gradually increase in response to rising market interest
rates. However, net interest income is not currently expected to change
significantly in 1995.

     The growth in service charges on deposit accounts in 1994 compared with
1993 was predominantly due to increased service fees for overdrafts as well as
increased cash management-related fee income earned on wholesale accounts.
     The increase in mutual fund and annuity sales fees was due to a $40 million
growth in annuity sales fees from $17 million in 1993 to $57 million in 1994,
primarily offset by a $19 million decrease in mutual fund sales fees from $26
million in 1993 to $7 million in 1994. Sales volume of annuities grew from $387
million in 1993 to $1,091 million in 1994. The change in the mix of products
sold, from bond-oriented mutual funds to fixed-rate annuities, reflected a
combination of influences, including a shift in investor preferences due to
rising interest rates and the introduction of new noncommission retail products
such as no-load Lifepath Funds. Sales of mutual funds and annuities contributed
to fees and commissions income through sales fees and to trust and investment
services income through mutual fund management fees.
     Substantially all of the decrease in debit and credit card merchant fees
was due to an alliance with Card Establishment Services (CES) that the Company
entered into in November 1993 for merchant credit card and debit card processing
services. Under this agreement, the Company is responsible for marketing, sales
and initial merchant credit analysis; CES provides technology, processing
operations and customer service. The Company retains an interest in the net
revenues from processing the transactions that are now reported as income from
equity investments accounted for by the equity method, rather than reported as
income from debit and credit card merchant fees. As a result, income from the
alliance contributed $7 million to income from equity investments in 1994. In
October 1994, it was announced that CES would be purchased by First Data
Resources in 1995. The purchase is not expected to have a material impact on the
alliance.
     The increase in "all other" fees and commissions was primarily due to a
decrease in amortization expense for purchased mortgage servicing rights and
increased loan servicing fees. Amortization expense for purchased mortgage
servicing rights totaled $8 million in 1994, compared with $16 million in 1993.
At December 31, 1994, the balance of purchased mortgage servicing rights was $96
million, compared with $15 million at December 31, 1993. In 1994, the Company
purchased an additional $89 million ($64 million of which was purchased in the
fourth quarter of 1994) in servicing rights.
     The increase in trust and investment services income in 1994 compared with
1993 was primarily due to greater mutual fund investment management fees,
reflecting the overall growth in the fund families' net assets. The Stagecoach
family of 24 funds had $6.4 billion of assets under management at December 31,
1994, compared with $4.3 billion at December 31, 1993. The Stagecoach family
consists of both retail and institutional funds. The retail funds, first
introduced in 1992, are primarily distributed through the branch network. These
funds had $5.4 billion under management at December 31, 1994, compared with $3.8
billion at December 31, 1993. The institutional funds, first introduced in mid-
1993, are offered primarily to selected groups of investors and certain
corporations, partnerships and other business entities. At December 31, 1994,
these funds had $1.0 billion of assets under management compared with $530
million at December 31, 1993. The Overland Express family of 16 funds, which had
$3.4

billion of assets under management at December 31, 1994, compared with $3.9
billion at December 31, 1993, is sold nationwide through brokers. The decline in
the Overland Express Fund assets under management was mostly in the Variable
Rate Government Fund, the largest Overland Express Fund, reflecting a shift of
investor preferences away from bond-oriented funds due to the rising interest
rate environment. In addition to managing Overland Express Funds and all the
funds in the Stagecoach family, the Company also managed or maintained personal
trust, employee benefit trust and agency assets of approximately $47 billion,
compared with $45 billion at December 31, 1993.
     The investment securities gains in 1994 reflected the sale of both
corporate debt and marketable equity securities from the available-for-sale
portfolio.
     In 1994, losses from the disposition of operations included fourth quarter
accruals for the disposition of premises and, to a lesser extent, severance of
$14 million associated with scheduled branch closures and $10 million associated
with ceasing the direct origination of 1-4 family first mortgage loans by the
Company's mortgage lending unit. (See Line of Business Results--Mortgage Lending
section for further information.)
     Partially offsetting these accruals was an $8 million payment received in
the first quarter of 1994 that was contingent on performance in relation to the
alliance formed with CES. Additional payments from the CES agreement are also
contingent upon future performance. In 1993, losses from disposition of
operations included a $36 million accrual related to the disposition of owned
and leased premises resulting from reduced space requirements; for example,
downsizing some full service branches into supermarket locations and into other
smaller, mid-sized branches. Additional accruals may be made in 1995 for branch
closures or relocations depending on the success of the Company's alternative
distribution channels, particularly supermarket banking.
     "All other" noninterest income in 1993 included $18 million of interest
income received as a result of the settlement of California Franchise Tax Board
audits related to the appropriate years for claiming deductions applicable to
the 1976 through 1986 tax returns.
     Noninterest income is expected to increase in 1995, reflecting growth from
fee-based products, mutual fund management fees and deposit-related services.

</TABLE>

     The decrease in salaries expense was due to a decline in the Company's
full-time equivalent (FTE) staff. The Company's FTE staff, including hourly
employees, averaged 19,558 in 1994 and 20,766 in 1993; it was 19,598 at December
31, 1994.
     Incentive compensation is comprised of sales and discretionary bonuses,
senior and executive incentive performance bonuses and certain stock-based
incentive bonuses. Substantially all of the increase in incentive compensation
from 1993 to 1994 was due to various sales programs, of which a significant
portion related to annuities and mutual funds.
     Employee benefits expense for 1993 included an incremental expense of $11
million related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106 (FAS 106), Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions. During 1993, the Company also adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards


                                                                              15
<PAGE>

No. 112 (FAS 112), Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, which
resulted in an accrual of $12 million. (See a further discussion of FAS 106 and
112 in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.)
     Increases in equipment expense and contract services in 1994 were primarily
related to system upgrades throughout the Company and the development of new
products and services, including software programming.
     The decrease in federal deposit insurance expense in 1994 compared with
1993 was mostly due to a decrease in the federal deposit insurance rate in 1994.
Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA), the FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system under which the
assessment rate for an insured depository institution varies according to the
level of risk incurred in its activities. Based on semi-annual assessment risk
evaluations performed by the FDIC, the Bank is assigned an annualized assessment
rate between .230% and .310%. The FDIC is proposing to lower the assessment rate
for certain institutions, which, if adopted, will reduce this expense in 1995
compared with 1994.
     The decrease in certain identifiable intangibles expense was largely due to
lower amortization expense for core deposit intangibles. Amortization expense
for core deposit intangibles was $49 million in 1994, compared with $61 million
in 1993. At December 31, 1994, the balance of core deposit intangibles was $208
million.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     The 100% decrease in foreclosed assets expense in 1994 compared with 1993
was largely due to a decline in write-downs from $60 million in 1993 to $13
million in 1994 and increased gains on sales.
     The Company expects total noninterest expense to increase modestly in 1995
compared with 1994, reflecting expenditures to help generate new customer
revenue.



BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A comparison between the year-end 1994 and 1993 balance sheets is presented
below. The Bank's assets of $51.9 billion and $50.7 billion at December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively, represented substantially all of the Company's
consolidated assets at year-end 1994 and 1993.


INVESTMENT SECURITIES
................................................................................

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (FAS
115), Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, on
December 31, 1993. This Statement addresses the accounting and reporting for
certain investments in debt and marketable equity securities. (For further
discussion of FAS 115, see Note 3 to the Financial Statements.)
     Total investment securities averaged $12.7 billion in 1994, a 12% increase
from $11.3 billion in 1993. Investment securities totaled $11.6 billion at
December 31, 1994, down 11% from $13.1 billion at December 31, 1993. The
investment securities portfolio at December 31, 1994 was comprised of $8.6
billion held-to-maturity securities at cost and $3.0 billion available-for-sale
securities at fair value. Investment securities are expected to continue to
decrease in the future as the cash received from their maturities is used to
fund loan growth.
     Table 8 provides expected remaining maturities and yields (taxable-
equivalent basis) of debt securities within the investment portfolio. The
weighted average expected remaining maturity of the debt securities portfolio
was 2 years and 10 months at December 31, 1994, compared with 2 years and 7
months at December 31, 1993. The increase in the expected remaining maturity
reflects a higher interest rate environment, in which prepayments are likely to
slow down. Expected remaining maturities will differ from remaining contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay certain obligations
with or without penalties. It is more appropriate to monitor investment security
maturities and yields using prepayment assumptions since this better reflects
what the Company expects to occur. (Note 3 to the Financial Statements shows the
remaining contractual principal maturities and yields of debt securities.)
     At December 31, 1994, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had an
estimated unrealized loss of $434 million

(estimated unrealized gross gains were zero), or 5.0% of the cost of the
portfolio. At December 31, 1993, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had
an estimated unrealized net gain of $91 million (which reflected estimated
unrealized gross losses of $23 million), or .9% of the cost of the portfolio.
     The available-for-sale portfolio includes both debt and marketable equity
securities. At December 31, 1994, the available-for-sale securities portfolio
had an unrealized net loss of $189 million, comprised of unrealized gross losses
of $221 million and unrealized gross gains of $32 million. At December 31, 1993,
the available-for-sale securities portfolio had an unrealized net gain of $36
million, comprised of unrealized gross gains of $59 million and unrealized gross
losses of $23 million. The unrealized net gain or loss on available-for-sale
securities is reported on an after-tax basis as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. At December 31, 1994, the investment securities valuation
allowance amounted to an unrealized net loss of $110 million, compared with an
unrealized net gain of $21 million at December 31, 1993.
     The unrealized net loss in both the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale
portfolios was predominantly due to investments in mortgage-backed securities.
These unrealized net losses reflected an increasing interest rate environment.
As interest rates rise, the Company expects the unrealized losses to grow and
prepayments to decline. The decline in the fair value of the investment
securities portfolio is not considered to be an other-than-temporary impairment.
For the held-to-maturity securities, the full amount of principal and interest
is expected to be collected. The Company may decide to sell certain of the
available-for-sale securities to manage the level of earning assets (for
example, to offset loan growth that may exceed expected maturities and
prepayments of securities), resulting in the realization of losses. (See Note 3

LOAN PORTFOLIO
................................................................................

A comparative schedule of average loan balances is presented in Table 4; year-
end balances are presented in Note 4 to the Financial Statements.
     Loans averaged $34.0 billion in 1994, compared with $34.3 billion in 1993.
Total loans at December 31, 1994 increased to $36.3 billion, or 10% compared
with year-end 1993, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. A
significant portion of this increase was due to increases in the real estate 1-4
family first mortgage portfolio. The Company anticipates an increase in its loan
portfolio for 1995 as well as a shift in loan growth from 1-4 family mortgages
to higher yielding consumer and commercial loans. The Company's total unfunded
loan commitments grew 31% to $20.9 billion at December 31, 1994, from $16.0
billion at December 31, 1993, including a 39% increase in unfunded credit card
commitments from $5.6 billion at December 31, 1993 to $7.8 billion at December
31, 1994.
     Commercial loans grew 19% to $8.2 billion at year-end 1994, from $6.9
billion at December 31, 1993. This growth primarily occurred in middle market
loans, resulting from increased marketing efforts, and is expected to continue
in 1995. Total unfunded commercial loan commitments grew from $5.1 billion at
December 31, 1993 to $6.6 billion at December 31, 1994. Included in the
commercial loan portfolio are agricultural loans of $822 million and $643
million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Agricultural loans consist
of loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers.
     The Company's 1-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio increased 21% from
$7.5 billion at December 31, 1993 to $9.1 billion at December 31, 1994. Most of
the increase occurred in the first half of 1994. As a result of a rising
interest rate environment in 1994, demand within the Company's 1-4 family first
mortgage portfolio shifted from traditional fixed-rate loan products to
adjustable-rate loan products, which have generally been held for portfolio
purposes. Approximately 58% of the 1-4 family first mortgage loans outstanding
at December 31, 1994 were at a fixed rate, a majority of which are FIRM loans
that convert to ARMs at the end of an initial fixed period. Due to the recent,
gradual increase in mortgage rates, the portfolio is expected to experience
slower prepayments in 1995 than in the previous two years. (See Line of Business
Results--Mortgage Lending section for further information.)
     Of the Company's 1-4 family first mortgage portfolio, 97% is located in
California, of which 50% is located in Southern California. The portfolio has
maintained relatively low nonaccrual levels. Of the total outstanding at
December 31, 1994, loans made prior to 1989, which have seasoned to a greater
extent than the rest of the portfolio, totaled $1.2 billion, with $22.4 million,
or 1.9%, on nonaccrual. Loan originations from 1989 and 1990 have experienced
the greatest decline in property values in the portfolio due to the peak of
California housing prices in those years and, therefore, make up the largest
component of loans on nonaccrual. Loans originated in 1989 and 1990 totaled $1.4
billion, with $49.0 million, or 3.5%, on nonaccrual. Loans originated from 1991
through 1994 totaled $6.5 billion, with only $9.3 million, or .1%, on
nonaccrual.
     The Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio was $9.6 billion at
December 31, 1994, compared with $9.9 billion at December 31, 1993, a 3%
decrease. This decrease was primarily due to payments received. Net charge-offs
for commercial real estate loans were $60 million in 1994, down from $232
million in 1993 and $406 million at their peak in 1992.
     Table 9 presents comparative period-end commercial real estate loans.

(1) Included in commercial loans.
(2) Agricultural loans that are primarily secured by real estate are included in
    other real estate mortgage loans; such loans were $256 million, $225 million
    and $261 million at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     Over the years, the Company has prospered as an active commercial real
estate lender. However, as a result of the recent recession and overbuilt real
estate markets, the Company's earnings during 1993, 1992 and 1991 were
significantly affected by its relatively high levels of commercial real estate
loans. The Company's real estate borrowers with properties located in Southern
California


18
<PAGE>

were particularly affected. There is still an oversupply of certain types of
commercial real estate in the U.S. (particularly California) that could last for
a number of years. However, a substantial amount of liquidity has returned to
the real estate markets, mostly in apartments and shopping centers and, to a
lesser degree, in other property types. Many developers are successfully
financing acquisition or development programs through the capital markets and
many banks are showing interest in financing certain product types. This
liquidity has contributed significantly to the Company's progress in reducing
its nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets. As a result of this liquidity in the
marketplace, nonaccrual commercial real estate loans have declined to 4.3% of
the commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 1994, down from 9.1% at
December 31, 1993 and 12.3% at its peak at December 31, 1992. The Company has
begun to see growth in its out-of-state commercial real estate loan portfolio
and expects continued growth during 1995, as evidenced by an 80% increase in
commitments from $929 million at December 31, 1993 to $1,672 million at December
31, 1994. In addition to originating new commercial real estate loans in 1994,
the Company began purchasing loans at a discount from other financial
institutions totaling $170 million, including $32 million that was classified as
nonaccrual on the date of purchase. The Company expects to collect the full
purchase price of these loans.
     Table 10 summarizes the other real estate mortgage loans by state and
property type. Substantially all of the other real estate mortgage loans are
secured by properties located in California, representing 81% of the portfolio
at December 31, 1994, compared with 78% at December 31, 1993. No other state
comprised more than 1% of the portfolio at December 31, 1994. The largest
property type was office buildings, representing 29% and 28% of the portfolio at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

NONACCRUAL AND RESTRUCTURED LOANS AND OTHER ASSETS
................................................................................

Table 14 presents comparative data for nonaccrual and restructured loans and
other assets. Management's classification of a loan as nonaccrual or
restructured does not necessarily indicate that the principal of the loan is
uncollectible in whole or in part. (Notes 1 and 5 to the Financial Statements
describe the Company's accounting policies relating to nonaccrual and
restructured loans and foreclosed assets, respectively.)
     Table 15 summarizes the approximate changes during 1994 and 1993 in
nonaccrual loans by loan category. Table 16 summarizes the quarterly trend, for
the last eight quarters, of the approximate changes in nonaccrual loans. The
general decline of nonaccrual loans over the last nine quarters, with
nonaccruals peaking at $2,399 million on September 30, 1992, largely resulted
from loan payments and loans returned to accrual, together with a reduction in
new loans placed on nonaccrual. While the overall credit quality of the loan
portfolio has improved, and is expected

to continue, the total nonaccrual balance could fluctuate from quarter to
quarter. The Company anticipates normal influxes of loans as it increases its
lending activity as well as resolutions of loans in the nonaccrual portfolio.
The performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such
as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower such as
actions taken by a borrower's management. In addition, from time to time, the
Company purchases loans from other financial institutions that may be classified
as nonaccrual based on its policies.
     Foreclosed assets at December 31, 1994 decreased to $272 million from $348
million at December 31, 1993 substantially due to $206 million in sales,
predominantly offset by $174 million in additions. However, additions decreased
$231 million from 1993. The majority of sales of foreclosed assets in 1994
consisted of 1-4 family properties and office buildings. Approximately 33% of
foreclosed assets at December 31, 1994 have been in the portfolio less than one
year, with land and 1-4 family properties representing a majority of the amount
greater than one year old. Table 17 summarizes the approximate changes during
1994 and 1993 in foreclosed assets. Table 18 summarizes the quarterly trend in
foreclosed assets for the past eight quarters. Table 19 summarizes foreclosed
assets at December 31, 1994 by state and type and Table 20 summarizes California
foreclosed assets at December 31, 1994 by region and type.

NONACCRUAL LOANS BY PERFORMANCE CATEGORY

At December 31, 1994, an estimated $246 million, or 43%, of nonaccrual loans
were less than 90 days past due, including an estimated $184 million, or 32%,
that were current (less than 30 days past due) as to payment of principal and
interest. This compares with an estimated $704 million, or 59%, of nonaccrual
loans that were less than 90 days past due at December 31, 1993, including an
estimated $595 million, or 50%, that were current.
     For all loans on nonaccrual during 1994 and 1993 (including loans no longer
on nonaccrual at December 31, 1994 and 1993), cash interest payments of $74
million and $137 million were received while the loans were on nonaccrual status
in 1994 and 1993, respectively. Of the $74 million received in 1994, $24 million
was recognized as interest income and $50 million was applied to principal. Of
the $137 million received in 1993, $19 million was recognized as interest income
and $118 million was applied to principal. The average nonaccrual book principal
loan balances (net of charge-offs and interest applied to principal) were $799
million and $1,800 million during 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     Table 21 presents the amount of nonaccrual loans that were contractually
past due and those that were contractually current at December 31, 1994 and
1993. Both book and contractual balances are presented in the table, the
difference reflecting charge-offs and interest applied to principal. The ratio
of book to contractual principal balance was 65% at December 31, 1994, compared
with 66% at December 31, 1993.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
................................................................................

An analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses, including charge-
offs and recoveries by loan category, is presented in Note 4 to the Financial
Statements. At December 31, 1994, the allowance for loan losses was $2,082
million, or 5.73% of total loans, compared with $2,122 million, or 6.41%, at
December 31, 1993. The provision for loan losses declined to $200 million in
1994 from $550 million in 1993, due to the continued improvement of the
Company's loan portfolio. Assuming the economic recovery in California and
improvements in the Company's credit quality continue, there may be no provision
for loan losses in 1995. Net charge-offs in 1994 were $240 million, or .70% of
average total loans, compared with $495 million, or 1.44%, in 1993. Loan loss
recoveries were $129 million in 1994, compared with $169 million in 1993. Table
23 summarizes net charge-offs by loan category.
     Since peaking in 1992, net charge-offs have steadily declined in 1993 and
1994. Net charge-offs in 1995 are expected to remain roughly flat with 1994
levels.
     The largest category of net charge-offs in 1994 was credit card loans,
comprising 50% of the total net charge-offs. However, credit card net charge-
offs declined from $156 million, or 6.06% of average credit card loans, in 1993
to $120 million, or 4.45% of average credit card loans, in 1994. The percentage
of net charge-offs to average credit card loans is expected to increase slightly
in 1995, reflecting the normal loss rates on new accounts.
     Any loan that is past due as to principal or interest and that is not both
well-secured and in the process of collection is generally charged off (to the
extent that it exceeds the fair value of any related collateral) after a

period of time that is based on loan category. Additionally, loans are charged
off when classified as a loss by either internal loan examiners or regulatory
examiners.
     The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses that assesses the risk and losses inherent in its
portfolio. This process provides an allowance consisting of two components,
allocated and unallocated. The allocated component reflects inherent losses
resulting from the analysis of individual loans. It is developed through
specific credit allocations for individual loans, historical loss experience for
each loan category and degree of criticism within each category. The total of
these allocations is then supplemented by the unallocated component of the
allowance. This includes adjustments to the historical loss experience for the
various loan categories to reflect any current conditions that could affect
losses inherent in the portfolio. The unallocated component includes
management's judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for
concentrations, economic uncertainties and other subjective factors.
     The Company's determination of the level of the allowance and,
correspondingly, the provision for loan losses rests upon various judgments and
assumptions, including general (particularly California's) economic conditions,
loan portfolio composition, prior loan loss experience and the Company's ongoing
examination process and that of its regulators. The Company has an internal risk
analysis and review staff that reports to the Board of Directors and
continuously reviews loan quality. Such reviews also assist management in
establishing the level of the allowance. Similar to a number of other large
national banks, the Bank has been for several years and continues to be
examined by its primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC), and has OCC examiners in residence. These examinations occur throughout
the year and target various activities of the Bank, including specific segments
of the loan portfolio (for example, commercial real estate and shared national
credits). In addition to the Bank being examined by the OCC, the Parent and its
nonbank subsidiaries are examined by the Federal Reserve.
     The Company considers the allowance for loan losses of $2,082 million
adequate to cover losses inherent in loans, commitments to extend credit and
standby letters of credit at December 31, 1994.
     Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114 (FAS 114), Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan, as amended by FAS 118 (collectively referred to as FAS 114). These
Statements address the disclosure requirements and allocations of the allowance
for loan losses for certain impaired loans and amend FASB Statements No. 5 and
15; however, they do not address the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses. These Statements are effective January 1, 1995, and can only be applied
prospectively.
     A loan within the scope of FAS 114 is considered impaired when, based on
current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement, including scheduled interest payments.
     When a loan to an individual borrower with unique risk characteristics has
been identified as being impaired, the amount of impairment will be measured by
the Company using discounted cash flows, except when it is determined that the
sole (remaining) source of repayment for the loan is the operation or
liquidation of the underlying collateral. In such case, the current fair value
of the collateral, reduced by costs to sell, will be used in place of discounted
cash flows. Alternatively, some impaired loans will have risk characteristics
similar to other impaired loans and will be aggregated for the purpose of
measuring impairment using historical loss factors as a means of measurement.
     If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded
investment in the loan (including accrued interest, net deferred loan fees or
costs, and unamortized premium or discount), an impairment will be recognized by
creating or adjusting an existing allocation of the allowance for loan losses.
FAS 114 will not change the timing of charge-offs of loans to reflect the
amount ultimately expected to be collected.
     Based on the Company's current interpretations, the preliminary estimate of
the total loans within the scope of FAS 114 that were impaired as of January 1,
1995 were less than $500 million.


DEPOSITS
................................................................................

Comparative detail of average deposit balances is presented in Table 4. Average
core deposits decreased 2% in 1994 compared with 1993. Average core deposits
funded 76% and 79% of the Company's average total assets in 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Total average deposits remained flat compared with 1993, as the
decrease in core deposits was offset by an increase in interest-bearing foreign
deposits, which were used to fund short-term borrowing needs.

CERTAIN FAIR VALUE INFORMATION
..............................................................................

FAS 107 requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for certain
financial instruments. Quoted market prices, when available, are used to reflect
fair values. If market quotes are not available, which is the case for most of
the Company's financial instruments, management has provided its best estimate
of the calculation of the fair values using discounted cash flows. Fair value
amounts differ from book balances because fair values attempt to capture the
effect of current market conditions (for example, interest rates) on the
Company's financial instruments.
     Due to rising interest rates, there was a decrease in the excess (premium)
of the fair value over the carrying value of the Company's financial instruments
at December 31, 1994 compared with December 31, 1993. The Company's FAS 107
disclosures are presented in Note 14 to the Financial Statements.


CAPITAL ADEQUACY/RATIOS
..............................................................................

The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy. Management
reviews the various capital measures monthly and takes appropriate action to
ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The
Company's current capital position exceeds current guidelines established by
industry regulators.


          [CORE DEPOSITS AT YEAR END ($ BILLIONS) (GRAPH)] SEE APPENDIX


RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS

The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the OCC issue risk-based capital (RBC)
guidelines for bank holding companies and national banks, respectively. The FRB
is the primary regulator for the Parent and the OCC is the primary regulator for
the Bank. RBC guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to
different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
     There are two categories of capital under the guidelines. Tier 1 capital
includes common stockholders' equity and qualifying preferred stock, less
goodwill and certain other deductions (including the unrealized net gains and
losses, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities
carried at fair value); Tier 2 capital includes preferred stock not qualifying
as Tier 1 capital, mandatory convertible debt, subordinated debt, certain
unsecured senior debt issued by the Parent and the allowance for loan losses,
subject to limitations by the guidelines. Tier 2 capital is limited to the
amount of Tier 1 capital (i.e., at least half of the total capital must be in
the form of Tier 1 capital). The Company's Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital components
are shown in Table 25.
     Under the guidelines, one of four risk weights is applied to the different
balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the
counterparty (for example, qualifying 1-4 family first mortgage loans are risk-
weighted at 50%). Off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments and
derivative financial instruments, are also applied


                                                                              29
<PAGE>

a risk weight after calculating balance sheet equivalent amounts. One of four
credit conversion factors are assigned to loan commitments based on the
likelihood of the off-balance sheet item becoming an asset. (For example,
certain loan commitments are converted at 50% and then risk-weighted at 100%.)
Derivative financial instruments are converted to balance sheet equivalents
based on notional values, replacement costs and remaining contractual terms. The
credit conversion factors and risk weights are 0%, 20%, 50% and 100%. (Refer to
Notes 4 and 13 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of off-balance
sheet items.)
     The Company's total RBC ratio at December 31, 1994 was 13.16% and its Tier
1 RBC ratio was 9.09%, exceeding the minimum guidelines of 8% and 4%,
respectively. The ratios at December 31, 1993 were 15.12% and 10.48%,
respectively. The decrease in the Company's Tier 1 RBC ratio at December 31,
1994 compared with 1993 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 5,122,597
shares of common stock throughout 1994 and, secondarily, from the redemption of
$150 million in Series A preferred stock (at its liquidation preference carrying
amount) in the first quarter of 1994.
     The Company's risk-weighted assets are calculated as shown in Table 25.
Risk-weighted balance sheet assets were $15.1 billion and $16.4 billion less
than total assets on the consolidated balance sheet of $53.4 billion and $52.5
billion at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, as a result of weighing
certain types of assets at less than 100%; such assets, for both December 31,
1994 and 1993, substantially consisted of claims on or guarantees by the U.S.
government or its agencies (risk-weighted at 0% to 20%), 1-4 family first
mortgage loans (50%), private collateralized mortgage obligations backed by 1-4
family first mortgage loans (50%) and cash and due from banks (0% to 20%). The
$2.2 billion increase in risk-weighted balance sheet assets in 1994 compared
with 1993 was substantially due to an increase in loans (mostly commercial and
1-4 family first mortgage loans) and a corresponding decrease in investment
securities, which are lower risk-weighted assets.

LEVERAGE RATIO

To supplement the RBC guidelines, the FRB established a leverage ratio
guideline. The leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly
average total assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items. The minimum
leverage ratio guideline is 3% for banking organizations that do not anticipate
significant growth and that have well-diversified risk, excellent asset quality,
high liquidity, good earnings and, in general, are considered top-rated, strong
banking organizations. Other banking organizations are expected to have ratios
of at least 4% to 5%, depending upon their particular condition and growth
plans. Higher leverage ratios could be required by the particular circumstances
or risk profile of a given banking organization. The Company's leverage ratios
were 6.89% and 7.39% at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The decrease
in the leverage ratio at December 31, 1994 compared with December 31, 1993 was
primarily due to a decrease in Tier 1 capital.

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA)

In addition to adopting a risk-based assessment system, FDICIA required that the
federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining five capital tiers: well
capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, a "well
capitalized" institution must have a Tier 1 RBC ratio of at least 6%, a total
capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be
subject to a capital directive order. The Bank had a Tier 1 RBC ratio of 9.56%,
a total capital ratio of 12.64% and a leverage ratio of 7.21% at December 31,
1994, compared with 10.36%, 13.99% and 7.30% at December 31, 1993, respectively.


ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
................................................................................

The principal objectives of asset/liability management are to manage the
sensitivity of net interest spreads to potential changes in interest rates and
to enhance profitability in ways that promise sufficient reward for understood
and controlled risk. Funding positions are kept within predetermined limits
designed to ensure that risk-taking is not excessive and that liquidity is
properly managed.
     Interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different
times as interest rates change. For example, if fixed-rate assets are funded
with floating-rate debt, the spread between asset and liability rates will
decline or turn negative if rates increase. The Company refers to this type of
risk as "term structure risk." There is, however, another source of interest
rate risk, which results from changing spreads between loan and deposit rates.
These changing spreads are not highly correlated to changes in the level of
interest rates and are driven by other market conditions. The Company calls this
type of risk "basis risk"; it is the Company's main source of interest rate risk
and is significantly more difficult to quantify and manage than term structure
risk.
     One way to analyze the impact that future changes in interest rates will
have on net interest income is through a cumulative gap measure. The gap
represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in
specified time periods. Table 26 shows in summary form the Company's interest
rate sensitivity based on expected interest rate repricings in specific time
frames for the balance sheet as of December 31, 1994. All swaps, except for
forward swaps, are reported in the table. Table 27 presents an expanded,
detailed report of the Company's interest rate sensitivity by major asset and
liability categories, together with an adjusted cumulative gap measure.

     In categorizing assets and liabilities according to expected repricing time
frames, management makes certain judgments and approximations. For example, a
new three-year loan with a rate that is adjusted every 30 days would be
included in the "0-3 months" category rather than the "over 1-5 years" category.
There are also balance sheet categories that have a fixed rate and an
unspecified maturity, or a rate which is administered but changes slowly or not
at all as market rates change. An example of this type of account is interest-
bearing checking, which has balances available on demand and pays a rate that
changes infrequently. The balances are relatively stable from quarter to
quarter, but could decline because of disintermediation if rates increased
substantially. Another example is the revolving credit feature of fixed-rate
credit card loans, which differentiates these loans from fixed-rate loans with
specified contractual maturities. Given the unusual rate maturity
characteristics of these balance sheet items, they are placed in a "nonmarket
category." This category is generally viewed as being relatively stable in terms
of interest rate variability and the net nonmarket liabilities are viewed as
funding fixed-rate assets with maturities greater than one year. Nonmarket
assets include non-interest-earning assets, fixed-rate credit card loans,
nonaccrual loans and equity securities. Nonmarket liabilities and stockholders'
equity include savings deposits, interest-bearing checking, Wells Extra savings
(included in market rate savings), noninterest-bearing deposits, other
noninterest-bearing liabilities, common stockholders' equity and fixed-rate
perpetual preferred stock.
     Some asset/liability managers allocate these nonmarket assets and
liabilities to the various maturity categories. The Company believes that these
allocations are mostly arbitrary and tend to provide a false sense that the gap
structure is accurately defined. For this reason, they remain in the nonmarket
category, in order to maintain the Company's focus on their unusual rate
maturity characteristics.
     Mortgage-backed investment securities and fixed-rate loans in the real
estate 1-4 family first mortgage, other real estate mortgage and consumer loan
categories are based on expected maturities rather than on contractual
maturities. The gap structure also does not allocate Prime-based loans and
market rate account (MRA) savings deposits to specific maturity categories (MRA
savings deposits exclude Wells Extra savings). Statistical evidence indicates
that both Prime-based loans and MRA savings deposits have relatively short
maturities, with that of MRA savings deposits being somewhat longer. Keeping
them in distinct categories (as with nonmarket) helps maintain focus on these
rates, since most of the Company's short-term net interest income variability
depends on their relative movements.
     The Company uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an
asset/liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate maturities.
They are used to reduce the Company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and
provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rates on their funding
sources. For example, the Company uses interest rate futures to shorten the rate
maturity of market rate savings to better match the maturity of Prime-based
loans.
     The under-one-year net liability position at December 31, 1994 was $520
million (1.0% of total assets), compared with the under-one-year asset position
of $1,402 million at December 31, 1993 (2.7% of total assets). This measure of
term structure risk would indicate a nearly balanced interest rate risk
position.
     The two adjustments to the cumulative gap amount shown on Table 27 provide
comparability with those bank holding companies that present interest rate
sensitivity information in this manner. However, management does not believe
that these adjustments depict its interest rate risk. The first adjustment line
excludes noninterest-earning assets, noninterest-bearing liabilities and
stockholders' equity from the cumulative gap calculation so that only earning
assets, interest-bearing liabilities and all interest rate swap contracts,
excluding forward swaps, are reported. The second adjustment line moves
interest-bearing checking, savings deposits and Wells Extra savings from the
nonmarket liability category to the shortest rate maturity category. This second
adjustment reflects the availability of these deposits for immediate withdrawal.
The resulting adjusted under-one-year cumulative gap (net liability position)
was $10.1 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The gap analysis provides a useful framework to measure the term structure
risk. In addition, the Company performs net interest income simulations to
estimate the potential effects of changing interest rates. This process allows
the Company to fully explore the complex relationships within the gap over time
and various interest rate environments.
     To get a complete picture of its current interest rate risk position, the
Company must look at both term structure risk and basis risk. The two most
significant components of basis risk are the Prime/MRA spread and the rate paid
on savings and interest-bearing checking accounts. During the last rate cycle,
the Prime/MRA spread varied from a low of approximately 275 basis points in 1987
to a high of approximately 525 basis points when rates peaked in 1989. The
increase in the Prime/MRA spread as well as lagged movement in other deposit
rates caused spreads to increase to historic high levels. The Company's risk was
that declining rates would cause margins to compress as loan rates dropped more
rapidly than deposit rates. If loan rates decreased even


                                                                              33

more than they had at the bottom of the last cycle, the Company's net interest
margin could have come under severe pressure. At the peak of the rate cycle in
1989, interest rate floor contracts and a smaller amount of swaps were purchased
to hedge against this type of margin compression. Most of these contracts
matured by the end of 1994.
     The spread between loans and deposits increased again in 1994 as the Prime
rate climbed 250 basis points and deposit rates were slow to react. The
increasing loan/deposit spread roughly offset the loss of hedging income due to
the maturing interest rate floor and swap hedges put in place in 1989.
     As the Company looks toward managing interest rate risk in 1995, it is
confronted with several risk scenarios. If the Prime rate and other market rates
remain at current levels, the Company may be faced with an environment in which
deposit rates begin to creep upward, causing declines in net interest income. As
stated earlier, the Prime rate increased 250 basis points during 1994, while the
MRA savings deposit rate on average has moved only 35 basis points. During the
last period of increasing rates, the MRA savings deposit rate moved
approximately 45% of the movement in the Prime rate. Although market conditions
are substantially different in this interest rate cycle, there may be further
increases in deposit rates, causing a decline in net interest income. There is
no cost-effective way to hedge against such a decline.
     If interest rates rise, net interest income may actually increase if
deposit rates continue to lag increases in market rates. The Company could,
however, experience significant pressure on net interest income if there is a
substantial movement in deposit rates relative to market rates. This basis risk
potentially could be hedged with interest rate caps, but the Company believes
they are not cost-effective in relation to the risk they would mitigate.
     Finally, a declining interest rate environment might result in a decrease
in loan rates while deposit rates remain relatively stable, since they have not
increased much in this cycle. This rate scenario could also create significant
risk to net interest income. The Company has partially hedged against this risk
by again purchasing interest rate floor contracts as indicated in Table 28.
     In 1995, the Company anticipates that a significant amount of its loan
growth will be funded by maturing fixed-rate investment securities. Since it is
anticipated that the bulk of the loan growth will be at floating rates, these
changes could significantly affect the gap structure. To partially hedge these
projected gap changes, $1.4 billion of forward swaps were added in which the
Company receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate. These forward swaps are
detailed in Table 29.


DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
................................................................................

The Company uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an
asset/liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate maturities
to reduce the Company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Company also
offers contracts to its customers, but hedges such contracts by purchasing other
financial contracts or uses the contracts for asset/liability management.
     Table 28 reconciles the beginning and ending notional or contractual
amounts for derivative financial instruments for 1994 and shows the expected
remaining maturity at year-end 1994.
     Table 29 summarizes the notional amount, expected maturities and weighted
average interest rates associated with amounts to be received or paid on
interest rate swap agreements, together with an indication of the
asset/liability hedged.
     For a further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Note
13 of the Financial Statements.


LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
................................................................................

Liquidity refers to the Company's ability to maintain a cash flow adequate to
fund operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost-
effective basis.
     In recent years, core deposits have provided the Company with a sizable
source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. The Company's average core
deposits and stockholders' equity funded 84% and 87% of its average total assets
in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The remaining funding of average total assets was mostly provided by senior
and subordinated debt, deposits in foreign offices and short-term borrowings
(comprised of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). Senior and
subordinated debt averaged $3.4 billion and $4.1 billion in 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Short-term borrowings averaged $2.4 billion and $1.3 billion in
1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The weighted average expected remaining maturity of the debt securities
within the investment securities portfolio was 2 years and 10 months at December
31, 1994. Of the $11.8 billion debt securities at cost at December 31, 1994,
$2.5 billion, or 21%, is expected to mature or be prepaid in 1995 and an
additional $2.5 billion, or 21%, is expected to mature or be prepaid in 1996.
The Company has purchased shorter-term debt securities to maintain asset
liquidity and to fund loan growth.

(1) To facilitate the settlement process, the Company enters into offsetting contracts 2 to 45 days prior to their maturity date.
    Concurrent with the closing of these positions, the Company generally enters into new interest rate futures and forward
    contracts with a later expiration date since the Company's use of these contracts predominantly relates to ongoing hedging
    programs.
(2) Terminations occur if a customer that purchased a contract decides to cancel it before the maturity date. If the customer
    contract was hedged, the Company terminates the interest rate derivative instrument used to hedge the customer's contract upon
    cancellation. The impact of terminations on income before income taxes for 1994 was approximately $1 million.

     Other sources of liquidity include maturity extensions of short-term
borrowings and sale or runoff of assets. Commercial and real estate loans
totaled $26.3 billion at December 31, 1994. Of these loans, $7.0 billion matures
in one year or less, $7.9 billion matures in over one year through five years
and $11.4 billion matures in over five years. Of the $19.3 billion that matures
in over one year, $12.0 billion has floating or adjustable rates and $7.3
billion has fixed rates. Of the $7.3 billion of fixed-rate loans, approximately
$2.7 billion represents fixed initial-rate mortgage (FIRM) loans. FIRM loans
carry fixed rates for a minimum of 3 years to a maximum of 10 years of the loan
term and carry adjustable rates thereafter. (Refer to the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows for further information on the Company's cash flows from its
operating, investing and financing activities.)
     Liquidity for the Parent Company and its nonbank subsidiaries is generated
through its ability to raise funds in a variety of domestic and international
money and capital markets, dividends from subsidiaries and lines of credit. A
shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
allows the issuance of up to $1.5 billion of senior or subordinated debt or
preferred stock. At December 31, 1994, $1.3 billion remained unissued. An
additional $500 million was issued in January 1995, which further reduced the
shelf to $752 million. (Refer to Note 6 to the Financial Statements for a
schedule of outstanding senior and subordinated debt.) The Company also had
unused committed lines of credit of approximately $300 million at December 31,
1994.
     In 1994, a significant portion of the Parent's source of funding was due to
dividends paid by the Bank totaling $1,001 million. The dividends received
helped to fund the Company's ongoing stock repurchase program. The Company
expects the Parent to continue to receive dividends from the Bank in 1995. (See
Notes 2 and 11 to the Financial Statements for the Bank's dividend restriction
and the Parent Company's financial statements, respectively.)
     To accommodate future growth and current business needs, the Company has a
capital expenditure program. Capital expenditures for 1995 are estimated at $200
million for additional automation equipment for branches and offices, relocation
and remodeling of Company facilities and routine replacement of furniture and
equipment. The Company will fund these expenditures from various sources,
including retained earnings of the Company and borrowings of various maturities.



COMPARISON OF 1993 VERSUS 1992
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net income in 1993 was $612 million, compared with $283 million in 1992. Net
income per share was $10.10, compared with $4.44 in 1992. Return on average
assets (ROA) was 1.20% and return on average common equity (ROE) was 16.74% in
1993 compared with .54% and 7.93% respectively, in 1992.
     The increase in earnings in 1993 compared with 1992 was substantially due
to a $665 million, or 55%, decrease in the loan loss provision. In addition,
net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis declined 1% to $2,659 million
in 1993, while the net interest margin increased 4 basis points to 5.74%. The
increase in the net interest margin was substantially due to lower rates paid on
interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, wider spreads between Prime- and
LIBOR-based loans and their funding source and recoveries on loans where
interest had been previously applied to principal. These improvements were
partially offset by a change in the mix of earning assets from higher-yielding
loans to lower-yielding investment securities and lower income from derivative
contracts used to hedge mismatches in the rate maturity of loans and their
funding sources. Hedging income from derivative contracts decreased $32 million
in 1993, resulting in a 7 basis point decline in the net interest margin due to
the maturity of contracts.
     Average earning assets declined to $46.3 billion in 1993 from $47.3 billion
in 1992. The decrease in earning assets was substantially due to a $6.1 billion
decrease in average loans, primarily in commercial loans and other real estate
mortgage loans, partially offset by a $5.3 billion increase in average
investment securities, predominantly mortgage-backed securities.

     Noninterest income was $1,093 million in 1993, compared with $1,059 million
in 1992. Services charges on deposit accounts increased 7% to $423 million,
primarily due to increases in service charges on individual and business
checking accounts. Fees and commissions increased 4% to $376 million
predominantly resulting from sales fees on mutual funds and annuities as well as
increased shared ATM network income. Sales fee revenues on mutual funds and
other financial products increased from $29 million in 1992 to $43 million in
1993 due to the introduction of the Personal Financial Officer program in the
branches. Shared ATM network income increased to $38 million from $32 million
in 1992, primarily due to a fee increase implemented in mid-1992 as well as a
7% increase in the volume of transactions processed through the ATM network.
Trust and investment services income increased 15% to $190 million, mostly due
to greater mutual fund investment management fees, reflecting growth in the
funds' net assets. These fees amounted to $37 million in 1993, compared with
$19 million in 1992. In 1992, the Company realized gains of $45 million from the
sale of all of its 30-year mortgage-backed securities. These securities were
previously designated as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or
market. The increase in losses from disposition of operations from 1992 to 1993
was due to a $36 million accrual made in the third quarter of 1993 primarily
related to reduced space requirements.
     "All Other" noninterest income in 1993 included $18 million of interest
income received as a result of the settlement of California Franchise Tax Board
audits related to the appropriate years for claiming deductions applicable to
the 1976 through 1986 tax returns. "All Other" noninterest income in 1992
included $14 million of interest income due to the settlement of Internal
Revenue Service audits related to the appropriate years for claiming certain
deductions and credits applicable to the 1978 through 1986 tax years. "All
Other" noninterest income in 1992 also included real estate investment
(contingent interest loans accounted for as investments) losses of $19 million,
which were substantially due to a write-down on land for development in Southern
California.
     Noninterest expense totaled $2,162 million in 1993, compared with $2,035
million in 1992. Salaries expense increased 5% to $684 million due to increases
in merit pay and severance accruals primarily related to the reorganization of
the Retail Distribution Group. Incentive compensation increased 49% to $109
million substantially due to various sales programs and a Company-wide employee
appreciation program. Employee benefits expense increased 22% to $213 million
primarily due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106 (FAS 106), Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions, and FAS 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.
FAS 106 resulted in an incremental expense in 1993 of approximately $11 million;
FAS 112 resulted in an accrual of $12 million.
     Total loans were $33.1 billion at December 31, 1993, a 10% decrease from
December 31, 1992. This decrease was predominantly due to declines of 18% in
other real estate mortgage loans and 16% in commercial loans.
     The provision for loan losses in 1993 was $550 million, compared with
$1,215 million in 1992. Net charge-offs in 1993 were $495 million, or 1.44% of
average total loans, compared with $798 million, or 1.97%, in 1992. Loan loss
recoveries were $169 million in 1993, compared with $117 million in 1992. The
allowance for loan losses was 6.41% of total loans at December 31, 1993,
compared with 5.60% at December 31, 1992. The decline in the provision for loan
losses reflected the continued improvement in the Company's loan portfolio.
     Total nonaccrual and restructured loans were $1,200 million, or 3.6% of
total loans, at December 31, 1993, compared with $2,142 million, or 5.8% of
total loans, at December 31, 1992. At December 31, 1993, an estimated $704
million, or 59%, of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days past due, compared
with an estimated $1,294 million, or 61%, at December 31, 1992. Foreclosed
assets were $348 million at December 31, 1993, compared with $510 million at
December 31, 1992.
     The average volume of core deposits in 1993 was $40.4 billion, 3% lower
than in 1992. Average core deposits funded 79% of the Company's average total
assets in 1993, compared with 80% in 1992.
     The Company adopted FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, on January 1,
1993. Under this method, the computation of the net deferred tax asset or
liability gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. As a
result, when the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was signed into law in August
of 1993, raising the corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%, effective January 1,
1993, an adjustment was made that increased the Company's deferred tax asset
and, correspondingly, decreased income tax expense by approximately $18 million.
Because the deferred tax asset was originally recorded at a lower tax rate, the
higher tax rate in effect at that time increased the value of the asset. The
decreased income tax expense was partially offset by a $9 million increase to
reflect the application of the higher tax rate to 1993 earnings.

                     WELLS FARGO & COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The accounting and reporting policies of Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
(Company) conform with generally accepted accounting principles and prevailing
practices within the banking industry. Certain amounts in the financial
statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current
financial statement presentation. The following is a description of the
significant accounting policies of the Company.


CONSOLIDATION
................................................................................

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
Wells Fargo & Company (Parent), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Bank) and the nonbank
subsidiaries of the Parent.
     Significant majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line
basis. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Other subsidiaries and affiliates in which there is at least 20%
ownership are generally accounted for by the equity method; those in which there
is less than 20% ownership are generally carried at cost. Subsidiaries and
affiliates that are accounted for by either the equity or cost method are
included in other assets.


SECURITIES
................................................................................

Securities are accounted for according to their purpose and holding period.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Securities generally acquired to meet long-term investment objectives, including
yield and liquidity management purposes, are classified as investment
securities. Realized gains and losses are recorded in noninterest income using
the identified certificate method.

SECURITIES AT COST  Debt securities acquired with the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as securities carried at historical
cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, where
appropriate. For certain debt securities (for example, Government National
Mortgage Association securities), the Company anticipates prepayments of
principal in the calculation of the effective yield. If it is probable that the
carrying value of any debt security will not be realized due to other-than-
temporary impairment, the estimated loss is recorded in noninterest income as a
loss on investment securities. If a decision is made to dispose of securities at
cost or should the Company become unable to hold securities until maturity, they
would be reclassified to securities at fair value.

SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE  Upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115 (FAS 115), Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities, on December 31, 1993, debt securities that may not be held
until maturity and marketable equity securities are considered available-for-
sale and, as such, are classified as securities carried at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, reported in a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Declines in the value of debt securities and
marketable equity securities that are considered other than temporary are
recorded in noninterest income as a loss on investment securities.

SECURITIES AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET  Prior to December 31, 1993, securities
that were not held on a long-term basis or until maturity were classified as
securities carried at the lower of cost or market.

TRADING SECURITIES

Securities, if any, acquired for short-term appreciation or other trading
purposes are recorded in a trading portfolio and are carried at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income. There were no
trading securities in the past three years.

NONMARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

Nonmarketable equity securities are acquired for various purposes, such as
troubled debt restructurings and as a regulatory requirement (for example,
Federal Reserve Bank stock). These securities are accounted for at cost and are
included in other assets as they do not fall within the scope of FAS 115 since
there are restrictions on their sale or liquidation. The asset value is reduced
when declines in value are considered to be other than temporary.


PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
................................................................................

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Capital leases are included in premises and equipment, at the
capitalized amount less accumulated amortization.
     Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-
line method. Estimated useful lives


                                                                              43
<PAGE>

range up to 40 years for buildings, 2 to 10 years for furniture and equipment,
and up to the lease term for leasehold improvements. Capitalized leased assets
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the respective leases,
which generally range from 20 to 35 years.


LOANS
................................................................................

Loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income.
Unearned income, which includes deferred fees net of deferred direct incremental
loan origination costs, is amortized to interest income generally over the
contractual life of the loan using an interest method or the straight-line
method if it is not materially different.
     Loans identified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or
market value. Nonrefundable fees, related direct loan origination costs and
related hedging gains or losses, if any, are deferred and recognized as a
component of the gain or loss on sale recorded in noninterest income.

NONACCRUAL LOANS  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days
past due as to interest or principal (unless both well-secured and in the
process of collection), when the full timely collection of interest or principal
becomes uncertain or when a portion of the principal balance has been charged
off. Real estate 1-4 family loans (both first liens or junior liens) are placed
on nonaccrual status within 150 days of becoming past due as to interest or
principal, regardless of security. Generally, consumer loans not secured by real
estate are only placed on nonaccrual status when a portion of the principal has
been charged off. Generally, such loans are entirely charged off within 180 days
of becoming past due.
     When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest
receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost
recovery method thereafter, until qualifying for return to accrual status.
Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest
and principal become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement
or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.

RESTRUCTURED LOANS  In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties
and the Company makes certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms,
the loan is classified as a restructured (accruing) loan, unless the yield is
equivalent to that of a new loan.
     Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on nonaccrual for
a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the
restructured terms. However, performance prior to the restructuring, or
significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are included in
assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan
being returned to accrual at the time of restructuring or after a shorter
performance period. If the borrower's ability to meet the revised payment
schedule is uncertain, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  The Company's determination of the level of the
allowance for loan losses rests upon various judgments and assumptions,
including general economic conditions, loan portfolio composition, prior loan
loss experience, evaluation of credit risk related to certain individual
borrowers and the Company's ongoing examination process and that of its
regulators. The Company considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to
cover losses inherent in loans, loan commitments and standby letters of credit.


GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
................................................................................

Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net
assets acquired, results from acquisitions made by the Company. Most of the
Company's goodwill is being amortized using the straight-line method over 20
years. The remaining period of amortization, on a weighted average basis,
approximated 12 years at December 31,1994.
     Identifiable intangible assets that are included in other assets are
generally amortized using an accelerated method over 5 to 15 years.
Approximately 51% of the December 31, 1994 remaining balance will be amortized
in 3 years.


INCOME TAXES
................................................................................

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Consolidated or
combined state tax returns are filed in certain states, including California.
Income taxes are generally allocated to individual subsidiaries as if each had
filed a separate return. Payments are made to the Parent by those subsidiaries
with net tax liabilities on a separate return basis. Subsidiaries with net tax
losses and excess tax credits receive payments for these benefits from the
Parent.
     Effective January 1, 1993, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which uses the liability (or balance sheet)
method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined
based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of
the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition
to changes in tax rates and laws. FAS 109 supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 11 (APB 11), Accounting for Income Taxes, which was used prior to
1993 to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities. Under APB 11, the net
deferred tax asset or liability was an


44
<PAGE>

accumulation of annual adjustments based on the tax effects of the book and tax
income statement differences and was not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax
rates and laws.


INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
................................................................................

The Company uses interest rate derivative financial instruments (futures,
forwards, caps, floors and swaps) primarily to hedge mismatches in the rate
maturity of loans and their funding sources. Gains and losses on interest rate
futures are deferred and amortized as a component of the interest income or
expense reported on the asset or liability hedged. Amounts payable or receivable
for swaps, caps and floors are accrued with the passage of time, the effect of
which is included in the interest income or expense reported on the asset or
liability hedged; fees on these financial contracts are amortized over their
contractual life as a component of the interest reported on the asset or
liability hedged. Gains or losses on the interest rate derivatives (e.g.,
forwards) hedging loans originated for sale are deferred and recognized as a
component of the gain or loss recorded on the sale of the related loans in
noninterest income. Cash flows resulting from interest rate derivative financial
instruments that are accounted for as hedges of identifiable transactions are
classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
Credit risk related to interest rate derivative financial instruments is
considered and, if material, provided for separately from the allowance for loan
losses.
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119
(FAS 119), Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, on December 31, 1994. FAS 119 requires various
disclosures regarding derivative activities which are set forth in Note 13 to
the Financial Statements.


NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
................................................................................

Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income (after deducting
dividends on preferred stock) by the average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. The impact of common stock equivalents, such as stock options,
and other potentially dilutive securities is not material; therefore, they are
not included in the computation.



2  CASH, LOAN AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Reserve Board regulations require reserve balances on deposits to be
maintained by the Bank with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average required
reserve balance was $1.2 billion in both 1994 and 1993.
     The Bank is subject to certain restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act,
including restrictions on extensions of credit to its affiliates. In particular,
the Bank is prohibited from lending to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries
unless the loans are secured by specified collateral. Such secured loans and
other regulated transactions made by the Bank (including its subsidiaries) are
limited in amount as to each of its affiliates, including the Parent, to 10% of
the Bank's capital stock and surplus (as defined, which for this purpose
includes the allowance for loan losses on an after-tax basis) and, in the
aggregate to all of its affiliates, to 20% of the Bank's capital stock and
surplus. The Bank's capital stock and surplus at December 31, 1994 was $5
billion.
     Dividends payable by the Bank to the Parent without the express approval of
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are limited to the Bank's
retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net
profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year.
Retained net profits are defined by the OCC as net income, less dividends
declared during the period, both of which are based on regulatory accounting
principles. Based on this definition, the Bank can declare dividends of
approximately $539 million of its retained net profits at December 31, 1994 plus
retained net profits up to the date of any such dividend declaration. Dividends
declared by the Bank in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $1,001 million, none and $117
million, respectively.


                                                                              45

3  INVESTMENT SECURITIES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (FAS
115), Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, on
December 31, 1993. FAS 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for certain
investments in debt and marketable equity securities.
     FAS 115 establishes three classifications of securities, each of which
receives different accounting treatment. Held-to-maturity investment securities
are reported at cost. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, reported
as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Trading securities are reported
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. The
estimated fair value of investments is determined based on current quotations,
where available. Where current quotations are not available, the estimated fair
value is determined based primarily on the present value of future cash flows,
adjusted for the quality rating of the securities, prepayment assumptions and
other factors. The Company had no trading securities in 1994, 1993 or 1992.
     The following table provides the major components of investment securities
at cost and at fair value:

     Proceeds from the sales of debt securities in the available-for-sale
portfolio totaled $13 million in 1994, resulting in a $5 million gain. A loss of
$1 million was realized in 1994 resulting from a write-down due to other-than-
temporary impairment in the fair value of certain debt securities. Proceeds from
the sales of marketable equity securities in the available-for-sale portfolio
totaled $5 million in 1994, resulting in a $4 million gain.
     Proceeds from the sales of debt securities in the available-for-sale
portfolio totaled $284 thousand in 1993, resulting in a $10 thousand gain.
     In 1992, 30-year mortgage-backed securities were reclassified from
securities at cost to securities held for sale and carried at the lower of cost
or market. Proceeds from the subsequent sales of these securities totaled $828
million. Gross gains of $45 million were realized on these sales.
     The following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities
and yields (taxable-equivalent basis) of debt securities within the investment
portfolio. The remaining contractual principal maturities for mortgage-backed
securities were allocated assuming no prepayments. Expected remaining maturities
will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to
prepay obligations with or without penalties. (See the Investment Securities
section of the Financial Review for expected remaining maturities and yields.)

A summary of the major categories of loans outstanding and related unfunded
commitments to extend credit is shown in the table below. At December 31, 1994
and 1993, the commercial loan category and related commitments did not have an
industry concentration that exceeded 10% of total loans and commitments. Tables

</TABLE>

     In the course of evaluating the credit risk presented by a customer and the
pricing that will adequately compensate the Company for assuming that risk,
management determines a requisite amount of collateral support. The type of
collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, land,
buildings, equipment, income-producing commercial properties and residential
real estate. The Company has the same collateral policy for loans whether they
are funded immediately or on a delayed basis (commitment).
     A commitment to extend credit is a legally binding agreement to lend funds
to a customer and is usually for a specified interest rate and purpose. These
commitments have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee. The
extension of a commitment gives rise to credit risk. The actual liquidity needs
or the credit risk that the Company will experience will be lower than the
contractual amount of commitments to extend credit shown in the table above
because a significant portion of these commitments is expected to expire without
being drawn upon. Certain commitments are subject to a loan agreement containing
covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer that must be met
before the Company is required to fund the commitment. The Company uses the same
credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does in making
loans.
     In addition, the Company manages the potential credit risk in commitments
to extend credit by limiting the total amount of arrangements, both by
individual customer and in the aggregate; by monitoring the size and maturity
structure of these portfolios; and by applying the same credit standards
maintained for all of its credit activities. The credit risk associated with
these commitments is considered in management's determination of the allowance
for loan losses.
     Standby letters of credit totaled $836 million and $889 million at December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Standby letters of credit are issued on behalf
of customers in connection with contracts between the customers and third
parties. Under a standby letter of credit, the Company assures that the third
party will receive specified funds if a customer fails to meet his contractual
obligation. The liquidity risk to the Company arises from its obligation to make
payment in the event of a customer's contractual default. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit and the Company's management of that
credit risk is the


48
<PAGE>

same as for loans and is considered in management's determination of the
allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, standby letters of
credit included approximately $123 million and $143 million, respectively, of
participations purchased and were net of approximately $81 million and $56
million, respectively, of participations sold. Approximately 63% of the
Company's year-end 1994 standby letters of credit had maturities of one year
or less and substantially all had maturities of seven years or less.
     Included in standby letters of credit are those that back financial
instruments (financial guarantees). The Company had issued or purchased
participations in financial guarantees of approximately $427 million and $473
million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The Company also had
commitments for commercial and similar letters of credit of $125 million and
$105 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Substantially all
fees received from the issuance of financial guarantees are deferred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the guarantee. Losses on
standby letters of credit and other similar letters of credit have been
immaterial.
     On January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 114 (FAS 114), Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,
as amended by FAS 118 (collectively referred to as FAS 114). These Statements
address the accounting treatment of certain impaired loans and amend FAS 5 and
15. A further discussion of FAS 114 is in the Allowance for Loan Losses section
of the Financial Review.
     Nonaccrual and restructured loans were $582 million and $1,200 million at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Related commitments to lend additional
funds were approximately $67 million and $143 million at December 31, 1994 and
1993, respectively.
     Nonaccrual loans with a remaining recorded investment totaling $92 million
and $117 million were restructured at market interest rates and returned to
fully performing accrual status during 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     If interest due on the book balances of all nonaccrual and restructured
loans (including loans no longer non-accrual or restructured at year end) had
been accrued under their original terms, it is estimated that income before
income tax expense would have been greater by the amounts shown in the table
below:

     The interest rates on floating-rate notes are determined periodically by
formulas based on certain money market rates, subject, on certain notes, to
minimum or maximum interest rates.
     The Company's mandatory convertible debt, which is identified by notes (7)
and (9) to the table on the preceding page, qualifies as Tier 2 capital but is
subject to discounting and note fund restrictions under the risk-based capital
rules. In 1994, $100 million of the Equity Commitment Notes and $150 million of
the Mandatory Equity Notes, both due in 1996, were redeemed prior to maturity.
The terms of the remaining $200 million of the Mandatory Equity Notes, due in
1998, require the Company to sell or exchange with the noteholder the Company's
common stock, perpetual preferred stock or other capital securities at maturity
or earlier redemption of the notes. At December 31, 1994, $127 million of
stockholders' equity had been designated for the retirement or redemption of
those notes.
     Certain of the agreements under which debt has been issued contain
provisions that may limit the merger or sale of the Bank and the issuance of its
capital stock or convertible securities. The Company was in compliance with the
provisions of the borrowing agreements at December 31, 1994.

DIRECTOR OPTION PLANS
..............................................................................

The 1990 Director Option Plan (1990 DOP) provides for annual grants of options
to purchase 500 shares of common stock to each non-employee director elected or
re-elected at the annual meeting of shareholders. Non-employee directors who
join the Board between annual meetings receive options on a prorated basis. The
options may be exercised until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant; they
become exercisable after one year at an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of the stock at the time of grant. The maximum total number of shares of
common stock issuable under the 1990 DOP is 100,000 in the aggregate and 20,000
in any one calendar year. At December 31, 1994, 24,526 options


                                                                              53
<PAGE>

were outstanding under this plan, of which 18,938 options were exercisable.
During 1994, 2,000 options were exercised. As the exercise price of the option
is equal to the quoted market price of the stock at the time of grant, no
compensation expense is recorded for the 1990 DOP.
     The 1987 Director Option Plan (1987 DOP) allows participating directors to
file an irrevocable election to receive stock options in lieu of their retainer
to be earned in any one calendar year. The options may be exercised until the
tenth anniversary of the date of receipt; options become exercisable after one
year at an exercise price of $1 per share. At December 31, 1994, 3,781 options
were outstanding under this plan, of which 3,220 options were exercisable.
During 1994, no options were exercised. Compensation expense for the 1987 DOP is
measured as the difference between the quoted market price of the stock at the
date of grant less the option exercise price. This expense is accrued as
retainers are earned.

LONG-TERM AND EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

The Wells Fargo & Company Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) became effective upon
the approval of shareholders in April 1994. The LTIP supersedes the 1990 Equity
Incentive Plan (1990 EIP), which is itself the successor to the original 1982
Equity Incentive Plan (1982 EIP). No additional awards or grants will be issued
under the 1990 or 1982 EIPs.
     While similar to the existing 1990 EIP, in that the LTIP includes
provisions for the same kinds of awards that could have been made under the 1990
EIP, the LTIP varies from the 1990 EIP in certain respects. The following are
certain of the more important differences. The LTIP provides for awards of
restricted shares in addition to the stock options, stock appreciation rights
and share rights that could have been awarded under the 1990 EIP. Stock
appreciation rights awarded under the LTIP need not be in tandem with stock
options, as was the case under the 1990 EIP, but may stand alone. Employee
stock options granted under the LTIP can be granted with exercise prices at or,
unlike the 1990 EIP, above the current value of the common stock and, except for
incentive stock options, can have terms longer than 10 years, the maximum
provided in the 1990 EIP. Employee stock options generally become fully
exercisable over 3 years from the grant date. Upon termination of employment,
the option period is reduced or the options are canceled. The LTIP also provides
for grants to recipients not limited to present key employees of the Company.
The total number of shares of common stock issuable under the LTIP is 2,500,000
in the aggregate (excluding outstanding awards under the 1990 and 1982 EIPs) and
800,000 in any one calendar year. No compensation expense has been recorded for
the stock options under the LTIP (or 1990 and 1982 EIPs), as the exercise price
is equal to the quoted market price of the stock at the time of grant.
     Transactions involving options of the LTIP and EIPs are summarized as
follows:

     Loans may be made, at the discretion of the Company, to assist the
participants of the LTIP and the EIPs in the acquisition of shares under
options. The total of such interest-bearing loans were $6 million and $7 million
at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The holders of restricted share rights that were granted prior to 1991 are
entitled at no cost to 30% of the shares of common stock represented by the
restricted share rights held three years after the restricted share rights were
granted, an additional 30% after four years and the final 40% after five years.
The holders of the restricted share rights granted in 1991 or later are entitled
at no cost to the shares of common stock represented by the restricted share
rights held by each person five years after the restricted share rights were
granted. Upon receipt of the restricted share rights, holders are entitled to
receive quarterly cash payments equal to the cash dividends that would be paid
on the number of common shares equal to the number of restricted share rights.
Except in limited circumstances, restricted share rights are canceled upon
termination of employment. As of December 31, 1994, the LTIP, the 1990 EIP and
the 1982 EIP had 58,229, 376,410 and 32,266 restricted share rights outstanding,
respectively, to 655, 863 and 80 employees or their beneficiaries, respectively.
The compensation expense for the restricted share rights equals the market price
at the time of grant and is accrued on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period of three to five years. The amount of expense accrued for the restricted
share rights under the LTIP, 1990 and 1982 EIPs was $8 million, $7 million and
$7 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

Options to purchase up to 1,100,000 shares of common stock may be granted under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Employees of the Company with at least
one year of service, except hourly employees, are eligible to participate.
Certain highly compensated employees may be excluded from participation at the
discretion of the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors. The plan provides for an option price of the lower of market value
at grant date or 85% to 100% (as determined by the Board of Directors for each
option period) of the market value at the end of the one-year option period. For
the current option period ending July 31, 1995, the Board approved a closing
option price of 85% of the market value. The plan is noncompensatory and results
in no expense to the Company. Transactions involving the ESPP are summarized as
follows:

    closing option price is sufficiently below the market value at grant date
    and based on the participant's level of participation. Since the closing
    option price was higher in 1994 and 1993, the additional option grants were
    canceled. These options represent a majority of the canceled options shown

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase and Share Custody Plan
allows holders of the Company's common stock to purchase additional shares
either by reinvesting all or part of their dividends, or by making optional cash
payments. Currently, up to $6,000 of dividends per quarter may be used to
purchase shares at a 3% discount. Dividends in excess of $6,000 per quarter and
between $150 and $2,000 per month in optional cash payments may be used to
purchase shares at fair market value. Shares may also be held in custody under
the Plan even without the reinvestment of dividends. During 1994 and 1993,
97,256 and 222,679 shares, respectively, were issued under the plan.


                                                                              55

9  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND OTHER EXPENSES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RETIREMENT PLAN
................................................................................

The Company's retirement plan is known as the Tax Advantage and Retirement Plan
(TAP), a defined contribution plan. As part of TAP, the Company makes basic
retirement contributions to employee retirement accounts. Effective July 1994,
the Company increased its basic retirement contributions from 4% to 6% of the
total of employee base salary plus payments from certain bonus plans (covered
compensation). The Company also makes special transition contributions related
to the termination of a prior defined benefit plan of the Company ranging from
.5% to 5% of covered compensation for certain employees. The plan covers
salaried employees with at least one year of service and contains a vesting
schedule graduated from three to seven years of service.
     Prior to July 1994, the Company made supplemental retirement contributions
of 2% of employee-covered compensation. All salaried employees with at least one
year of service were eligible to receive these Company contributions, which
vested immediately. Effective July 1994, the supplemental retirement
contributions were discontinued, except for those contributions that are made to
employees hired before January 1, 1992. Those employees will continue to receive
the supplemental 2% contribution and the 4% basic retirement contributions until
fully vested. Upon becoming 100% vested, the basic retirement contribution will
increase to 6% of employee-covered compensation and the supplemental 2%
contributions will end.
     Salaried employees who have at least one year of service are eligible to
contribute to TAP up to 10% of their pretax covered compensation through salary
deductions under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, although a lower
contribution limit may be applied to certain employees in order to maintain the
qualified status of the plan. The Company makes matching contributions of up to
4% of an employee's covered compensation for those who have at least three years
of service and elect to contribute under the plan. Effective July 1994, the
Company began to partially match contributions by employees with at least one
but less than three years of service. For such employees who elect to contribute
under the plan, the Company matches 50% of each dollar on the first 4% of the
employee's covered compensation. The Company's matching contributions are
immediately vested and, similar to retirement contributions, are tax deductible
by the Company.
     Employees direct the investment of their TAP funds and may elect to invest
in the Company's common stock.
     Expenses related to TAP for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and
1992 were $56 million, $53 million and $50 million, respectively.


HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE
................................................................................

The Company provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain active
and retired employees. The Company reserves its right to terminate these
benefits at any time. The health care benefits for active and retired employees
are self-funded by the Company with the Point-of-Service Managed Care Plan or
provided through health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Effective January 1,
1993, the health care and life insurance benefits for retirees changed. The
amount of subsidized health care coverage for active employees is based upon
their eligibility to retire as of January 1, 1993. The amount of subsidized
health care coverage for active employees is based upon their eligibility to
retire as of January 1, 1993 and their years of service at the time of
retirement. For those active employees with an adjusted service date after
September 30, 1992, there are no medical or dental benefits upon retirement.
Additionally, those employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are no longer
eligible for the nominal Company-paid life insurance benefit. Effective
January 1, 1994, newly hired employees are not eligible for Company-paid life
insurance benefits.
     The Company recognized the cost of health care benefits for active eligible
employees by expensing contributions totaling $45 million, $49 million and $47
million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Life insurance benefits for active
eligible employees are provided through an insurance company. The Company
recognizes the cost of these benefits by expensing the annual insurance
premiums, which were $2 million, $2 million and $3 million in 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively. At December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately 18,300
active eligible employees and 6,220 retirees.
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 (FAS 106), Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions. This Statement changed the method of accounting
for postretirement benefits other than pensions from a cash to an accrual basis.


56
<PAGE>

     Under FAS 106, the determination of the accrued liability requires a
calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO). The
APBO represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits other
than pensions to be paid out in the future (e.g., health benefits to be paid for
retirees) that have been earned as of the end of the year. The unrecognized APBO
at the time of adoption of FAS 106 (transition obligation) of $142 million for
postretirement health care benefits is being amortized over 20 years.
     The following table sets forth the net periodic cost for postretirement
health care benefits for 1994 and 1993:

     For measurement purposes, a health care cost trend rate was used to
recognize the effect of expected changes in future health care costs due to
medical inflation, utilization changes, technological changes, regulatory
requirements and Medicare cost shifting. Average annual increases of 5.5% for
HMOs and 8.5% for all other types of coverage in the per capita cost of covered
health care benefits were assumed for 1995. The rate for other coverage was
assumed to decrease gradually to 5.5% in 2001 and remain at that level
thereafter. Increasing the assumed health care trend by one percentage point in
each year would increase the APBO as of December 31, 1994 by $4.5 million and
the aggregate of the interest cost and service cost components of the net
periodic cost for 1994 by $0.4 million.
     In 1994, the $34.4 million increase in the unrecognized net gain was
primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, a lower average per capita
cost of health care coverage and a reduction in the health care cost trend rates
for HMOs.
     The Company also provides postretirement life insurance to certain existing
retirees. The APBO and expenses related to these benefits were not material.
     Effective July 1993, the Company also adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112 (FAS 112), Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits. This Statement requires employers to recognize the obligation to
provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. The adoption of FAS 112 resulted in an accrual of $12 million in
1993.


OTHER EXPENSES

Contract services expense was $101 million, $61 million and $48 million in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.
     Advertising and promotion expense was $65 million, $59 million and $47
million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     Operating losses, which included losses from litigation, fraud and other
matters, were $62 million, $52 million and $45 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,

     Amounts for the current year are based upon estimates and assumptions as of
the date of this report and could vary significantly from amounts shown on the
tax returns as filed. Accordingly, the variances from the amounts previously
reported for 1993 are primarily as a result of adjustments to conform to tax
returns as filed.
     The Company's income tax expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 included $3
million, under $1 million and $18 million, respectively, related to investment
securities transactions.
     The Company had net deferred tax assets of $998 million, $862 million and
$804 million at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The tax effect
of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax
assets and liabilities at December 31, 1994 and 1993 are presented below:

     The Company's $998 million net deferred tax asset at December 31, 1994
included a valuation allowance of $2 million. The January 1, 1993 valuation
allowance of $5 million was reduced by $3 million in 1993 due to the current
utilization of a California capital loss carryforward. Substantially all of the
Company's net deferred tax asset of $998 million at December 31, 1994 related
to net expenses (the largest of which was the provision for loan losses) that
have been reflected in the financial statements, but which will reduce future
taxable income. At December 31, 1994, the Company did not have any net operating
loss carryforwards. The Company estimates that approximately $875 million of the
$998 million net deferred tax asset at December 31, 1994 could be realized by
the recovery of previously paid federal taxes; however, the Company


58
<PAGE>

expects to actually realize the federal net deferred tax asset by claiming
deductions against future taxable income. The balance of approximately $123
million relates to approximately $1.8 billion of net deductions that are
expected to reduce future California taxable income (California tax law does not
permit recovery of previously paid taxes). The Company's California taxable
income has averaged approximately $1.1 billion for each of the last three years.
The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will have
sufficient future California taxable income to fully utilize these deductions.
     The significant components of deferred income tax (benefits) for the years
ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 were as follows:

     The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability of $45 million on
$124 million of undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary and an affiliate
because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in those companies and are not
taxable under current law. A deferred tax liability would be recognized to the
extent the Company changed its intent to not indefinitely reinvest a portion or
all of such undistributed earnings. In addition, a current tax liability would
be recognized if the Company recovered those undistributed earnings in a taxable
manner, such as through the receipt of dividends or sales of the entities, or if
the tax law changed.


                                                                              59

12  LEGAL ACTIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the normal course of business, the Company is at all times subject to
numerous pending and threatened legal actions, some of which the relief or
damages sought are substantial. After reviewing pending and threatened actions
with counsel, management considers that the outcome of such actions will not
have a material adverse effect on stockholders' equity of the Company; the
Company is not able to predict whether the outcome of such actions may or may
not have a material adverse effect on results of operations in a particular
future period.


                                                                              61

13  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company enters into a variety of financial contracts, which include interest

rate swap agreements. The contract or notional amounts of derivatives do not
represent amounts exchanged by the parties and therefore are not a measure of
exposure through the use of derivatives. The amounts exchanged are determined by
reference to the notional amounts and the other terms of the derivatives. The
contract or notional amounts to not represent exposure to liquidity risk. The
Company is not a dealer but an end-user of these instruments and does not use
them speculatively. The Company also offers contracts to its customers, but
hedges such contracts by purchasing other financial contracts or uses the
contracts for asset/liability management. The contracts are used primarily to
hedge mismatches in interest rate maturities and, therefore, serve to reduce
rather than increase the Company's exposure to movements in interest rates. The
Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to financial instruments. The Company controls the credit risk of
its financial contracts (except futures contracts and interest rate cap
contracts written, for which credit risk is DE MINIMUS) through credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit risk related to derivative
financial instruments is considered and, if material, provided for separately
from the allowance for loan losses. As the Company generally enters into
transactions only with high quality institutions, losses associated with
counterparty nonperformance on derivative financial instruments have been
immaterial.
     The Company also enters into foreign exchange positions, such as forward,
spot and option contracts. As these contracts are purchased for trading
purposes, they are marked to market with gains and losses recognized in income.
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119
(FAS 119), Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, on December 31, 1994. FAS 119 requires various
disclosures regarding derivative activities that are set forth on the following
pages.
     The following table summarizes the aggregate notional or contractual
amounts, credit risk amount and net fair value for the Company's derivative
financial instruments at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

     Interest rate futures and forward contracts are contracts in which the
buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to make delivery of a specific
financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. Gains and losses on
futures contracts are settled daily based on a notional (underlying) principal
value and do not involve an actual transfer of the specific instrument. Futures
contracts are standardized and are traded on exchanges. The exchange assumes the
risk that a counterparty will not pay and generally requires margin payments to
minimize such risk. Market risks arise from movements in interest rates and
security values. The Company uses 90- to 120-day futures contracts on Eurodollar
deposits and U.S. Treasury Notes mostly to shorten the rate maturity of market
rate savings to better match the rate maturity of Prime-based loans. Initial
margin requirements on futures contracts are provided by investment securities
pledged as collateral. The net deferred losses related to interest rate futures
contracts were $4 million at December 31, 1994, which will be fully amortized in
1995. The net deferred gains related to interest rate futures contracts were $4
million at December 31, 1993, which was fully amortized in 1994. The Company
also uses forward contracts with maturities of two months and under to hedge the
interest rate risk of fixed-rate real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans
originated for sale. Gains and losses attributable to the forward contracts are
included with the gains or losses on the sales of the related loans.
     Interest rate floors and caps are interest rate protection instruments that
involve the payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest differential.
This differential represents the difference between current interest rates and
an agreed-upon rate, the strike rate, applied to a notional principal amount. At
December 31, 1994, the Company had $14.4 billion of floors to protect variable-
rate loans from a drop in interest rates. Of the $14.4 billion, $2.0 billion had
forward start dates in May 1995. By purchasing a floor, the Company will be paid
by a counterparty the difference between a short-term rate (e.g., three-month
LIBOR) and the strike rate, should the short-term rate fall below the strike
level of the agreement. These contracts have a weighted average maturity of 3
years and 5 months. At December 31, 1994, there were $.2 billion of caps
purchased to hedge caps embedded within loans. The Company generally receives
cash quarterly on purchased floors (when the current interest rate falls below
the strike rate) and purchased caps (when the current interest rate exceeds the
strike rate). The premiums paid for interest rate purchased floor and cap
agreements are included with the assets hedged.
     Interest rate swap contracts are entered into primarily as an
asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate
swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as fixed-rate payments
for floating-rate payments, based on a notional principal amount. Payments
related to the Company's swap contracts are made either monthly, quarterly or
semi-annually by one of the parties depending on the specific terms of the
related contract. The primary risk associated with swaps is the exposure to
movements in interest rates and the ability of the counterparties to meet the
terms of the contract. At December 31, 1994, the Company had $3.1 billion of
interest rate swaps outstanding for interest rate risk management purposes. Of
this amount, $1.6 billion relates to swaps for which the Company receives
payments based on fixed interest rates and makes payments based on variable
rates (i.e., one- or three-month LIBOR rate). Of the $1.6 billion of receive-
fixed rate swap agreements, $1.4 billion was used to convert floating-rate loans
into fixed-rate assets. These contracts have a weighted average maturity of 1
year and 9 months, a weighted average receive rate of 5.55% and a weighted
average pay rate of 5.83%. The remaining $.2 billion was used to convert fixed-
rate debt into floating-rate obligations.  These contracts have a weighted
average maturity of 1 year and 10 months, a weighted average receive rate of
7.37% and a weighted average pay rate of 5.75%. The Company also had $1.4
billion of forward starting swaps in which the Company will receive payments
based on fixed rates and will make payments based on variable rates. These
contracts have a weighted average maturity of 4 years and 3 months. The Company
also had $.1 billion basis swaps for which the Company receives a variable rate
(i.e., six-month LIBOR) and pays another rate (i.e., one-month commercial paper
rate). The basis swaps have a weighted average maturity of 10 months, a weighted
average receive rate of 5.30% and a weighted average pay rate of 6.43%.
     At December 31, 1994, the Company had a $.1 billion cross currency swap to
convert debt costs of variable-rate long-term debt issued in German marks into
fixed-rate U.S. dollar obligations. Interest payments are settled quarterly,
whereas the principal payment will be settled at the expiration of the contract
in 1995, along with the maturity of the related hedged debt.

14  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (FAS 107), Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires that the Company disclose
estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates,
methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company's financial
instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of FAS 107 and
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes in
this Annual Report. The carrying amounts in the table are recorded in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet under the indicated captions except for the
derivative financial instruments, which are recorded in the specific asset or
liability balance being hedged or in other assets if the derivative financial
instrument is a customer accommodation.
     Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at the transaction level
using present value techniques in instances where quoted market prices are not
available. Because broadly traded markets do not exist for most of the Company's
financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the
effect of current market conditions at a specific time. Fair valuations are
management's estimates of the values, and they are often calculated based on
current pricing policy, the economic and competitive environment, the
characteristics of the financial instruments and other such factors. These
calculations are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and do not include tax ramifications; therefore, the
results cannot be determined with precision, substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate
settlement of the instruments. There may be inherent weaknesses in any
calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including
discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect
the results. The Company has not included certain material items in its
disclosure, such as the value of the long-term relationships with the Company's
deposit, credit card and trust customers, since these intangibles are not
financial instruments. For all of these reasons, the aggregation of the fair
value calculations presented herein do not represent, and should not be
construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company.


FINANCIAL ASSETS
................................................................................

SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS

This category includes cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements and due from customers on
acceptances. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because
of the relatively short period of time between the origination of the instrument
and its expected realization.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Investment securities at cost and fair value at December 31, 1994 and 1993 are
set forth in Note 3.

LOANS

The fair valuation calculation process differentiates loans based on their
financial characteristics, such as product classification, loan category,
pricing features and remaining maturity. Prepayment estimates are evaluated by
product and loan rate. Discount rates presented in the paragraphs below have a
wide range due to the Company's mix of fixed- and variable-rate products. The
Company used variable discount rates which incorporate relative credit quality
to reflect the credit risk on their fair value calculation.
     The fair value of commercial loans, other real estate mortgage loans and
real estate construction loans is calculated by discounting contractual cash
flows using discount rates that reflect the Company's current pricing for loans
with similar characteristics and remaining maturity. Most of the discount rates
for commercial loans, other real estate mortgage loans and real estate
construction loans are between 7.3% and 10.3%, 7.8% and 12.5%, and 8.0% and
12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 1994. Most of the discount rates for the
same portfolios in 1993 were between 8.2% and 9.5%, 5.5% and 9.3%, and 6.0% and
8.0%, respectively.
     For real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages, fair value is
calculated by discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayment
estimates, using discount rates based on the Company's current pricing for loans
of similar size, type, remaining maturity and repricing characteristics. Most of
the discount rates applied to this portfolio are between 7.0% and 10.0% at
December 31, 1994 and 5.7% and 7.3% at December 31, 1993.
     For credit card loans, the portfolio's yield is equal to the Company's
current pricing and, therefore, the fair value is equal to book value.

(1) The carrying amount and fair value exclude equipment leases of $124 million and $152 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
    respectively.
(2) The carrying amount and fair value exclude obligations under capital leases of $55 million and $60 million at December 31, 1994
    and 1993, respectively.
(3) The Company entered into cross currency swap agreements to hedge floating-rate subordinated debt issued in German marks and
    British pounds.
(4) The carrying amounts include unamortized fees paid or received, deferred gains or losses and gains or losses on derivative
    financial instruments receiving mark-to-market treatment.

     For other consumer loans, the fair value is calculated by discounting the
contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayment estimates, based on the current
rates offered by the Company for loans with similar characteristics. Most of the
discount rates applied to this portfolio are between 9.5% and 16.0% at December
31, 1994 and 8.5% and 9.5% at December 31, 1993.
     For auto lease financing, the fair value is calculated by discounting the
contractual cash flows at the Company's current pricing for items of similar
remaining term, without including any tax benefits. Most of the discount rates
applied to this portfolio are between 9.0% and 10.0% at December 31, 1994 and
8.0% and 9.3% at December 31, 1993.
     Commitments, standby letters of credit, and commercial and similar letters
of credit not included in the previous table have contractual values of $20,939
million, $836 million and $125 million, respectively, at December 31, 1994, and
$15,979 million, $889 million and $105 million, respectively, at December 31,
1993. These instruments generate ongoing fees at the Company's current pricing
levels. Of the commitments at December 31, 1994, 81% mature within one year and
82% are commitments to extend credit at a floating rate.

NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

The Company's nonmarketable equity investments, including securities, are
carried at cost and have a book value of $407 million and $396 million and an
estimated fair value of $618 million and $562 million at December 31, 1994 and
1993, respectively. There are restrictions on the sale and/or liquidation of the
Company's interest, which is generally in the form of limited partnerships; and
the Company has no direct control over the investment decisions of the limited
partnerships. To estimate fair value, a significant portion of the underlying
limited partnerships' investments are valued based on market quotes.


FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
................................................................................

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES

FAS 107 states that the fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing checking and savings
deposits and market rate savings, is equal to the amount payable on demand at
the measurement date. Although the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
requirement for these categories is not consistent with the market practice of
using prevailing interest rates to value these amounts, the amount included for
these deposits in the previous table is their carrying value at December 31,
1994 and 1993. The fair value of certificates of deposit and other time deposits
is calculated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The
discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for like deposits
with similar remaining maturities.

SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

This category includes federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. The
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively
short period of time between the origination of the instrument and its expected
realization.

SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT

The fair value of the Company's underwritten senior and subordinated debt is
estimated based on the quoted market prices of the instruments. The fair value
of the medium-term note programs, which are part of senior debt, is calculated
based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is
estimated using the rates currently offered for new notes with similar remaining
maturities.


DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
................................................................................

Derivative financial instruments are fair valued based on the estimated amounts
that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the
reporting date (i.e., mark-to-market value). Dealer quotes are available for
substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments.


LIMITATIONS
................................................................................

These fair value disclosures are made solely to comply with the requirements of
FAS 107. The calculations represent management's best estimates; however, due to
the lack of broad markets and the significant items excluded from this
disclosure, the calculations do not represent the underlying value of the
Company. The information presented in this footnote is based on fair value
calculations and market quotes as of December 31, 1994 and 1993. These amounts
have not been updated since year end; therefore, the valuations may have changed
significantly since that point in time.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT





The Board of Director sand Stockholders
of Wells Fargo & Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wells Fargo &
Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1994.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wells Fargo &
Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
