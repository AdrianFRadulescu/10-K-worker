Item 1.    Business

"Business"  on pages 4 through 9 of the Annual  Report to  Stockholders  for the
year ended December 31, 1995 is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information required pursuant to this Item follows:

Village Bancorp, Inc.
The  management of The Village Bank & Trust  Company  (Village)  caused  Village
Bancorp,  Inc.  (Company)  to be formed in 1983 to enhance the  opportunity  for
diversification  and  expansion,  and to allow for greater  flexibility  in both
banking and  non-banking  functions  which banks are currently  prohibited  from
entering.  On July 19, 1983,  the Bank became a wholly owned  subsidiary  of the
Company.  On November  18,  1994,  Liberty  National  Bank  (Liberty),  Danbury,
Connecticut  became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  On June 20, 1995,
the Company merged Liberty into Village and now operates Liberty's former office
as a branch office of Village. As a combination of entities under common control
the merger was accounted for in a manner similiar to a pooling of interests.  As
such,  all  historical  financial  data  presented in the annual report has been
restated to include both entities for all periods presented.  As of December 31,
1995 the Company's only subsidiary was Village.

The Village Bank & Trust Company
The  Village  Bank &  Trust  Company  was  incorporated  in 1973  and  commenced
operations  in  1974.  The  Bank  maintains  its   headquarters  in  Ridgefield,
Connecticut  where it conducts  general  banking  business as a state  chartered
commercial  bank as allowed by Sec. 36-57 of the Connecticut  General  Statutes.
The Bank began  offering  trust and  similiar  services in the third  quarter of
1993. Liberty was merged into Village in June 1995, with its former office now a
Village branch. The Bank intends to offer services in the future that will allow
the Bank to remain competitive with other financial  institutions as regulations
permit.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Concessions Held
There are no  patents,  trademarks,  licenses  or  concessions  held that have a
material importance to the Company.

Seasonal Variations In Business
The Bank experiences little or no seasonal variation in its business due to the
retail composition of its customer base.

Dependence Upon Limited Number Of Customers
The Bank is not materially  dependent on any single person,  group of persons or
organization.  The loss of any customer or customers would not have a materially
adverse effect on the continued operation of the Bank.

Competition
The Bank  encounters  substantial  competition for deposits and loans from other
financial  institutions.  Vigorous competition exists between the Bank and other
branch offices of financial  institutions  in Danbury,  New Milford,  Wilton and
Ridgefield,  including  commercial  banks,  savings  banks and  savings and loan
associations.  No one  financial  institution  is  dominant  in  any  particular
function of the banking market place.

Number of Employees
At  December  31,  1995,  Village  had  seventy-five  (75) full time  equivalent
employees.  Of these employees two officers of Village  provide  services to the
Company.

Supervision and Regulation
Village is insured by the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC) and is
subject to extensive  regulation by the FDIC.  Village,  as a Connecticut  state
chartered bank, is also subject to regulation by the  Connecticut  State Banking
Commissioner,  who is responsible for administering  Connecticut banking laws. (
Bancorp, as a bank holding company, is also subject to regulation by the Federal
Reserve Board.

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

The  FDIC has  adopted  regulations  which  require  FDIC-insured  banks to meet
certain  minimum  capital  requirements.  Banks that have less than the  minimum
required  capital  are  considered  to be  operating  in an unsafe  and  unsound
condition,  and are  subject  to a number  of  possible  regulatory  enforcement
actions,  ranging  from  being  required  to  acquire  additional  capital up to
termination of the Bank's FDIC deposit insurance.

Most  recent  legislation  has been aimed at  increasing  capital  levels in the
banking  industry and  restricting  business for those who fail to meet adequate
capital  levels.  As the  Company  is  well  capitalized  the  majority  of this
legislation  has had  little  effect  on the  operation  of the  Company.  Other
regulatory  actions focus on risk management  (i.e.  interest rate risk,  credit
risk) and the proper use of internal controls.  Proposed legislation runs a wide
gamut of  proposals.  It is not possible at this time to predict  whether or not
any such proposals will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Item 2.    Properties

Village  owns in fee simple a self  contained  facility  at 25  Prospect  Steet,
Ridgefield,  Connecticut.  The site contains  0.929 acres.  The building has two
floors,  the first floor which approximates 5,500 square feet is the location of
the general banking area, board room and President's  office.  The second floor,
which  approximates  5,000  square feet,  is the location of the  administrative
offices, loan operations department, sanitary and employee facilities.

Village  entered into a lease  agreement  on April 5, 1985 for a branch  banking
facility at 219 Town Green,  Wilton,  Connecticut.  The  leasehold  contains two
thousand  six hundred  forty five (2,645)  square  feet,  of which the Bank uses
approximately  one thousand nine hundred forty five (1,945)  square feet for its
branch banking office.  The remaining area is sublet as retail space.  The lease
arrangement is for ten years with two five year  extensions  options that can be
exercised  by the Bank.  The lease  has  provisions  for  consumer  price  index
increases,  and the current rental expense is $73,220 not including property tax
and  maintenance  charges.  This facility was opened  November 16, 1985 and is a
full service branch banking office.

Village  extended  a  lease  agreement  on  March  31,  1993,  for a  non-branch
operations  (back-office) facility at 96 Danbury Road, Ridgefield,  Connecticut.
The leasehold contains  approximately six thousand (6,000) square feet of office
space and one thousand  (1,000) square feet of storage space. The original lease
arrangement was for five years with provisions for two five year extensions,  at
an annual  rental of  approximately  $86,540,  not  including  property  tax and
maintenance charges.  This lease originally commenced November,  1988, with five
percent annual  increases.  Four  stockholders,  two of whom are Directors,  are
affiliated with the partnership which is leasing the facility to the Bank.

Village owns in fee simple a self contained  facility at 54 Bridge  Street,  New
Milford, Connecticut. The site contains 0.16 acres. The building has two floors.
The first floor,  which  approximates  1,700 square feet, is the location of the
general banking office.  The second floor, which approximates 1,524 square feet,
will be used for offices and loan originations and closings.

Village has a lease  agreement for a branch banking  facility at 28 Shelter Rock
Road,  Danbury,  Connecticut,  that extends through November 30, 1996. The lease
agreement provides for two renewal options which extend for five years each. The
leasehold contains  approximately two thousand four hundred sixty (2,460) square
feet. The annual rental is  approximately  $48,150,  not including  property and
maintenance charges.

There are no material pending legal proceedings.


Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders during the
fourth quarter of 1994.

LETTER TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS

[GRAPHIC]-----------------------------------------------------------------------

      With the completion of 1995, we find ourselves  halfway through the decade
of the 90's.  As a result,  it  seemed  appropriate  to adopt our theme for this
year's  annual  report - "Chart the Past,  Navigate  the  Present,  Explore  the
Future."

      1995 is now the past.  We are very  pleased to report  that net income for
the year was  $1,316,000  or $1.38 per share,  an 86% increase from the 1994 net
income of $707,000 or $.74 per share.

      Total  consolidated  assets on  December  31, 1995 were  $174,277,000,  an
increase of 10.8% over the  $157,241,000  reported on December 31,  1994.  Total
deposits  had  increased  to   $158,539,000   on  December  31,  1995  from  the
$143,421,000  reported the previous year end. The Corporation's  equity totalled
$14,148,000 as of December 31, 1995. Very significantly, during 1995 The Village
Bank & Trust  Company's  loan  portfolio  increased  $13,266,000  to a total  of
$119,591,000  outstanding on December 31, 1995. All of our financial results can
be found in great detail later in this annual report.

      Over the past few years,  the Corporation has made conscious  decisions to
undertake  projects that would benefit the  Corporation  in the future.  Some of
those projects are now generating returns to the Corporation as expected.

      Early in 1995,  the decision was made to merge Liberty  National Bank into
The Village Bank & Trust  Company.  This was completed in June of 1995,  and the
resulting cost savings  benefitted the Corporation during the second half of the
year. Our office in New Milford is now solidly  profitable and continues to grow
in deposits and loans.  Our new Trust  Department  is gaining  acceptance in the
area,  and steadily  growing.  Each of these past  projects  contributed  to the
excellent results for 1995.

      The  present is a time of rapid  change  for our  industry.  The  numerous
mergers and consolidations of other banks have been  well-publicized.  The names
of many of our competitors have changed over the last five years, some more than
once. Village Bancorp continues to "navigate" through this evolution in banking.
Our focus in on  carefully  controlled  growth  which we believe will return the
maximum value to our  shareholders.  With this in mind, The Village Bank & Trust
Company is building a 17,000  square foot  building in the middle of the Danbury
downtown  redevelopment area. When complete sometime early in 1997, the building
will house the fifth office of The Village Bank on the ground floor, and most of

                                     PAGE 8

the Bank's back office check  processing  departments on the top two floors.  By
moving our operations  departments into our own building,  the Bank will be able
to eliminate  sizeable  rental payments that are currently being paid for leased
office  space.  As a result,  we expect that this branch  office will quickly be
profitable.

      More than at any time in the past,  the  future for our  Corporation  will
seem like exploring unknown territory. In particular,  the technological changes
that already exist and are being  developed will  revolutionize  the delivery of
many of our products.  Management and the Board are spending  considerable  time
and effort  studying  the options  available,  in order to choose  products  and
services we believe our  customers  will want, in a form that will be profitable
to the Bank.

      Today is an exciting time to be in our industry. Our Corporation has found
great  success to date,  and we fully  intend to continue  that success into the
future. We enjoy having you share in the growth of the Corporation as we explore
the future.

================================================================================


At December 31, 1995 $553,000 of nonaccrual loans were collateralized.

A loan is put on  nonaccrual  basis when the loan  becomes past due ninety days,
except for instances  where there are factors known to management  which reflect
favorably  on the ability of the  customer to fulfill the  obligation.  The Bank
would have recorded an additional $51,000, $55,000 and $87,000 of gross interest
income  in 1995,  1994 and  1993,  respectively,  if  nonaccrual  loans had been
current.

====================================================================================
</TABLE>


(1)  The amount charged to operations  and the related  balance in the allowance
     for loan losses is based upon periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio by
     management.  These evaluations consider several factors including,  but not
     limited to, general economic conditions, loan portfolio composition,  prior
     loan loss experience and management's estimation of potential losses.


The  allowance  for loan losses is  considered  adequate by  management to cover
known and  unknown  risk  elements  in the  portfolios.  This  consideration  is
affected by the Bank's real estate lending  portfolio which represents the major
portion of the growth in the loan  portfolios.  Real estate loans are  generally
well  collateralized,  and are  therefore  reflected  as such in the  allowance.
Management  anticipates no material increase or decrease in charge-off  activity
in 1996.

                     Management's Discussion & Analysis of
                  Financial Condition & Results of Operations

General

Village  Bancorp,  Inc.  (Company) is a  Connecticut  incorporated  bank holding
company and parent  corporation  of the Village Bank & Trust Company  (Village),
which is the only subsidiary of the Company.  In January 1994,  Village Bancorp,
Inc. and Liberty  National Bank  (Liberty)  jointly  announced the signing of an
agreement by which Village  Bancorp,  Inc. would acquire all of the  outstanding
common stock of Liberty.  This  acquisition  took place in November of 1994.  In
June of 1995,  Liberty  National  Bank was merged into The Village  Bank & Trust
Company.  All  historical  financial  data has been  restated  to  include  both
entities  for  all  periods  presented.   The  Bank  functions  as  a  financial
intermediary  acting as  depository  and lender of funds to its  customers,  and
generates its income from the interest  earned on invested  assets less interest
paid on its deposits and interest bearing  liabilities.  The Bank is a member of
the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC) and the deposits of the Bank
are  insured  by the FDIC to the extent  provided  by law.  The Bank  offers all
general   commercial   banking  services  allowed  by  both  State  and  Federal
regulations.  The Company does not engage in any non-banking activities that are
permitted to bank  holding  companies  under  enacted  regulations.  The Bank is
subject to intense  competition  from various  financial  institutions and other
companies or firms that engage in similiar  activities.  Bank holding  companies
and banks are  extensively  regulated  under both  federal  and state law. As of
December  31,  1995,  the  Bank  had 75  full-time  equivalent  employees.  Most
full-time  employees  are  eligible  for group  life,  health  and  medical  and
disability   insurance.   Village  Bank  &  Trust  employees  are  eligible  for
participation in a 401(k) plan after one year of service.  The Company is listed
on the National  Association of Securities  Dealers  Automated  Quotation System
("NASDAQ")  SmallCap  Stock  Market  price  quotation  service  under the symbol
"VBNK".  Village began operating a trust  department and offering trust services
in the third quarter of 1993.

Financial Condition

The Company had total assets of $174,277,000 on December 31, 1995 as compared to
assets of  $157,241,000  on December  31,  1994.  The most  significant  area of
increase over the past year was in loans, which increased  $13,266,000  (12.5%).

Loan  growth  was  funded by an  increase  of  $15,118,000  (10.5%) in the Banks
deposits.  This increase in loans is primarily due to the fact that the majority
of the loans the Bank  originated  were  variable rate loans which are generally
retained  for its own  portfolio,  as  opposed  to fixed  rate  loans  which are
generally sold in the secondary  mortgage market. 

The loan portfolio of the Bank includes  $96,137,000 of real estate, home equity
and construction  mortgages.  This is 80.4% of the Banks total loan portfolio as
of December 31,  1995.  This is in  comparison  to  $89,543,000  (84.2%) in real
estate  related  loans  outstanding  on  December  31,  1994.  Due to this  high
percentage  of real  estate  loans the  management  of the Bank is  continuously
monitoring real estate values and the general economic  conditions in the Bank's
lending areas so that it may take appropriate action when necessary.

Capital Resources

The  Company,  aware  that its  capital  position  is a measure  of its  ongoing
viability and ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial
services industry,  strives to maintain a strong capital position. With a strong
capital position,  the Company has the ability to effectively compete now and in
the future and be better able to withstand economic  instability or uncertainty.
The  Company has a leverage  ratio of 8.37% on December  31, 1995 as compared to
8.79% on December 31, 1994. 

In 1989 the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation approved a final Statement of
Policy on Risk-Based Capital to be implemented over a two-year transition period
beginning at December 31, 1990.  Risk weights are assigned to balance  sheet and
off-balance  sheet items and are used to calculate the Bank's capital ratios. On
December 31, 1995 the required minimum capital was 8.0% of total capital to risk
weighted assets and 4.0% Tier 1 capital to risk weighted  assets.  The Company's
ratios on December  31, 1995 were 14.68% total  capital  ratio and 13.87% Tier 1
capital ratio, which exceed the minimum requirements.  These ratios for December
31, 1994 were 15.44% and 14.33%,  respectively.  Management  does not anticipate
any event that would cause the Company to fall below the minimum requirements at
December 31, 1996, and anticipates that the Company will continue to have excess
"risk -based" capital.

Results of Operations

Net income  for 1995 was  $1,316,000  as  compared  to  $707,000  for 1994.  Net
interest  income for 1995 amounted to  $7,694,000 as compared to $7,002,000  for
1994.  Net interest  income  increased  primarily as a result of the increase in
interest income on loans.

Income Taxes

The  Company's  provision  for income taxes was $984,000 for 1995 as compared to
$719,000 for 1994. 

In February 1992, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standard  (SFAS) No. 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes",

                                    PAGE 16
<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

which  requires an asset and  liability  approach for financial  accounting  and
reporting for income taxes.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 effective  January
1, 1993. There was no effect of initially applying this new standard.

Assets and Related Income Analysis

Loans  outstanding  on December  31, 1995  totaled  $119,591,000  as compared to
$106,325,000  outstanding  on  December  31,  1994.  The  increase  in the  loan
portfolio of $13,266,000  (12.5%) was primarily  attributable to the majority of
real estate loans originated being variable rate, which the Bank primarily holds
for its own portfolio.  The majority of loans at the Bank are and have been real
estate  related.  Loan income  increased  $2,369,000 from $7,808,000 for 1994 to
$10,177,000 for 1995. This increase is due to an increase in average outstanding
loans  from  $98,908,000  for 1994 to  $116,921,000  for 1995,  coupled  with an
increase  in the  average  rate  earned  from  7.81%  in 1994 to  8.70% in 1995.

Securities,   which  consist  of  securities   held-to-maturity  and  securities
available-for-sale, decreased $1,255,000 (3.5%) from $35,817,000 at December 31,
1994 to  $34,562,000  at December 31,  1995.  Income from  securities  decreased
$85,000  (4.5%) from  $1,877,000  for the 1994 period to $1,792,000 for the 1995
period.  This  decrease  resulted  primarily  from a decrease in average  dollar
amount  outstanding from $34,818,000 for 1994 to $29,196,000 for 1995, offset by
an  increase in average  rate earned from 5.39% for 1994 to 6.14% for 1995.  Net
security  gains were  $70,000 in 1995;  there were none in 1994.  The Bank holds
securities  held-to-maturity  until maturity and does not trade them. Securities
available-for-sale are used to compensate for liquidity forecasting  deviations.

Federal funds sold increased $4,950,000 (152.3%) from $3,250,000 at December 31,
1994 to  $8,200,000 at December 31, 1995.  Federal  funds sold income  increased
$105,000  (39.5%) from  $266,000 for 1994 to $371,000  for 1995.  This  increase
resulted  primarily  from an increase in the average  rate earned from 4.23% for
1994 to 5.86% in 1995,  coupled with a slight  increase in average dollar amount
outstanding from $6,289,000 in 1994 to $6,329,000 in 1995.

Liability and Related Expense Analysis

Deposits increased $15,118,000 (10.5%) from $143,421,000 at December 31, 1994 to
$158,539,000  at December 31, 1995.  Interest on deposits  increased  $1,697,000
(57.5%)  from  $2,949,000  for 1994 to  $4,646,000  for 1995.  This  increase is
attributable  to an  increase  in the  average  rate paid from 2.43% for 1994 to
3.17% for 1995  period,  coupled with an increase in the average  dollar  amount
outstanding from  $135,642,000 for 1994 to $146,480,000 in 1995. 

Data  processing  services  increased  $45,000  (10.6%) from $425,000 in 1994 to
$470,000 in 1995,  as a result of increased  use of services  offered along with
increased volumes.

Printing,  stationery  and  supplies  expense  increased  $54,000  (32.5%)  from
$166,000  in 1994 to  $220,000  in 1995,  mainly  as a result  of the  merger of
Liberty National Bank into Village.

Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses decreased  $101,000 (32.5%) from $311,000 for 1994
to $210,000 for 1995. The economy and the real estate market in the Banks market
areas are closely  monitored by  management  to maintain an  allowance  for loan
losses that is considered  adequate.  The loan loss  allowance was $1,311,000 to
support loan portfolios of $119,591,000,  or a loan loss reserve ratio of 1.10%.
This is in comparison to a ratio of 1.46% for 1994. Management believes that the
allowance for loan losses is adequate.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Financial  institutions  have become  increasingly  concerned about matching the
repricing  ability  of  interest-earning  assets  to the  repricing  ability  of
interest-bearing  liabilities.  Interest rate risk occurs when these  repricings
occur in  different  time  frames.  An interest  rate  sensitivity  "gap" is the
difference between the repricing assets and the repricing  liabilities  occuring
in a given time frame.  A positve "gap" occurs when the asset amount exceeds the
liability  amount. A negative "gap" occurs when the liability amount exceeds the
asset amount. In a falling interest rate environment a negative "gap" would tend
to increase the institution's net interest income,  while a positive "gap" would
have an adverse effect.  In a rising interest rate  environment a positive "gap"
would tend to increase the institution's  net interest income,  while a negative
"gap" would have an adverse effect. Normally institutions attempt to match these
repricings   while   maintaining  an  adequate   interest  rate  spread  without
compromising the quality of assets. The Bank's interest rate sensitivity for the
one year or less  time  frame  consists  of  $129,261,000  of  repricing  assets
compared to $133,980,000 of repricing  liabilities.  For more information please
see "Business".

                  Financial Condition & Results of Operations
                  (continued)
Liquidity

Liquidity is the ability to provide funds for loan requests,  unexpected deposit
outflows and meeting  other  recurring  financial  obligations.  The Bank,  as a
financial intermediary, monitors its liquidity position carefully, that it might
identify trends that could impact its  liquidity/cash  flow position.  The Banks
experience little in seasonal liquidity  fluctuation.  Loan commitments are also
closely  monitored  to assure these  commitments  do not  negatively  affect the
Bank's planned  liquidity  position.  Primary liquidity is comprised of cash and
due from banks,  interbank  overnight federal funds sold and securities maturing
in less than one year. These assets  aggregated  $37,745,000,  or 21.7% of total
assets, as of December 31, 1995, as compared to $30,503,000  (19.4%) at December
31, 1994.  Management closely monitors the Bank's  liquidity/cash  flow position
and does not anticipate any liquidity problems in the future.

Impact of Inflation

The  quantitative  impact of  inflation  is  subjective  in  interpretation  and
difficult and imprecise to measure in the financial services industry. Inflation
poses a financial risk as the Bank's assets  consist mainly of financial  assets
which are funded by deposit liabilities of varying maturities and deposit yields
as opposed to physical or real assets.  With few fixed or physical  assets,  the
Bank has a low degree of operating  leverage  which  mitigates the  inflationary
impact.  The  financial  leverage  ratio of capital to total  assets is the most
effective  measure of a  financial  institution's  viability  and its ability to
withstand inflationary pressures.

COMPARISON OF 1994 TO 1993

Financial Condition

The Company had total assets of $157,241,000 on December 31, 1994 as compared to
assets of  $152,890,000  on December  31,  1993.  The most  significant  area of
increase over the year was in loans, which increased  $12,381,000 (13.2%). 

Loan growth was funded by an increase of $4,475,000  (3.2%) in deposits  coupled
with a decrease in securities of $5,757,000  (13.9%).  This increase in loans is
primarily  due to the fact that the  majority  of the loans the Bank  originated
were variable rate loans which are generally retained for its own portfolio,  as
opposed to fixed rate loans which are generally  sold in the secondary  mortgage
market.

The loan portfolio of the Bank includes  $89,543,000 of real estate, home equity
and construction mortgages.

This is 84.2% of the Bank's total loan  portfolio as of December 31, 1994.  This
is in comparison to $78,367,000 (83.4%) in real estate related loans outstanding
on December 31, 1993.

Capital Resources

The  Company had a leverage  ratio of 8.79% on December  31, 1994 as compared to
9.07% on December 31, 1993. At December 31, 1994, the Company's total capital to
risk  weighted  assets ratio was 15.44% and its Tier 1 capital to risk  weighted
assets  ratio was 14.33%.  Each of these  capital  ratios was  substantially  in
excess of regulatory requirements.

Results of Operations

Net income for 1994 was $707,000 as compared to $994,000 for 1993.  Net interest
income for 1994 amounted to $7,002,000 as compared to $6,744,000  for 1993.  Net
interest  income  increased  primarily  as a result of the  increase in interest
income on securities.

Income Taxes

The  Company's  provision  for income taxes was $719,000 for 1994 as compared to
$652,000 for 1993.

Assets and Related Income Analysis

Loans  outstanding  on December  31, 1994  totaled  $106,325,000  as compared to
$93,944,000 outstanding on December 31, 1993. The increase in the loan portfolio
of  $12,381,000  (13.2%) was  primarily  attributable  to the  majority of loans
originated  being  variable  rate,  which the Bank  primarily  holds for its own
portfolio.  The  majority of loans are and have been real estate  related.  Loan
income  increased  $3,000 from  $7,805,000 for 1993 to $7,808,000 for 1994. This
increase is due to an increase in average outstanding loans from $95,154,000 for
1993 to  $98,908,000  for 1994,  offset by a decrease in the average rate earned
from 8.20% in 1993 to 7.81% in 1994.  

Securities,   which  consist  of  securities   held-to-maturity  and  securities
available-for-sale,  decreased  $5,757,000  (13.9%) from $41,574,000 at December
31, 1993 to $35,817,000 at December 31, 1994.  Income from securities  increased
$150,000  (8.7%) from  $1,727,000 for the 1993 period to $1,877,000 for the 1994
period.  This increase  resulted  primarily  from an increase in average  dollar
amount  outstanding from $31,617,000 for 1993 to $34,818,000 for 1994, offset by
a decrease in average  rate  earned  from 5.46% for 1993 to 5.39% for 1994.  Net
security  gains were  $10,000 in 1993;  there were none in 1994.  The Bank holds
securities  held-to-maturity  until  maturity and do not trade them.  Securities

available-for-sale are used to compensate for liquidity forecasting  deviations.

Federal funds sold decreased  $3,100,000 (48.8%) from $6,350,000 at December 31,
1993 to  $3,250,000 at December 31, 1994.  Federal  funds sold income  increased
$74,000  (38.5%)  from  $192,000 for 1993 to $266,000  for 1994.  This  increase
resulted  primarily  from an increase in the average  rate earned from 2.92% for
1993 to 4.23% in 1994, offset by a decrease in average dollar amount outstanding
from $6,586,000 in 1993 to $6,289,000 in 1994.

Liability and Related Expense Analysis

Deposits  increased  $4,475,000 (3.2%) from $138,946,000 at December 31, 1993 to
$143,421,000 at December 31, 1994. Interest on deposits decreased $31,000 (1.0%)
from  $2,980,000 for 1993 to $2,949,000 for 1994.  This decrease is attributable
to a decrease  in the  average  rate paid from 2.55% for 1993 to 2.43% for 1994,
offset by an increase in the average dollar amount outstanding from $129,752,000
for 1993 to $135,642,000 in 1994.  

Other  operating  expenses  increased  $97,000 (11.1%) from $874,000 for 1993 to
$971,000  for  1994.  The  significant  component  of this  increase  are  costs
associated with the merger of the Company and Liberty.

Provisions for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses increased  $266,000 (591.1%) from $45,000 for 1993
to $311,000  for 1994.  The  economy  and the real  estate  market in the Bank's
market areas have been closely  monitored by management to maintain an allowance
for loan  losses  that is  considered  adequate.  The loan  loss  allowance  was
$1,551,000 to support loan  portfolios of  $106,325,000,  or a loan loss reserve
ratio of 1.46%.  This is in comparison to a ratio of 1.82% for 1993.  Management
believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate.


Liquidity

Primary liquidity is comprised of cash and due from banks,  interbank  overnight
federal funds sold and  securities  maturing in less than one year.  This figure
amounted to  $30,503,000  or 19.4% of total assets,  as of December 31, 1994, as
compared to $36,845,000; or 24.1% of total assets, as of December 31, 1993.

             Independent Auditors' Report

                      [Letterhead of Deloitte & Touche LLP]


To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Village Bancorp, Inc.

We have audited the  consolidated  balance sheets of village  Bancorp,  Inc. and
subsidiary  (the  "Company")  as of  December  31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of income changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the  three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1995.  These
financial  statements are the  reponsibility  of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our
audits.  The consolidated  financial  statements give retroactive  effect to the
1994 merger of Village  Bancorp,  Inc and Liberty  National Bank, which has been
accounted  for  as a  pooling  of  interests  as  described  in  Note  1 to  the
consolidated  financial statements,  In 1995, Liberty National Bank was combined
with the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,  The Village Bank and Trust Company,
as a combination of entities under common control and accordingly, was accounted
for in a  manner  similar  to a  pooling  of  interests.  We did not  audit  the
statements of income,  changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows of Liberty
National Bank for the year ended December 31, 1993, such statements  reflect net
interest  income of $686,427.  Those  statements  were audited by other auditors
whose  report  dated  March 25,  1994  (April  22,  1994 as to Note 13) has been
furnished to us, and our opinion,  insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for Liberty  National Bank for 1993, is based solely on the report of such other
auditors.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards,  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement An audit includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits and the report of the other auditors  provide a reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of the other  auditors,  the
consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,   the  financial  position  of  Village  Bancorp,  Inc.  and
subsidiary as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended  December
31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As  described  in Note 1, the  Company  changed  its  method of  accounting  for
securities in 1994.

                                      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


Nature of Operations - Village  Bancorp,  Inc. and its  subsidiary,  The Village
Bank & Trust Company (the "Bank"),  collectively  the "Company",  are engaged in
the business of commercial  banking.  Headquartered  in Ridgefield,  the Company
operates  four  branch   offices  in  Fairfield  and   Litchfield   counties  in
Connecticut. The Company principally is engaged in lending and deposit gathering
activities  within these counties.  The Company's  future  prospects are largely
dependent on its ability to compete with entities  having greater  resources and
on the  performance  of the  local  economy.  A wide  range of loan and  deposit
products and trust  services are offered to the customer.  Customer  convenience
and responsive  service are emphasized.  Over 80% of loans are collateralized by
real estate located in Fairfield,  Litchfield and adjacent counties. Within this
area  employment  levels  and  related  economic  activity   generally  are  not
materially dependent on any one employer.

Organization  - In November of 1994,  Village  Bancorp,  Inc.  acquired  Liberty
National Bank  (Liberty).  Each share of Liberty stock was converted  into .1149
shares of Village Bancorp, Inc. common stock. This transaction was accounted for
using the pooling-of-interests method and, accordingly, all historical financial
data has been  restated to include both entities for all periods  presented.  On
June 20,  1995,  the  Company  merged  Liberty  into  Village  and now  operates
Liberty's  former  office as a branch  office of Village.  In 1995,  Liberty was
combined with the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,  The Village Bank and Trust
Company, as a combination of entities under common control and, accordingly, was
accounted for in a manner similiar to a pooling of interests.

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation - The Company's consolidated financial
statements  include the Bank and have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  and conform with  predominant  practices  used
within  the  banking  industry.   All  significant   intercompany  accounts  and
transactions  are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  In preparing  such  financial
statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  the  date  of  the
consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and expenses for the period.  Actual
results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Estimates that are particularly  susceptible to significant change relate to the
determination  of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate
acquired  in  connection  with  foreclosures  or in  satisfaction  of loans.  In
connection  with the  determination  of the  allowance  for loan losses and real
estate  owned,   management  obtains  independent   appraisals  for  significant
properties.

Management  believes  that the  allowance  for loan  losses is  adequate.  While
management uses available  information to recognize possible loan losses, future
additions  to the  allowance  may be  necessary  based on  changes  in  economic
conditions,  particularly  in the Bank's service area,  Fairfield and Litchfield
Counties,  Connecticut. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their  examination  process,  periodically  review the Bank's allowance for loan
losses.  Such agencies may recommend to the Bank that it recognize  additions to
the allowance based on their judgements of information  available to them at the
time of their examination.

Allowance  for Loan  Losses - The  allowance  for loan  losses is  sustained  by
charges to operating  expense.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan
losses when  management  believes  that the  collectibility  of the principal is
unlikely;  recoveries  of  previously  charged  off  loans are  restored  to the
allowance.  The  allowance  for loan losses is  maintained  at a level  believed
adequate  by  management  to  absorb  potential  losses  in the loan  portfolio.
Management's  determination  of the  adequacy  of the  allowance  is based on an
evaluation of the loan portfolio and other pertinent factors, including, but not
limited to, past loan loss  experience,  composition  of the loan  portfolio and
current economic factors.

Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows  -  For  purposes  of  presenting  the
consolidated statements of cash flows, cash equivalents include amounts due from
banks  and  federal  funds  sold.  Generally,  federal  funds  sold have one day
availability.

Securities  -  Securities  held-to-maturity  are  stated at cost,  adjusted  for
accumulated  amortization  of  premium  and  accretion  of  discount,  which  is
calculated  on a  method  that  approximates  the  interest  method.  Securities
available-for-sale  are  stated  at the  lower  of cost or at  fair  value.  The
determination  to include debt  securities  as  securities  held-to-maturity  or
securities  available-for-sale  is made at the time of purchase  and is based on
such factors as overall  interest  rate  sensitivity  of the Company,  projected
liquidity needs, and the Company's long-term investment strategies. The Banks do
not acquire securities for the purpose of engaging in trading  activities.  When
sales occur,  gains or losses on the sale of securities are recognized using the
specific  identification method. The Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold its securities  classified as held-to-maturity  for their economic life.
Prior to the adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
115,  "Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities",  on
January 1, 1994, the Company stated all securities at amortized cost.

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                  (continued)

Loans -  Interest  income  on loans is  recognized  based  on rates  applied  to
principal  amounts  outstanding.  Loans are  placed on  nonaccrual  status  when
management  believes  that  interest  or  principal  on  such  loans  may not be
collected in the normal course of business.  Interest payments received on loans
in  nonaccrual  status are applied,  based on  management's  judgement as to the
collectibility  of loan  principal,  either as a reduction  of  principal  or as
interest  income.  Such loans are  restored  to accrual  status when there is no
longer  doubt  concerning  collectibility  and the  borrower  has  performed  in
accordance  with the terms of the loan.  Loans  held for sale are  stated at the
lower of fair value or cost.

Loan origination and commitment fees, net of certain loan origination costs, are
deferred and the net amount  amortized as an  adjustment  of the related  loan's
yield.  Loan fees  deferred in 1995 and 1994  aggregated  $282,000 and $367,000,
respectively.  Loan  costs  deferred  in 1995 and 1994  aggregated  $20,000  and
$27,000,  respectively.  Net  amounts  included in income  aggregated  $433,000,
$93,000 and $161,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Impaired Loans - The Company adopted SFAS No. 114,  "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan", as amended by SFAS No. 118,  "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan - Income  Recognition  and  Disclosures",  as of January 1,
1995.  Adoption  of these  statements  did not result in any  adjustment  to the
allowance for loan losses as of January 1, 1995.

A loan is  recognized  as impaired  when it is probable  that  principal  and/or
interest are not  collectible in accordance  with the  contractual  terms of the
loan.  When a loan is considered  impaired,  it is placed on nonaccrual  status.
Income is  recorded  using the income  recognition  principles  outlined  above.
Measurement of impairment is based on the present value of expected  future cash
flows  discounted  at the  loan's  effective  interest  rate,  or, at the loan's
observable  market  price or the fair  value of the  collateral,  if the loan is
collateral  dependent.  Small homogeneous  loans such as residential  mortgages,
home equity  loans,  installment  loans and consumer  credit are not  separately
reviewed for impaired status. These loans typically are for maturities less than
five years and require monthly payments.  Separate  allocations to the allowance
for loan  losses  are made  based upon  trends  and prior  loss  experience  and
composition  of  credit  risk in  these  types  of  loans.  This  evaluation  is
inherently  subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible
to significant change.

If the fair value of an impaired loan is less than the related  recorded amount,
a  specific  valuation  allowance  is  established  or the write down is charged
against the  allowance  for loan losses if the  impairment  is  considered to be
permanent.

Bank  Premises and  Equipment - Bank  premises and equipment are stated at cost,
less accumulated  depreciation and  amortization.  Depreciation and amortization
are computed using the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives or
the  lease  term,  if  shorter,  up to 39 years  for  premises  and 15 years for
equipment.

Income  Taxes  - SFAS  No.  109,  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes",  establishes
financial  accounting  and  reporting  standards for the effects of income taxes
that result from an  enterprise's  activities  during the current and  preceding
years,  requires an asset and liability  approach for financial  accounting  and
reporting for income taxes.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 effective  January
1, 1993. There was no effect of initially applying this standard.

Other Real Estate - Other real estate includes  properties  which are foreclosed
or received in  settlement  of a loan,  and real  property  not used in trade or
business. The properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value (net of
estimated costs of disposition) at the date  transferred.  Losses arising at the
time of  acquisition of such  properties  are charged  against the allowance for
loan losses.  Subsequent  write-downs of the carrying value of these  properties
may be  required  and would be  charged to  operations.  There was no other real
estate at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

Net  Income  Per Share - Net  income  per share has been  computed  based on the
weighted  average  number of common and common  equivalent  shares  outstanding;
956,937  shares in 1995,  950,190  shares in 1994,  and 944,938  shares in 1993.
Common stock  equivalents,  which consist of common stock  options,  have only a
minor dilutive effect (less than 3%) in 1995, 1994 and 1993.

Pending  Accounting  Pronouncements  - SFAS No. 122,  "Accounting  for  Mortgage
Servicing  Rights," requires  separate  capitalization of the costs of rights to
service  mortgage  loans for  others  regardless  of  whether  these  rights are
acquired  through a purchase  or loan  origination  activity.  Adoption  of this
Statement  is  required as of January 1, 1996.  Given the  current  level of the
Company's  mortgage  banking  activities,  adoption  of  this  Statement  is not
expected to have a material  effect upon the  Company's  financial  condition or
results of operations.

SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for Stock  Based  Compensation",  requires  expanded
disclosures of stock based  compensation  arrangements and encourages,  but does
not require,  employers to adopt a fair value method of accounting  for employee
stock based compensation. While the Company has not yet determined the effect of
this statement  when it becomes  effective in 1996,  management  does not expect
that adoption of this statement  will have a material  effect upon the Company's
financial condition or results of operations.

Reclassifications - Certain 1994 and 1993 amounts in the consolidated  financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1995 presentation.



2. Cash and Due from Banks

The Bank is required by Federal  regulation  to maintain  average  cash  reserve
balances.  Throughout 1995, daily cash reserves and compensating balances served
to satisfy this requirement and averaged approximately $2,068,000.



3. Securities


The aggregate amortized cost and fair values of securities  held-to-maturity and
securities  available-for-sale  at December  31, are  summarized  as follows (in

At December 31, 1995,  securities  with an amortized cost of $614,000 and a fair
value of $628,000 were pledged to secure public funds and for other  purposes as
required by law and banking  regulation.  Gross gains on sales of  securities in
1995, 1994 and 1993 were $77,000, $0 and $10,000, respectively, and gross losses
were $7,000, $0 and $0.

The  amortized  cost and fair value of  securities  at  December  31,  1995,  by
contractual  maturity,  are shown below.  Expected  maturities  will differ from
contractual  maturities  because  issuers  may have the  right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

In December  1995,  the Company  transferred  a security  having a fair value of
$353,000 (carrying value of $336,000) from its "held-to-maturity"  securities to
its portfolio of  "available-for-sale"  securities.  This was done to respond to
changes in the interest rate  environment  and to align the Companys's  interest
rate gap position.

This transfer was made in accordance with FASB's "A Guide to  Implementation  of
Statement  115  on  Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity
Securities"  issued in  November  1995.  Concurrent  with the  adoption  of this
guidance,  corporations  were permitted through December 31, 1995, to reclassify
their  "available-for-sale"  and  "held-to-maturity"  securities without calling
into question the past intent of an entity to hold securities to maturity.

As this security was sold before  year-end the gain on the sale was reflected in
the Company's results of operations.

===============================================================================

In the normal course of business there are outstanding  various  commitments and
contingent  liabilities,  such as guarantees  and  commitments to extend credit,
which are not reflected in the financial  statements.  Such commitments  involve
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount  recognized in
the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The Bank controls these risks through credit
approvals,  limits and monitoring  procedures.  Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination  clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since a portion of these  commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
upon, the total  commitment  amounts do not  necessarily  represent  future cash
requirements.  At  December  31,  1995,  existing  commitments  were as follows:
commitments to originate loans - $10,901,000,  unused  revolving lines of credit
on residential properties, including home equity - $10,564,000, unused revolving
lines of credit on commercial real estate and  construction - $5,822,000,  stand
by  letters  of  credit -  $2,081,000  and  unused  consumer  lines of  credit -
$2,055,000. At December 31, 1994, these commitments were as follows: commitments
to originate loans - $9,778,000, unused revolving lines of credit on residential
properties,  including  home equity -  $10,676,000,  unused  revolving  lines of
credit on commercial real estate and construction - $3,845,000, stand by letters
of credit - $2,254,000 and unused consumer lines of credit $1,777,000.

Substantially all of the Bank commercial and residential  lending activities are
with  customers  located in  Fairfield  and  Litchfield  Counties,  Connecticut.
Although lending activities are diversified,  a substantial portion of many Bank
customers' net worth is dependent on local real estate values.

The Bank has  established  credit  policies  applicable  to each type of lending
activity in which it engages,  evaluates the  credit-worthiness of each customer
and,  in  most  cases,  lend  up to 80% of the  fair  value  of the  collateral,
depending on the Bank's evaluation of the borrowers' creditworthiness.  The fair
value of collateral is monitored on an ongoing basis and  additional  collateral
is obtained when warranted. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. While
collateral  provides  assurance  as a secondary  source of  repayment,  the Bank
ordinarily  requires  the  primary  source  of  repayment  to be  based  on  the
borrower's ability to generate continuing cash flows.

Changes in the allowance for loan losses are summarized as follows:

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                  (continued)

For management purposes, portions of this allowance are allocated to segments of
the loan  portfolio  based on  perceived  credit  risks.  At December  31, 1995,
management allocated $491,000 of the balance in the allowance for loan losses to
specific credit risks and $820,000 is considered to be an unallocated or general
allowance.  This unallocated  allowance is considered to be capital for purposes
of determining  compliance with certain  regulatory  capital standards (see Note
7).

The principal portion of loans delinquent as to principal or interest for ninety
days or more, including nonaccrual loans, is as follows:

At  December  31,  1995 and 1994 there were $0 and  $120,000,  respectively,  of
restructured  loans.  Loans on which  interest is not being  accrued  aggregated
approximately $606,000 and $240,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The Bank would have recorded an additional $51,000, $55,000 and $87,000 of gross
interest income in 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively,  if nonaccrual  loans had
been  current.   Furthermore,   another  $8,000  would  have  been  recorded  on
restructured  loans in 1994. At December 31, 1995,  there were no commitments to
lend  additional  funds to borrowers whose loans are classified as nonaccrual or
were restructured.

As described in Note 1,  effective  January 1, 1995,  the Company  adopted a new
accounting  standard  which  defines when  certain  loans are  considered  to be
impaired  and  requires  such loans to be measured at fair value.  The  recorded
investment in loans that are  considered to be impaired at December 31, 1995 was
$636,000.  Included  in this  amount is  $636,000  of  impaired  loans for which
specific valuation allowances of $180,000 have been established. During 1995 the
average recorded  investment in impaired loans was  approximately  $496,000.  No
interest  income was recognized on impaired  loans,  either on the accrual or on
the cash basis method of interest  recognition.  During 1995,  one impaired loan
had a partial write-off totaling $51,000. Generally, the fair value of the above
loans was determined using the fair value of the underlying collateral.

NOW accounts, included in interest bearing deposit liabilities, were $36,928,000
and $38,089,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.


7. Stockholders' Equity

Under the Company's stock option plans,  key personnel have been granted options
to purchase  common stock. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,  outstanding  options,
giving  effect  to  stock  dividends,   aggregated  14,600  and  21,663  shares,
respectively,  at prices ranging from $8.67 to $15.00 per share. At December 31,
1995,  options to purchase 14,600 shares were exercisable and 45,455 shares were
reserved for issuance in connection with the stock option plans. During 1995 and
1994, 3,999 and 4,340 shares, respectively,  were issued through the exercise of
stock options. There were no exercises of options during 1993.

Federal bank agencies have  established  minimum  capital  standards for banking
institutions.  Regulatory  restrictions are imposed on institutions that fail to
meet or exceed these  standards.  The following  summarizes the minimum  capital
requirements and the Company's capital position at December 31, 1995:

                  Capital                  Company's Capital      Minimum
                 Standard                       Position     Capital Requirement
===============================================================================
Total capital to risk weighted assets           14.68%              8.0%
===============================================================================
Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets          13.87               4.0
===============================================================================

The capital  requirements  described  above were  developed to be  responsive to
credit risk. Banks are subject to various other risks,  such as those associated
with  interest rate  fluctuations,  operational  risk and asset  concentrations.
During 1990, the bank regulatory authorities adopted a Tier 1 capital-to-average
assets requirement (leverage ratio) that is intended to address these additional
risks and works in tandem with the other  requirements.  Banks  evaluated by the
bank  regulators as being strong  banking  organizations  are required to have a
minimum  leverage ratio of 3%, while the requirement for others ranges upward to
5%. At December 31, 1995,  the Company's  leverage  ratio of 8.37% exceeded this
requirement.


8. Income Taxes

As described in Note 1, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 109 as of January 1, 1993.
SFAS No. 109 establishes  financial  accounting and reporting  standards for the
effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise's  activities  during the
current and preceding  years.  It requires an asset and  liability  approach for
financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.

There are various  restrictions  which limit the ability of a bank subsidiary to
transfer  funds in the form of cash  dividends,  loans or advances to the parent
company.  Under  Connecticut  law,  the  approval  of the primary  regulator  is
required  if the  dividend  declared  by the  bank in any year  exceeds  the net
profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two
years.

In addition,  the Bank is subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act.
These  restrictions  limit the transfer of funds to the parent  company,  in the
form of loans or extensions of credit, investments and purchases of assets. Such
transfers are limited in amount to 10% of the bank's capital and surplus.  These
transfers are also subject to various collateral requirements.


11. Related Party Transactions


Certain directors and executive officers, including their immediate families and
companies in which they are principals, are loan customers of the Bank. Loans to
these persons aggregated approximately $5,044,000 and $5,386,000 at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively. During 1995 new loans to related parties aggregated
$13,291,000 and loan payments aggregated $13,633,000. The maximum amount of such
loans  outstanding  during  1995  and  1994  was  $10,394,000  and  $10,743,000,
respectively.

Two  directors  and four  stockholders  of the Company  are  partners in a joint
venture which is leasing certain real estate to Village. The terms of such lease
are described further in Note 12.

12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities


In July 1985,  the Bank entered into a five-year  noncancelable,  branch  office
lease  arrangement.  The lease  contains a provision  which allows for an annual
adjustment to the minimum payment to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index
and a provision for two five-year  renewal  options.  In October 1989,  the Bank
entered into a five year noncancelable, renewable sublease for a portion of this
space at an annual rental of  approximately  $19,000 with an increase  after the
third year based on the Consumer Price Index.

In March 1993,  the Bank  entered into a five-year  noncancelable,  office lease
arrangement  with related  parties (see Note 11).  Minimum  payments  under this
operating  lease started at $82,400 a year. The lease contains a provision which
allows for a five percent annual increase and provides for two five-year renewal
options.

The Bank is leasing space for its Danbury  office under a lease  agreement that
extends through November 30, 1996. The lease agreement  provides for two renewal
options which extend for five years each.

Total rent expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $248,000,  $221,000 and $198,000,
respectively,  which amounts are net of $19,000, $20,000 and $19,000 of sublease
income.

Prior to considering sublease income,  future minimum lease payments at December
31, 1995 are as follows:

13. Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments


SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments",  requires
disclosure  of the  estimated  fair  values of  certain  financial  instruments.
Estimated  fair  values  are as of  December  31,  1995 and  1994 and have  been
determined using available market  information and various valuation  estimation
methodologies.  Considerable  judgment is required to  interpret  the effects on
fair value of such items as future expected loss  experience,  current  economic
conditions,  risk  characteristics  of various  financial  instruments and other
factors.  The estimates  presented herein are not necessarily  indicative of the
amounts that the Company would realize in a current market  exchange.  Also, the
use of different market assumptions  and/or estimation  methodologies may have a
material effect on the determination of the estimated fair values.

                                                  As of December 31,

                                    PAGE 35                  1995 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fair value  estimates  presented  above are based on  pertinent  information
available to management as of December 31, 1995 and 1994. Although management is
not aware of any factors  that would  significantly  affect the  estimated  fair
value  amounts,  such  amounts  have not  been  comprehensively  revalued  since
December  31, 1995 and,  therefore,  current  estimates of fair value may differ
significantly from the amounts presented above.

Fair value methods and assumptions are as follows:

Cash and Cash  Equivalents,  Accrued  Income  Receivable  and  Accrued  Interest
Payable - The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Securities - The fair value of securities  was estimated  based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes, if available.  If a quote is not available,  fair value
is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.

Loans - The fair  value of fixed rate loans has been  estimated  by  discounting
projected  cash flows using  current  rates for similar  loans.  For loans which
reprice to market  rates or mature  within a one year time frame,  the  carrying
amount is a  reasonable  estimate  of fair value.  The fair value of  nonaccrual
loans at December 31, 1994 was not  estimated  or included in the amounts  shown
above.  The value of  approximately  $636,000 of impaired  loans at December 31,
1995, is estimated to have a fair value of approximately $456,000. This estimate
is very  subjective  and may not be  indicative  of what would be  realized in a
liquidation situation.

Deposits  Without Stated  Maturities - Under the provisions of SFAS No. 107, the
estimated fair value of deposits with no stated  maturity,  such as non-interest
bearing  demand  deposits,  savings  accounts,  NOW  accounts,  money market and
checking accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand.

Time  Deposits  - The fair  value of  certificates  of  deposit  is based on the
discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using
the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Off  Balance  Sheet Risk -As  described  in Note 4, the  Company  was a party to
financial  instruments  with  off-balance  sheet risk at December 31, 1995. Such
financial  instruments  consist of commitments to extend permanent financing and
letters of credit.  If the options are exercised by the  prospective  borrowers,
these financial instruments will become  interest-bearing assets of the Company.
If the options expire,  the Company retains any fees paid by the counterparty in
order to obtain the  commitment or guarantee.  The fair value of  commitments is
estimated based upon fees currently  charged to enter into similiar  agreements,
taking  into  account  the  remaining  terms of the  agreements  and the present
creditworthiness of the  counterparties.  For fixed-rate  commitments,  the fair
value estimation takes into consideration an interest rate risk factor. The fair
value of guarantees and letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for
similiar agreements. The fair value of these off-balance sheet items at December
31,  1995 and 1994,  respectively,  approximates  the  recorded  amounts  of the
related  fees,  which are not  material.  The  Company  has not engaged in hedge
transactions such as interest rate futures contracts or interest rate swaps.
