ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

General Development Of Business

Zurn Industries, Inc., a corporation founded in 1900 and incorporated in 1932
together with its subsidiaries (the "Company") designs, constructs,
manufactures, markets, and operates in four industry segments: Power Systems;
Water Control; Lynx Golf; Mechanical Power Transmission.

Following a decision made in March 1994, the steam generating manufacturing
facilities of the Power Systems segment were closed on August 31, 1994 because
of uncompetitive costs while marketing, design, and administrative activities
continue with subcontracting of production to third parties.

Segment Status

No new segment or product is being planned or developed which will require the
investment of a material amount of the Company's assets, or which otherwise is
material.

Sources And Availability Of Raw Materials

The Company's businesses use ferrous and non-ferrous metals, concrete
products, plastics, and stainless steel castings purchased from various
domestic and foreign suppliers.  The sources of supply are adequate and the
Company is not substantially dependent upon any one supplier.

Patents And Licenses

The Company owns numerous patents relating to the design and manufacture of
its products and systems.  From time to time the Company grants licenses to
others under certain of its patents and obtains licenses under the patents of
others.  While the Company considers that, in the aggregate, its patents and 
licenses are important in the operation of its businesses, it believes that
the successful manufacture and sale of its products generally depends more
upon its technological know-how and manufacturing and construction skills.

Seasonal Business

The demand for Lynx Golf products is highest in the Company's first and fourth
quarters.  None of the other industry segments is considered to have
significant seasonal business.



                                      -3-<PAGE>
Working Capital Requirements

Power plant construction by the Power Systems segment requires significant
liquidity to support the performance of contracts involving payment retainage,
or letters of credit in lieu thereof, the payment of certain amounts from
projects' future cash flows, and loans to and equity investments in projects. 
Certain products of the Water Control segment are considered standard items
and significant amounts of inventory are required to meet rapid delivery
requirements of customers.  The Lynx Golf segment requires significant amounts
of inventory to meet customer demands.  There are no special or unusual
working capital requirements for the Company's other businesses.

Customer Dependence

None of the industry segments has a customer the loss of which would have a
material adverse effect on the segment.

Customer Identity

There are no customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect
on the Company.

Backlog

The backlog of unshipped orders was as follows:
                                                            March 31       
                                                      1995           1994
                                                          (Thousands)

Power Systems                                       $ 65,000       $159,000
Water Control                                        122,000         69,000
Lynx Golf                                             23,000          5,000
Mechanical Power Transmission                         11,000         11,000
                                                    $221,000       $244,000

Approximately 4% of the Power Systems and the Mechanical Power Transmission
backlogs are expected to be completed in fiscal years ending after March 31,
1996.  The $90 million backlog at March 31, 1995 of a 50% owned joint venture
of the Power Systems segment is not included in the table.

Government Contracts

No material portion of the business of any industry segment is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the Government.

Competitive Conditions

The Company's major markets are electric power generation, industrial,
commercial, municipal, and consumer.  The Company competes with a number and
variety of diverse manufacturers, both large and small.  Because of the 


                                      -4-<PAGE>
multiplicity and diversity of such markets, it is impracticable to ascertain a
proper competitive rating index for any of the Company's segments.

In general, all the Company's products and systems are sold for the most part
in world-wide markets characterized by substantial price, service, and product
quality competition.

Research And Development

Research and development expenditures were not material in any of the last
three years.

Impact Of Environmental Laws And Regulations

Federal, state, and local regulations enacted to regulate the discharge of
materials into the environment will have no material effect on the Company's
capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Number Of Employees

The Company has approximately 2,430 employees.

Foreign And Domestic Operations And Export Sales

The Company's foreign operations represented less than 10% of consolidated
sales, operating income, and assets in each of the last three years.  Export
sales were: 1995-$17,653,000; 1994-$20,073,000; 1993-$29,309,000.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

The Company principally operates in various locations throughout the United
States in facilities considered to be in good condition, well maintained, and
adequate for its purposes.  The approximate square feet of floor space
utilized in the United States is as follows:

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On September 24, 1993, the Superior Court of Imperial County California
entered a judgment in the amount of $25.7 million against the Company and its
subsidiary, National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO), in connection with
a cross complaint filed in February 1991 by Imperial Resource Recovery
Associates, L.P., a California Limited Partnership, which alleged that NEPCO
had failed to construct an electric generating facility in accordance with
contract terms.  The Court also assessed prejudgment interest of $6.1 million 

                                      -5-<PAGE>
and attorney fees of $8.4 million.  An appeal from the entire judgment was
taken on September 24, 1993 by the Company and NEPCO and is pending in the
California Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District.

The Company received an Administrative Order, effective April 30, 1992, issued
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to Section
106(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980 directing the Company and thirty-five others to implement response
activities at the Millcreek Dumpsite in Erie County, Pennsylvania in
accordance with a remedial plan.  The Company is informed that EPA has secured
estimates of the cost of the remedial work which approximate $12 million.  The
Company and seventeen of the other respondents have notified EPA of their
intention to undertake the remedial action.

On October 19, 1993, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources (Department) filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the Company
and twenty-six others seeking to recover past and future specified and
unspecified costs exceeding $2.2 million arising out of the Department's
involvement at the Millcreek Dumpsite in Erie County, Pennsylvania.

In January 1994, the State of California filed a complaint in the Municipal
Court of the Los Angeles Judicial District against the Company's subsidiary,
Zurn Constructors, Inc., two of its employees, and another company and
individual alleging felony and misdemeanor violations of the State's Health
and Safety, Water, and Penal codes in connection with the discharge of a
pollutant from the other company's property into a Coyote Creek tributary. 
The maximum fines for the alleged charges sought in the complaint against Zurn
Constructors total $.6 million.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Zurn Industries, Inc.
Erie, Pennsylvania

  We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of Zurn Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries listed in Item
14.  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the financial statements listed in Item 14 present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Zurn
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries at March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial 

                                      -8-<PAGE>
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

                  EXHIBIT 10.7 - INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

The Company's Incentive Compensation Plan, as it applies to executive
officers, provides that an amount equal to 4% of earnings before income taxes
in excess of a 10% return on the Company's net worth plus 4% of earnings
before income taxes in excess of a 20% return on the Company's net worth is
available to the Management Development and Compensation Committee to make
incentive compensation payments.  The distributable amount may be modified by
the Committee in circumstances it views as appropriate (e.g., when the Company
incurs an unusual gain or loss).  Using both financial and nonfinancial
criteria to measure performance, the Committee determines the amount to be
awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and, based on his recommendations and
their evaluation, to each other executive officer.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Sales And Earnings                                                            
The single most significant factor affecting consolidated sales has been the
change in Power Systems segment revenues which dropped by $300.7 million in
fiscal 1995, reflecting the depressed domestic independent power market, after
increasing by $111.0 million in 1994 and $80.1 in 1993.  The Water Control
segment's sales of plumbing products increased $21.6 million in 1995, almost
doubling 1994's growth, while water resource construction revenues were off
$27.1 million, slightly more than the fiscal 1994 increase.  Lynx Golf sales
suffered in an extremely competitive market for premium-priced clubs until the
introduction of new irons in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.
   Generally gross profit margin percentages have been affected from year to
year by the types and numbers of projects the Power Systems segment has under
construction.  While the segment's margin was minimally higher this year, the
effect of the Water Control segment and Lynx Golf on the consolidated margin
increase was greater than their individual profit improvements because of the
lower Power Systems segment revenues.  Last year the consolidated margin was
lower primarily because of the high costs and weak market for steam generating
systems manufactured by the Power Systems segment and increased costs incurred
by Lynx Golf.  Inflation's effect on the Company's costs over the last three
years has not been as great as the consumer price index change due to cost
containment measures and, in fiscal 1995, outsourcing programs which reduced
the costs of many manufactured products.  Most cost increases have been
recovered currently.
   Marketing and administration expenses for the most part do not bear a
direct relationship to sales volumes.  These expenses have increased in each
of the last two years as a result of the plumbing products sales growth and
new product introduction costs, but more than half of the fiscal 1995 effect
was offset by lower costs in the steam generating systems business. The fiscal
1994 increase almost equaled the $5.4 million incurred in fiscal 1993 by
businesses which have been sold.  Compared to the two most recent years,
marketing and administration expenses in 1993, excluding the costs of disposed
businesses, was lower because Lynx Golf spent less for advertising and
promotion.
   The unusual items are described in the notes to consolidated financial
statements and discussed elsewhere in this review.  The items in the footnote
table increased income $.06 and $.02 per share in fiscal 1995 and 1993 and
they reduced income $2.74 per share in fiscal 1994.  In addition, the income
tax refunds and adjustments associated with the 1995 and 1993 state tax
settlements increased income for those years by $.04 and $.14 per share,
respectively.  The revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from a tax
law change added $.15 per share in fiscal 1994.
   Interest income derived from financial instruments has not been
significantly affected by changing interest rates or amounts of liquid assets
available for investment over the last three years as rates increased when
cash declined.  The higher income levels in 1995 and 1994 came from interest
on federal income tax refunds in the current year, the financing of equipment 




                                     -20-<PAGE>
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 14

for customers' projects by the Power Systems segment in both years, and the
segment's long-term receivables in fiscal 1994.  Interest expense on long-term
obligations has declined in each of the last three years, but the total has
increased as a result of providing for interest on the recorded litigation
liability.
   Tax exempt investment income was a larger percentage of the lower pretax
income in fiscal 1995 and 1994 and, therefore, had a greater impact on the
effective tax rates.  Also because of the income level, state taxes were a
greater percentage of the overall effective rate this year.  Settlement of
prior year state tax assessments significantly reduced the effective tax rates
in fiscal 1995 and 1993.
   The net income (loss) per share for the last three years was: 1995 - $.76;
1994 - $(1.12); 1993 - $2.20.  Absent the unusual items, net income per share
would have been: 1995 - $.66; 1994 - $1.47; 1993 - $2.04.

Completion after fiscal 1996 is expected for 4% of the Power 
Systems and Mechanical Power Transmission amounts at March 31,

owned joint venture is not included in the table for 1995.

Power Systems                                                                
The segment's design, engineering, and construction of power plants have made
it the Company's most significant source of revenues since 1989.  The sharp
decline in fiscal 1995 revenues was the result of the weak domestic market,
and much of the work on plants completed in 1995 had been performed in fiscal
1994 which had a record high beginning of the year backlog.  Six power plants
were completed in 1995, six in 1994, and three were completed in 1993.  Weak
markets also have impacted the segment's equipment manufacturing businesses
which suffered a 26% sales decline in 1995 following a 21% decline in fiscal
1994.
   The gross profit margin from construction of power plants in fiscal 1995
was affected by cost overruns.  These included additional costs to complete
some projects that were started as early as fiscal 1992 which were
substantially offset by profit estimate revisions on other projects.  Also,
greater than estimated subcontracting costs led to deferring until fiscal 1996
profit recognition from a project which contributed 27% of 1995's construction
revenues.   Margins on steam generating systems improved as the result of
outsourcing high cost manufacturing that previously had been performed in
Company-owned facilities which, together with the sales decline, adversely 




                                     -21-<PAGE>
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 14

affected the Company's overall gross profit margin in fiscal 1994.  The Power
Systems segment's fiscal 1995 operating loss is attributable to the lower
revenues, cost overruns, and the higher cost of developing the international
markets for small- to medium-sized private power plants with long order lead
times.  The segment had an operating loss in fiscal 1994, rather than a $19.1
million profit, because of the $50.8 million of unusual items for litigation,
plant closing costs, and the recovery of an account receivable written off in
fiscal 1992.  In fiscal 1993, its operating profit was reduced by unusual 
litigation costs and the lower operating levels of the equipment manufacturing
businesses.
   Power Systems revenues and operating profit from the domestic market are
expected to be substantially lower in the near term because of the excess
electric power generation capacity.  For the balance of the decade, the North
American market for new capacity could be about half the size of the early
1990s.  The segment will not reflect the entire amounts for international
projects in its revenues because they likely will be performed by a consortium
such as the 50% owned joint venture which is responsible for the first such
project being built in Australia.  Rather, the segment's operating profit will
include its equity in the earnings of the ventures which may be lower as the
result of profit sharing with its partners and the highly competitive nature
of the international markets.

Water Control                                                                 
Plumbing products, the segment's largest business, had a 22% sales increase in
fiscal 1995 from higher prices and, to a lesser extent, new products
introduced over the last several years which drove the 13% sales gain in 1994. 
Water resource construction project revenues were off 32%, after increasing
42% in fiscal 1994, as a result of the low beginning of the year backlog which
was only partially replenished by the end of fiscal 1995.  Revenues from the
installation of fire protection sprinkler systems were lower in each of the
last two years, reflecting the depressed, highly-competitive West Coast
commercial construction market, after increasing in each of the earlier three
years.  The segment's total fiscal 1994 sales were 14% greater than 1993's
after excluding the effect of businesses sold in the fourth quarter of that
year.  The unusual items note to the consolidated financial statements
includes other information about changes in the Water Control segment's
operations resulting from dispositions and an acquisition.
   The segment's fiscal 1995 operating profit improvement was dampened by
reduced margins on water resource construction projects, including the effects
of delays experienced in the fourth quarter caused by severe flooding in
California, and new product development costs.  The fiscal 1994 operating
profit did not benefit from that year's sales increase because of lower
margins on those sales and the development costs for new plumbing products. 
As a result of downsizing, the fire sprinkler systems business' 1995 operating
profit was more than double 1994's when it made a positive contribution after
a small loss in fiscal 1993.
   While the plumbing products business has continued to outperform the
nonresidential construction market it serves, the Water Control segment's 

                                     -22-<PAGE>
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 15

backlog changes from year to year are generally attributable to the water
resource construction business.  Because the Southern California market it
serves has a continuing need to expand and upgrade its water and wastewater
infrastructure, there should be new projects that can be bid successfully and
managed profitably.

Lynx Golf                                                                    
Worldwide sales in an extremely competitive market were down 35% through
fiscal 1995's third quarter, but ended the year off 22%.  The partial recovery
came from sales of new irons which have experienced the most successful new
product introduction in Lynx's history.  In fiscal 1994, domestic sales of
golf clubs and accessories, 36% of which were derived from new metal woods
which subsequently lost their popularity, experienced a small decline that was
offset for the most part by a 28% sales increase in the European Union.
   Advertising and promotion, new product introduction costs, and surplus
capacity in the last three years have been significant factors contributing to
the operating losses.  The fiscal 1994 loss includes $2.4 million for the
disposition of discontinued products and $.9 million for the write off of
manufacturing assets not being used.  While manufacturing difficulties
initially encountered in producing the new metal woods were solved in fiscal
1994, the excess costs contributed to the losses in both that year and fiscal
1993.  Orders for the new irons accelerated during fiscal 1995's fourth
quarter driving the year-end backlog for spring and summer shipments to the
highest level in Lynx's history.

Mechanical Power Transmission                                                
The $37 million sales level of the last two years is 7% greater than fiscal
1993 despite the continuing weak and competitive market for industrial
equipment in the United States.  The fiscal 1995 operating profit was off
slightly, after excluding from 1994 the effect of an unusual item, as the
result of management and operating changes, including exiting some minor
product lines, and the costs of beginning an expansion into European and other
foreign markets.  In 1994, the segment's profit was depressed by a $1.8
million charge for the write off of a minority investment in a product line
which no longer fit its future direction.

Corporate And Others                                                         
The sales in fiscal 1993 are attributable to businesses which have been sold. 
Corporate income that year resulted from the reversal of interest ($4.6
million) which had been accrued in connection with a state income tax dispute
which was settled and from gains on the sales of businesses ($4.6 million).

Financial Condition                                                          
Liquidity is important to the Company's ability to take on construction
contract commitments.  Year-end liquid assets amounted to $54.8 million, down
from the $90.6 million accumulated at the end of fiscal 1993 primarily from
the then growing level of power plant and water resource construction
activities.  Less cash was provided by fiscal 1995's operations as the result 
of the lower earnings and the payment of accrued expenses, including most of
the plant closing costs provided for in fiscal 1994.  The amount of cash

                                     -23-<PAGE>
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 15

provided by operations in fiscal 1994 was nominal partly because of the steam
generating systems business and Lynx Golf losses.  Cash from operations also 
was affected in both years by the reductions in advance billings on contracts
collected in fiscal 1993.  The reductions offset the fiscal 1995 accounts
receivable collections and, in 1994, they were almost double the benefit of 
utilizing inventories which had been purchased in the prior year. 
   The cash from investing activities in fiscal 1995 provided 51% of the funds
needed to pay dividends to shareholders.  Dividend payments have been the
largest nonoperating use of cash in the last two years.  Other significant
uses of funds have been for investments in facilities and equipment ($32.4
million over the last three years), treasury stock purchases, long-term
investments, including the purchase of a plumbing products business in fiscal
1994, and the payment of income taxes and interest in connection with the
fiscal 1993 settlement of prior year tax assessments.
   Most of the working capital components were reduced in both fiscal 1995 and
1994 as construction activities slowed, and total working capital was
diminished as a result of the Lynx Golf and Power Systems losses, including
the litigation provision in fiscal 1994.  Working capital amounted to $155.5
million at year end and the 2.1 to 1 current ratio was one-tenth point higher
than its historical level.
   Power plant performance efficiency payments earned by the Power Systems
segment in fiscal 1994, but payable in future years, more than offset the $5.0
million reduction in long-term investments that resulted from relinquishing
the limited partnership investment related to the collection of the $8.4
million construction contract receivable which was fully reserved in fiscal
1992.  In fiscal 1992, $8.2 million was borrowed pursuant to the terms of a
1991 sales-type lease transaction.  Otherwise, long-term debt has been reduced
over the last four years by scheduled payments and conversions of debentures
into common stock.  Should financing be necessary in the future, the Company
has a revolving credit agreement which is described in the debt and line of
credit note to the financial statements. 
   The Power Systems segment may find it necessary to make substantial equity
and debt investments in power plant projects if it is to successfully compete
in the domestic and international markets.  Otherwise, no item, including the
litigation disclosed in the unusual items, commitments and contingencies note
to the financial statements, is expected to have a future material effect on
the Company's financial position.  However, if all issues which led to the
unusual litigation provision are lost on appeal, the resulting cash
expenditure, net of the ensuing income tax payment reductions, could be more
than $34 million.
   The $.22 per share quarterly dividend paid to shareholders since mid-fiscal
1991 was reduced to $.10 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 as
the result of a decision made on June 8, 1995 that the Company needed greater
flexibility for growth opportunity investments in power plants or other
business expansion.  Prospectively, dividend payments will be based on future
earnings trends and expectations and investment needs or, if it should occur, 
the loss of the litigation appeal.  Total capital employed at March 31, 1995
amounted to $230.5 million which includes $218.9 million ($17.73 per share of
common stock) of shareholders' equity.  The March 1995 equity to debt ratio
was 19 to 1.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ZURN INDUSTRIES, INC.                                                         
The Company and its subsidiaries operate in four industry segments.  Its
products and services are marketed by the Company's sales organizations and
through factory sales offices and independent representatives and agents. 
Generally credit is extended based on evaluations of customers' financial
condition.
   The Power Systems segment designs, constructs, and operates small- to
medium-sized alternate energy and combined-cycle power plants, designs steam
generators and waste heat energy recovery and incineration systems, and
produces equipment and fans to control emissions of solid particulate and
gaseous pollutants.  The segment's major construction contracts generally are
with project financed entities with credit extended based on the financing
without collateral.  While most contracts have been for plants in the United
States, recently the Company has focused on the Asia-Pacific and South
American markets.  Sales to individual customers amounting to more than 10% of
consolidated sales were: 1994 - $192,456,000; 1993 - $77,957,000 and
$68,853,000.
   The Water Control segment manufactures and distributes plumbing products
for the nonresidential construction markets in the United States and Canada
with significant suppliers being located in China, Mexico, and the Pacific
Rim.  It also constructs a wide variety of systems to control and treat water
and wastewater principally for government agencies in southern California and
designs and installs fire sprinkler systems in the states of California,
Hawaii, Texas, Utah, and Washington.
   Lynx Golf manufactures golf clubs in Nevada which are finished and
assembled in California, Mexico, and Scotland for distribution with other
purchased accessories to country club professionals, golf specialty shops, and
distributors worldwide, with the principal markets being the United States,
European Union, and Japan.  The Mechanical Power Transmission segment
manufactures and markets clutches, couplings, and universal joints in the
United States and Europe directly and through licensing agreements.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                               
Basis of Presentation   The financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of significant intercompany
transactions and accounts with reclassification of certain amounts to conform
with the current year presentation.  The reporting of amounts in the financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make assumptions and estimates. 
Actual results could differ from the estimates.

Investments   Marketable and irrevocable trust securities are available-for-
sale and are carried at their estimated fair values with unrealized gains and
losses included in shareholders' equity as a component of retained earnings. 
Debt securities maturing within three months of purchase are cash equivalents.



                                     -30-<PAGE>
ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 20

Certificates of deposit and notes receivable are carried at cost with interest
recognized as it accrues.  The sales-type lease represents the present value
of future minimum rental payments.  Business ventures are accounted for by the
equity method, or carried at cost if less than 20% of the stock is owned.

Financial Instrument Fair Values   No class of instrument has a significant
difference between its carrying value and estimated fair value based on market
quotations, projected cash flows, and other estimating methods.

Engineering and Construction Contracts   Revenue and costs on long-term
contracts are recognized by the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method,
commencing when progress is sufficient to determine earnings with reasonable
accuracy, based on estimates of total sales value and cost at completion. 
Earnings adjustments arising from changes in estimates are recognized
currently.  Estimated losses are recorded when identified.

Inventories   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, which includes
material, labor, and manufacturing overhead, or market.

Properties   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation
and amortization of properties are provided over their estimated useful lives
by the straight-line method.

Advertising and Promotion Expense  Commercial production and other advertising
and promotion costs are expensed when incurred or ratably in relation to sales
over the year in which the advertising is first used (1995 - $8,917,000; 1994
- - $8,222,000; 1993 - $5,164,000).

Foreign Currency Translation   Translation adjustments of foreign
subsidiaries, whose local currencies are their functional currencies, are
included in shareholders' equity as a component of retained earnings.

Earnings Per Share   Earnings per share are based on net income or loss and
the average shares of common stock and dilutive stock options outstanding
during the year (1995 - 12,355,000; 1994 - 12,438,000; 1993 - 12,521,000).

Industry Segment Data  Operating profit is net sales less operating costs and
certain corporate administrative expenses, allocated to the segments in
relation to their sales, payrolls, and assets, and excludes interest expense. 
Corporate amounts include gains from sales of businesses, investment income,
unallocated administrative expenses, and interest expense.  Corporate assets
consist principally of cash and equivalents, short-term marketable securities,
long-term investments, and corporate headquarters and rental properties.

Change In Accounting Principles   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
reduced fiscal 1994 shareholders' equity by $1,241,000.

The litigation charge was recognized as the result of a jury verdict against
the Company in connection with a contract to construct an agricultural waste-
burning power plant and includes $9,747,000 for the write-off of accounts
receivable and legal costs (1994-$2,655,000; 1993-$8,793,000).  If all issues
are lost on the appeal which is being aggressively pursued, additional charges
could reach $22,100,000, including interest on the unrecorded contingency
which is not being accrued.
   In fiscal 1994, a decision was made to close the Energy Division
manufacturing facilities because of uncompetitive costs and certain other
assets were written off.  The $8,400,000 of probable cash expenditures and
$14,600,000 in asset write-downs charged to the industry segments were: Power
Systems - $20,300,000; Lynx Golf - $860,000; Mechanical Power Transmission -
$1,840,000.  Substantially all the cash expenditure provision has been
disbursed or allocated to retirement obligations and unused provisions were
included in fiscal 1995's income.
   The Water Control segment sold Permutit and Vinylplex (fiscal 1993 sales -
$16,519,000) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 for cash ($7,992,000) and a
90-day note ($1,900,000) and, in fiscal 1993, it collected a $1,900,000 note
from the sale of a business in the prior year.  Operating profits of the
businesses were nominal.  It also purchased a plumbing products business in
December 1993.  An Other segment business (fiscal 1993 sales - $11,123,000)
was sold effective with the beginning of fiscal 1994.
   In fiscal 1994, the Power Systems segment recovered an account receivable
it had written off in fiscal 1992 and the revaluation of net deferred tax
assets because of a tax law change reduced the Company's net loss for the year
by $.15 per share.  Interest from settlement of prior year state tax
assessments included in unusual items and the associated income taxes amounted
to $.07 per share in 1995 and $.14 per share in 1993.
   In the normal course of business, financial and performance guarantees are
made in connection with major engineering and construction contracts and a
liability is recognized when a probable loss occurs.  Also, there are various
claims, legal, and environmental proceedings which management believes will
have no material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations when they are resolved.

Substantially all employees are covered by noncontributory Company sponsored
or multiemployer defined benefit plans.  Benefits of stated amounts for each
year of service are provided by the multiemployer plans and to 17% of the
participants in the Company's plans, while benefits for others are based on
years of service and the five highest years' compensation in the ten years
prior to retirement, or compensation at retirement.  Funding of Company
sponsored plans, invested primarily in listed stocks and bonds and cash
equivalents, is the minimum required by law and additional amounts as deemed
appropriate from time to time.  Contributions to multiemployer plans are
related to hours worked or compensation levels.

   The fiscal 1995 declines in the actuarial present values of projected
benefits generally are attributable to the obligation discount rate increase
after a small reduction from adopting mortality tables established by the GATT
treaty.  The pension plans' net gain was offset by the lower than projected
returns on assets included in the $15,056,000 of other pension costs.  The
funded status of one pension plan changed from marginally underfunded to
overfunded in fiscal 1995.  Most of the termination benefits and curtailment
gains were included in the fiscal 1994 plant closing cost provision.

67%; fully-eligible employees - 15%; other active employees - 18%.  The assumed
health care cost trend rate declines 1/2% each year to 5.25% in 2010.  A 1%
greater rate would increase the accumulated obligation by $2,547,000 and the
annual expense by $373,000.

There are 1,998,000 shares of unreserved authorized preferred stock and
1,424,000 shares of common stock are reserved for the exercise of stock
options.
   Three million shares of Second Series Junior Participating Preferred Stock
($1.00 par value, $2.00 liquidation preference to common stock, redeemable at
the greater of $260 or four times the current common stock market price) are
reserved for issuance on exercise of rights attached to outstanding common
stock.  The rights may be redeemed at $.025 per right and expire in May 1996. 
If 15% or more of the Company's common stock becomes beneficially owned by a
person or group (subject to the Board of Directors' authority to defer

exchange or tender offer which would result in 15% or more ownership is
commenced, the rightholders, except such beneficial owners, may purchase one-
quarter share of the preferred stock at $65 per share or, for $65, they may
purchase shares of the Company's common stock at one-half their market value.
If other change in control events occur, the same rightholders may, for $65,
purchase shares of the acquirer's common stock at one-half their market value.
   The Company's stock option plan provides for granting either nonqualified or
incentive stock options to key employees to purchase no earlier than six months
after the grant date shares of common stock at its market value on the grant
date.  Another plan provided for the annual distribution of nonqualified common
stock options to each director who was not employed by the Company. Outstand-
ing options expire on dates from June 1995 to January 2005.  In lieu of cash,
common stock was received and distributed on exercise of certain stock options.
