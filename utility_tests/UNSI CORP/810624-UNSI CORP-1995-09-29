Read Instructions (on back page) Before Preparing Form. Please Print or Type.

Nothing in this Form Shall be construed to imply that the Commission has 
verified any information contained herein.

If the notification relates to a portion of the filing checked above, identify
the Item(s) to which the notification relates:  Annual Report on Form 10-KSB

Part I - Registrant Information

Full Name of Registrant
                      UNSI Corporation

Former Name if Applicable
                     United Service Source, Inc.

Address of Principal Executive Office (Street and Number)
    c/o Forstmann-Leff Associates, Inc., 55 East 52nd Street

City, State and Zip Code
    New York, New York 10055-0189

Part II - Rules 12b-25 (b) and (c)

If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or expense
and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the following
should be completed. (Check box if appropriate)

    (a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this form 
        could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;

    (b) The subject annual report or semi-annual report/portion thereof will be
(X)     filed on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed
        due date; or the subject quarterly report/portion thereof will be filed
        on or before the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date;
        and

    (c) The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 12b-25(c)
        has been attached if applicable.

Part III - Narrative

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-F,
10-Q or N-SAR or portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed
time period.

The principal operating subsidiary of the registrant recently sold
substantially all of its operating assets. Because the officers of the
registrant have been focusing their efforts on consummating this sale,
the registrant is unable to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-KSB. It
is anticipated that the operating results related to the sale of the 
subsidiary's assets will be presented as losses from discontinued operations.
The registrant is unable to quantify such losses at this time for the reasons
set forth above.
