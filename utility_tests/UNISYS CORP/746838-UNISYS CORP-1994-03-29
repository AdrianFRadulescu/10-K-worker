                             PART I


ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

     Unisys Corporation ("Unisys") provides information
services, technology and software on a worldwide basis.

     Unisys operates primarily in one business segment:
information management systems and related services and supplies.  
This segment represents more than 90% of consolidated revenue,
operating profit and identifiable assets. Financial information
concerning revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets
relevant to the segment is set forth in Note 13, "Business
segment information", of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements appearing in the Unisys 1993 Annual Report to
Stockholders, and such information is incorporated herein
by reference.

     Principal executive offices of Unisys are located at
Township Line and Union Meeting Roads, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
19424.

Principal Products and Services
- -------------------------------

     Principal information management systems products and services 
include enterprise systems and servers, departmental servers and 
desktop systems, software, custom defense systems, information
services and systems integration and equipment maintenance.

     Enterprise systems and servers comprise a complete line of
small to large processors and related communications and
peripheral products, such as printers, storage devices and
document handling processors and equipment.  Departmental
servers and desktop systems include UNIX servers, workstations,
personal computers and terminals.  Software consists of
application and systems software.  Custom defense systems
include specialized information processing systems, software and
services marketed primarily to government defense agencies.
Information services and systems integration includes systems
integration, outsourcing services, application development,
information planning and education.  Equipment maintenance
results from charges for preventive maintenance, spare parts and
other repair activities.

     Information about revenue from classes of similar products
and services for the three years ended December 31, 1993,
appears under the heading "Revenue by similar classes of
products and services" in the Unisys 1993 Annual Report to 
Stockholders, and such information is incorporated herein
by reference.

     Unisys markets its products and services throughout most of
the world, primarily through a direct sales force.  In certain
foreign countries, Unisys products and services are marketed
primarily through distributors.  Unisys manufactures a
significant portion of its product lines.  Some products,
including certain personal and UNIX open system-based computers,
peripheral products, electronic components and subassemblies and
software products, are manufactured for Unisys to its design or
specifications by other business equipment manufacturers,
component manufacturers or software suppliers.

Raw Materials
- -------------

     Raw materials essential to the conduct of the business are
generally readily available at competitive prices in reasonable
proximity to those plants utilizing such materials.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
- --------------------------------

     Unisys owns many domestic and foreign patents relating to
the design and manufacture of its products, has granted licenses
under certain of its patents to others and is licensed under the
patents of others.  Unisys does not believe that its business is
materially dependent upon any single patent or license or
related group thereof.  Trademarks used on or in connection with
Unisys products are considered to be valuable assets of Unisys.

Backlog
- -------

     Unisys does not accumulate backlog information on a
company-wide basis.  Unisys believes that backlog is not a
meaningful indicator of future revenues due to the significant
portion of Unisys revenue received from software, information
services and systems integration, and equipment maintenance
(approximately 49% in 1993) and the shortening of the time
period from receipt of a purchase order to billing upon shipment
of equipment.  Unisys "lead time" for commercial equipment (the
time that customers are told that it will take from receipt of
an order to shipment) is between 13 and 150 days depending upon
the type of system and location of customer.  However, the
average is between 35 and 45 days.  Therefore, Unisys believes
that the dollar amount of backlog is not material to an
understanding of its business taken as a whole.

<PAGE>
                              -5-

U.S. Government Business
- ------------------------

     Revenue and earnings connected with defense and other U.S.
governmental business are particularly subject to the size and
phasing of federal government programs in which Unisys may
participate.  During 1993, revenue from sales of custom systems
and services under Federal defense and space contracts and
subcontracts represented approximately 17% of total consolidated
revenue.  Sales of commercial products to the U.S. government
represented an additional 13% of total consolidated revenue.

Competition
- -----------

     Unisys business is affected by rapid change in technology
in the information systems and services field and aggressive
competition from many domestic and foreign companies, including
computer hardware manufacturers, software providers and
information services companies.  Unisys competes primarily on
the basis of product performance, service, technological
innovation and price.  Unisys believes that its continued
investment in engineering and research and development, coupled
with its marketing capabilities, will have a favorable impact on
its competitive position.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

     Unisys engineering and research and development costs were
$934.7 million in 1993, $980.7 million in 1992 and $1,147.4
million in 1991.  Excluding capitalized software and hardware
support, Unisys-sponsored research and development costs were
$515.2 million in 1993, $535.9 million in 1992 and $638.9
million in 1991.  Customer-sponsored research and development
costs were $231.2 million in 1993, $243.3 million in 1992, and
$286.9 million in 1991.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     Capital expenditures, earnings and the competitive position
of Unisys have not been materially affected by compliance with
federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the
environment.  Capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities are not expected to be material in 1994 and 1995.

Employees
- ---------

     As of December 31, 1993, Unisys had approximately 49,000
employees.

Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the Unisys 1993

centers.  Unisys believes that its facilities are suitable and
adequate for current and presently projected needs.  Unisys

acquire additional facilities, expand existing facilities and
dispose of existing facilities or parts thereof.

<F2>  Average amount outstanding during the period is the average of month end
      borrowings.

<F3>  Average interest rate during the period is determined by dividing actual

                   DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                   --------------------------
               FOR OFFICERS OF UNISYS CORPORATION
               ----------------------------------

                            Article I
                             Purpose
                             -------

1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of the Deferred Compensation Plan for
     Officers (the "Plan") of Unisys Corporation (the
     "Corporation") is to offer those persons who are officers
     (at the time of filing a form of election) the opportunity
     to defer receipt of Designated Incentive Compensation,
     under terms advantageous to both the Officer and the
     Corporation, until termination of the Officer's service as
     an Officer and/or employee of the Corporation.

                           Article II
                            Authority
                            ---------

2.1  Effective Date.  The Board of Directors (the "Board") of
     the Corporation originally approved this Plan on January
     29, 1982 and, including subsequent amendments, the Plan is
     further amended in its present form effective January 1,
     1994.

2.2  Authority.  Any decision made or action taken by the
     Corporation and any of its officers or employees involved
     in the administration of this Plan, or any member of the
     Board of Directors, or the Compensation and Organization
     Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation arising out of or in connection with the
     construction, administration, interpretation and effect of
     the Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of all and
     each of them, as the case may be, and will be conclusive
     and binding on all parties.  No member of the Board of
     Directors and no employee of the Corporation shall be
     liable for any act or action hereunder, whether of omission
     or commission, by any other member or employee or by any
     agent to whom duties in connection with the administration
     of the Plan have been delegated or, except in circumstances
     involving his/her bad faith, for anything done or omitted
     to be done by himself or herself.

                           Article III
                    Deferral of Compensation

3.1  Deferral Election.  Each Officer may elect to have all or a
     portion of his/her Designated Incentive Compensation for
     any calendar year deferred under this Plan.  "Officers" for
     purposes of this Plan include elected officers and any
     other employee authorized to participate in the Plan by the
     Committee.  "Designated Incentive Compensation" for
     purposes of this Plan means amounts payable under the
     Unisys Executive Annual Variable Compensation Plan and any
     other successor annual incentive plan and any other items
     of remuneration as may be designated by the Committee from
     time to time.  The election shall be executed in writing by
     the Officer on an annual basis in a timely manner (normally
     prior to the start of the fiscal year during which such
     Designated Incentive Compensation is earned) in advance of
     the payment date, absent deferral, on a form furnished by
     the Staff Vice President, Compensation.  An election, once
     made, shall be irrevocable with respect to payments for the
     fiscal year to which it applies.  The election may specify
     that the Officer desires to have all, a specified
     percentage, or a specific dollar amount, if determinable,
     of his/her Designated Incentive Compensation for the year
     deferred under the Plan.

3.2  Investment Options.

           (a)   Each Officer may elect, at the same time as the
     election to defer compensation is made, to have current
     deferrals invested in one or more of the investment
     measurement options available under the Plan.  Such
     investment election with respect to current deferrals may
     be changed as of the first day of any quarter provided that
     written notice of such election is filed prior to the first
     day of that quarter with the Staff Vice President,
     Compensation.

           (b)   Effective January 1, 1994, the investment
     measurement options available under the Plan are five of
     the six investment options available under the Unisys
     Savings Plan (the "USP"), as follows:  (1) the Fidelity
     Retirement Money Market Portfolio, (2) the Fidelity Asset
     Manager: Growth Fund, (3) the Fidelity Magellan Fund, (4)
     the Fidelity Asset Manager Fund and (5) the Insurance
     Contract Fund.

           (c)   Effective January 1, 1994, deferred amounts
     credited to the Officer's memorandum account allocated to
     the investment measurement options available under the Plan
<PAGE>
                              -3-

     prior to January 1, 1994 will be transferred to the
     investment measurement options described in Subsection (b)
     as follows:

     Short Term Investment Fund  -   Fidelity Retirement Money
                                     Market Portfolio

     Indexed Equity Fund         -   Fidelity Asset Manager:
                                     Growth Fund

     Active Equity Fund          -   Fidelity Magellan Fund

     Diversified Fund            -   Fidelity Asset Manager Fund

     Insurance Contract Fund     -   No change

           (d)   Subject to the restrictions described in
     Subsection (e), transfers of existing account balances
     among the investment measurement options will be permitted
     as of the first day of a calendar quarter provided that
     written notice of such election is filed prior to the first
     day of the quarter with the Staff Vice President,
     Compensation.

           (e)   Certain restrictions shall apply to investments
     in this Plan as follows:

                  (1)  investment allocation percentages to any
                       of the investment options shall be in 5%
                       increments as to each chosen option;

                  (2)  in the absence of any complete
                       designation or in the case of no
                       designation at all, the Insurance
                       Contract Fund shall be deemed to have
                       been elected as to any undesignated
                       percentage;

                  (3)  transfers between the Insurance Contract
                       Fund and the Fidelity Retirement Money
                       Market Portfolio are not permitted,
                       except as may be periodically allowed;

                  (4)  investment of Compensation in the chosen
                       options shall be deemed made the first
                       business day of the month following its
                       normal payment date in the absence of
                       deferral;

                  (5)  the increase/decrease credited to each
                       month's beginning balance shall be based
                       upon the net income factor assigned to
                       each eligible investment option from the
                       USP with such factors including all
                       realized and unrealized income associated
                       with each option and net of any expenses
                       or accruals provided for under USP; and
<PAGE>
                              -4-

                  (6)  the amount deferred shall be credited
                       with the pro-rata income factor of the
                       Insurance Contract Fund for the number of
                       days (if more than 5) between the normal
                       payment date in the absence of deferral
                       and the effective date of investment at
                       the beginning of the next following
                       month.

           (f)   The Committee shall have the authority to
     modify the rules and restrictions relating to Plan
     investments as it, in its discretion, deems necessary and
     in accord with the investment practices in place under the
     USP.


                           Article IV
                  Treatment of Deferred Amounts
                  -----------------------------

4.1  Memorandum Account.  The Corporation shall establish on its
     books a memorandum account for each Officer who has
     deferred Designated Incentive Compensation under this
     Plan.  To this account shall be credited deferrals and
     incremental amounts equivalent to the income factors
     assigned to each form of eligible investment option in the
     USP.  Payments to the Officer or Beneficiary as defined in
     Article V following termination of service shall be debited
     to the account.  No assets shall be segregated or earmarked
     in respect to any deferrals or reinvestments and no Officer
     shall have any right to assign, transfer, pledge or
     hypothecate his/her interest or any portion thereof in
     his/her account.  The Plan and the crediting of accounts
     hereunder shall not constitute a trust and shall be merely
     for the purpose of recording an unsecured contractual
     obligation.

                            Article V
                   Payment of Deferred Amounts
                   ---------------------------

5.1  Payment Election.  The Officer electing to defer Designated
     Incentive Compensation shall have the right, at the time of
     making such deferral election, to specify the receipt of
     payment of such deferred Compensation in either a lump sum
     payment or annual installments (not exceeding 10
     installment payments) as elected by the Officer.  Payment
     shall be made in a lump sum if no election or form of
     payment has been timely made by the Officer.  An election
     of form of payment, once timely made, may be revoked and a
     new election of form of payment (the "Revised Election")
     may be made at any time prior to the date that is ninety
     days before the Officer's termination of employment or, if
     an election under (1) below has been made, the later
<PAGE>
                              -5-

     termination of the individual's services as an Officer,
     provided, however, that in no event may an Officer's
     Revised Election designate a form of payment that is more
     rapid than that previously designated by the Officer.  The
     Revised Election shall be effective unless the Senior
     Management Compensation Committee, whose members are
     appointed by the Board of Directors, disapproves such
     Revised Election within ten days of its filing with the
     Staff Vice President, Compensation.

     Under a Revised Election made in the form authorized by the
     Committee, the Officer may designate:

     (1)   a modification of the normal triggering event for
           payment (i.e., termination of employment) to a later
           termination of the individual's services as an
           Officer, and/or

     (2)   a greater number of installments (not exceeding 10)
           or installment payments in place of a prior lump sum
           payment election, and/or

     (3)   further deferral of the commencement of payment to a
           date later than the normal date of payment described
           in this Article V, provided, in such event, the
           Revised Election shall be limited to a number of
           installments less than 10, so as not to extend the
           maximum payout term permitted under the Officer's
           original election (except to the extent affected by
           the election made in (1) above).

     Unless a Revised Election is made as provided under this
     Article V, payment of Deferred Compensation shall be made,
     or commence, no later than ninety days following the
     Officer's termination of employment.

5.2  Form and Time of Payment.  All payments of cash deferrals
     under this Plan shall be made in cash.  Unless otherwise
     elected by the Officer, the payment or commencement of
     payment of account balances hereunder shall occur as soon
     as practicable, but in no event later than ninety days,
     following the Officer's termination of employment (or
     termination of services as an Officer, if applicable).

5.3  Valuation.  The account balance available for payment shall
     be the ending balance as of the latest month valued plus a
     prorated income factor of the Insurance Contract Fund for
     the number of days (if more than 5) between the valuation
     date and the subsequent date of disbursement.

     The amount of each annual installment payment to an Officer
     shall be determined by dividing the value of the deferral
     units (including incremental amounts) at the time of the
     installment payment in the Officer's account by the number
     of installments remaining to be paid.
<PAGE>
                              -6-

5.4  Special Payment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
     this Plan to the contrary, the Corporation in its sole
     discretion may accelerate the payment of deferrals to an
     Officer or to all Officers or to a Beneficiary whether
     before or after the Officer's termination of service, for
     reasons of individual hardship, death, changes in the tax
     laws or accounting principles.

5.5  Beneficiary.  Beneficiary under this Plan is the person or
     persons designated from time to time in writing by a
     participating Officer to receive payments after the death
     of such Officer or, in the absence of any such designation
     or in the event that such designated person or persons
     shall predecease such Officer, his/her estate.

                           Article VI
                        Change in Control
                        -----------------

6.1  Withdrawal Election.  Notwithstanding any other provision
     of the Plan to the contrary, in the event of a "change in
     control," as defined below, each Officer may elect to
     receive a single sum payment of all or any portion of
     his/her account balance.  Such election shall only be
     effective if delivered to the Staff Vice President,
     Compensation within the ninety-day period immediately
     following the date of the occurrence of the change in
     control.  If such election is timely made, the Officer
     shall be entitled to receive, at his/her election, either
     of the following amounts:

     (1)   The full value or any portion thereof of his/her
           account balance available for payment (as described
           in Article V), minus an 8% early withdrawal penalty;
           or

     (2)   The full value or any portion thereof of his/her
           account balance available for payment (as described
           in Article V), minus a 6% early withdrawal penalty,
           provided, however, that in addition to the early
           withdrawal penalty, the Officer shall be suspended
           from making tax-deferred contributions to the Unisys
           Savings Plan or any equivalent subsidiary savings
           plan for the full calendar year immediately following
           the date on which the election is filed.

           Payment of such withdrawal shall be made as soon as
           possible after receipt of the Officer's election.
           The Committee, upon the advice of counsel, may modify
           the penalties described in (1) and/or (2) above in
           any way it deems appropriate and consistent with the
           purposes of the Plan.
<PAGE>
                              -7-

6.2  Litigation Expenses.  If litigation is brought by the
     Officer or the Officer's Beneficiary after a change in
     control to enforce or interpret any provision of the Plan,
     the Corporation to the extent permitted by applicable law
     shall reimburse the Officer (or Beneficiary) for the
     reasonable fees and disbursements of his/her counsel
     incurred in such litigation.

6.3  Change in Control Definition.  For purposes of this
     Article VI, a "change in control" shall mean:

     (a)   The acquisition, other than from the Corporation, by
           any individual, entity or group (within the meaning
           of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities
           Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
           Act")) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of
           Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20%
           or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of
           common stock of the Corporation (the "Outstanding
           Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting
           power of the then outstanding voting securities of
           the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
           election of directors (the "Company Voting
           Securities"), provided, however, that any acquisition
           by (x) the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or
           any employee benefit plan (or related trust)
           sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or any of
           its subsidiaries or (y) any corporation with respect
           to which, following such acquisition, more than 60%
           of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
           common stock of such corporation and the combined
           voting power of the then outstanding voting
           securities of such corporation entitled to vote
           generally in the election of directors is then
           beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
           substantially all of the individuals and entities who
           were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the
           Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting
           Securities immediately prior to such acquisition in
           substantially the same proportion as their ownership,
           immediately prior to such acquisition, of the
           Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting
           Securities, as the case may be, shall not constitute
           a Change in Control; or

     (b)   Individuals who constitute the Incumbent Board cease
           for any reason to constitute at least two thirds of
           the Board.  For the purposes of this Article VI (b)
           the Incumbent Board shall mean the individuals who
           constitute the Board as of October 26, 1989 and any
           individual who becomes a director subsequent to
           October 26, 1989 whose election or nomination for
           election by the Corporation was approved by a vote of
<PAGE>
                              -8-

           at least a majority of the directors then comprising
           the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose,
           any such individual whose initial assumption of
           office is in connection with an actual or threatened
           election contest relating to the election of members
           of the Board; or

     (c)   Approved by the shareholders of the Corporation of a
           reorganization, merger or consolidation (a "Business
           Combination"), in each case, with respect to which
           all or substantially all of the individuals and
           entities who were the respective beneficial owners of
           the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company
           Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business
           Combination do not, following such Business
           Combination, beneficially own, directly or
           indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then
           outstanding shares of common stock and the combined
           voting power of the then outstanding voting
           securities entitled to vote generally in the election
           of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation
           resulting from such Business Combination in
           substantially the same proportion as their ownership
           immediately prior to such Business Combination of the
           Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting
           Securities, as the case may be; or

     (d)   (i) A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
           Corporation or (ii) the sale or other disposition of
           all or substantially all of the assets of the
           Corporation other than to a corporation with respect
           to which, following such sale or disposition, more
           than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding
           shares of common stock and the combined voting power
           of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to
           vote generally in the election of directors is then
           owned beneficially, directly or indirectly, by all or
           substantially all of the individuals and entities who
           were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the
           Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting
           Securities immediately prior to such sale or
           disposition in substantially the same proportion as
           their ownership of the Outstanding Company Common
           Stock and Company Voting Securities, as the case may
           be, immediately prior to such sale or disposition.

           Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to
           the contrary, no amendment to this Article VI (nor
           any other amendment to the Plan that would materially
           affect an Officer's rights under this Article VI)
           shall be permitted after a change in control.

     shall have the authority to offer opportunities to Officers
     to elect an early payment of their account balances
     hereunder under such terms and conditions as are deemed

     elect an early payment in any calendar year.

                          Article VIII
                          Miscellaneous

8.1  Amendment.  The Board may modify or amend, in whole or in
     part, any of or all the provisions of the Plan, or suspend
     or terminate it entirely; provided, however, that any such

     without the participating Officer's consent, adversely
     affect any deferral credited to him or her for any period
     prior to the effective date of such modification,
     amendment, suspension or termination.  The Plan shall
     remain in effect until terminated pursuant to this
     provision.

     participate under the Plan, selected from time to time by
     the Board.

     All expenses and costs in connection with the operation of
     this Plan shall be borne by the Corporation.

                   Transfer of Account Balance
                   ---------------------------

9.1  Transfer to Director's Plan.  Notwithstanding any election
     of form of payment made hereunder, an Officer who,
<PAGE>
                              -10-

     following his termination of employment as an Officer, will
     be eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation
     Plan for Directors of Unisys Corporation ("Director's
     Plan") may elect at any time prior to the date that is
     ninety days before the Officer's termination of employment
     (or if an appropriate election had been made under Article
     III, the Officer's termination of services as an Officer)
     to transfer all or any portion of his account balance to
     the Director's Plan.  Such transfer must occur prior to the
     date that payments of the Officer's account balance would
     otherwise be made, or commence, hereunder.  Upon transfer,
     the Officer's Account Balance (or portion thereof
     transferred) will be subject to the terms and conditions of
     the Director's Plan; provided, however, that any election
     of form of payment made under the Director's Plan with
     respect to the amount transferred may not provide for a
     form of payment that is in any way more rapid than the form
     of payment in effect under this Plan with respect to such
     amounts immediately prior to transfer to the Director's
     Plan.

     Valuation of the account balance (or portion thereof) to be
     transferred shall be made consistent with the valuation
     provisions described in Article V.

     Upon transfer, the Officer's (or Officer's beneficiary's)
     rights hereunder with respect to the amounts transferred
     shall cease.

                                                January 1, 1994


                   DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                   --------------------------
              FOR DIRECTORS OF UNISYS CORPORATION
              -----------------------------------

                           Article I
                            Purpose
                            -------

     1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of the Deferred Compensation
Plan for Directors (the "Plan") of Unisys Corporation (the
"Corporation") is to offer members of the Board of Directors of
the Corporation (the "Board") who are not, at the time of
filing a form of election, employees of the Corporation the
opportunity to defer receipt of their directors' compensation,
under the terms advantageous to both the Director and the
Corporation, until termination of the Director's service with
the Corporation.

                           Article II
                           Authority
                           ---------

     2.1  Effective Date.  The Board approved the Plan on
November 20, 1981, and including subsequent amendments, the
Plan is restated effective January 1, 1994.

     2.2  Authority.  Any decision made or action taken by the
Corporation, any of its officers, the Board or the Compensation
and Organization Committee (the "Committee") arising out of or
in connection with the construction, administration,
interpretation and effect of the Plan shall be within the
absolute discretion of all and each of them, as the case may
be, and will be conclusive and binding on all parties.  No
member of the Board and no employee of the Corporation shall be
liable for any act or action hereunder, whether of omission or
commission, by any other member or employee or by any agent to
whom duties in connection with the administration of the Plan
have been delegated or, except in circumstances involving
his/her bad faith, for anything done or omitted to be done by
himself or herself.

                          Article III
                    Deferral of Compensation
                    ------------------------

     3.1  Deferral Election.  Each Director may elect to have
all or a portion of his/her Compensation for any calendar year
deferred under the Plan.  "Compensation" includes payments for
services as a Director of the Corporation and may include
directors' fees as well as Board or Committee meeting fees, but
excludes any mandatory remuneration paid in the form of stock
and/or stock units.  Such election shall be executed in writing
by the Director and filed on an annual basis in a timely manner
(normally prior to the start of the fiscal year during which
such Compensation is earned) on a form furnished by the
<PAGE>
                              -2-

Secretary of the Corporation.  An election, once made, shall be
irrevocable with respect to payments for the fiscal year to
which it applies.  The election will specify that the Director
desires to have all or a specified percentage of his/her cash
Compensation for the year deferred under the Plan.

     3.2  Investment Options.

          (a)  Each participant may elect, at the same time as
the election to defer compensation is made, to have current
deferrals invested in one or more of the investment measurement
options available under the Plan.  Such investment election
with respect to current deferrals may be changed as of the
first day of any quarter provided that written notice of such
election is filed prior to the first day of that quarter with
the Secretary of the Corporation.

          (b)  Effective January 1, 1994, the investment
measurement options available under the Plan are five of the
six investment options available under the Unisys Savings Plan
(the "USP"), as follows:  (1) the Fidelity Retirement Money
Market Portfolio, (2) the Fidelity Asset Manager: Growth Fund,
(3) the Fidelity Magellan Fund, (4) the Fidelity Asset Manager
Fund and (5) the Insurance Contract Fund.

          (c)  Effective January 1, 1994, deferred amounts
credited to the Director's memorandum account allocated to the
investment measurement options available under the Plan prior
to January 1, 1994 will be transferred to the investment
measurement options described in Subsection (b) as follows:

Short Term Investment Fund   -   Fidelity Retirement Money
                                 Market Portfolio

Indexed Equity Fund          -   Fidelity Asset Manager: Growth
                                 Fund

Active Equity Fund           -   Fidelity Magellan Fund

Diversified Fund             -   Fidelity Asset Manager Fund

Insurance Contract Fund      -   No change

          (d)  Subject to the restrictions described in
Subsection (e), transfers of existing account balances among
the investment measurement options will be permitted as of the
first day of a calendar quarter provided that written notice of
such election is filed prior to the first day of the quarter
with the Secretary of the Corporation.

          (e)  Certain restrictions shall apply to investments
in this Plan as follows:

               (1)   investment allocation percentages to any
                     of the investment options shall be in 5%
                     increments as to each chosen option;
<PAGE>
                              -3-

               (2)   in the absence of any complete designation
                     or in the case of no designation at all,
                     the Insurance Contract Fund shall be
                     deemed to have been elected as to any
                     undesignated percentage;

               (3)   transfers between the Insurance Contract
                     Fund and the Fidelity Retirement Money
                     Market Portfolio are not permitted, except
                     as may be periodically allowed;

               (4)   investment of Compensation in the chosen
                     options shall be deemed made the first
                     business day of the month following its
                     normal payment date in the absence of
                     deferral;

               (5)   the increase/decrease credited to each
                     month's beginning balance shall be based
                     upon the net income factor assigned to
                     each eligible investment option from the
                     USP with such factors including all
                     realized and unrealized income associated
                     with each option and net of any expenses
                     or accruals provided for under USP; and

               (6)   the amount deferred shall be credited with
                     the pro-rata income factor of the
                     Insurance Contract Fund for the number of
                     days (if more than 5) between the normal
                     payment date in the absence of deferral
                     and the effective date of investment at
                     the beginning of the next following month.

          (f)  The Committee shall have the authority to modify
the rules and restrictions relating to Plan investments as it,
in its discretion, deems necessary and in accord with the
investment practices in place under the USP.


                           ARTICLE IV
                          Stock Units
                          -----------

     4.1. Frozen Stock Units Account.  Effective November 21,
1991, the Stock Units Account was no longer an available
investment option under this Plan and amounts invested in the
Account were frozen as to future investment option transfers.
Amounts invested in the Stock Units Accounts through
November 21, 1991 continue to be held under this Plan.
Dividends and other adjustments to the Stock Units Account
will be made in accordance with Section 4.2.
<PAGE>
                              -4-

    4.2  Dividends and Other Adjustments.  If the Corporation
shall issue a stock dividend on the common stock, stock
dividend equivalents shall be credited to the Director's Stock
Units Account, as of the dividend payment date, as Stock Units
in the same amount as the stock dividends to which the Director
would have been entitled if the Stock Units were shares of
common stock.  The Director's Stock Units Account shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect splits, reverse splits, or
comparable changes to the Corporation's common stock.  Cash
dividends shall be converted to stock units (or portions
thereof) based on the value of Unisys Common Stock (i.e., the
average of the highest and lowest prices reported on the
Composite Tape for New York Stock Exchange Companies) on the
dividend payment date.



                           ARTICLE V
                 Treatment of Deferred Amounts
                 -----------------------------

     5.1  Memorandum Account.  The Corporation shall establish
on its books a memorandum account for each Director who has
deferred Compensation under this Plan.  To this account shall
be credited deferrals and incremental amounts equivalent to the
income factors assigned to each form of eligible investment
option in the USP.  Payments to the Director or Beneficiary (as
defined in Section 6.3) shall be debited to the account.  No
assets shall be segregated or earmarked in respect to any
deferrals or reinvestments and no Director shall have any right
to assign, transfer, pledge or hypothecate his/her interest or
any portion thereof in his/her account.  The Plan and the
crediting of accounts hereunder shall not constitute a trust
and shall be merely for the purpose of recording an unsecured
contractual obligation.

                           ARTICLE VI
                            Payment
                            -------

     6.1  Payment Election.

          (a)  Each time the Director makes his/her election to
defer Compensation, the Director shall designate the form in
which payment of such deferred amounts shall be made.  The
Director may elect payment in either a single sum or in annual
installments (not to exceed ten installment payments).  Payment
shall be made in a lump sum if no election of form of payment
is timely made by the Director.

          (b)  An election of form of payment, once timely
made, may be revoked and a new election of form of payment (the
"Revised Election") may be made at any time prior to the date
that is ninety days before termination of the individual's
service as a Director provided, however, that in no event may a
<PAGE>
                              -5-

Director's Revised Election designate a form of payment that is
more rapid than that previously designated by the Director.
Under a Revised Election made in the form authorized by the
Committee, the Director may designate:

               (1)   a greater number of installments (not
                     exceeding 10) or installment payments in
                     place of a prior lump sum payment
                     election, and/or

               (2)   further deferral of the commencement of
                     payment to a date later than the normal
                     date of payment provided, in such event,
                     the Revised Election shall be limited to a
                     number of installments less than 10, so as
                     not to extend the maximum payout term
                     permitted under the Director's original
                     election.

          (c)  Unless a Revised Election is made as provided in
Subsection (b), payment of deferred amounts shall be made, or
commence, no later than ninety days following termination of
the individual's service as Director.

     6.2  Payment Upon Termination of Service.

          (a)  Following termination of service, all payments
of deferred amounts under this Plan including, without
limitation, amounts represented by Corporation Stock Units,
shall be made in cash.

          (b)  In determining the amount to be paid upon
termination of service, the following shall apply:

               (1)   Except with respect to Corporation Stock
                     Units, the account balance available for
                     payment shall be the ending balance as of
                     the latest month valued plus a pro-rated
                     income factor of the Insurance Contract
                     Fund for the number of days (if more than
                     5) between the valuation date and the
                     subsequent date of disbursement;

               (2)   The cash value of the Director's
                     Corporation Stock Units Account shall
                     include:  (i) the value of the product of
                     the number of Stock Units credited to the
                     Director's account multiplied by the
                     average of the highest and the lowest New
                     York Stock Exchange composite tape market
                     prices on the date of termination of
                     services as a Director (or if there be no
                     such sale on such day, the next preceding
                     trading day) and, (ii) earnings based
                     upon (i) herein until paid measured by the
                     Insurance Contract Fund of the USP.
<PAGE>
                              -6-

               (3)   The amount of each annual installment
                     payment to a Director shall be determined
                     by dividing the value of the Director's
                     Account at the time of the installment
                     payment by the number of installments
                     remaining to be paid.

     6.3  Beneficiary.  Beneficiary under this Plan is the
person or persons designated from time to time in writing by a
participating Director to receive payments after the death of
such Director or, in the absence of any such designation or in
the event that such designated person or persons shall
predecease such Director, his/her estate.

     6.4  Early Withdrawals.

          (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may
accelerate the payment of deferred account balances to a
Director or to all Directors or to a Beneficiary (whether
before or after termination of service), for reasons of
hardship, death, changes in the tax laws or accounting
principles.  In addition, the Committee, in its sole
discretion, shall have the authority to offer opportunities to
Directors and Beneficiaries to elect an early payment of their
deferred account balances hereunder under such terms and
conditions (including the assessment of early withdrawal
penalties) as are deemed necessary and appropriate by the
Committee, provided, however, that unless otherwise authorized
by the Board, the Committee may not offer more than one such
opportunity to elect an early payment in any calendar year.

          (b)  With respect to any early payment made pursuant
to this Section 6.4, that portion of the deferred account
balance invested in the Stock Units Fund will be paid no
earlier than six months after the effective date of the
Director's or Beneficiary's election to receive such early
payment and the value of the Stock Units Fund to be paid (as
described in Section 6.2(b)(2)) will be determined on the date
that is six months following the effective date of such
election.

                          Article VII
                       Change in Control
                       -----------------

     7.1  Withdrawal Election.

          (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
to the contrary, in the event of a "change in control," as
defined below, each Director may elect to receive a single sum
payment of all or any portion of his/her account balance
including, without limitation, the portion represented by
his/her frozen Corporation Stock Units Account.  Such election
shall only be effective if delivered to the Secretary of the
Corporation within the ninety-day period immediately following
the date of the occurrence of the change in control.
<PAGE>
                              -7-

          (b)  If an election is timely made, the Director (or
Beneficiary) will be entitled to receive, as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the ninety-day period, an
amount equal to (1) the full value or any portion thereof of
the deferred account balance (except that portion invested in
the Stock Units Fund), minus (2) an early withdrawal penalty
equal to 8% of the total value of (1).  With respect to that
portion of the deferred account balance invested in the Stock
Units Fund, such portion shall be valued on the date that is
six months following the effective date of the election to
receive such payment and the Director or Beneficiary will be
entitled to receive, as soon as practicable thereafter, an
amount equal to(i) the full value or any portion thereof of the
Stock Units Fund minus (ii) an early withdrawal penalty equal
to 8% of the total value of (i).  The Committee, upon advice of
counsel, may modify the early withdrawal penalty described
above in any way it deems appropriate and consistent with the
purposes of the Plan.

     7.2  Litigation Expenses.  If litigation is brought by the
Director or the Director's Beneficiary after a change in
control to enforce or interpret any provision of the Plan, the
Corporation to the extent permitted by applicable law shall
reimburse the Director (or Beneficiary) for the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel incurred in such litigation.

     7.3  Change in Control Definition.  For purposes of this
Article VII, a "change in control" shall mean:

          (a)  The acquisition, other than from the
Corporation, by any individual, entity or group (within the
meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either
(i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
Corporation (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii)
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors (the "Company Voting Securities"),
provided, however, that any acquisition by (x) the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (or
related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries or (y) any corporation with respect to
which, following such acquisition, more than 60% of,
respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of
such corporation and the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors is then
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the
beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company
Common Stock and Company Voting Securities immediately prior to
such acquisition in substantially the same proportion as their
<PAGE>
                              -8-

ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the
Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities,
as the case may be, shall not constitute a Change in Control;

than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
common stock and the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation
resulting from such Business Combination in substantially the
same proportion as their ownership immediately prior to such
Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock
and Company Voting Securities, as the case may be; or

          (d)  (i) A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
Corporation or (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation other than
to a corporation with respect to which, following such sale or
disposition, more than 60% of, respectively, the then
outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting
power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors is then owned
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially
all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock
and Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or
disposition in substantially the same proportion as their
ownership of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company
Voting Securities, as the case may be, immediately prior to
such sale or disposition.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary, no amendment to this Article VI (nor any other
amendment to the Plan that would materially affect a Director's
rights under this Article VI) shall be permitted after a change

                    UNISYS INFORMATION SERVICES
                    ---------------------------
                     LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
                     ------------------------

The Information Services (IS) Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan)
is a new compensation program developed for certain key executives
of IS.  By design, the Plan encourages IS executives to attend to
the longer-term performance of the Company by granting awards
contingent on IS meeting predetermined financial targets during a
multi-year period.

This is a one-time plan covering the period January 1, 1993 through
December 31, 1995 (the Award Cycle).

Details of the Plan follow.

Eligibility
- -----------

Eligibility for the Plan is limited to the Senior Vice President IS
and to selected members of Information Services senior management
selected by the Senior Vice President and approved by the President
and Chairman.  Participation is not automatic for any salary level
and each potential participant must be nominated by the IS Senior
Vice President and approved by the President and Chairman.

New employees or current employees who are approved for
participation during the award cycle will be eligible to receive a
pro-rata portion of the Award, if any, for that portion of the Award
Cycle during which they participated in the Plan provided they had a
minimum of twelve (12) months participation retroactive to the date
of their original participation.

Award Criteria
- --------------

A target performance award--that is, the gross amount you would be
entitled to, assuming achievement of 100% of target objectives,
during and at the end of the three-year cycle--has been determined
for you.

Of the amount ultimately received 70% depends on the degree that
Information Services achieves the predetermined financial
performance targets during the course of the Award Cycle and 30% on
the assessment of your personal contributions by the Chairman and
the President.

If the targets for either the IS financial objectives or the
qualitative objectives are not met, you could receive no payout or
an amount that is less than your original target.  If IS exceeds its
target financial objectives, you could receive a larger amount.

End revenue and Information Services profit are the two financial
measurements of IS award performance.  Forty percent of your award
will depend on IS revenue attainment, and 30% on IS profit
attainment.
<PAGE>
                              -2-

Revenue includes all commercial Information Services revenue as well
as hardware and software revenue directly related to the information
services revenue recognized at the time the associated cost is
recognized.  This would include the revenue generated by the
utilization of Paramax resources on commercial accounts.  The final
determination of hardware and software revenue to be included as
Information Services revenue will be made by the Chairman and the
President after consulting with the Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer and the Senior Vice President, Information
Systems.

Profit is Information Services published gross margin less Corporate
IS staff SG&A expense.  The profit calculation is prior to SG&A
expenses for division sales commissions, presales activity (for
hardware and software) and corporate allocations.

In the event of an acquisition of an information services firm by
Unisys during the term of this plan, the additional revenue and
profit will be taken into consideration to adjust the goals and
achievement levels of this plan.  The revenue and profit acquired
will be eliminated from the calculation, but the growth in revenue
and profit after acquisition will be included.

All final determinations in connection with the calculation of
revenue and pretax profit shall be in the sole and exclusive
discretion of the Chairman and the President.

In addition, 30% of your payout will depend on the assessment by the
Senior Vice President IS, as approved by the Chairman and the
President, of your personal contributions during the Award Cycle.

Award Payment
- -------------

By the end of February, 1996, the Chairman and the President will
confirm the degree of achievement of the financial goals and will
determine the specific awards for plan participants.  Award payments
will be made in cash in March of 1996.  Payments under this program
do not qualify as eligible compensation under the Company's Pension
Plan.

Tax Implications
- ----------------

When the period ends and you receive your award, Unisys will be
required to withhold federal income taxes as well as applicable
state and local taxes.

Termination of Employment
- -------------------------

An executive who quits or is terminated for cause before the end of
the Award Cycle will forfeit his/her award.  "Cause" is defined as
gross misconduct and/or continued documented poor performance.

An executive who terminates employment (after a minimum of twelve
month's participation) because of death or long-term disability or
accepts another position in Unisys at the request of Unisys will be
eligible for a pro rata award.

The Chairman and the President, at their sole discretion, may make
pro-rata awards to terminated participants under such terms and
conditions as it deems appropriate.  The amount resulting from the
award will be determined and distributed to you or your estate net
of applicable withholding taxes in early 1996.

General
- -------

The Chairman and the President are empowered to select participants,
approve objectives and performance measurements, determine actual
awards, interpret plan provisions, and make all determinations
concerning the achievement of performance goals.  All decisions in
connection with the administration and interpretation of the Plan
shall be retained by the Chairman and the President and such
decisions shall be binding and conclusive on all parties.

Unisys expects to make payments to Plan participants at the end of
the Award Cycle.  The plan, however, is discretionary.  Subject to
applicable laws and regulations, the Chairman and the President may
modify or terminate the Long-Term Incentive Plan.  No such change,
however, would adversely affect your right to a pro-rated award
earned prior to the change.

                  Management's Discussion and Analysis of
              Financial Condition and Results of Operations
              ---------------------------------------------
Overview
- --------

In 1993, the Company reported net income of $565.4 million, or $2.31 per
fully diluted common share, compared to net income of $361.2 million, or
$1.40 per fully diluted common share, in 1992. Excluding the effects of
extraordinary items and accounting changes, fully diluted earnings per
common share in 1993 were $1.48 compared to $1.04 a year ago. In 1991,
the Company incurred a net loss of $1.4 billion, or $9.37 per common share
on both a primary and fully diluted basis. The loss included special charges
of $1.2 billion, covering work force reductions, plant and excess facilities
consolidation and other charges.

In 1993, significant progress was made in strengthening the Company's
balance sheet. In the year, inventories, receivables and total debt were
reduced by 14%, 22% and 18%, respectively; and since December 31, 1991,
these items have been reduced 48%, 62% and 45%, respectively.  At
December 31, 1993, net debt as a percent of total capital was 29% compared
to 55% two years ago.

In 1993, the increase in the Company's profitability was driven principally
by cost reductions, as deterioration in the Company's European business
accelerated and market conditions in Japan continued weak, more than
offsetting growth in other parts of the business.  Given the economic
uncertainties in these international markets, the Company continues to
rely on cost reductions as its principal means of driving profit and cash flow.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Revenue for 1993 was $7.7 billion, down 8% from 1992 revenue of $8.4 billion.
Approximately one-third of the revenue decline was due to the impact of
negative currency translation. In 1993, the Company began reporting the
following components of revenue: sales, services, and equipment maintenance.
Prior years' revenue reflects a reclassification to conform with the 1993
presentation. Sales declined 13% to $4.7 billion in 1993 from $5.4 billion in
1992, due to decreases in sales of enterprise systems and servers,
departmental servers and desktop systems and custom defense systems offset
in part by an increase in software revenue. Services revenue increased 19%
to $1.6 billion in 1993 from $1.3 billion in 1992 as the Company continued
to implement its strategy of becoming an information management solutions
provider. Equipment maintenance revenue declined 14% to $1.4 billion in 1993
from $1.7 billion in 1992, due principally to a decline in equipment sales
and improved product reliability.

Revenue for 1992 was $8.4 billion, down 3% from 1991 revenue of $8.7 billion.
Effective June 30, 1991, the Company sold its Communications and Networks
Group, comprised principally of its Timeplex, Inc. subsidiary. Excluding
Timeplex revenue of $124.8 million in 1991, 1992 revenue declined 2%. Revenue
from both the commercial and defense business declined from the prior year.
Sales declined 6% to $5.4 billion in 1992, due principally to a decline in
the sale of personal workstations (mainly to the U. S. government under a
large government contract) and the sale of Timeplex. These declines were
partially offset by growth in software, UNIX systems and the Company's two
large enterprise system families - the A Series and 2200 Series. Services
revenue increased 16% to $1.3 billion in 1992 from $1.1 billion in 1991.
Equipment maintenance declined 8% to $1.7 billion in 1992 from $1.8 billion
in 1991, due principally to a decline in equipment sales and improved product
reliability.

                                 -2-

Revenue from international operations in 1993 was $3.6 billion, down 14% from
1992. Approximately 35% of this revenue decline was due to the impact of
negative currency translation. Revenue from U.S. operations in both 1993 and
1992 was $4.1 billion. Revenue from operations outside the U.S. in 1992 was
$4.3 billion, down 4% from 1991. Revenue from U.S. operations in 1992
declined 3% from 1991.

During the past three years, the Company received approximately 20% of its
revenue from custom defense systems. A substantial portion of this revenue
was derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense
and the Canadian Department of National Defence. Any future declines in
defense industry spending could affect the Company's ability to obtain new
defense contracts, and no assurance can be given that current, in-process,
multiple-year contracts will not be downsized or discontinued.

Total gross profit margin increased to 37% in 1993 from 36% in 1992. Sales
gross profit margin in 1993 was 41% compared to 38% in 1992; services gross
profit margin for 1993 was 23% compared to 21% in 1992; and equipment
maintenance gross profit margin for 1993 was 43% compared to 42% in 1992.
Excluding restructuring charges, in 1991 the total gross profit margin was
32%, sales gross profit margin was 33%, services gross profit margin was 17%,
and equipment maintenance gross profit margin was 40%. Prior years' services
gross profit margin reflects a reclassification of certain selling, general
and administrative expenses to cost of services to conform with the 1993
presentation of such costs. This reclassification was made to better match
service costs with service revenue and produced no change to operating profit.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1993 was $1.6 billion, a
decrease of 7% from $1.8 billion in 1992. The decline was principally due
to the effects of continued tight cost management and foreign currency
translation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1992 were
$1.8 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 1991. Exclusive of restructuring
charges in 1991, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 10%.
The decline was principally due to the Company's repositioning actions.
Total employment at December 31, 1993 was approximately 49,000 compared to
approximately 54,300 at December 31, 1992 and 60,300 at December 31, 1991.

Research and development expenses in 1993 were $515.2 million compared to
$535.9 million in 1992, a decline of 4%. Research and development expenses
in 1992 were $535.9 million compared to $638.9 million in 1991. Exclusive
of special charges in 1991, research and development expenses declined 9%
in 1992 from 1991. The decline in all periods resulted from repositioning
actions which reduced managerial and administrative costs and focused
research and development efforts on core products.

As a result of the above, operating income was $734.1 million in 1993
(9.5% of revenue) compared to $720.7 million in 1992 (8.6% of revenue) and
an operating loss of $578.9 million in 1991 ($245.3 million operating income
exclusive of special charges, 2.8% of revenue).

Interest expense was $241.7 million in 1993, down from $340.6 million in
1992, reflecting principally lower average debt levels. Interest expense in
1992 was down from $407.6 million in 1991, reflecting both lower average debt
levels and lower average interest rates.

                                 -3-

Other income in 1993 was $11.0 million compared to $55.5 million in 1992 and
an expense of $301.8 million in 1991. Excluding special charges of $375.4
million, 1991 other income was $73.6 million. Included in 1993 is a charge
of $20.0 million related to the "Ill Wind" settlement. This settlement
requires the Company to make contingency payments based on proceeds from
asset sales and on net income. The maximum contingent amount payable in
1994 under this settlement agreement is $30.0 million.

It is the Company's policy to minimize its exposure to foreign currency
fluctuations. On a net basis, and after taking into account the cost of
the Company's hedging program, foreign currency effects had a minimal
effect on pretax results in each of the past three years.

Income before income taxes for 1993 was $503.4 million, up 16% from $435.6
million in 1992. Income before income taxes in 1991 (which included a $1.2
billion special charge) was a loss of $1.3 billion.

Estimated income taxes were $141.8 million in 1993 compared with $139.4
million in 1992 and $105.0 million in 1991. Included in 1993 is a net
benefit of $19.2 million, or $.09 per fully diluted common share, relating
to a U.S. tax law change enacted in August. This law increases the top
corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993. Since
the Company has net deferred tax assets in the U.S., the effect of the
tax rate change was to increase these tax assets with a corresponding
reduction in provision for taxes.

Net income for 1993 was $565.4 million compared to $361.2 million in
1992 and a loss of $1.4 billion in 1991. Income before extraordinary
items and changes in accounting principles was $361.6 million in 1993,
up 22% from the 1992 level of $296.2 million. In 1991, income before
extraordinary items and changes in accounting principles was a loss of
$1.4 billion.

Excluding the effects of extraordinary items and accounting changes,
fully diluted earnings per common share in 1993 were $1.48 compared to
$1.04 in 1992. Because of the additional income caused by the accounting
changes adopted in 1993, the earnings per share computation for 1993
assumes the conversion of Series A preferred stock. The 1992 computation
did not assume such conversion since it would have been antidilutive.
If the 1993 computation had been made on a basis comparable to that of
1992, fully diluted earnings per common share before extraordinary items
and changes in accounting principles would have been $1.30 per share in
1993 compared to $1.04 per share in 1992.

Accounting Changes and Extraordinary Items
- ------------------------------------------

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 106, which establishes
accounting standards for postretirement benefits other than pensions. This
statement requires the Company to change from the cash basis of accounting
for such benefits by requiring the accrual, during the years that the
employees render services, of the estimated cost of providing such benefits.
SFAS 106 also requires the recognition of a transition obligation based on
the aggregate amount that would have been accrued in prior years if the
new rules had been in effect for those years. The Company adopted SFAS
106 effective January 1, 1993 and has recognized the entire transition
<PAGE>
                                 -4-

obligation. In November 1992, the Company announced changes to its
postretirement benefit plans, effective January 1, 1993, whereby the
Company's current subsidy will be phased out, ending as of January 1,
1996. Several lawsuits have been brought by plan participants challenging
the announced changes to the plans and the Company is defending them
vigorously. The recognition of the transition obligation decreased net
income for 1993 by $194.8 million, net of $124.5 million of income tax
benefits, or $.79 per fully diluted common share. Prior years' financial
statements have not been restated.

In February 1992,the FASB issued SFAS 109 which establishes financial
accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that
result from a company's activities during the current and preceding years.
The Company adopted this statement effective January 1, 1993. The
cumulative effect of this change increased net income for 1993 by
$425.0 million, or $1.73 per fully diluted common share. Prior years'
financial statements have not been restated.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had deferred tax assets in excess of
deferred tax liabilities of $1,123 million. For the reasons cited below,
management believes that it is more likely than not that $773 million of
such assets will be realized, therefore resulting in a valuation allowance
of $350 million. In assessing the likelihood of realization of this asset,
the Company has considered various factors including its forecast of
future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could
be implemented to realize deferred tax assets.

The principal basis used to assess the likelihood of realization was the
Company's forecast of future taxable income which was adjusted by applying
varying probability factors to the achievement of this forecast. Forecasted
taxable income is expected to arise from ordinary and recurring operations
and to be sufficient to realize the entire amount of net deferred tax assets.
Approximately $2.3 billion of future taxable income (predominantly U.S.)
is needed to realize all of the net deferred tax assets.

The Company's net deferred tax assets include substantial amounts of net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  The major portion of such
carryforwards expire beyond the year 2003. In addition, substantial amounts
of foreign net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period.
Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate
realization of the net deferred tax assets. In recent years, the computer
industry has undergone dramatic changes and there can be no assurance that
in the future there could not be increased competition or other factors which
may result in a decline in sales or margins, loss of market share, or
technological obsolescence. The Company will evaluate quarterly the
realizability of its net deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation
allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary.

In 1993, the Company settled lawsuits with Honeywell Inc. in connection
with its sale of the Sperry Aerospace Group in December 1986. The Company
will make payments of $43.2 million spread over three years toward a $70
million total settlement, with the remaining amounts to be paid by insurance
companies and an investment banking firm. The first of such payments of
$14.4 million was paid by the Company in June 1993. As a result of the
settlement, the Company recorded an extraordinary charge of $26.4 million,
net of $16.8 million of income tax benefits, or $.11 per fully diluted
common share.
<PAGE>
                                 -5-

In 1992, the Company recorded, in accordance with AICPA Opinion No. 11,
an extraordinary item of $65.0 million, or $.36 per fully diluted common
share, related to the tax benefit of book operating loss carryforwards.
Since these tax benefits were not previously recognized in the Company's
financial statements, accounting rules followed by the Company at that
time required that they be reported as an extraordinary item in the results
of operations in the period when they were realized.

Financial Condition
- -------------------

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $1,019.7, $1,176.5
and $919.5 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Investments in
properties and rental equipment were $196.8, $251.7 and $248.3 million
in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Proceeds from sales of properties
were $26.5, $90.3 and $344.1 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
The 1991 amounts included $206.8 million from the sale of Timeplex.

In March and July 1993, the Company redeemed all of its $200 million 9%
Notes due October 1, 1993, and all of its $100 million 10 3/4% Notes due
November 1, 1995, each at the redemption price of 100% of principal amount,
plus accrued interest. In January 1994, the Company announced that it would
redeem on February 11, 1994 the remaining $20 million outstanding 8.20%
Sinking Fund Debentures due 1996, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of the Debentures, plus accrued interest. In December 1993,
the Company repurchased $15.0 million of its debt. The Company intends,
from time to time, to continue to redeem or repurchase its debt securities
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon
availability, market conditions and other factors.

In August 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective
a registration statement filed by the Company covering $500 million of
debt or equity securities. Although the Company has no immediate plan for
its utilization, the registration statement enables the Company to be
prepared for future market opportunities. Proceeds from future offerings
of these securities are anticipated to be used for general corporate
purposes, including reduction or refinancing of debt.

In December 1992, the Company entered into a $300 million revolving credit
agreement with a syndicate of banks, which expires on May 31, 1995. This
agreement provides for short-term borrowings and up to $100 million of
letters of credit and replaced the Company's $1.25 billion revolving
credit agreement that was to expire January 11, 1993. During 1993,
there were no borrowings under this agreement.

At December 31, 1993, total debt was $2.1 billion, a decline of $453.1
million from December 31, 1992 principally due to the redemptions of the
Company's debt securities described above. Cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities at December 31, 1993 were $950.5 million compared
to $882.8 million at December 31, 1992. During 1993, debt net of cash
and marketable securities decreased $520.8 million to $1.1 billion.
As a percent of total capital, debt net of cash and marketable securities
at December 31, 1993 was 29% compared to 42% at December 31, 1992.

The credit rating of the Company's senior long-term debt was increased
from B+ to BB- by Standard & Poor's Corporation in September 1993, from
B+ to BB by Duff & Phelps Inc. in July 1993 and from B1 to Ba3 by Moody's
Investors Service in May 1993.

Stockholders' equity increased $451.4 million during 1993, principally
reflecting net income of $565.4 million and an increase of $89.2 million
due to the contribution of seven million newly issued shares of the
Company's common stock to its U.S. pension plan, offset by preferred
dividends of $177.6 million and unfavorable currency translation
adjustments of $23.3 million.

In 1993, quarterly dividends of $1.40625 per share were declared on the
Company's Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. The stated
quarterly dividend on Series A stock is $.9375. At December 31, 1993,
cumulative preferred dividends in arrears on all series of preferred
stock amounted to $107.8 million. In February 1994, the Company declared
a Series A dividend payable April 15, 1994 which includes full payment
of the Series A dividend arrearage.

In 1994, the Company expects to settle certain open tax years with the
Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to result in cash payments
by the Company of approximately $125 million. These payments will not
affect earnings since provision for these taxes has been made in prior years.

In November 1992, the FASB issued SFAS 112, "Employers Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," which is required to be adopted by January 1,
1994. This statement establishes financial accounting standards for
employers that provide benefits to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement. In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which is
required to be adopted by January 1, 1994. This statement addresses the
accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities.
The effect of adoption of these statements on the Company's consolidated
financial position and results of operations is expected to be immaterial.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Unisys Corporation


1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Principles of consolidation
- ---------------------------
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly
owned subsidiaries. Investments in companies representing ownership
interests of 20% to 50% are accounted for by the equity method.

Cash equivalents
- ----------------
All short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less are classified as cash equivalents.

Marketable securities
- ---------------------
Marketable securities, consisting principally of U.S. Government
securities, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates
market.

Inventories
- -----------
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally on the first-in, first-out method.

Properties, rental equipment and depreciation
- ---------------------------------------------
Properties and rental equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated
over the estimated lives of such assets using the straight-line method.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the asset lives
or the terms of the respective leases. The principal rates used are
summarized below by classification of properties:

- -------------------------------------------------
                                Rate per Year (%)
- -------------------------------------------------
Buildings                                   2 - 5
Machinery and equipment                    5 - 25
Tools and test equipment              10 - 33 1/3
Rental equipment                               25
- -------------------------------------------------

Revenue recognition
- -------------------
Sales revenue is generally recorded upon shipment of product in the case
of sales contracts, upon shipment of the program in the case of software,
and upon installation in the case of sales-type leases. Revenue from
service and rental agreements is recorded as earned over the lives of the
respective contracts.

Revenue under cost-type contracts is recognized when costs are incurred,
and under fixed-price contracts when products or services are accepted
and billings can be made. General and administrative expenses are charged
to income as incurred. Cost of revenue under long-term contracts is
charged based on current estimated total costs. When estimates indicate
a loss under a contract, cost of revenue is charged with a provision for
such loss.
<PAGE>
                                 -11-

Income taxes
- ------------
Income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates
applicable to such income.  Deferred taxes have not been provided on the
cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since such
amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Earnings per common share
- -------------------------
In 1993 and 1992, the computation of primary earnings per share was based
on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and
additional shares assuming the exercise of stock options. The computation
of fully diluted earnings per share for both years further assumes the
conversion of the 8 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due August 1,
2000. The computation of fully diluted earnings per share for 1993
further assumes conversion of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock. In 1991, both primary and fully diluted earnings per common share
were based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares.
The inclusion of additional shares assuming the conversion of Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive in
1992 and 1991. The shares used in the computations for the three years
ended December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):

- ---------------------------------------------------
                       1993        1992        1991
- ---------------------------------------------------
Primary             165,070     163,725     161,552
Fully diluted       246,550     181,813     161,552
- ---------------------------------------------------

Cost in excess of net assets acquired
- -------------------------------------
Cost in excess of net assets acquired represents the excess of cost over
fair value of the net assets of Sperry Corporation and Convergent, Inc.,
which is being amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years and
12 years, respectively. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1993 and
1992 was $524.7 and $483.4 million, respectively.

Software capitalization
- -----------------------
The cost of development of computer software to be sold or leased is
capitalized and amortized to cost of sales over the estimated
revenue-producing lives of the products, but not in excess of three years
following product release. Unamortized marketable software costs (which
are included in other assets) at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $294.5
and $320.4 million, respectively.

Translation of foreign currency
- -------------------------------
The local currency is the functional currency for most of the Company's
international subsidiaries and, as such, assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and
expense items are translated at average exchange rates during the year.
Translation adjustments resulting from changes in exchange rates are
reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Exchange gains
and losses on certain forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of
international net investments and exchange gains and losses on
intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also reported
in the separate component of stockholders' equity.
<PAGE>
                                 -12-

For those international subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary
economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency and, as such,
nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange
rates and monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current
exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses arising from translation are
included in other income.

The Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and options which
have been designated as hedges of certain transactional exposures. Gains
and losses on these instruments are deferred and will be recognized as
part of the transaction being hedged.

Reclassifications
- -----------------
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
1993 presentation.


2. Accounting changes and extraordinary items

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting
Standard Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," and SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The adoption of
SFAS 106 decreased net income $194.8 million, net of $124.5 million of
income tax benefits, or $.79 per fully diluted common share, and the
adoption of SFAS 109 increased net income by $425.0 million, or $1.73 per
fully diluted common share. For further discussion of SFAS 106 and 109,
see notes 14  and 4, respectively.

In 1993, the Company settled lawsuits with Honeywell Inc. in connection
with its sale of the Sperry Aerospace Group in December 1986. As a result
of the settlement, the Company recorded an extraordinary charge of $26.4
million, net of $16.8 million of income tax benefits, or $.11 per fully
diluted common share.

In 1992, the Company recorded an extraordinary item of $65.0 million, or
$.36 per fully diluted common share, related to the tax benefit of book
operating loss carryforwards. See note 4.


3. 1991 special charges

In 1991, the Company recorded pretax charges of $1,200.0 million covering
(a) $925.0 million for a work force reduction of approximately 10,000
people, product and market segment pruning, plant and excess facilities
consolidation and other charges, (b) $200.0 million for a write-down of
cost in excess of net assets acquired, and (c) $75.0 million for a
write-off of an investment in the preferred stock of Memorex Corporation.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted SFAS 109 effective January
1, 1993. Prior years' financial statements have not been restated. Under
the provisions of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized using enacted tax rates and reflect the effect of "temporary
differences" between the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of such assets and
liabilities.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give
rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities at
December 31, 1993 were as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------
(Millions)
=========================================================
Deferred tax assets:
Tax loss carryforwards                           $  379.5
Foreign tax credit carryforwards                    334.8

- ---------------------------------------------------------
Total deferred tax assets                        $1,247.4
=========================================================
Deferred tax liabilities:
Pensions                                           $281.4
Other                                               193.4
- ---------------------------------------------------------
Total deferred tax liabilities                     $474.8
=========================================================

SFAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax  asset will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been
provided on certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards with short
carryforward periods remaining. During 1993, the net decrease in the
valuation allowance was $28.2 million.

Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no
U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been recorded, because such
earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely, approximated $500
million at December 31, 1993. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
The additional taxes payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if
remitted, would be substantially offset by U.S. tax credits for foreign
taxes already paid. While there are no specific plans to distribute the
undistributed earnings in the immediate future, where economically
appropriate to do so, such earnings may be remitted.

Cash paid during 1993, 1992 and 1991 for income taxes was $118.1, $157.5
and $105.5 million, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, the Company has U.S. federal and state and local
tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax loss carryforwards for certain
foreign subsidiaries, the tax effect of which is approximately $379.5
million. Many of these carryforwards are available for substantial
periods. The Company also has available tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $427.8 million, of which $115.0 million expire in 1994,
$97.4 million expire in 1995, and the remainder thereafter.

In 1992, the Company recorded in accordance with AICPA Opinion No. 11,
an extraordinary item of $65.0 million, or $.36 per fully diluted common
share, related to the tax benefit of book operating loss carryforwards.
Since these tax benefits were not previously recognized in the Company's
financial statements, accounting rules followed by the Company at that
time required that they be reported as an extraordinary item in the
results of operations in the period when they were realized.

In 1993 the Internal Revenue Service continued its audit of Sperry
Corporation for the years ended March 31, 1985 and 1986 and for
the short period ended September 16, 1986. The audit of Timeplex, Inc.
for the period July 1, 1984 to January 22, 1988 continued throughout the
year, and resulted in a tentative agreement which is expected to be
finalized in the first half of 1994. The Company is currently contesting
issues in connection with Sperry Corporation for the years ended March
31, 1980-1984, and for Convergent, Inc. for the years 1981-1988. In
management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made
for all years.

sale. Second-half results for 1991 did not include the Timeplex business,
which was sold as of June 30, 1991.

Total long-term debt maturities in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 are
$25.0, $72.2, $354.0, $436.0 and $211.0 million, respectively.

Cash paid during 1993, 1992 and 1991 for interest was $256.7, $324.7 and
$402.6 million, respectively.

The Company has a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a
syndicate of banks which expires on May 31, 1995. This agreement provides
for short-term borrowings and up to $100 million of letters of credit.
The terms of the agreement provide for a minimum net worth requirement
and interest coverage ratio, as defined therein. Additional terms include
a limitation on the payment of dividends, prepayment of debt and amount
of outstanding debt. The Company is required to have no borrowings
outstanding under the revolving credit agreement for thirty consecutive
days, or fifteen consecutive days during each half, of each calendar
year. During 1993, there were no borrowings under this agreement, and at
December 31, 1993, the Company was in compliance with all of its terms.

The Company pays commitment fees on the unused amount of the revolving
credit agreement; there are no compensating balance requirements.
Revolving credit borrowings, at the Company's option, are at the agent
bank's base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin
depending on the Company's debt rating on its outstanding senior
unsecured long-term debt securities. Commissions for letters of credit
also vary depending on such debt rating. In addition, international
subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements with banks in
accordance with local customary practice.


11. Leases

Rental expense, less income from subleases, for 1993, 1992 and 1991 was
$228.1, $253.0 and $259.3 million, respectively.

Minimum net rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases
outstanding at December 31, 1993, substantially all of which relate to
real properties, were as follows: 1994, $208.3 million; 1995, $180.7
million; 1996, $159.8 million; 1997, $124.9 million; 1998, $105.9
million; and thereafter, $624.3 million.


12. Maintenance and repairs

Maintenance and repairs for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were $66.1, $89.7 and
$93.9 million, respectively.

13. Business segment information

The Company operates primarily in one business segment - information
systems and related services and supplies. This segment represents more
than 90% of consolidated revenue, operating profit and identifiable
assets. The Company's operations are structured to achieve consolidated
objectives. As a result, significant interdependencies and overlaps exist
among the Company's operating units. Accordingly, the revenue, operating
profit and identifiable assets shown for each geographic area may not be
indicative of the amounts which would have been reported if the operating
units were independent of one another.

Sales and transfers between geographic areas are generally priced to
recover cost plus an appropriate mark-up for profit. Operating profit is
revenue less related costs and direct and allocated operating expenses,
excluding interest and the unallocated portion of corporate expenses.
Corporate assets are those assets maintained for general purposes,
principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, costs in
excess of net assets acquired, deferred taxes and corporate facilities.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of revenue. Revenue from
various agencies of the U.S. Government approximated $2,287, $2,424 and
$2,310 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

14. Employee plans

Retirement benefits
- -------------------

Defined benefit retirement income plans cover the majority of
domestic employees and certain employees in countries outside the
United States. In the U.S., the Company has retirement plans under
which funds are deposited with a trustee. Major subsidiaries outside the
United States provide for employee pensions in accordance with local
requirements and customary practices, and several maintain funded defined
benefit plans.

For plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
("ERISA"), the Company's funding policy is to fund in accordance with
ERISA funding standards. The various benefit formulas and the funding
methods used in the international plans are in accordance with local
requirements. Plan assets generally are invested in common stocks,
fixed-income securities, insurance contracts and real estate. At December
31, 1993, the assets of the Company's U.S. pension plans included
approximately seven million shares of the Company's common stock valued
at approximately $89 million.

As a result of restructuring actions, net curtailment gains (losses) of
$5.8, $18.2 and $(8.4) million have been recognized in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Other postretirements benefits
- ------------------------------
The Company provides certain health care benefits for U.S. employees who
retire or terminate after qualifying for such benefits. Most
international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and
the cost to the Company is not significant. The Company expects to fund its
share of such benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis.

As discussed in note 2, the Company adopted SFAS 106 effective January
1, 1993. Prior years' financial statements have not been restated. SFAS
106 requires the Company to change from the cash basis of accounting for
such benefits by requiring the accrual, during the years that the
employee renders services, of the estimated cost of providing such
benefits.

In November 1992, the Company announced changes to its postretirement
benefit plans, effective January 1, 1993, whereby the Company's current
subsidy will be phased out, ending as of January 1, 1996. Several
lawsuits have been brought by plan participants challenging the announced
changes to the plans, and the Company is defending them vigorously.

The net periodic postretirement benefit cost under SFAS 106 amounted to
$24.5 million in 1993. Amounts included in expense for 1992 and 1991,
under the previous cash basis of accounting, were $60.5 and $51.4
million, respectively.  The adoption of SFAS 106 had the effect of
decreasing 1993 postretirement benefit expense by $28.1 million, or $.07
per fully diluted common share.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the following
components:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accrued postretirement benefit obligation
recognized in the consolidated balance sheet                       $284.8
=========================================================================


As of December 31, 1993, $251.1 million of this liability was classified
as long-term and $33.7 million was classified as a current liability.

The assumed rate of return on plan assets was 10% and the weighted
average discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation was 7.35%. The assumed health care cost trend rate
used in measuring the expected cost of benefits covered by the plan
was 11% for 1994, gradually declining to 6% in 2005 and thereafter.
A one-percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 1993 by $34.2 million and increase the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement health care benefit cost by $2.6 million.

Stock plans
- -----------
Under plans approved by the stockholders, stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance units may be
granted to officers and other key employees.

15. Stockholders' equity

The Company has 360,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. In 1991,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company was amended to change the
par value of the common stock from $5 per share to $.01 per share. The
Company has 40,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, par value
$1 per share, issuable in series.

In 1993, the Company contributed seven million shares of its common
stock, valued at $89.2 million, to its U.S. pension plan.

The Company has authorization to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of
Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred
Stock"), 10 shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
("Series B Preferred Stock") and 20 shares of Series C Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock").

In 1992, the Company resumed the payment of dividends on preferred stock
which had been suspended in February 1991. At December 31, 1993,
cumulative preferred dividends of $107.8 million were in arrears, which
represented three and one-half quarterly dividends or $3.28 per share for
Series A Preferred Stock and $487,650.27 per share for Series B and C
Preferred Stock. If, on the date used to determine stockholders of record
for a meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, such
preferred stock dividends are in arrears in an amount equal to at least
six quarterly dividends, the number of members of the Board of Directors
will be increased by two as of the date of such stockholders' meeting and
the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to
vote for and elect such two additional directors.

Each share of Series A Preferred Stock (i) accrues quarterly cumulative
dividends of $3.75 per share per annum, (ii) has a liquidation preference
of $50.00 plus accrued and unpaid dividends, (iii) is convertible into
1.67 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to customary
anti-dilution adjustments, and (iv) is redeemable at the option of the
Company under certain circumstances and at varying prices.
<PAGE>
                                 -24-

Mitsui & Co., Ltd. ("Mitsui") owns $150 million of convertible
preferred stock, which includes 10 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and
20 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock and
the Series C Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder
into the Company's common stock at conversion prices of $20.00 and $21.00
per share, respectively, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
Both Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (i) have a
stated value of $5 million per share, (ii) accrue quarterly cumulative
dividends based on such stated value at 8 7/8% per annum until June 28,
1995 and 9 1/2% per annum from June 28, 1995 to June 28, 1997, (iii)
accrue dividends on the amount of any unpaid dividends, (iv) are
redeemable at the option of the Company at a premium which is determined
by reference to interest rates then in effect and the amount of time then
remaining to June 28, 1997, and (v) are entitled to receive upon
liquidation the stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In the
event that the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock have
not been previously redeemed by the Company or converted by the holder,
the Company will be required to convert both series into the Company's
common stock based on the then-current market price after June 28, 1996
(or after June 28, 1995 if so requested by Mitsui, the original holder
of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock), or earlier
under certain extraordinary circumstances, and conduct a managed sale
program of the common stock. To the extent that the proceeds received by
Mitsui from such managed sale program are less than the stated value of
the shares so converted, plus accrued and unpaid dividends and a present
valued premium amount if such conversion takes place before June 28,
1997, the Company has agreed to issue additional shares of capital stock
to Mitsui which will be sold in a manner approved by the Company until
Mitsui receives proceeds equal to the sum of such amounts. Shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock rank pari passu
with each other and with Series A Preferred Stock, and the holders of
Series A, B and C Preferred Stock have priority as to dividends over
holders of the Company's common stock and other series or classes of the
Company's stock which rank junior with regard to dividends. Each series
of Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock is non-voting except with
respect to certain matters relating to the rights and preferences of such
series. With respect to such matters, each of the Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock votes separately as a class. The
Series A Preferred Stock also votes as a class on these matters, but its
class includes the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock,
as well as any other series of preferred stock having equal rank as to
dividends and liquidation rights.

Each outstanding share of common stock has attached to it one preferred
share purchase right (a "Right"). Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase for $75, under certain circumstances, one
three-hundredth of a share of Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par
value $1 per share. The Rights become exercisable only if a person or
group acquires 20% or more of the Company's common stock, or announces
a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the common stock. If the
Company is acquired (or survives in a reverse merger transaction) or 50%
or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, each Right
will entitle its holder to purchase a number of the acquiring company's
common shares (or the Company's common shares) having a market value of
$150. The Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at one and
two-thirds cents per Right prior to the earlier of the expiration of the
Rights at March 17, 1996, or the time that a 20% position has been
acquired. Until the Rights become exercisable, they have no dilutive
effect on net income per common share.

At December 31, 1993, 147.3 million shares of unissued common stock of
the Company were reserved for the following: 57.2 million for convertible
preferred stock, 33.7 million for the 8 1/4% convertible subordinated
debentures and 56.4 million for stock options, stock purchase and savings
plans.

16. Financial instruments

The Company has a hedging policy designed to minimize its exposure to
foreign currency fluctuations. Forward exchange contracts and options are
entered into on a continuous basis for periods consistent with the
Company's exposures, and such instruments generally have maturities of
less than a year. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company had $903.8
and $1,743.4 million of forward foreign exchange contracts and options
outstanding, respectively.

The Company has entered into certain interest rate and currency swap
agreements which effectively convert variable-rate obligations into
fixed-rate obligations and foreign currency denominated debt into U.S.
dollar denominated debt. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company had
$346.4 and $475.7 million of notional value of such swaps outstanding,
respectively.

The Company's theoretical risk in the transactions referred to above is
the cost of replacing, at current market rates, these contracts in the
event of default by the counterparties; however, the Company believes
such risk to be remote.

Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of
temporary cash investments and receivables. Temporary investments are
placed with creditworthy financial institutions, primarily in
over-securitized treasury repurchase agreements, U.S. Government
securities, Euro-time deposits or commercial paper of major corporations.
Receivables are due from a large number of customers which are dispersed
worldwide across many industries. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the estimated fair value of the Company's
long-term debt was $2,273.2 and $2,504.3 million, respectively, and the
amount reported in the balance sheet was $2,050.0 and $2,455.9 million,
respectively. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the estimated fair value of
the Company's foreign currency contracts and options was $154.2 and
$114.4 million, respectively, and the amount reported in the balance
sheet was $11.4 and $20.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 1993 and
1992, the estimated fair value of the Company's interest rate and
currency swaps was a loss of $1.6 and $22.4 million, respectively, and
the amount reported in the balance sheet was zero.

The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt was based on
the quoted market prices for publicly traded issues. For debt which is
not publicly traded, the fair value was estimated based on current yields
to maturity for the Company's publicly traded debt with similar
maturities. The fair value of foreign currency contracts and options, and
interest rate and currency swaps were estimated by obtaining from brokers
market data for calculation components used to derive the value of
comparable contracts.

17. Litigation

In 1991, the Company and the U.S. Government concluded a final global
settlement of the "Ill Wind" investigation and certain other
investigative and litigation matters. In the settlement agreement, the
Company agreed to the following payments and concessions: (a) cash
payments, exclusive of interest, totaling $54 million over a period of
five years; (b) the forgoing of negotiated profits and fees, estimated
at $46 million, on the North Warning System radar contract (the contract
is scheduled to be completed in late 1994); and (c) contingency payments,
not to exceed a total of $90 million, to be made through 1997, subject
to annual caps, based upon the amount of asset sales and net income
reported by the Company during such period.

Item (a) above had previously been accrued by the Company. No accrual is
required by generally accepted accounting principles in respect of item
(b) since the agreement reached is in effect a lowering of the contract
revenue to be paid by the government. The payments for item (c) are
contingent upon future events; therefore no accrual is required until the
events occur. Through December 31, 1993, the Company has paid and
expensed $23.8 million of such contingency payments.

There are various lawsuits, claims and proceedings that have been brought
or asserted against the Company.  Although the ultimate results of these
lawsuits, claims and proceedings are not presently determinable,
management does not expect that these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
consolidated statement of income.

Report of Independent Auditors
- ------------------------------

To the Board of Directors of Unisys Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unisys
Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31,1993. These financial statements are the
responsibility of Unisys Corporation's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Unisys Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions and income taxes.
