                          PART I


ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

  Unisys Corporation ("Unisys") provides information
services, technology and software on a worldwide basis.

  Unisys operates primarily in one business segment:
information systems and related services and supplies.  This
segment represents more than 90% of consolidated revenue,
operating profit and identifiable assets. Financial information
concerning revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets
relevant to the segment is set forth in Note 11, "Business
segment information", of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements appearing in the Unisys 1994 Annual Report to
Stockholders, and such information is incorporated herein by
reference.

  Principal executive offices of Unisys are located at
Township Line and Union Meeting Roads, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
19424.

Principal Products and Services
- -------------------------------

  Principal information systems products and services 
include enterprise systems and servers, departmental servers 
and desktop systems, software, custom defense systems, information 
services and systems integration, and equipment maintenance.

  Enterprise systems and servers comprise a complete line of
small to large processors and related communications and
peripheral products, such as printers, storage devices and
document handling processors and equipment.  Departmental servers
and desktop systems include UNIX servers, workstations, personal
computers, and terminals.  Software consists of application and
systems software.  Custom defense systems include specialized
information processing systems, software, and services marketed
primarily to government defense agencies.  Information services
and systems integration includes systems integration, outsourcing
services, application development, information planning, and
education.  Equipment maintenance results from charges for
preventive maintenance, spare parts, and other repair activities.

UNIX is a registered trademark licensed in the United States and
other countries, exclusively by X/Open Company, Ltd.

                           -4-

  Information about revenue from classes of similar products
and services for the three years ended December 31, 1994,
appears under the heading "Revenue by similar classes of
products and services" appearing in the Unisys 1994 Annual Report
to Stockholders, and such information is incorporated herein
by reference.

  Unisys markets its products and services throughout most of
the world, primarily through a direct sales force.  In certain
foreign countries, Unisys products and services are marketed
primarily through distributors.  Unisys manufactures a
significant portion of its product lines.  Some products,
including certain personal and UNIX open system-based computers,
peripheral products, electronic components and subassemblies and
software products, are manufactured for Unisys to its design or
specifications by other business equipment manufacturers,
component manufacturers or software suppliers.

Raw Materials
- -------------

  Raw materials essential to the conduct of the business are
generally readily available at competitive prices in reasonable
proximity to those plants utilizing such materials.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
- --------------------------------

  Unisys owns many domestic and foreign patents relating to
the design and manufacture of its products, has granted licenses
under certain of its patents to others and is licensed under the
patents of others.  Unisys does not believe that its business is
materially dependent upon any single patent or license or
related group thereof.  Trademarks used on or in connection with
Unisys products are considered to be valuable assets of Unisys.

Backlog
- -------

  Unisys does not accumulate backlog information on a
company-wide basis.  Unisys believes that backlog is not a
meaningful indicator of future revenues due to the significant
portion of Unisys revenue received from software, information
services and systems integration, and equipment maintenance
(approximately 55% in 1994) and the shortening of the time
period from receipt of a purchase order to billing upon shipment
of equipment.  Unisys "lead time" for commercial equipment (the
time that customers are told that it will take from receipt of
an order to shipment) is between 13 and 150 days depending upon
the type of system and location of customer.  However, the
average is between 35 and 45 days.  Therefore, Unisys believes
that the dollar amount of backlog is not material to an
understanding of its business taken as a whole.

                           -5-

U.S. Government Business
- ------------------------

  Revenue and earnings connected with defense and other U.S.
governmental business are particularly subject to the size and
phasing of federal government programs in which Unisys may
participate.  During 1994, revenue from sales of custom systems
and services under Federal defense and space contracts and
subcontracts represented approximately 15% of total consolidated
revenue.  Sales of commercial products to the U.S. government
represented an additional 7% of total consolidated revenue.

Competition
- -----------

  Unisys business is affected by rapid change in technology
in the information systems and services field and aggressive
competition from many domestic and foreign companies, including
computer hardware manufacturers, software providers and
information services companies.  Unisys competes primarily on
the basis of product performance, service, technological
innovation and price.  Unisys believes that its continued
investment in engineering and research and development, coupled
with its marketing capabilities, will have a favorable impact on
its competitive position.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

  Unisys engineering and research and development costs were
$870.9 million in 1994, $934.7 million in 1993 and $980.7
million in 1992.  Excluding capitalized software and hardware
support, Unisys-sponsored research and development costs were
$483.4 million in 1994, $515.2 million in 1993 and $535.9
million in 1992.  Customer-sponsored research and development
costs were $197.2 million in 1994, $231.1 million in 1993, and
$243.3 million in 1992.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

  Capital expenditures, earnings and the competitive position
of Unisys have not been materially affected by compliance with
federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the
environment.  Capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities are not expected to be material in 1995 and 1996.

Employees
- ---------

  As of December 31, 1994, Unisys had approximately 46,300
employees.

Mr. William B. Patton, Jr.
P. O. Box 1222
Blue Bell, PA  19422

Dear Bill:

You are presently employed by Unisys Corporation (the "Company").  The purpose
of this letter is to set forth the agreement (the "Agreement") with you
concerning your relationship with the Company on and after January 1, 1995
(hereinafter the "Effective Date").  This Agreement supersedes and replaces all
prior understandings and agreements, whether written or verbal, between you and
the Company with respect to your employment with the Company, except for the
Letter Agreement from James A. Unruh dated December 20, 1993 and the related
Release effective January 1, 1994.  The provisions of this Agreement are as
follows:

     1.   Resignation.  You shall resign as an officer and employee of the
          Company as of December 31, 1994.

     2.   Consulting Services.  For a term commencing on the Effective Date and
          ending December 31, 1995, unless sooner terminated as provided in
          Section 9 (such period from the Effective Date through December 31,
          1995 or earlier termination being hereinafter referred to as the
          "Consulting Term"), you shall make yourself available to the Company
          to serve as a non-employee consultant to provide services to the
          Company at such times and places as are requested by the Company;
          provided that you shall not be required to perform more than ten (10)
          hours of consultant activities (including travel time) in any one day,
          nor more than one hundred (100) hours of consultant activities
          (including travel time) in any one calendar month.   Your activities
          as a non-employee consultant shall be directed by the President,
          Information Services and Systems Group ("ISSG"), or his designee.  The
          Company shall give you such notice as is practicable as to when
          consultant activities are requested.  You will use your best efforts
          to accommodate any request for consultant activity by the Company,
          notwithstanding any other commitments you may have.

     3.   Consulting Compensation.  The compensation for your consulting
          services shall be as follows:
<PAGE>
 
                                     - 2 -


          (a)  Consulting Fee.  You shall be paid a consulting fee at a rate
               equal to $17,500 per month during the Consulting Term.

          (b)  1994 Executive Variable Compensation ("EVC").  Notwithstanding
               your termination prior to the payment date, you shall be entitled
               to receive an  EVC award for the 1994 EVC award year in
               accordance with the terms of the EVC Plan and your EVC award
               letter dated April 22, 1994.

          (c)  Bonus Fee.  You are not entitled to an EVC award payout for the
               1995 EVC award year.  Unless the Consulting Term is terminated
               before December 31, 1995, you shall be entitled to receive a
               bonus fee payable in March, 1996, in an amount equal to the
               product of (i) the average percentage EVC award payout for
               eligible United States/Canada Division participants for the 1995
               EVC award year, times (ii) $410,000.

          (d)  Stock Options.  With respect to your outstanding stock options
               granted under the 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "1990
               Plan"), such stock options shall be exercisable in accordance
               with the terms of the 1990 Plan and any agreements pertaining to
               such stock options; provided, however, that:

               (i)  The portions of such stock options scheduled to vest on or
                    before April 30, 1995 shall be so exercisable; and

               (ii) You shall have the right to exercise your vested stock
                    options until December 31, 1999.

          (e)  Pension.  You are not entitled to a benefit under the Unisys
               Pension Plan and the Supplemental Employee Retirement Income
               Plan.  For purposes of calculating your benefit under the Unisys
               Elected Officer Pension Plan, your termination date shall be
               December 31, 1994, but an additional one year shall be counted as
               service and an additional amount of $410,000 plus any amounts
               paid to you under Sections 3(b) and 3(c) shall be counted as
               eligible compensation for 1995 for purposes of calculating your
               Final Average Compensation.

          (f)  Medical.  On and after the Effective Date, you shall be entitled
               to the same medical coverage under the same terms, including your
               payment of applicable premiums, as if you were a participant in
               the Unisys Post-Retirement and Extended Disability Medical Plan
               (the "PRM Plan").  Such coverage will be provided to you and your
               eligible dependents through the PRM Plan or through any other
               arrangement deemed appropriate by the Company.

               Company's umbrella liability insurance policy through July 31,
               1995 and the Company will pay up to an aggregate of $5,000 for
               financial counseling services and tax preparation services
               provided to you in 1995.  You will be entitled to executive
               outplacement consulting services similar to those services
               offered to similarly-situated executives, up to a maximum cost of
               $25,000 inclusive of office space.  You may utilize the services
               of the outplacement consultants retained by the Company or you
               may select your own outplacement consultant.

     4.   Additional Payment.  In consideration of your execution of the release
          described in Section 11 hereof and in consideration and settlement of
          any claim you may have for damages for wrongful termination, age
          discrimination or any other claims based on tort, you shall be paid
          $200,000, such amount being payable to you in four installments of
          $50,000 each, payable on February 15, 1995, May 1, 1995, September 1,
          1995 and December 31, 1995.  You acknowledge that the payments set
          forth above are not an admission on the part of the Company of any
          liability for any wrongdoing whatsoever.

     5.   Expenses.  The Company shall reimburse you for reasonable travel and
          associated expenses incurred in the performance of your consultant
          activities hereunder consistent with the Unisys Travel Policy provided
          that you have obtained advance approval for such travel and expenses
          from the President, ISSG, or his designee.

     6.   Taxes.  You shall be responsible for the payment of all applicable
          Federal, state and local taxes due with respect to the consulting fees

          4, including, but not limited to, Federal and state income taxes,
          Social Security tax, Unemployment Insurance taxes and any other taxes
          or fees as are required.  The remaining remuneration paid to you under
          Section 3 will be treated as wages as deemed appropriate by the
          Company and the Company will withhold applicable taxes accordingly.
          The Company will file all informational returns with the Internal
          Revenue Service and similar state and local taxing authorities
          regarding the remuneration paid to you hereunder.  However, the
          Company agrees that payments made under Section 4 hereof are not wages
          or compensation for services rendered and no IRS Form 1099 will be
          issued in respect thereof.

     7.   Relationship of Parties.  On and after the Effective Date, you shall
          be acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee, agent
          or representative of Unisys.

               the Unisys Code of Ethical Conduct and the Company's Policies and
               Procedures related thereto as if you were an employee of the
               Company.

     9.   Termination.

          (a)  This Agreement may be terminated at any time and for any reason
               by the Company.  Unless the Agreement is terminated for "cause",
               you shall be entitled to receive the compensation and benefits
               described in Sections 3(a)-(g) and Section 4.

          (b)  If the Agreement is terminated for "cause", all of the
               compensation and benefits described in Sections 3(a)-(g) and
               Section 4 shall immediately cease (provided that any amounts or
               benefits paid prior to the termination of the Agreement shall not
               be affected) and you shall be considered to have terminated your
               employment for all purposes as of December 31, 1994.  For
               purposes of this Agreement, "cause" shall mean (i) your refusal
               or failure to exercise your best efforts in the performance of
               your consulting duties and responsibilities under this Agreement
               or your refusal or failure to perform your consulting duties in
               accordance with the specific directions of the President, ISSG,
               or his designee, or (ii) a breach of any of your obligations
               described in Section 8.

          (c)  The Company will provide you with written notice of the facts
               constituting any breach of Section 9(b)(i).  The Company may
               thereafter terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9(b)(i)
               upon the occurrence of any further breach thereof without further
               notice.  If the Company believes that you have engaged in any
               conduct that would violate Section 8(a)(vi), the Company will
               give you written notice requesting that you immediately cease and
               desist from such conduct.  The Company may thereafter
<PAGE>
 
                                     - 6 -



               terminate this Agreement for a breach of Section 8(a)(vi) upon
               the occurrence of any further breach thereof without further
               notice.  No notice of a breach of this Agreement shall be
               required prior to the Company's termination of this Agreement
               except as expressly provided in this Section 9(c).

          (d)  In the event of your death or your inability to perform your
               duties and responsibilities under this Agreement as a result of
               your disability, the Consulting Term shall terminate for all
               purposes as of the date of such death or disability.

          (e)  If the Agreement is terminated for cause, as defined in Section
               9(b):

               (i)       all outstanding stock options shall expire;

               (ii)      your pension under the Elected Officer Pension Plan
                         shall be calculated, or recalculated, as applicable,
                         without regard to the additional year of service and
                         additional compensation described in Section 3(e);

               (iii)     any medical coverage provided through a Company-
                         sponsored arrangement shall be terminated, subject to
                         applicable law; and

               (iv)      your post-retirement life insurance coverage shall
                         terminate.

          (f)  In addition to any other remedies it may have, the Company shall
               be entitled to an injunction restraining you from doing or
               continuing to do any act in violation of Section 8, or requiring
               you to act in conformance with Section 8.

          (g)  You agree that a breach by you of any of the provisions of this
               Agreement will damage the Company in an amount which is difficult
               to determine and, accordingly, the Company may retain as
               liquidated damages and not as a penalty any amounts payable to
               you under this Agreement whether in the form of consulting fees,
               additional payments, or other benefits, including those described
               in Sections 3(a)-(g) hereof.

     10.  Other Benefits.  The rights granted to you under Section 3 are in
          addition to all other obligations of the Company to you as a
          terminated employee, and except as otherwise expressly provided in the
          Agreement, your rights and obligations to benefits from the Company
          shall be determined in accordance with the applicable benefit plans.
          Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, your
          termination date for all employment and benefit purposes shall be

     11.  Release.  In consideration of the Company's entering into this
          Agreement and as a condition to the Company's obligations hereunder,
          you agree to waive and release any and all claims against the Company
          and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates and their directors,
          officers and employees that you now have or may have in the future
          arising out of your employment or termination of employment with the
          Company, and you shall execute a release, in the form attached hereto,
          which release shall be incorporated and become a part of this
          Agreement.

     12.  Arbitration.  Any dispute or controversy arising under or in
          connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by
          arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The arbitration shall be
          conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
          Association except that the arbitrator shall be selected by mutual
          agreement of the parties.  If the parties cannot mutually agree upon
          an arbitrator, then each party shall select an arbitrator of their
          choice, and the two arbitrators so selected shall mutually select a
          third arbitrator.  Any arbitration award will be final and conclusive
          upon the parties, and a judgment enforcing such award may be entered
          in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The prevailing party in any
          such arbitration shall be entitled to recover from the other party the
          attorney's fees, costs and expenses incurred by them in such
          arbitration.

     13.  Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Any notice or other communication required or permitted pursuant

               discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is
               agreed to in writing.  No agreements or representations, oral or
               otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter

The Unisys Elected Officer Pension Plan (the "Plan") is amended, effective July
28, 1994, to read as follows:

I.   A new Section 2.20 is added to the Plan to read as follows:

     "2.20  "Change in Control" shall mean

          (a)  The acquisition, other than from the Company, by any individual,
          entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of
          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))
          of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
          under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either (i) the then
          outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding
          Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then
          outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote
          generally in the election of directors (the "Company Voting
          Securities"), provided, however, that any acquisition by (x) the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (or
          related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries or (y) any corporation with respect to which, following
          such acquisition, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding
          shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting
          power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation
          entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then
          beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially
          all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners,
          respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company
          Voting Securities immediately prior to such acquisition in
          substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately
          prior to such acquisition, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and
          Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, shall not constitute a
          Change in Control; or

          (b)  Individuals who, as of July 28, 1994 constitute the Board (the
          "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least two-
          thirds of the Board, provided that any individual becoming a director
          subsequent to July 28, 1994 whose election or nomination for election
          by the Company, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the
          directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as
          though such individual were a member of the Incumbent board, but
          excluding, for this purpose, any such
<PAGE>
 
          individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an
          actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of
          members of the Board; or

          (c)  Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a reorganization,
          merger or consolidation (a "Business Combination"), in each case, with
          respect to which all or substantially all of the individuals and
          entities who were the respective beneficial owners of the Outstanding
          Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities immediately prior
          to such Business Combination do not, following such Business
          Combination, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60%
          of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the
          combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
          entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case
          may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination in
          substantially the same proportion as their ownership immediately prior
          to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock
          and Company Voting Securities, as the case may be; or

          (d)  (i) A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (ii)
          the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
          assets of the Company other than to a corporation with respect to
          which, following such sale or disposition, more than 60% of,
          respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the
          combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
          entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then owned
          beneficially, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of
          the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners,
          respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company
          Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or disposition in
          substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the
          Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities, as the
          case may be, immediately prior to such sale or disposition."

II.  Section 3.01(c) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

          "(c)  A former Officer who was eligible under paragraph (a) above and
          continues in active employment for more than twelve months after
          ceasing to be an Officer shall be eligible, upon application, to
          receive a vested annual retirement benefit calculated in accordance
          with Sections 5.01(a), 5.03, 5.06 and 5.07, utilizing as an offset the
          amount of benefits payable under the Company Plan and the Supplemental
          Plan calculated as if the 
<PAGE>
 
          Participant had elected a single life annuity form of benefit under
          the Company Plan, and such former Officer shall not be eligible for
          the survivor benefits described in Section 5.04. This Section 3.01(c)
          shall not apply after the occurrence of a Change in Control with
          respect to any individual who was an Officer on the date of the Change
          in Control."

III. A new Section 3.01(d) is added to read as follows:

          "(d)  Notwithstanding the participation requirements described in
          Section 3.01(a), each Employee who is an Officer on the date of the
          Change in Control and who, as of the date of the Change in Control,
          has completed 5 or more years of Credited Service shall be eligible to
          participate in this Plan."

IV.  Section 5.01(a) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

          "(a)  Subject to the adjustments set forth in Sections 5.02 and 5.03,
          a Participant shall receive an annual retirement benefit payable at
          Normal Retirement Date equal to:

          (1)  40% of the Participant's Final Average Compensation for the
               Participant's first 10 years of Credited Service, or, for a
               Participant who has less than 10 years of Credited Service, one-
               third of one percent of the Participant's Final Average
               Compensation for each month of Credited Service; plus

          (2)  1% of the Participant's Final Average Compensation for each year
               of Credited Service in excess of 10 (but not in excess of 30)
               including proportional credit for a fraction of a year; minus

          (3)  50% of the Participant's Primary Social Security Benefit.

                    Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                 Financial Condition and Results of Operations
                ----------------------------------------------

Overview
- --------

In 1994, the Company reported net income of $100.5 million compared to net
income of $565.4 million in 1993.  The 1994 results include a special pretax
charge of $186.2 million ($133.1 million after tax).  Excluding the effects of
the special charge, extraordinary items and accounting changes, fully diluted
earnings per common share in 1994 were $.71 compared to $1.48 a year ago.

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a special pretax charge of
$186.2 million ($133.1 million after tax), or $.78 per fully diluted common
share.  The purpose of the charge was to reduce the Company's overall cost
structure.  The charge principally relates to a work force reduction of
approximately 4,600 people.  As a result of this action, the Company expects to
create annual savings estimated at more than $200 million.  See Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 1995, the Company will focus on achieving profitable revenue growth and
further reducing its cost structure.  The Company expects that, in the near
term, profit pressures will continue before the favorable effects of the
restructuring are realized.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Revenue for 1994 was $7.4 billion, down 4% from 1993 revenue of $7.7 billion.
The largest decline (18%) occurred in the Government Systems business, which
continues to be impacted by a decline in government spending and increased
competition.  Sales declined 13% to $4.1 billion in 1994 from $4.7 billion in
1993, due to decreases in sales of enterprise systems and servers (14%),
software (9%), and custom defense systems (21%).  Services revenue increased 24%
to $2.0 billion in 1994 from $1.6 billion in 1993 as the Company continued to
implement its strategy to aggressively grow its services and systems integration
business.  This business is now the Company's largest single revenue stream with
27% of total revenue in 1994 compared to 21% in 1993 and 16% in 1992.  Equipment
maintenance revenue declined 7% to $1.3 billion in 1994 from $1.4 billion in
1993, due principally to a decline in equipment sales and improved product
reliability.

Revenue for 1993 was $7.7 billion, down 8% from 1992 revenue of $8.4 billion.
Sales declined 13% to $4.7 billion in 1993 from $5.4 billion in 1992, due to
decreases in sales of enterprise systems and servers, departmental servers and
desktop systems, and custom defense systems, offset in part by an increase in
software revenue.  Services revenue increased 19% to $1.6 billion in 1993 from
$1.3 billion in 1992.  Equipment maintenance revenue declined 14% to $1.4
billion in 1993 from $1.7 billion in 1992, due principally to a decline in
equipment sales and improved product reliability.

Revenue from international operations in 1994 was $3.8 billion, up 3% from 1993,
due principally to an increase in revenue in Japan.  Revenue from the remainder
of the Pacific Asia area and from Europe was approximately the same as last
year.  The effect of foreign currency translation on 1994 revenue was not
material.  Revenue from U.S. operations in 1994 was $3.6 billion, down 11% from
1993.  This decline was caused by a 20% reduction in U.S. revenue from the
Government Systems business.  Revenue from operations outside the U.S. in 1993
was $3.7 billion, down 14% from 1992.  Approximately 35% of this revenue 


                                       1
<PAGE>
 
decline was due to the negative impact of currency translation. Revenue from
U.S. operations in both 1993 and 1992 was $4.1 billion.

In 1994, the Company received approximately 16% of its revenue from custom
defense systems, down from 20% in both 1993 and 1992.  A substantial portion of
this revenue was derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Department of
Defense and the Canadian Department of National Defence.  Any future declines in
defense industry spending or increased competition could affect the Company's
ability to obtain new defense contracts, and no assurance can be given that
current, in-process, multiple-year contracts will not be downsized or
discontinued.

Total gross profit margin decreased to 33% in 1994 (35% excluding the 1994
special charge) from 37% in 1993.  Sales gross profit margin in 1994 was 39%
(both before and after the charge) compared to 41% in 1993; services gross
profit margin for 1994 was 21% (22% excluding the charge) compared to 23% in
1993; and equipment maintenance gross profit margin for 1994 was 35% (40%
excluding the charge) compared to 43% in 1993.  Total gross profit margin is
expected to continue to be pressured by competitive pricing and the continuing
shift to lower-margin products and services.  In addition, business risks
associated with services contracts, particularly large, multi-year, fixed-price
systems integration contracts, may from time to time create volatility in
margins.

In 1992, total gross profit margin was 36%, sales gross profit margin was 38%,
services gross profit margin was 21%, and equipment maintenance gross profit
margin was 42%.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1994 were $1.7 billion, an
increase of 1% from $1.6 billion in 1993.  Exclusive of the special charge,
selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.6 billion in 1994, a slight
decline from 1993.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.8
billion in 1992.  Total employment at December 31, 1994 was approximately 46,300
compared to approximately 49,000 at December 31, 1993 and 54,300 at December 31,
1992.

Research and development expenses in 1994 were $483.4 million compared to $515.2
million in 1993, a decline of 6%.  Exclusive of the special charge, research and
development expenses were $455.5 million in 1994, a decline of 12% from 1993.
Research and development expenses in 1993 were $515.2 million compared to $535.9
million in 1992.  The reduction in 1994 principally reflects the Company's move
to common hardware platforms and technologies.  The declines are also consistent
with the continuing shift of revenue to services business which requires less
research and development.

As a result of the above, operating income was $306.0 million in 1994 (4.1% of
revenue) compared to $734.1 million in 1993 (9.5% of revenue) and $720.7 million
in 1992 (8.6% of revenue).  Exclusive of the special charge, operating income in
1994 was $491.2 million, or 6.6% of revenue.

Interest expense was $203.7 million in 1994, down from $241.7 million in 1993,
reflecting principally lower average debt levels.  Interest expense in 1993 was
down from $340.6 million in 1992, reflecting both lower average debt levels and
lower average interest rates.

Other income in 1994 was $50.9 million compared to $11.0 million in 1993 and
$55.5 million in 1992.  The increase in other income in 1994 compared to 1993
was due principally to favorable foreign currency translation and lower
contingency expenses related to "Ill Wind" settlement payments. Included in 1994
and 1993 are charges of $.7 million and $20.0 million, respectively, 


                                       2
<PAGE>
 
related to the "Ill Wind" settlement. This settlement requires the Company to
make contingency payments based on proceeds from asset sales and on net income.
Since net income after preferred dividends for 1994 was a loss, no contingency
payments were due on this aspect of the settlement. The $.7 million represents
amounts due on proceeds from asset sales. The maximum contingent amount payable
in 1995 under this settlement agreement is $40.0 million.

It is the Company's policy to minimize its exposure to foreign currency
fluctuations.  On a net basis, and after taking into account the cost of the
Company's hedging program, foreign currency effects had a minimal effect on
pretax results in each of the past three years.

Income before income taxes for 1994 was $153.2 million ($339.4 million exclusive
of the special charge).  Income before income taxes in 1993 and 1992 was $503.4
million and $435.6 million, respectively.

Estimated income taxes were $45.0 million in 1994 ($98.1 million before the
special charge) compared with $141.8 million in 1993 and $139.4 million in 1992.
Included in 1993 is a net benefit of $19.2 million, or $.09 per fully diluted
common share, relating to a U.S. tax law change enacted in August of 1993.  This
law increased the top corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January
1, 1993.  Since the Company had net deferred tax assets in the U.S., the effect
of the tax rate change was to increase these tax assets with a corresponding
reduction in provision for taxes.  The 1995 worldwide effective tax rate is
expected to be approximately 34%.

Net income for 1994 was $100.5 million compared to $565.4 million in 1993 and
$361.2 million in 1992.  Income before the special charge, extraordinary items,
and changes in accounting principles was $241.3 million in 1994, $361.6 million
in 1993 and $296.2 million in 1992.

Excluding the effects of the special charge, extraordinary items, and accounting
changes, fully diluted earnings per common share in 1994 were $.71 compared to
$1.48 in 1993 and $1.04 in 1992.

Accounting Changes and Extraordinary Items
- ------------------------------------------

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions."  SFAS
112 establishes financial accounting standards for employers that provide
benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
The effect of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position,
consolidated statement of income, and liquidity was immaterial.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company also adopted SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" and SFAS 119, "Disclosure
about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments."
SFAS 115 establishes financial accounting standards for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in
debt securities.  SFAS 119 establishes disclosure requirements about derivative
financial instruments.

In 1994, the Company recorded an extraordinary charge for repurchases of debt of
$7.7 million, net of $5.1 million of income tax benefits, or $.04 per fully
diluted common share.


                                       3
<PAGE>
 
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  The adoption of SFAS 106 decreased net income for 1993 by $194.8
million, net of $124.5 million of income tax benefits, or $.79 per fully diluted
common share, and the adoption of SFAS 109 increased net income for 1993 by
$425.0 million, or $1.73 per fully diluted common share.  See Notes 4 and 12 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 1994, the Company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred
tax liabilities of $1,155 million.  For the reasons cited below, management
believes that it is more likely than not that $828 million of such assets will
be realized, therefore resulting in a valuation allowance of $327 million.  In
assessing the likelihood of realization of this asset, the Company has
considered various factors including its forecast of future taxable income and
available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize deferred
tax assets.

The principal basis used to assess the likelihood of realization was the
Company's forecast of future taxable income which was adjusted by applying
probability factors to the achievement of this forecast.  Forecasted taxable
income is expected to arise from ordinary and recurring operations and to be
sufficient to realize the entire amount of net deferred tax assets.
Approximately $2.4 billion of future taxable income (predominantly U.S.) is
needed to realize all of the net deferred tax assets.

The Company's net deferred tax assets include substantial amounts of net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  The major portion of such
carryforwards expire in 1998 and beyond.  In addition, substantial amounts of
foreign net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period.  Failure to
achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the
net deferred tax assets.  In recent years, the information management business
has undergone dramatic changes and there can be no assurance that in the future
there could not be increased competition or other factors which may result in a
decline in sales or margins, loss of market share, or technological
obsolescence.  The Company will evaluate quarterly the realizability of its net
deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the
amount of such allowance, if necessary.

In 1993, the Company settled certain lawsuits in connection with its sale of the
Sperry Aerospace Group in December 1986 to Honeywell, Inc.  The Aerospace Group
was part of Sperry Corporation, which was acquired by the Company in September
1986 in the largest acquisition at the time in the computer industry.  The
lawsuits alleged violations of securities laws and fraudulent and negligent
misrepresentations of interim financial statements of the Sperry Aerospace Group
as of and for the six months ended September 30, 1986 prepared in connection
with the sale.  The sale of the Aerospace Group as a non-strategic business was
part of the financing strategy for the acquisition of Sperry Corporation and was
carried out very shortly after the completion of this acquisition.  The
Aerospace Group operations were never reported in the financial results of the
Company.  The settlement of litigation arising out of the sale, therefore, was
unrelated to the ordinary activities of the Company.  Accordingly, the Company
reported this litigation settlement as an extraordinary charge of $26.4 million,
net of $16.8 million of income tax benefits, or $.11 per fully diluted common
share.

In 1992, the Company recorded, in accordance with AICPA Opinion No. 11, an
extraordinary item of $65.0 million, or $.36 per fully diluted common share,
related to the tax benefit of book operating loss carryforwards.  Since these
tax benefits were not previously recognized in the Company's financial
statements, accounting rules followed by the Company at that time required 


                                       4

that they be reported as an extraordinary item in the results of operations in
the period when they were realized.

Financial Condition
- -------------------

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $648.8, $1,019.7, and
$1,176.5 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  Investments in
properties and rental equipment were $225.7, $196.8, and $251.7 million in 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively.  Proceeds from sales of properties were $24.8,
$26.5, and $90.3 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

During 1994, the Company repurchased and redeemed $112.5 million of debt.  The
Company intends, from time to time, to continue to redeem or repurchase its
securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending
upon availability, market conditions, and other factors.

In 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a
registration statement filed by the Company covering $500 million of debt or
equity securities.  The registration statement enables the Company to be
prepared for future market opportunities.  Proceeds from future offerings of
these securities are anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes,
including reduction or refinancing of debt.

The Company has a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of
banks, which expires on May 31, 1995.  This agreement provides for short-term
borrowings and up to $100 million of letters of credit.  During 1994, there were
no borrowings under this agreement.

At December 31, 1994, total debt was $1.9 billion, a decline of $111.8 million
from December 31, 1993 principally due to the repurchases and redemptions
described above.  Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December
31, 1994 were $884.6 million compared to $950.5 million at December 31, 1993.
During 1994, debt net of cash and marketable securities decreased $45.9 million
to $1.1 billion.  As a percent of total capital, debt net of cash and marketable
securities was 29% at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

Dividends paid on preferred stock amounted to $228.0 million in 1994 compared to
$183.7 million in 1993 and $46.1 million in 1992.  The current-year amount
includes full payment for all preferred dividend arrearages.

Stockholders' equity decreased $91.0 million during 1994, principally reflecting
net income of $100.5 million and favorable currency translation adjustments of
$20.0 million offset by preferred dividends of $214.6 million.

The Company expects to settle certain open tax years with the Internal Revenue
Service in late 1995 or early 1996.  It is expected that such settlements will
result in cash payments of approximately $130 million (including interest).
These payments will not affect earnings since provision for these taxes has been
made in prior years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Unisys Corporation

1.  Summary of significant accounting policies

Principles of consolidation
- ---------------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned
subsidiaries.  Investments in companies representing ownership interests of 20%
to 50% are accounted for by the equity method.

Cash equivalents
- ----------------

All short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are
classified as cash equivalents.

Marketable securities
- ---------------------

Marketable securities, consisting principally of unsecured corporate
obligations, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates
market.

Inventories
- -----------

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined
principally on the first-in, first-out method.

Properties, rental equipment and depreciation
- ---------------------------------------------

Properties and rental equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over the
estimated lives of such assets using the straight-line method.  Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the asset lives or the terms of
the respective leases.  The principal rates used are summarized below by
classification of properties:

<TABLE>

                            Rate per Year (%)
- ---------------------------------------------
<S>                                 <C>
Buildings                                 2-5
Machinery and equipment                  5-25
Tools and test equipment            10-33 1/3
Rental equipment                           25
- ---------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Revenue recognition
- -------------------

Sales revenue is generally recorded upon shipment of product in the case of
sales contracts, upon shipment of the program in the case of software, and upon
installation in the case of sales-type leases.  Revenue from services and
equipment maintenance is recorded as earned over the lives of the respective
contracts.

Revenue under cost-type contracts is recognized when costs are incurred, and
under fixed-price contracts when products or services are accepted and 


                                      10
<PAGE>
 
billings can be made. General and administrative expenses are charged to income
as incurred. Cost of revenue under long-term contracts is charged based on
current estimated total costs. When estimates indicate a loss under a contract,
cost of revenue is charged with a provision for such loss.

Income taxes
- ------------

Income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates applicable to
such income.  Deferred taxes have not been provided on the cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since such amounts are expected
to be reinvested indefinitely.

Earnings per common share
- -------------------------

In 1994, the computation of both primary and fully diluted earnings per share
was based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares.  The
inclusion of additional shares assuming the exercise of stock options,
conversion of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, or conversion of
the 8 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due August 1, 2000 would have been
antidilutive.  In 1993 and 1992, the computation of primary earnings per share
was based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and
additional shares assuming the exercise of stock options, and the computation of
fully diluted earnings per share assumed the conversion of the 8 1/4%
convertible subordinated notes due August 1, 2000.  The computation of fully
diluted earnings per share for 1993 further assumed conversion of Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.  The inclusion of additional shares
assuming the conversion of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock would
have been antidilutive in 1992.  The shares used in the computations for the
three years ended December 31, 1994 were as follows (in thousands):

Fully diluted    170,752  246,550  181,813
- ------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Software capitalization
- -----------------------

The cost of development of computer software to be sold or leased is capitalized
and amortized to cost of sales over the estimated revenue-producing lives of the
products, but not in excess of three years following product release.
Unamortized marketable software costs (which are included in other assets) at
December 31, 1994 and 1993 were $265.3 and $294.5 million, respectively.


                                      11
<PAGE>
 
Cost in excess of net assets acquired
- -------------------------------------

Cost in excess of net assets acquired represents the excess of cost over fair
value of the net assets of Sperry Corporation and Convergent, Inc., which is
being amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years and 12 years,
respectively.  Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was $566.1
and $524.7 million, respectively.

The carrying value of cost in excess of net assets acquired is reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not
be recoverable.  If such an event occured, the Company would prepare projections
of future results of operations for the remaining amortization period.  If such
projections indicated that the cost in excess of net assets acquired would not
be recoverable, the Company's carrying value of such asset would be reduced by
the estimated excess of such value over projected income.

Translation of foreign currency
- -------------------------------

The local currency is the functional currency for most of the Company's
international subsidiaries and, as such, assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.  Income and expense items are
translated at average exchange rates during the year.  Translation adjustments
resulting from changes in exchange rates are reported in a separate component of
stockholders' equity.  Exchange gains and losses on certain forward exchange
contracts designated as hedges of international net investments and exchange
gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are
also reported in the separate component of stockholders' equity.

For those international subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies,
the U.S. dollar is the functional currency and, as such, nonmonetary assets and
liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates and monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at current exchange rates.  Exchange gains and losses
arising from translation are included in other income.

The Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and options which have
been designated as hedges of certain transactional exposures.  Gains and losses
on these instruments are deferred and are recognized in income together with the
transaction being hedged.

2.  1994 special charge

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $186.2
million, $133.1 million after tax, or $.78 per fully diluted common share.  The
charge was related to involuntary employee termination benefits including
severance, notice pay, medical and other benefits for approximately 4,600 people
and was taken to reduce the Company's cost structure.  Such costs were accrued
and charged to expense in accordance with a management plan which was approved
and announced in the fourth quarter of 1994.  Actual costs incurred are charged
to the accrued liability when the actions are taken.

The 1994 pretax charge of $186.2 million was recorded in the statement of income
as follows: cost of sales, $30.3 million; cost of services, $17.5 million; cost
of equipment maintenance, $61.8 million; selling, general and administrative
expenses, $47.7 million; research and development expenses, $27.9 million; and
other income, net, $1.0 million.

Cash expenditures during 1994 relating to the current actions were $6.3 million
for 825 terminations, and are expected to be approximately $150 


                                      12
<PAGE>
 
million in 1995. The remainder, which relates primarily to foreign operations,
is expected to be expended in 1996.

3.  Accounting changes and extraordinary items

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions."  SFAS
112 establishes financial accounting standards for employers that provide
benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
The effect of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position,
consolidated statement of income, and liquidity was immaterial.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company also adopted SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" and SFAS 119, "Disclosure
about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments."
SFAS 115 establishes financial accounting standards for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in
debt securities.  SFAS 119 establishes disclosure requirements about derivative
financial instruments.

In 1994, the Company recorded an extraordinary charge for the repurchases of
debt of $7.7 million, net of $5.1 million of income tax benefits, or $.04 per
fully diluted common share.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  The adoption of SFAS 106 decreased net income $194.8 million,
net of $124.5 million of income tax benefits, or $.79 per fully diluted common
share, and the adoption of SFAS 109 increased net income by $425.0 million, or
$1.73 per fully diluted common share.  For further discussion of SFAS 106 and
109, see notes 12 and 4, respectively.

In 1993, the Company settled certain lawsuits in connection with its sale of the
Sperry Aerospace Group in December 1986 to Honeywell, Inc.  The Aerospace Group
was part of Sperry Corporation, which was acquired by the Company in September
1986 in the largest acquisition at the time in the computer industry.  The
lawsuits alleged violations of securities laws and fraudulent and negligent
misrepresentations of interim financial statements of the Sperry Aerospace Group
as of and for the six months ended September 30, 1986 prepared in connection
with the sale.  The sale of the Aerospace Group as a non-strategic business was
part of the financing strategy for the acquisition of Sperry Corporation and was
carried out very shortly after the completion of this acquisition.  The
Aerospace Group operations were never reported in the financial results of the
Company.  The settlement of litigation arising out of the sale, therefore, was
unrelated to the ordinary activities of the Company.  Accordingly, the Company
reported this litigation settlement as an extraordinary charge of $26.4 million,
net of $16.8 million of income tax benefits, or $.11 per fully diluted common
share.

In 1992, the Company recorded an extraordinary item of $65.0 million, or $.36
per fully diluted common share, related to the tax benefit of book operating
loss carryforwards.  See note 4.

The Company adopted SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1993.  Prior years' financial
statements have not been restated.  Under the provisions of SFAS 109, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates and reflect
the effect of "temporary differences" between the recorded amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of such assets
and liabilities.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to
significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 1994
and 1993 were as follows:

SFAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance
if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized.  During 1994, the net decrease in the valuation allowance
was $23.3 million.

Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, for which no U.S.
income or foreign withholding taxes have been recorded, approximated $600
million at December 31, 1994.  Such earnings are expected to be reinvested
indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.  The additional
taxes payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if remitted, would be
substantially offset by U.S. tax credits for foreign taxes already paid.  While
there are no specific plans to distribute the undistributed earnings in the
immediate future, where economically appropriate to do so, such earnings may be
remitted.

Cash paid during 1994, 1993, and 1992 for income taxes was $87.6, $118.1, and
$157.5 million, respectively.

At December 31, 1994, the Company has U.S. federal and state and local tax loss
carryforwards and foreign tax loss carryforwards for certain foreign
subsidiaries, the tax effect of which is approximately $470.7 million.  These
carryforwards will expire as follows (in millions): 1995, $31.5; 1996, $16.7;


                                      15
<PAGE>
 
1997, $11.5; 1998, $16.9; 1999, $35.7; and $358.4 thereafter.  The Company also
has available tax credit carryforwards of approximately $368.6 million, which
will expire as follows (in millions): 1995, $96.6; 1996, $2.6; 1997, $2.1; 1998,
$114.6; 1999, $94.4; and $58.3 thereafter.

In 1992, the Company recorded, in accordance with AICPA Opinion No. 11, an
extraordinary item of $65.0 million, or $.36 per fully diluted common share,
related to the tax benefit of book operating loss carryforwards.  Since these
tax benefits were not previously recognized in the Company's financial
statements, accounting rules followed by the Company at that time required that
they be reported as an extraordinary item in the results of operations in the
period when they were realized.

In 1994, the Internal Revenue Service continued its audit of Sperry Corporation
for the years ended March 31, 1985 and 1986 and for the short period ended
September 16, 1986.  The audit of Timeplex, Inc. for the period July 1, 1984 to
January 22, 1988 was completed in 1994, with agreements reached on all
outstanding issues.  The Company is currently contesting issues in connection
with Sperry Corporation for the years ended March 31, 1980-1984, and for
Convergent, Inc. for the years 1981-1988.  In management's opinion, adequate
provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.

Total long-term debt maturities in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 are $71.2,
$342.3, $427.8, $208.4, and $341.5 million, respectively.

Cash paid during 1994, 1993, and 1992 for interest was $208.9, $256.7, and
$324.7 million, respectively.

The Company has a $300 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of
banks which expires on May 31, 1995.  This agreement provides for short-term
borrowings and up to $100 million of letters of credit.  The terms of the
agreement, which were revised to adjust for the 1994 special charge, provide for
a minimum net worth requirement and interest coverage ratio, as defined therein.
Additional terms include a limitation on the payment of dividends, prepayment of
debt, and amount of outstanding debt.  The Company is required to have no
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement for thirty
consecutive days, or fifteen consecutive days during each half, of each calendar
year.  During 1994, there were no borrowings under this agreement, and at
December 31, 1994, the Company was in compliance with all of its terms.

The Company pays commitment fees on the unused amount of the revolving credit
agreement; there are no compensating balance requirements.  Revolving credit
borrowings, at the Company's option, are at the agent bank's base rate or the
London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin depending on the Company's debt
rating on its outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt securities.
Commissions for letters of credit also vary depending on such debt rating.  In
addition, international subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements
with banks in accordance with local customary practice.

10  Leases

Rental expense, less income from subleases, for 1994, 1993, and 1992 was $210.2,
$228.1, and $253.0 million, respectively.

Minimum net rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases outstanding
at December 31, 1994, substantially all of which relate to real properties, were
as follows: 1995, $186.6 million; 1996, $164.4 million; 1997, $135.3 million;
1998, $107.9 million; 1999, $89.0 million; and thereafter, $546.1 million.

11  Business segment information

The Company operates primarily in one business segment-information systems and
related services and supplies.  This segment represents more than 90% of
consolidated revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets.  The Company's
operations are structured to achieve consolidated objectives.  As a result,
significant interdependencies and overlaps exist among the Company's operating
units.  Accordingly, the revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets shown
for each geographic area may not be indicative of the amounts which would have
been reported if the operating units were independent of one another.

Sales and transfers between geographic areas are generally priced to recover
cost plus an appropriate mark-up for profit.  Operating profit is revenue less
related costs and direct and allocated operating expenses, excluding interest
and the unallocated portion of corporate expenses.  Corporate assets are those
assets maintained for general purposes, principally cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, costs in excess of net assets acquired, prepaid pension
assets, deferred taxes, investments at equity, and corporate facilities.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of revenue.  Revenue from various
agencies of the U.S. Government approximated $1,628, $2,287, and $2,424 million
in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

12  Employee plans

Retirement benefits
- -------------------

Defined benefit retirement income plans cover the majority of domestic employees
and certain employees in countries outside the United States.  In the U.S., the
Company has retirement plans under which funds are deposited with a trustee.
Major subsidiaries outside the United States provide for employee pensions in
accordance with local requirements and customary practices, and several maintain
funded defined benefit plans.

For plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), the
Company's funding policy is to fund in accordance with ERISA funding standards.
The various benefit formulas and the funding methods used in the international
plans are in accordance with local requirements.  Plan assets generally are
invested in common stocks, fixed-income securities, insurance contracts, and
real estate.  At December 31, 1994, the assets of the Company's U.S. pension
plans included approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's common stock
valued at approximately $19 million.

Net curtailment gains of $11.3, $5.8, and $18.2 million have been recognized in
1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Other postretirement benefits
- -----------------------------

The Company provides certain health care benefits for U.S. employees who retired
or terminated after qualifying for such benefits.  Most international employees
are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not
significant.  The Company expects to fund its share of such benefit costs
principally on a pay-as-you-go basis.

The Company adopted SFAS 106 effective January 1, 1993.  Prior years' financial
statements have not been restated.  SFAS 106 required the Company to change from
the cash basis of accounting for such benefits by requiring the accrual, during
the years that the employee renders services, of the estimated cost of providing
such benefits.

In November 1992, the Company announced changes to its postretirement benefit
plans, effective January 1, 1993, whereby the Company's current subsidy will be
phased out, ending as of January 1, 1996.  Several lawsuits have been brought by
plan participants challenging the announced changes to the plans, and the
Company is defending them vigorously.  In 1994, several of these lawsuits were
resolved which resulted in the Company recognizing income of $13.8 million ($8.0
million amortization of prior service benefit and $5.8 million settlement).

Amounts included in expense for 1992, under the previous cash basis of
accounting, was $60.5 million.  The adoption of SFAS 106 had the effect of
decreasing 1993 postretirement benefit expense by $28.1 million, or $.07 per
fully diluted common share.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 and 1993 includes the
following components:

</TABLE>

As of December 31, 1994, $225.3 million of this liability was classified as
long-term and $28.7 million was classified as a current liability.

The assumed rate of return on plan assets was 8% and 10% in 1994 and 1993,
respectively, and the weighted average discount rate used to measure the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.75% at December 31, 1994 and
7.35% at December 31, 1993.  The assumed health care cost trend rate used in
measuring the expected cost of benefits covered by the plan was 11% for 1995,
gradually declining to 6.5% in 2004 and thereafter.  A one-percentage point
increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1994 by $13.9
million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components
of net periodic postretirement health care benefit cost by $2.4 million.

13  Stockholders' equity

The Company has 360,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share.  The Company has 40,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, par
value $1 per share, issuable in series.

In 1993, the Company contributed seven million shares of its common stock,
valued at $89.2 million, to its U.S. pension plan.

The Company has authorization to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"), 10 shares
of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock")
and 20 shares of Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C
Preferred Stock").

In 1992, the Company resumed the payment of dividends on preferred stock, which
had been suspended in February 1991.  During 1994, all cumulative preferred
dividend arrearages were paid.

Each share of Series A Preferred Stock (i) accrues quarterly cumulative
dividends of $3.75 per share per annum, (ii) has a liquidation preference of
$50.00 plus accrued and unpaid dividends, (iii) is convertible into 1.67 shares
of the Company's common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments,
and (iv) is redeemable at the option of the Company under certain circumstances
and at varying prices.  If, on the date used to determine stockholders of record
for a meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, preferred
stock dividends are in arrears in an amount equal to at least six quarterly
dividends, the number of members of the Board of Directors will be increased by
two as of the date of such stockholders' meeting and the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote for and elect such two
additional directors.

Mitsui & Co., Ltd. ("Mitsui") owns $150 million of convertible preferred stock,
which includes 10 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and 20 shares of Series C
Preferred Stock.  The Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock
are convertible at the option of the holder into the Company's common stock at
conversion prices of $20.00 and $21.00 per share, respectively, subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments. Both Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock (i) have a stated value of $5 million per share, (ii) accrue
quarterly cumulative dividends based on such stated value at 8 7/8% per annum
until June 28, 1995 and 9 1/2% per annum from June 28, 1995 to June 28, 1997,
(iii) accrue dividends on the amount of any unpaid dividends, (iv) are
redeemable at the option of the Company at a premium which is determined by
reference to interest rates then in effect and the amount of time then remaining
to June 28, 1997, and (v) are entitled to receive upon liquidation the stated
value plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In the event that the Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock have not been previously redeemed
by the Company or converted by the holder, the Company will be required to
convert both series into the Company's common stock based on the then-current
market price after June 28, 1996 (or after June 28, 1995 if so requested by
Mitsui, the original holder of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock), or earlier under certain extraordinary circumstances, and
conduct a managed sale program of the common stock.  Such conversions and sales
must, in general, be completed by June 28, 1997.  To the extent that the
proceeds received by Mitsui from such managed sale program are less than the
stated value of the shares so converted, plus accrued and unpaid dividends and a
present valued premium amount if such conversion takes place before June 28,
1997, the Company has agreed to issue additional shares of capital stock to
Mitsui which will be sold in a manner approved by the Company until Mitsui
receives proceeds equal to the sum of 

                                      24
<PAGE>
 
such amounts. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
rank pari passu with each other and with Series A Preferred Stock, and the
holders of Series A, B and C Preferred Stock have priority as to dividends over
holders of the Company's common stock and other series or classes of the
Company's stock which rank junior with regard to dividends. Each series of
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock is non-voting except with respect to
certain matters relating to the rights and preferences of such series. With
respect to such matters, each of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock votes separately as a class. The Series A Preferred Stock also
votes as a class on these matters, but its class includes the Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, as well as any other series of preferred
stock having equal rank as to dividends and liquidation rights.

Each outstanding share of common stock has attached to it one preferred share
purchase right (a "Right").  Each Right entitles the registered holder to
purchase for $75, under certain circumstances, one three-hundredth of a share of
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share.  The Rights become
exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company's
common stock, or announces a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the
common stock.  If the Company is acquired (or survives in a reverse merger
transaction) or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are
sold, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase a number of the acquiring
company's common shares (or the Company's common shares) having a market value
of $150.  The Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at one and two-
thirds cents per Right prior to the earlier of the expiration of the Rights at
March 17, 1996, or the time that a 20% position has been acquired.  Until the
Rights become exercisable, they have no dilutive effect on net income per common
share.

At December 31, 1994, 111.2 million shares of unissued common stock of the
Company were reserved for the following: 57.2 million for convertible preferred
stock, 33.7 million for the 8 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures and 20.3
million for stock options, stock purchase and savings plans.

14  Financial instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.  The
Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative trading
purposes.  The derivative instruments used are foreign exchange forward
contracts and options, and interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements.
These derivatives, which are over-the-counter instruments, are non-leveraged and
involve little complexity.

The Company monitors and controls its risks in the derivative transactions
referred to above by periodically assessing the cost of replacing, at market
rates, those contracts in the event of default by the counterparty.  The Company
believes such risk to be remote.  In addition, before entering into derivative
contracts, and periodically during the life of the contract, the Company reviews
the counterparty's financial condition.

Due to its foreign operations, the Company is exposed to the effects of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar.  Foreign exchange forward
contracts and options generally having maturities of less than nine months are
entered into for the sole purpose of hedging long-term investments in foreign
subsidiaries and certain transactional exposures.

The cost of foreign currency options is recorded in prepaid expenses in the
consolidated balance sheet.  At December 31, 1994, such prepaid expense was $5.1
million.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the
decline in value of the underlying exposures is partially offset by gains in the
value of purchased currency options designated as hedges.  When the U.S. dollar
weakens, the increase in the value of the underlying exposures is reduced only
by the premium paid to purchase the options.  The cost of options and any gains
thereon are reported in income when the related transactions being hedged
(generally within twelve months) are recognized.

The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts.  Gains and
losses on such contracts hedging transactional exposures are deferred and
included in other liabilities until the corresponding transaction is recognized.
At December 31, 1994, the Company had a total of $1,483.7 million (of notional
value) of foreign exchange forward contracts, $811.2 million to sell foreign
currencies and $672.5 million to buy foreign currencies.  At December 31, 1993,
the Company had a total of $511.5 million of such contracts, $330.2 million to
sell foreign currencies and $181.3 million to buy foreign currencies.  At
December 31, 1994, a realized net gain of approximately $12.9 million was
deferred and included in other liabilities on such contracts.  Gains or losses
on foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge foreign currency transactions
are reported in income when the related transactions being hedged (generally
within twelve months) are recognized. Gains or losses on those contracts which
hedge long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries are reported in a separate
component of stockholders' equity for translation adjustments.

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert variable
rate obligations to a fixed rate basis, and uses foreign currency swaps to
effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to U.S. dollar denominated
debt in order to reduce the impact of interest rate and foreign currency rate
changes on future income.  The differential to be paid or received under these
agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense related to the
debt.  The related amount payable to or receivable from counterparties is
included in other liabilities or current receivables.  At December 31, 1994, the
weighted average fixed rate paid by the Company was 

                                      27

<PAGE>
 
9.1%. The fair values of the swap agreements are not recognized in the financial
statements. At December 31, 1994, the Company had three interest rate swap
contracts with a total notional value of $63.8 million, of which $13.6 million
expires in 1995 and $50.2 million expires in 1996, and one foreign currency swap
for $50.1 million expiring in 1996. During the three years ended December 31,
1994, there were no terminations of swap contracts. Accordingly, there were no
deferred gains or losses related to such swaps as of December 31, 1994.

Financial instruments comprise the following:

*notional value

Financial instruments also include temporary cash investments and customer
accounts receivable.  Temporary investments are placed with creditworthy
financial institutions, primarily in over-securitized treasury repurchase
agreements, Euro-time deposits or commercial paper of major corporations.  The
Company's cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and at December 31, 1994 principally have maturities of less
than one month.  Due to the short maturities of these instruments, they are
carried in the balance sheet at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates
market value.  Realized gains or losses during 1994, as well as unrealized gains
or losses at December 31, 1994, were immaterial.  Receivables are due from a
large number of customers which are dispersed worldwide across many industries.
At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had no significant concentrations of
credit risk.

For foreign currency contracts and options, no impact on financial position or
results of operations would result from a change in the level of the underlying
rate, price or index.  All of the Company's foreign currency contracts and
options are hedges against specific exposures and have been accounted for as
such.  Therefore, a change in the derivative's value would be offset with an
equal but opposite change in the hedged item.

The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The
fair value of the Company's long-term debt was based on the quoted market prices
for publicly traded issues.  For debt which is not publicly traded, the fair
value was estimated based on current yields to maturity for the Company's
publicly traded debt with similar maturities.  In estimating the fair value of
its derivative positions, the Company utilizes quoted market prices, if
available, or quotes obtained from outside sources.

15  Litigation

The "Ill Wind" global settlement agreement between the Company and the U.S.
Government requires, among other things, that the Company make contingency
payments, through 1997, not to exceed a total of $90 million, subject to annual
caps, based upon the amount of asset sales and net income reported by the
Company during such period.  Through December 31, 1994, the Company has expensed
$24.5 million of such contingency payments.

There are various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings that have been brought or
asserted against the Company.  Although the ultimate results of these lawsuits,
claims, and proceedings are not presently determinable, management does not
expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position, consolidated statement of income, or liquidity.

Report of Independent Auditors


To the Board of Directors of Unisys Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unisys
Corporation at December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
Unisys Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Unisys Corporation
at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the
Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions and income taxes.

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a special charge of $186.2
million, or $.78 per fully diluted common share.  See Note 2 to the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 106 and 109.  See Note 3
to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

common share amount for the full year because of accounting rules governing the
computation of earnings per common share.

composite listing.
