                                   PART I

Item 1. Business

General

  TrustCo Bank Corp NY  ("TrustCo") is a one-bank holding company having
its principal place of business at 320 State Street, Schenectady, New
York 12305. TrustCo Bank Corp NYwas organized in 1981 to acquire all
of the outstanding stock of Trustco Bank New York, formerly known as
The Schenectady Trust Company. Following the necessary regulatory
approvals, TrustCo commenced business on July 1, 1982. Through policy
and practice, TrustCo continues to emphasize that it is an equal
opportunity employer. There are 452 full-time equivalent employees at
year-end.

Bank Subsidiary

TrustCo's subsidiary, Trustco Bank New York ("Bank"), is a New York
State chartered trust company, engaged in a general commercial banking
business serving individuals, partnerships, corporations,
municipalities and governments of New York. The largest part of such
business consists of accepting deposits and making loans and
investments. The Bank provides a wide range of both personal and
business banking services. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve
system and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. The Bank accounted for
substantially all of TrustCo's 1993 consolidated net income and
average assets.

The trust department of the Bank acts as executor of estates and
trustee of personal trusts, gives estate planning and related advice,
provides custodial services and acts as trustee of various types of
employee benefit plans and corporate pension and profit sharing
trusts. The aggregate market value of the assets under trust, custody
or management was approximately $671 million as of December 31, 1993.

The daily operations of the Bank remains the responsibility of its
Board of Directors and officers, subject to the overall supervision of
TrustCo. TrustCo, as the parent corporation, derives most of its
income from dividends paid to it by its subsidiary Bank. TrustCo's
Bank subsidiary is included in TrustCo's consolidated financial
statements.

ORE Subsidiary

During 1993, TrustCo created ORE Subsidiary Corp., a New York
corporation, to hold and manage certain foreclosed properties. The
accounts of this new subsidiary are included in TrustCo's consolidated
financial statements.

Competition

TrustCo's subsidiary Bank encounters keen competition from other
commercial banks, including New York City-based holding companies
which are some of the largest and most competitive institutions in the
United States. In addition, savings banks, savings and loan
associations, credit unions and other financial and related
institutions compete for the banking, trust, investment and other
financial services which Bank offers. On a regular basis, TrustCo has
discussions with other financial institutions relative to potential
merger or acquisition opportunities.

Supervision and Regulation

Banking is a highly regulated industry, with numerous federal and
state laws and regulations governing the organization and operation of
banks and their affiliates. As a bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"), TrustCo is
regulated and examined by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Board"). The Act requires that TrustCo obtain
prior Board approval for bank and non-bank acquisitions and restricts
the business operations permitted to TrustCo. The Bank is subject to
regulation and examination by the New York State Banking Department.

Virtually all aspects of TrustCo's and the Bank's business are subject
to regulation and examination by the Board, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department.

Most of TrustCo's revenues consist of cash dividends paid to TrustCo
by its subsidiary Bank, payment of which is subject to various state
and federal regulatory limitations. (Reference is made to Note 1(j) of
TrustCo's consolidated financial statements for information concerning
restrictions on TrustCo's ability to pay dividends.) In addition, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board have established
guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of
capital by a bank holding company under their jurisdictions.
Compliance with the standards set forth in such guidelines could also
limit the amount of dividends which a bank or a bank holding company
may pay.

The banking industry is also affected by the monetary and fiscal
policies of the federal government, including the Board, which exerts
considerable influence over the cost and availability of funds
obtained for lending and investing.

Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations
and taxation of banks, companies which control banks and other
financial institutions are frequently raised in Congress and in the
New York state legislature and before various bank regulatory
authorities. The likelihood of any major changes and the impact such
changes might have on TrustCo are impossible to determine.

Foreign operations

Neither TrustCo nor the Bank engage in material operations in foreign
countries or have any outstanding loans to foreign debtors.

Statistical Information Analysis

The "Financial Review" on pages 26-44 of TrustCo's Annual Report to
Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 1993, which contains a
presentation and discussion of statistical data relating to TrustCo,
are hereby incorporated by reference. The information with respect to
such tables should not be construed to imply any conclusion on the
part of the management of TrustCo that the results, causes or trends
indicated therein will continue in the future. The nature and effects
of governmental monetary policy, supervision and regulation, future
legislation, inflation and other economic conditions and many other
factors which affect interest rates, investments, loans, deposits and
other aspects of TrustCo's operations are extremely complex and could
make historical operations, earnings, assets and liabilities not
indicative of what may occur in the future.

Item 2. Properties

TrustCo's executive offices are located at 320 State Street,
Schenectady, New York, 12305. The Bank operates 43 offices, of which
20 are owned and 23 are leased from others. These properties, when
considered in the aggregate, are not material to the operation of
TrustCo.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The nature of TrustCo's business generates a certain amount of
litigation against TrustCo and its subsidiary Bank involving matters
arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management of TrustCo, there are no proceedings pending to which
TrustCo or either of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which its
property is the subject which, if determined adversely to TrustCo or
such subsidiary, would be material in relation to TrustCo's
consolidated stockholders' equity and financial condition.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None.

Executive Officers of TrustCo

officers of TrustCo and their business history for the past five

Reports on Form 8-K:

On October 18, 1993, TrustCo filed a Current Report on Form 8-K
reporting (1) a 2 for 1 stock split payable on November 18, 1993, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 1993,
and (2) second-quarter and six-month earnings.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the TrustCo Bank Corp NY(the "Corporation")
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Corporation
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
event that a claim for indeminifcation against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the Corporation of expenses incurred or
paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Corporation
in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection
with the securities being registered, the Corporation will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
whether such indeminification by it is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.

1985 TRUSTCO BANK CORP NY
STOCK OPTION PLAN
(as amended through December 31, 1992)

SECTION 1: PURPOSE

This Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") has been established by TrustCo
Bank Corp NY (the "Company") to advance the interests of the Company
and its stockholders by providing to certain key employees an
opportunity to acquire equity ownership in the Company and the
incentive advantages inherent in that equity ownership.

SECTION 2: DEFINITIONS

When capitalized and used in this Plan, each of the following terms or
phrases has the indicated meaning, unless a different meaning is
clearly implied by the context:

"Adoption Date" means the date this plan is duly adopted by the
Board.

"Board" means the Company's Board of Directors.

"Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

"Committee" means the Committee to be appointed by the Board from
time to time and to consist of three or more members of the Board who
have not been eligible to receive options under the Plan at any time
within a period of one year immediately preceding the date of their
appointment to such Committee.

"Company" means TrustCo Bank Corp NY and its subsidiaries.

"Disability" means a Participant's termination of employment by the
Company or a Participating Subsidiary by reason of his permanent and
total disability, as defined in Code Section 22(e)(3).

"Eligible Employee" means any executive or other key managerial
employee of the Company or any Participating Subsidiary who is a
full-time, salaried employee of the Company or any Participating
Subsidiary, provided he is so employed at the date any Stock Option
is granted to him.

"Fair Market Value" means the current fair market value of any Stock
subject to a Stock Option. During such time as the Stock is not
listed on an established stock exchange, fair market value per share
shall be the mean between the closing dealer "bid" and "ask" prices
for the Stock as quoted by NASDAQ for the day of the grant and if
"bid" and "ask" prices are quoted for the day of the grant, the fair
market value shall be determined by reference to such prices on the
next preceding day on which such prices were quoted. If the Stock is
listed on an established stock exchange or exchanges, the fair market
value shall be deemed to be the highest closing price of the Stock on
such stock exchange or exchanges on the day the option is granted or,
if no sale of Stock has been made on any stock exchange on that day,
the fair market value shall be determined by reference to such
price for the next preceding day on which a sale occurred. In the
event that Stock is not traded on an established stock exchange, and
no closing dealer "bid" and "ask" prices are available, then the
purchase price shall be 100 percent of the fair market value of one
share of Stock on the day the option is granted, as determined by the
Committee in good faith. The purchase price shall be subject to
adjustment only as provided in Section 9 of the Plan.

"Incentive Stock Option" means an option granted to a Participant
under this Plan to purchase the Company's Stock, which is designated
as an Incentive Stock Option and which satisfies the requirements of
Code Section 422, as amended.

"Nonqualified Stock Option" means an option granted to a Participant
under this Plan to purchase the Company's Stock and which is not an
Incentive Stock Option.

"Option Agreement" means the written agreement executed between the
Participant and the Company evidencing the award of Stock Options
under this Plan, as more particularly described in Section 7.

"Participant" means any Eligible Employee who has been awarded any
Stock Option(s) under this Plan and his heirs, legatees, or personal
representatives who may succeed to his interests under any Option
Agreement at his death.

"Participating Subsidiary" means a Subsidiary some or all of whose
employees have been designated as Eligible Employees by the Board.

"Plan" means the TrustCo Bank Corp NY Stock Option Plan as embodied
in this document including all amendments to this document made from
time to time.

"Shareholder-Employee" means any Eligible Employee who at the time an
Incentive Stock Option is to be granted to him under this Plan owns
(within the meaning of Code Section 442(b)(6) and (c)(5)) more than
10 percent of the combined voting power of all classes of the
Company's Stock or of its parent or subsidiary companies (if any).

"Stock" means shares of the Company's common stock.

"Stock Appreciation Right" means a right, granted to a Participant
concurrently with the grant of a Nonqualified Stock Option, to
receive a cash payment from the Company upon the partial or complete
cancellation of that option by a Participant. Each option agreement
may provide that the Participant may from time to time elect to
cancel all or any portion of the option then subject to exercise, in
which event the Company's obligation in respect of such option may be
discharged by payment to the Participant of an amount in cash equal
to the excess, if any, of the fair market value at the time of
cancellation of the shares subject to the option or the portion
thereof so cancelled, over the aggregate purchase price for such
shares as set forth in the option agreement. In the event of such a
cancellation, the number of shares as to which such option was
cancelled shall not become available for use under the Plan.

"Stock Option" or "Option" means a right granted under this Plan to
purchase Company Stock, including a Nonqualified Stock Option or an
Incentive Stock Option.

"Subsidiary" means a corporation of which stock possessing 50% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of its stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is owned in
the aggregate by the Company directly or indirectly through one or
more Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3: PLAN ADMINISTRATION

The Plan is to be administered by the Committee except as otherwise
provided in the Plan. Subject to all other Plan provisions, the
Committee is expressly empowered to:

1. select the Eligible Employees who are to receive Stock Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights under this Plan from time to time and grant
those Options and Stock Appreciation Rights;

2. determine the time(s) at which Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights are to be granted;

3. determine the number of shares of Stock to be subject to a Stock
Option granted to any Participant;

4. determine the option price and term of each Stock Option granted
under this Plan (including whether it is to be an Incentive Stock
Option or Nonqualified Stock Option) and all other terms and
conditions to be included in the Option Agreement relating to any
Stock Options under this Plan;

5. determine the duration and purposes of leaves of absence which may
be granted to a Participant without constituting a termination of
employment or service for purposes of the Plan;

6. determine all matters of interpretation of the Plan and any Option
Agreement, and the Committee's decision is to be binding and
conclusive on all persons;

7. determine, in its sole discretion, whether the Company is to
accept Stock previously acquired by a Participant as payment of the
option price for Stock Options granted under this Plan;

8. prescribe, amend and rescind all rules and regulations relating to
the Plan and its operations;

9. in the event of the Company's or a Participating Subsidiary's
merger, consolidation, dissolution or liquidation, accelerate the
exercise date and expiration date for any unexercised Stock Options
then outstanding; and

10. make all other determinations and decisions and take all further
actions deemed necessary or advisable for the Plan's administration.

Notwithstanding any conflicting Plan provision, the Board reserves
the right, by written resolution duly adopted by the Board, to
terminate from time to time any and all powers delegated to the
Committee by the express Plan provisions and, in that event, those
Committee powers so terminated by the Board shall revert to and be
fully exercisable by the Board to the same extent as they were
exercisable by the Committee, provided that no termination of the
Committee's powers shall be retroactively effective. Any termination
of the Committee's powers under this Plan shall not be deemed a Plan
amendment. No Committee or Board member may participate in the
decision to award any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right under
this Plan to himself. Neither the Board nor the Committee may,
without the Participant's consent, change the terms and conditions of
any Option Agreement after its execution, except to the extent that
the Agreement may, by its terms, be so amended.

SECTION 4: PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION

This Plan is effective as of the Adoption Date, subject, however, to
the Plan's approval by the Company's shareholders either on or before
the Adoption Date or within the 12-month period following the
Adoption Date. If shareholder approval is not so obtained, all Stock
Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Option Agreements granted
under this Plan shall automatically be null and void, ab initio. No
Stock Option may be granted under this Plan at any date which is 10
years or more after the Adoption Date.

SECTION 5: AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATIONS

This plan may be amended, suspended, terminated or reinstated, in
whole or in part, at any time by the Board; provided, however, that
without the approval of the Company's stockholders, the Board may
not:

1. except as provided in Section 9, increase the number of shares of
Stock subject to Stock Options issued under this Plan;

2. extend the maximum period during which a Stock Option may be
exercised;

3. extend the maximum period during which Incentive Stock Options may
be granted under this Plan; or

4. change the class of Eligible Employees.

SECTION 6: SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

The total number of shares available for grants of Stock Options
under this Plan is 60,000, subject to the adjustments under Section
9. If a Stock Option or a portion thereof expires or terminates for
any reason without being exercised in full, the unpurchased shares
covered by the Option are to be available for future Stock Option
grants under this Agreement.

SECTION 7: GRANTS OF OPTIONS

Nonqualified Stock Options may be granted to any Eligible Employee,
at the time(s) and upon such terms and conditions as may be selected
by the Committee. At the time of grant of a Nonqualified Stock
Option, the Committee may, in its discretion, also grant to the
Eligible Employee Stock Appreciation Rights for the total number of
shares subject to that Option. The grant of a Nonqualified Stock
Option and, if appropriate, Stock Appreciation Rights shall be
evidenced by an Option Agreement between the Eligible Employee and
the Company containing any terms and conditions specified by the
Committee, but including the terms described in Section 8.

Incentive Stock Options may be granted to any Eligible Employee, at
the time(s) and upon such terms and condition as may be selected by
the Committee, subject, nevertheless to the following:

1. The aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the Incentive
Stock Option is granted) of the Stock subject to Incentive Stock
Options granted to any Eligible Employee during one calendar year
(under this Plan and all other plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries providing "incentive stock options" within the meaning
of Code Section 422A(b)) shall not exceed the sum of: (i) $100,000;
and (ii) the amount of any "unused limit carryover" which may be
taken into account for that calendar year with respect to that
Eligible Employee under Code Section 422(A)(c)(4).

2. the grant shall be evidenced by an Option Agreement between the
Company and the Eligible Employee containing any terms and conditions
specified by the Committee, except that those terms and conditions
must conform with Section 8 and must be consistent with the
requirements for an "incentive stock option" as described in Code
Section 422A(b).

SECTION 8: TERMS OF OPTIONS AGREEMENT

All Option Agreements for Incentive Stock Options issued under this
Plan must include terms that are consistent with the following:

1. The Participant shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares
subject to the Stock Option, upon his exercise of that Option, at a
price no less than 100% of the Stock's Fair Market Value at the date
of the grant; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive
Stock Option granted to a Shareholder-Employee, the option price is
to be no less than 110% of that Fair Market Value.

2. At the option's exercise, the option price may be paid in cash or
cash equivalent--that is, by certified check, bank draft or postal or
express money orders made payable to the Company's order in U.S.
dollars. Alternatively, in the Committee's sole discretion, the
option price may be paid, in whole or in part, by the Participant's
exchange of Company Stock previously acquired by him, based on that
Stock's Fair Market Value at the date of exchange. However, no
Company Stock may be accepted in payment of the option price upon
exercise of an Incentive Stock Option, if that Stock was acquired by
the Participant's previous exercise of an Incentive Stock Option
unless that Stock has been held by the Participant for more than 2
years after the date that previous Option was granted and more than 1
year after the date that previous Option was exercised.

3. The option may not be exercisable after the earlier of the
following dates:

(i) If the Participant is not a Shareholder-Employee at the date of
grant or the Option is not an Incentive Stock Option, the date 10
years after the date of grant;

(ii) If the Participant is a Shareholder-Employee at the date of
grant and the Option is an Incentive Stock Option, the date 5 years
after the date of grant;

(iii) If the Participant's employment terminates for reasons other
than his death, disability, or retirement, the date three months
after the date his employment terminates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may
further limit the period during which all or any portion of a Stock
Option may be exercised and may accelerate the time at which an
Option may be exercised.

4. Acceleration and the immediate right to exercise options in full
will occur if any one or more of the following takes place:

(i) a contract providing for a merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another entity (except in the case where the Company is
the surviving entity and the merger does not affect the stock
interest of the stockholders of the Company) or a sale of
substantially all the assets of the Company is executed;

(ii) a single entity or individual (including any related parties to
such entity or individual) acquires 20% or more of the outstanding
stock of the Company; or

(iii) a situation occurs in which, during any period of 12
consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of such period
were members of the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least
a majority of the Board, unless the nomination or election of each
new director was approved by at least two-thirds of the directors
then still in office who were directors at the beginning of such
period.

5. The Stock Option(s) and any related Stock Appreciation Rights may
be exercised only by the Participant during his lifetime and, after
his death, only by his heirs, legatees or personal representatives
who succeed to his interest under the Option Agreement. Neither the
Option Agreement, the Stock Options nor the Stock Appreciation Rights
issued under this Plan shall be transferable by the Participant other
than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

6. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, no Incentive Stock
Option may be exercised while there is outstanding (within the
meaning of Code Section 422(c)(7)) any "incentive stock option"
(within the meaning of Code Section 422A(b)) to purchase stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary which was granted to the Participant prior
to the grant of the Option sought to be exercised. The provisions of
this Item 6 shall apply only to Incentive Stock Options granted prior
to January 1, 1987.

7. In the case of Nonqualified Stock Options, the Option may be
exercised while there is outstanding another Stock Option to purchase
Stock of the Company or a Subsidiary which was granted to the
Participant prior to the grant of the Option sought to be exercised.

8. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option
is granted) of the stock with respect to which Incentive Stock
Options are exercisable for the first time by such individual during
any calendar year (under all such plans of the individual's employer
corporation and its parent and subsidiary corporation) shall not
exceed $100,000. The provisions of this Item 8 shall apply to
Incentive Stock Options granted after December 31, 1986.

9. The acceleration provisions of Section 8, Item 4 of the Plan shall
override restrictions contained in Section 8, Item 8.

10. As to each Option granted a Participant since November 19, 1985,
if the Participant's employment terminates by his death, disability
or retirement, the exercise of each such Option shall accelerate and
become exercisable in full upon such termination, and shall remain
exercisable throughout the period permitted for exercise.

SECTION 9: RECAPITALIZATION

The number of shares of Stock subject to this Plan, the number of
shares of Stock covered by each outstanding Option (and any
corresponding Stock Appreciation Rights), and the price per share in
each Option, are to be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
decrease in the number of issued shares of Company Stock resulting
from a subdivision or consolidation of shares or the payment of a
stock dividend (but only on the Company's common stock) or any other
increase or decrease in the number of those shares effected without
receipt of consideration by the Company.

Subject to any required action by the Stockholders if the Company
shall be the surviving corporation in any merger or consolidation,
each outstanding Stock Option (and any corresponding Stock
Appreciation Rights) shall pertain to and apply to the securities to
which a holder of the number of shares of stock subject to that
Option would have been entitled. A dissolution or liquidation of the
Company, a proposed sale of substantially all of the assets of the
Company, or a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the
surviving Corporation, shall cause each outstanding Option (and any
corresponding Stock Appreciation Rights) to terminate as of a date to
be fixed by the Board; provided that no less than 30 days written
notice of the date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee, and each
Optionee shall have the right, during the period of 30 days preceding
such termination, to exercise his option as to all or any part of the
shares covered thereby, including shares as to which such option
would not otherwise be exercisable.

The foregoing adjustments shall be made by the Committee. Fractional
shares resulting from any adjustment in options pursuant to this
Section 9 may be settled as the Committee or the Board (as the case
may be) shall determine.

SECTION 10: GOVERNMENT AND OTHER REGULATIONS

No Option shall be exercisable, no Stock shall be issued, no
certificate for shares of Stock shall be delivered, and no payment
shall be made under this Plan except in compliance with all
applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The Company shall
have the right to rely on the opinion of its counsel as to such
compliance. Any share certificate issued to evidence Stock for which
an Option is exercised may bear such legends and statements as the
Committee may deem advisable to assure compliance with federal and
state laws and regulations. No Option shall be exercisable, no Stock
shall be issued, no certificate for shares shall be delivered, and no
payment shall be made under this Plan until the Company has obtained
such consent or approval as the Committee may deem advisable from
regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such matters.

SECTION 11: INDEMNIFICATION OF COMMITTEE

In addition to such other rights of indemnification that they may
have as officers or directors, the Committee members shall be
indemnified by the Company against the reasonable expenses, including
attorneys' fees actually and necessarily incurred in connection with
the Plan's administration and the defense of any action, suit, or
proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they
or any of them may be a party by reasons of any action taken or
failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any Option or
Stock Appreciation Right granted thereunder. The Committee members
are also to be indemnified against all amounts paid by them in
settlement thereof (provided that settlement is approved by
independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in
satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding,
except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in
such action, suit or proceeding that such Committee member is liable
for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
his/her duties; provided that within 60 days after institution of any
such action, suit or proceeding a Committee member shall in writing
offer the Company the opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and
defend the same.

SECTION 12: MISCELLANEOUS

The adoption of this Plan, its operation, or any documents describing
or referring to this Plan (or any part thereof) shall not confer
upon any employee any right to continue in the employ of the Company
or in any way affect any right and power of the Company to terminate
the employment of any employee at any time with or without assigning
a reason thereof.

This Plan, insofar as it provides for grants, shall be unfunded, and
the Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at
any time be represented by grants under the Plan. Any liability of
the Company to any person with respect to any grant under this Plan
shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations which may be
created pursuant to this Plan. No such obligation of the Company
shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge of, or other encumbrance
on, any property of the Company.

The Plan shall be administered in the State of New York and the
validity, construction, interpretation, administration and effect of
the Plan shall be determined solely in accordance with the laws of
that State.

[TEXT]
TRUSTCO BANK CORP NY DIRECTORS STOCK OPTION PLAN

SECTION 1: PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

This Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") has been established by
TrustCo Bank Corp NY (the "Company") to advance the interest of
stockholders and the Company by encouraging Directors to acquire a
larger ownership in the Company. The resulting increased proprietary
interest in the Company increases their incentive to continue active
service as a Director and to oversee the success and growth of the
Company.

SECTION 2: DEFINITIONS

"Adoption Date" means the date this plan is duly adopted by the
Board.

"Board" means the Company's Board of Directors.

"Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

"Committee" means the Compensation Committee of the Board.

"Company" means TrustCo Bank Corp NY.

"Director" means a member of the Board of Directors of TrustCo Bank
Corp NY.

"Fair Market Value" means the current fair market value of any Stock
subject to a Stock Option. During such time as the Stock is not
listed on an established stock exchange, fair market value per share
shall be the mean between the closing dealer "bid" and "ask" prices
for the Stock as quoted by NASDAQ for the day of the grant, and if
no "bid" and "ask" prices are quoted for the day of the grant, the fair
market value shall be determined by reference to such prices on the
next preceding day on which such prices were quoted. If the Stock is
listed on an established stock exchange or exchanges, the fair market
value shall be deemed to be the highest closing price of the Stock on
such stock exchange or exchanges on the day the option is granted or,
if no sale of Stock has been made on any stock exchange on that day,
the fair market value shall be determined by reference to such
price for the next preceding day on which a sale occurred. In the
event that Stock is not traded on an established stock exchange, and
no closing dealer "bid" and "ask" prices are available, then the
purchase price shall be 100 percent of the fair market value of one
share of Stock on the day the option is granted, as determined by the
Committee in good faith. The purchase price shall be subject to
adjustment only as provided in Section 15 of the Plan.

"Grant Date" as used with respect to a particular Option, means the
date as of which such Option is granted by the Committee pursuant to
the Plan.

"Option" means the right, granted by the Committee pursuant to
Section 7 of the Plan, to purchase shares of Stock.

"Optionee" means the Director to which an Option is granted by the
Committee pursuant to the Plan, except that employees of TrustCo Bank
Corp NY or its subsidiaries, who are also Directors, shall not be
eligible to receive grants under this plan.

"Plan" means this Directors Stock Option Plan as it may be amended
from time to time.

"Stock" means shares of the Company's common stock.

"Total and Permanent Disability" as applied to an Optionee, means
that the Optionee; (i) has established to the satisfaction of the
Committee that the Optionee is unable to engage in any substantial
gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or
mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which
has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not
less than 12 months (all within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of
the Code); and (ii) has satisfied any other requirement imposed by
the Committee.

SECTION 3: PLAN ADMINISTRATION

The Plan shall be administered by a committee composed of three or
more Directors who are appointed by the Board as the Board's
Compensation Committee and who may be members of the committee
appointed to administer the TrustCo Bank Corp NY Stock Option Plan.
The Board may from time to time remove members from, or add members
to, the Committee. Vacancies on the Committee, however caused, shall
be filled by the Board. The Board shall elect one of the Committee's
members as Chairman. The Committee shall hold meetings at such times
and places as it may determine, subject to rules and to procedures
not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. A majority of the
authorized number of members of the Committee shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. Acts reduced to or approved
in writing by a majority of the members of the Committee then serving
shall be the valid acts of the Committee. A member of the Committee
shall be eligible to be granted Options under this Plan while a
member of the Committee. The Committee shall be vested with full
authority to make such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or
desirable to administer the Plan and to interpret the provisions of
the Plan. Any determination, decision or action of the Committee in
connection with the construction, interpretation, administration or
application of the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
all Optionees and any person claiming under or through an Optionee,
unless otherwise determined by the Board.

Any determination, decision or action of the Committee provided for
in the Plan may be made or taken by action of the Board if it so
determines, with the same force and effect as if such determination,
decision or action had been made or taken by the Committee. No member
of the Committee or of the Board shall be liable for any
determination, decision or action made in good faith with respect to
the Plan or any Option granted under the Plan. The fact that a member
of the Board shall at the time be, or shall theretofore have been or
thereafter may be, a person who has received or is eligible to
receive an Option shall not disqualify him or her from taking part in
and voting at any time as a member of the Board in favor of or
against any amendment or repeal of the Plan.

SECTION 4: PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION

This Plan is effective as of the Adoption Date, subject, however, to
the Plan's approval by the Company's shareholders either on or before
the Adoption Date of within the 12 month period following the
Adoption Date. If shareholder approval is not so obtained, all
Options granted under this Plan shall automatically be null and void,
ab initio. No Option may be granted under this Plan at any date which
is 10 years or more after the Adoption Date.

SECTION 5: AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

The Board may at any time terminate, amend, modify or suspend the

Company, no amendment or modification shall be made by the Board
which:

granted under the Plan;

(b) Alters the method by which the Option price is determined;

(c) Extends any Option for a period longer than 10 years after the
Grant Date;

(d) Materially modifies the requirements as to eligibility for
participation in the Plan;

(e) Amends Paragraphs 9(a) or 9(b) at intervals more frequent than
once every six months except to the extent necessary to comport with
changes in the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or
the rules thereunder; or

(f) Alters this Section 5 so as to defeat its purpose.

Further, no amendment, modification, suspension or termination of the
Plan shall in any manner affect any Option theretofore granted under
the Plan without the consent of the Optionee or any person validly
claiming under or through the Optionee.

SECTION 6: STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

(a) The stock to be issued upon exercise of Options granted under the
Plan shall be TrustCo Bank Corp NY Stock, which shall be made
available, at the discretion of the Board, either from authorized but
unissued Stock or from Stock acquired by the Company, including
shares purchased in the open market. The aggregate number of shares
of Stock which may be issued under or subject to Options granted
under this Plan shall not exceed 50,000 shares. The limitation
established by the preceding sentence shall be subject to adjustment
as provided in Section 15 of the Plan.

(b) In the event that any outstanding Option or portion thereof under
the Plan for any reason expires or is terminated, the shares of Stock
allocable to the unexercised portion of such Option may again be made
subject to Option under the Plan.

SECTION 7: GRANT OF OPTIONS

The Committee may from time to time, subject to the provisions of the
Plan, grant Options to Directors to purchase shares of Stock allotted
in accordance with Section 6. All Options granted under this Plan
shall be "Nonqualified Stock Options" for purposes of the Code.

SECTION 8: OPTION PRICE

The purchase price per share of each share of Stock which is subject
to an Option shall be 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a share
of Stock on the date of the Grant Date.

SECTION 9: ELIGIBILITY OF OPTIONEES

(a) Options on 1,000 shares of Stock shall be granted annually at a
meeting of the Board of Directors to be held each August, commencing
with August, 1993, to those persons who are then Directors of the
Company, except that if Counsel to the Company determines in his sole
discretion that on such date the Company is in possession of material
non-public information concerning its affairs, such grant shall be
delayed until the third day on which trading occurs following the
public dissemination of such information or the date of an event
which renders such information immaterial.

(b) Subject to the terms of the Plan, and subject to review by the
Board, the Committee shall have exclusive jurisdiction (i) to
determine the dates on which, or the time periods during which, the
Option may be exercised, (ii) to determine the purchase price of the
shares subject to each Option in accordance with Section 8 of the
Plan and (iii) to prescribe the form, which shall be consistent with
the Plan, of the instrument evidencing any Options granted under the
Plan.

(c) Neither anything contained in the Plan or in any document under
the Plan nor the grant of any Option under the Plan shall confer upon
any Optionee any right to continue as a Director of the Company or
limit in any respect the right of the Company shareholders to
terminate the Optionee's directorship at any time and for any reason.

SECTION 10: NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS

No Option granted under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable
by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and during the lifetime of an Optionee the Option shall
be exercisable only by such Optionee.

SECTION 11: TERM AND EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

(a) Each Option granted under the Plan shall terminate on the date
which is 10 years after the Grant Date. The Committee at its
discretion may provide further limitations on the exercisability of
Options granted under the Plan. An Option may be exercised only
during the continuance of the Optionee's service as a Director,
except as provided in Sections 12 and 13 of the Plan.

(b) A person electing to exercise an Option shall give written notice
to the Company of such election and of the number of shares he or she
has elected to purchase, in such forms as the Committee shall have
prescribed or approved, and shall at the time of exercise tender the
full purchase price of the shares he or she has elected to purchase.
The purchase price shall be paid in full in cash upon the exercise of
the Option; provided, however, that in lieu of cash, with the
approval of the Committee at or prior to exercise, an Optionee may
exercise his or her Option by tendering to the Company shares of
Stock owned by him or her and having a fair market value equal to the
cash exercise price applicable to his or her Option, with the then
fair market value of such stock to be determined in the same manner
as provided in Section 8 of the Plan with respect to the
determination of the fair market value of Stock on the date an Option
is granted.

(c) An Optionee or a transferee of an Option shall have no rights as a
stockholder with respect to any shares covered by his or her Option
until the date the stock certificate is issued evidencing ownership
of the shares. No adjustments shall be made for dividends (ordinary
or extraordinary), whether in cash, securities or other property, or
distributions or other rights, for which the record date is prior to
the date such stock certificate is issued, except as provided in
Section 15 hereof.

SECTION 12: TERMINATION OF DIRECTORSHIP

If an Optionee's status as a Director ceases for any reason, any
Option granted to him or her under the Plan shall terminate, and all
rights under the Option shall cease, except:

(a) In the case of a Stock Option held by an Optionee that is not
subject to Total and Permanent Disability, such Stock Option shall
terminate 18 months after the termination of the Optionee's status as
Director.

(b) In the case of a Stock Option held by an Optionee who is subject
to Total and Permanent Disability, such Stock Option shall terminate
upon its expiration date.

(c) In the case of the Optionee's death while serving as a director,
such Stock Option shall terminate eighteen months after the date of
death.

(d) The foregoing notwithstanding, no Option shall be exercisable
after its expiration date.

SECTION 13: DEATH OF AN OPTIONEE

If an Optionee dies after ceasing to serve as a Director but within
the period during which he or she could have exercised the Option
under Section 12 of the Plan, then the Option may be exercised by the
executors or administrators of the Optionee's estate, or by any
person or persons who have acquired the Option directly from the
Optionee by bequest or inheritance, within a period prescribed by the
Committee after the Optionee's death, except that no Option shall be
exercisable after its expiration date.

SECTION 14: MODIFICATION, EXTENSION AND RENEWAL OF OPTIONS

Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the
Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options
granted under the Plan or accept the surrender of outstanding Options
(to the extent not theretofore exercised) and grant new Options in
substitution therefor. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Committee may grant to an Optionee, if he or she is
otherwise eligible and consents thereto, a new or modified Option in
lieu of an outstanding Option for a number of shares, at an exercise
price and for a term which are greater or lesser than under the
earlier Option, or may do so by cancellation and regrant, amendment,
substitution or otherwise, subject only to the general limitations
and conditions of the Plan. The foregoing notwithstanding, no
modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the Optionee,
alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Option
theretofore granted under the Plan.

SECTION 15: CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

(a) In the event that the shares of the Company, as presently
constituted, shall be changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the Company
or of another corporation (whether by reason of merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend,
stock split, combination of shares or otherwise) or if the number of
such shares of stock shall be increased through the payment of a
stock dividend, then, subject to the provisions of Subsection (c)
below, there shall be substituted for or added to each share of stock
of the Company which was theretofore appropriated, or which
thereafter may become subject to an Option under the Plan, the number
and kind of shares of stock or other securities into which each
outstanding share of the stock of the Company shall be so changed or for
which each such share shall be exchanged or to which each such share
shall be entitled, as the case may be. Outstanding Options shall also
be appropriately amended as to price and other terms, as may be
necessary to reflect the foregoing events.

(b) If there shall be any other change in the number or kind of the
outstanding shares of the stock of the Company, or of any stock or
other securities into which such stock shall have been changed, or
for which it shall have been exchanged, and if the Board or the
Committee (as the case may be), shall in its sole discretion,
determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment in any
Option which was theretofore granted or which may thereafter be
granted under the Plan, then such adjustment shall be made in
accordance with such determination.

(c) A dissolution or liquidation of the Company or a merger or a
consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation,
shall cause each outstanding Option to terminate, except to the extent
that another corporation may and does in the same transaction assume
and continue the Option or substitute its own Options. In either
event, the Board or the Committee (as the case may be) shall have the
right to accelerate the time within which the Option may be
exercised.

(d) Fractional shares resulting from any adjustment in Options
pursuant to this Section 15 may be settled as the Board or the
Committee (as the case may be) shall determine.

(e) To the extent that the foregoing adjustments relate to stock or
securities of the Company such adjustments shall be made by the
Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding
and conclusive. Notice of any adjustment shall be given by the
Company to each holder of an Option which shall have been so
adjusted.

(f) The grant of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in
any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments,
reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or
business structure, to merge, to consolidate, to dissolve, to
liquidate or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or
assets.

SECTION 16: LISTING AND REGISTRATION OF SHARES

(a) No Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be exercisable in
whole or in part if at any time the Board or the Committee (as the
case may be) shall determine in its discretion that the listing,
registration or qualification of the shares of Stock subject to such
Option on any securities exchange or under any applicable law, or the
consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary
or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting
of such Option or the issue of shares thereunder, unless such
listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have
been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to
the Board.

(b) If a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of any Option
granted under the Plan is not in effect at the time of exercise, as a
condition of the issuance of the shares the person exercising such
Option shall give the Committee a written statement, satisfactory in
form and substance to the Committee, that he or she is acquiring the
shares for his or her own account for investment and not with a view
to their distribution. The Company may place upon any stock
certificate for shares issuable upon exercise of such Option the
following legend or such other legend as the Committee may prescribe
to prevent disposition of the shares in violation of the Securities
Act of 1933 or other applicable law:

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN
THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO
THEM UNDER THE ACT OR A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY
THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

SECTION 17: MISCELLANEOUS

The Plan shall be administered in the State of New York and the
validity, construction, interpretation, administration and effect of
the Plan shall be determined solely in accordance with the laws of
that State.

President's Message

  I am happy to report that 1993 was another record year at TrustCo.
It is nice to be able to report our continuing progress during this
period when apparently the banking industry has attained significant
recovery from the difficulties of the past three or four years.
Throughout this period, TrustCo has managed to avoid the pitfalls many
others have experienced by sticking to the basics of the business and
avoiding the current or in vogue products and precepts. We expect to
continue in this vein, and are grateful for the enthusiasm of our
staff and Boards in making this success a reality.

  Shareholder values continue to progress with net income for 1993 at
$20.3 million, up a significant 16.1% over 1992. As planned, TrustCo's
most important ratio, Return on Average Shareholders' Equity, was
16.2% for 1993, up from 15.1% in 1992. It is our commitment to ensure
Return on Average Equity measures up favorably in any peer group, and
we are comfortable that it does. TrustCo's five year average Return on
Equity was 17.1%, and we have plans to methodically increase ROE to
the 18% level for 1995.

  Barton Andreoli, President of Towne Paving Inc., joined the Boards
of Trustco Bank New York and TrustCo Bank Corp NY during 1993; and
Bernard King, Chairman of King Road Materials Inc., retired from both
Boards during 1993. We thank Bernie for his many contributions and
wish him well in retirement. I would like to thank all our Board
members for their continued support and guidance through the year.

  We note with sorrow the passing of David Hume, Honorary Director,
who served the Boards with distinction for many years.

  Senior staff changes included William Milton and James McLoughlin
being promoted to Administrative Vice Presidents; Madeline Busch,
Donald Csaposs, Ann Noble, Matthew Waschull, and George Wickswat were
appointed Vice Presidents in their respective areas of responsibility.
We closed the former Home & City main office on State Street, Albany
and successfully merged the account base into Trustco's State Street
office. We consider the consolidation complete, leaving us with 43
branch offices, with the expectation of at least one new office during
the current year. We continue with our upgrading, targeting each
branch for major renovation on an approximate 7 year cycle.

  Our search for appropriately priced acquisitions in our market area
continues, though we are not engaged in any significant acquisition
conversations at this time.

  We continue to work with some of the problem loans we acquired and
want to report continuing progress in the legal actions. Though the
litigation is taking longer than originally anticipated, we want
shareholders to know we reserved sufficiently for these loans to
ensure there will be no negative impact on TrustCo's future financial
results as they are brought to conclusion.

  We completed a two for one stock split during the fourth quarter,
effectively increasing dividend payments by 29.4% over last year. Our
quarterly cash dividends have increased at a 25.9% compound annual
rate over the last five years, a major accomplishment in the current
banking climate.

  Trustco's Affordable Housing Program, designed to assist with
homeownership, was expanded to the other markets that we serve after
our initial success in Schenectady. This program is a model for
community reinvestment and one of the most effective in our state.

  It has been suggested by reporters on occasion that TrustCo is a
boring company to follow because the consistently good results don't
make stimulating copy. All in all, 1993 was another "boring" year here
at TrustCo with increases in all important areas and continuing
benefits to the owners, employees, and the community.

  Our expectation is that 1994 will also be "boring." Our plans call
for a repeat of 1993 income and growth successes, and newly added
branches are contributing solidly to loan and deposit growth. The
emphasis will continue on the Home Equity Loan and Home Equity Credit
Line products on the lending side and the NOW account on the deposit
side. Our Trust Department currently manages assets in excess of $600
million, and we look forward to increased penetration in the former
Home & City branch territories.

  With the difficult economy, community needs have increased and
Trustco has responded accordingly. As mentioned previously, we
continue to expand our Affordable Housing Program. We have been able
to provide increased employee and management participation in
charitable and community organizations, as well as increase our
corporate charitable donations in the Capital District area.

  The interesting times of the '90s in banking have been very
challenging at TrustCo. We believe we have met the challenge
successfully and will be able to continue this success into the
future. We have a strong marketplace with the right products and a
team of super employees to bring about the kind of results in the
future that have brought us success in the past. With our focus,
enthusiasm, and commitment, we will be able to compete successfully in
the banking environment of the future.

                              Sincerely,

                              Robert A. McCormick,
                              President and Chief Executive Officer

P.S. December 31, 1993 marked the completion of my first decade as CEO
of the Bank and Holding Company. I thought it appropriate to report
the results of that stewardship. I thank the Company's Board and all
of our employees for making us look so good.

                        Challenge and Progress
                               1983-1993

  1983-1993--A period characterized by turbulence in the banking
industry. First the go-go times, followed quickly by the savings and
loan debacle which decimated the industry, immediately followed by the
commercial banking fiasco. Taken in total, this period was a very
serious financial blow to taxpayers and to the shareholders of many
banking institutions.

  Through it all, TrustCo has served its shareholders well with
exemplary growth in the value of their investments, emerging as a
leader in the financial services marketplace. The past decade has been
a proving ground for our management team to significantly enhance the
bank's profitability and productivity in behalf of shareholders.

  TrustCo's success is founded on its accountability and vitality
which are well reflected in the following statistics:

  Since 1983, deposits have risen 534 percent. Average assets during
this same period were boosted 499 percent to $1.947 billion. Our 43
branches--an increase of 207 percent--are staffed by 458 employees
working in their own home towns, promoting the Bank's strong
commitment and presence as a respected local employer. Assets per
employee are up by 258 percent to $4.3 million, a tribute to our
diligence in creating efficiency in operations.

  The net income of TrustCo was $3.36 million in 1983. It has
increased 505 percent, ending 1993 at $20.33 million. During the past
ten years, Return on Equity rose from 12.3 percent to 18+ percent,
then diminished to 16.2 percent, and is on the way back to a planned
18 percent. This all important measure will stand up favorably against
any index for any period we have been able to find. Last August,
TrustCo increased its common stock dividend to shareholders for the
seventeenth consecutive year. The price per share of TrustCo stock has
climbed 704 percent. To put these achievements into perspective,
consider that 100 shares of common stock purchased at the beginning of
1983 would be worth 1,611 shares of common stock today.

  It is important to note that TrustCo's achievements have been
publicly recognized by external resources such as Louis Rukeyser's
Wall Street in 1992 for its remarkable dividend record; selected in
the same year by Financial World as one of the top 200 growth
companies in the United States; cited on the 1993 Honor Roll for
sustained superior performance over 10 years by the respected
investment banking firm of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.--one of only
ten banks in the nation to earn this recognition. TrustCo continues to
set and break its own records for financial performance and favorable
trends quarter after quarter, year after year.

  The lifeblood of the bank is its capacity to adapt to the changing
economy and the needs of its constituencies: shareholders, customers,
and community. TrustCo has at its core a versatile management team
whose diversity allows it to identify a range of initiatives and
translate them into positive results. Conservative, proactive
planning, consistent pursuit of the Capital Region retail and
commercial customer markets, and exceeding the expectations of our
shareholders are the guiding principles which have contributed to our
success.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

  The accounting and financial reporting policies of TrustCo Bank Corp
NY (Company) and Trustco Bank New York (Bank) conform to general
practices within the banking industry and are in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A description of the more
significant policies follows.

  During 1993, the Company created a new subsidiary to hold and manage
certain foreclosed properties. The enclosed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of this new subsidiary.

(b) Consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the
accounts of the subsidiaries after elimination of all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions.

(c) Investment Securities and Securities Held for Sale

  Investment securities are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts to first call or maturity date.
Securities held for sale are held at the lower of amortized cost or
market. Gains and losses on dispositions of these securities are based
on the adjusted cost of the specific security sold.

  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities
at the time of purchase. If management has the intent and the Company
has the ability to hold securities until maturity, they are classified
as investment securities and carried at amortized historical cost.
Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended
to be held to maturity are classified as held for sale and carried at
the lower of cost or market value. Securities held for indefinite
periods of time include securities that management intends to use as
part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold
in response to changes in interest rates and other factors related to
interest rate and resultant prepayment risk changes. Assets held in
trading accounts are carried at market value.

(d) Loans

  Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding. Related loan
fees are generally amortized into income over the applicable loan or
service period. Interest on discounted loans is accrued based upon
methods which approximate the interest method.

  Loan income is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting. When
in the opinion of management the collection of principal or interest
is in doubt, the loan is categorized as non-accrual. Thereafter, no
interest is taken into income until the borrower demonstrates the
ability to make scheduled payments of interest and principal.

(e) Allowance for Possible Loan Losses

  An allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level
considered adequate by management to provide for potential loan losses
based on analysis of the credit risk of the loan portfolio including a
review of past loan experience, current economic conditions and the
underlying collateral value. The allowance is increased by provisions
charged against income and reduced by net charge-offs.

  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance
for losses on loans and real estate owned. Such agencies may require
the Company to recognize additions to the allowances based on their
judgements of information available to them at the time of their
examination.

(f) Bank Premises and Equipment

  Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation computed on either the straight-line or accelerated
methods over the remaining useful lives of the assets. Occupancy
expense comprises all expenses, including maintenance and repair,
related to the operation of Bank premises, net of rental income. Gains
or losses attributed to the retirement or sale of assets are credited
or charged to operations in the year realized.

(g) Real Estate Owned

  Included in other assets are assets received from foreclosures and
in-substance foreclosures. A loan is considered an in-substance
foreclosure when little or no equity is present in the underlying
collateral, considering the current fair value of the collateral;
proceeds for repayment of the loan can be expected to come only from
the operation or sale of the collateral; control of the collateral is
effectively abandoned, or because of the current financial condition
it is doubtful that equity will be rebuilt or the loan repaid in the
foreseeable future.

  Foreclosed assets, including in-substance foreclosures, held for
sale are recorded on an individual basis at the lower of (1) fair
value minus estimated costs to sell or (2) "cost" (defined as the fair
value at initial foreclosure). When a property is acquired or
identified as in-substance foreclosure, the excess of the loan balance
over fair value is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
Subsequent write downs are included in other noninterest expense. At
December 31, 1993, the value of real estate owned was $19.2 million.
The value of real estate owned at December 31, 1992 was $26.6 million.

(h) Income Taxes

  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" and has chosen not to restate prior year financial
statements. Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

(i) Financial Instruments

  The Company is a party to certain financial instruments with off-
balance sheet risk such as commitments to extend credit, unused lines
of credit and letters of credit. It is the Company's policy to record
such instruments when funded.

  In December 1991, the FASB issued Statement No. 107 which requires
additional disclosure about fair value of financial instruments. The
Company has adopted the provisions of Statement No. 107 and has
provided the required disclosures in Note 15.

(j) Dividend Restrictions

  Banking regulations restrict the amount of cash dividends which may
be paid during a year without the written consent of the appropriate
bank regulatory agency. Based on these restrictions, the Company could
pay $32.4 million plus one hundred percent of 1994 net profits.

(k) Amortization of Goodwill

 The excess of the fair value of consideration paid over net assets
acquired (goodwill) was fully amortized as of December 31, 1992.

(l) Reclassification of Prior Year Statements

  It is the Company's policy to reclassify prior year financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.

(m) Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

  The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all of its employees. The benefits are based on years of
service and the employee's compensation during the five years before
retirement. The cost of this program is being funded currently.

  The Company sponsors a defined benefit health care plan for
substantially all retirees and employees. Effective January 1, 1993,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions," which establishes a new accounting principle for the cost
of retiree health care and other postretirement benefits (also see
note 12). Prior to 1993, the Company recognized these benefits on the
pay-as-you-go method (i.e., cash basis). The cumulative effect of the
change in method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions is reported in the 1993 consolidated statement of income.

(2) Acquisition of Home & City Savings Bank

  On September 30, 1991, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of Home & City Savings Bank of Albany, New York in a
purchase business combination. The aggregate purchase price for the
transaction was approximately $72 million consisting of cash and
1,441,050 shares of TrustCo common stock. The excess purchase price
over the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) of approximately
$2.5 million has been fully amortized.

  The results of operations of Home & City are included in the
Company's consolidated statements of income from the date of
acquisition.

  Assuming the acquisition had taken place January 1, 1991 a summary
of the Company's unaudited consolidated results of operations on a pro
forma basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 1991 would have
been as follows:
<TABLE>

Net Income per Common Share  $   1.53

</TABLE>

  The pro forma results are not necessarily representative of the
actual results that would have occurred in the period presented, or
what may be obtained in the future.

(3) Balances at Other Banks

  Trustco Bank New York maintains deposit accounts with several other
commercial banks as compensation for services provided to the Bank in
the normal course of business. These balances are not legally
restricted as to withdrawal but result from informal agreements and
are in lieu of fee assessments. As of December 31, 1993, a total of
$79,000 was on deposit at other banks. This balance was $195,000 as of
December 31, 1992. In addition, the Bank maintains a reserve balance
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as required by regulation by
the Federal Reserve System. This balance, legally restricted as to
withdrawal, totaled $15,907,000 as of December 31, 1993, and
$13,455,000 as of December 31, 1992. For the years ending December 31,
1993 and 1992 these balances averaged $15,517,000 and $14,961,000,

  Proceeds from sales of debt instruments included in investment
securities during 1993, 1992, and 1991 were approximately $0,
$107,639,000, and $37,178,000 respectively. All of the 1993 sales of
debt securities were made from those securities designated as Held for
Sale (See note 4). During 1993, the Company realized proceeds of
approximately $1,877,000 from the sale of its portfolio of equity
securities. Proceeds from this portfolio sale were used to acquire a
small portfolio of equity securities. Management has designated these
securities as trading assets and holds them at market value. The
market value of trading securities at December 31, 1993 was
$2,106,000. There were no trading assets as of December 31, 1992.

  The gross realized gains on sales of debt instruments in 1993, 1992,
and 1991 were $0, $3,346,000, and $492,000 respectively. Gross
realized gains on sales of equity instruments in 1993 were
approximately $229,000.

  Gross realized losses on the sales and calls of debt instruments for
1993, 1992, and 1991 were $0, $407,000, and $26,000 respectively.
Gross realized losses on sales of equity instruments in 1993 were
approximately $21,000.

  The book value of securities pledged to secure public deposits and
for other purposes required by law amounted to $85,634,000 and
$121,075,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The Statement is effective
for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1993. This Statement addresses the accounting for equity securities
that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in
debt securities. Those investments are to be classified in three
categories and accounted for as follows: debt securities that the
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
classified as "held-to-maturity" and reported at amortized cost. Debt
and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the
purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as "trading
securities" and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses included in earnings. Debt and equity securities not classified
as either "held-to-maturity" or "trading securities" are classified as
"available-for-sale securities" and reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings an reported in a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Management believes, at
this time, that the Statement will have no material impact on the
financial statements.

Loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing at
year end were $1,853,000, $6,438,000, and $3,340,000 for 1993, 1992
and 1991 respectively. There were no restructured loans at December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991.

  There were no unused commitments on nonaccrual loans at December 31,
1993 or 1992.

  The Bank has pledged certain of its GNMA mortgage pools as
collateral for standby letters of credit which have been issued. The
book value of pledged mortgages was $16,611,000 and $25,354,000 at
December 31, 1993, and 1992 respectively.

  In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has loan, deposit and
other transactions with executive officers and directors and
organizations with whom such persons are associated. Such transactions
are on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as to
loans, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
with others. The aggregate amount of loans to executive officers,
directors and their immediate families, and to corporations where
executive officers and directors beneficially own a 10% or greater
equity interest was $11,163,000 and $14,320,000 at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. During 1993, loan advances involving these
individuals amounted to $2,080,000 while repayments totaled
$5,237,000.

  On May 31, 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," (SFAS No. 114). SFAS No. 114, which
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994, prescribes recognition criteria for loan
impairment and measurement methods for certain impaired loans and
loans whose terms are modified in troubled-debt restructurings.
Although the Company has not yet performed a detailed analysis of the
effects of the implementation of SFAS No. 114, the Company does not
expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated
financial statements.

  The valuation allowance as established by management takes into
consideration the historical level of taxable income in the prior
years as well as the time period that the items giving rise to the
deferred tax assets turn around.

  The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax
rate. The reasons for these differences are as follows:

(12) Employee Benefits

  The Company maintains a trusteed non-contributory pension plan
covering substantially all full-time employees. The benefits are based
on the sum of (a) a benefit equal to a prior service benefit plus the
average of the employees' highest five consecutive years compensation
in the ten years preceding retirement multiplied by a percentage of
service after a specified date plus (b) a benefit based upon career
average compensation. The amounts contributed to the plan are
determined annually on the basis of (a) the maximum amount that can be
deducted for federal income tax purposes or (b) the amount certified
by a consulting actuary as necessary to avoid an accumulated funding
deficiency as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned
in the future. Assets of the funds are primarily invested in common
stock and fixed income common funds administered by the Bank.

  The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of condition at
December 31, 1993 and 1992:

  The discount rates used in determining the actuarial present value
of the projected benefit obligation were 6.75 percent in 1993 and 7.5
percent in 1992 and 1991. The rate of increase in future compensation
levels used in the actuarial present value of projected benefit
obligations was 5.0 percent in 1993 and 6.0 percent in 1992 and 1991.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 6.5 percent in
1993, 7.0 percent in 1992 and 8.5 percent in 1991.

  The Bank also has unfunded supplementary pension plans under which
additional retirement benefits are accrued for eligible senior and
executive officers.

  The Bank also provides a profit-sharing plan for substantially all
employees. Contributions to the plan, which are based on management
discretion as defined in the plan, amounted to $1,302,000 in 1993,
$1,294,000 in 1992, and $966,000 in 1991.

  An executive incentive plan for executive officers and other
designated senior officers became effective January 1,
1983. Contributions to the plan are based on the Bank's performance and
estimated distributions to participants are accrued during the year
and generally paid in the following year.

  Under the terms of the Company's Stock Option Plan, 1,264,230 shares
are reserved for options and stock appreciation rights (SAR's). As of
December 31, 1993, 887,564 options and 17,704 SAR's remain issued and
outstanding. Of these, 406,465 options and 17,704 SAR's are vested
with exercise prices ranging from $5.27 to $20.19. Under the plan,
107,982 shares remain available to grant at December 31, 1993.

  During 1993, 21,919 options were exercised and no options cancelled.
Additionally, 280,000 options were granted with an exercise price of
$20.19.

  Under the terms of the Directors Stock Option Plan, 100,000 shares
are reserved for options. As of December 31, 1993, 20,000 vested
options remain issued and outstanding, with an exercise price of
$21.38. Under the Plan, 78,000 shares remain available to grant at
December 31, 1993. During 1993, 22,000 options were granted and 2,000
options were exercised.

  In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Statement
106 requires a calculation of the present value of expected benefits
to be paid to employees after their retirement and an allocation of
those benefits to the periods that employees render service to earn
the benefits. The Company permits retirees under age 65 to participate
in the Company's medical plan by paying the same premium as the active
employees. At age 65, Trustco Bank provides a Medicare Supplemental
Program to retirees. The retirees contribute at the same percentage as
active employees. Contributions increase annually or as the premium
increases.

  Since these benefits are currently being provided, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106 effective January 1, 1993, and has reported the
cumulative effect of that change in the December 31, 1993 Consolidated
Statement of Income.

  Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993:

  Expense for 1993 related to the transition obligation was $5.3
million, with an after-tax cost of $3.3 million. Periodic benefit cost
amounts to $467 thousand for the year. The Company funded the plan in
full through the use of a benefit trust during the first quarter of
1993. As a result, periodic benefit costs in future years are expected
to decrease.

  The trust holding the plan assets is subject to federal income taxes
at a 35.0 percent tax rate at December 31, 1993. The expected long term
rate of return on plan assets, after estimated income taxes was 3.3
percent for the year ended December 31, 1993.

  Net period postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the
following components:

Interest cost                           389

                                  =========
</TABLE>

  For measurement purposes, a 16 percent annual rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend
rate) was assumed for 1993; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually
to 5.75 percent by the year 2002 and remain at that level thereafter.

  The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect
on the amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed health
care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1993, by approximately $1.1 million, and the aggregate of
the service and the interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 1993, by
approximately $236 thousand. The weighted-average discount rate used
in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
6.75 percent at December 31, 1993.

(13) Lease Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

(a) Leases

  The Bank leases certain banking premises. Accounting for these
leases is under the "operating method," with minimum rental
commitments in the amounts presented below. The majority of these
leases contain options to renew.

(b) Litigation

  Existing litigation arising in the normal course of business is not
expected to result in any material loss to the Company.

(14) Off-Balance-Sheet Financing and Concentrations of Credit Risk

  The Bank is a party to certain financial instruments with off-
balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in
excess of the amount recognized on the statements of condition. The
contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement
the Bank has in particular classes of financial instruments.

  The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
the other party to the commitments to extend credit and standby
letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of
those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making
commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

  Contract amounts of financial instruments that represent credit risk
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 at fixed and variable interest rates
are as follows:

</TABLE>

  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of
the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon,
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on
a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral, if any, required by
the Bank upon the extension of credit is based on management's credit
evaluation of the customer. Mortgage and construction loan commitments
are secured by a first lien on real estate. Collateral on extensions
of credit for commercial loans varies but may include accounts
receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income
producing commercial property.

  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
These guarantees are primarily issued to support borrowing
arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of
credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
facilities to customers.

  The Bank grants commercial, installment and residential loans to
customers throughout the Capital District of New York State. Although
the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of
its debtors' ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the
real estate sector as well as the overall strength of the economy.

(15) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 107,
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" (SFAS 107),
which requires that the Bank disclose estimated fair values for its
financial instruments. SFAS No. 107 defines fair value of financial
instruments as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a
forced or liquidation sale. SFAS No. 107 uses the same definition for
a financial instrument as the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 105, "Disclosure of Information about Financial
Instruments With Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments With
Concentrations of Credit Risk" (SFAS No. 105). SFAS No. 105 defines a
financial instrument as cash, evidence of ownership interest in an
entity, or a contract that imposes on one entity a contractual
obligation to deliver cash or another financial instrument to a second
entity or to exchange other financial instruments on potentially
unfavorable terms with a second entity and conveys to that second
entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial
instrument from the first entity or to exchange other financial
instruments on potentially favorable terms with the first entity.

  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the Bank's entire
holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market
exists for a significant portion of the Bank's financial instruments,
fair value estimates are based on judgements regarding future expected
net cash flows, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of
various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgement and therefore cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.

  Fair value estimates are based on existing on-and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of
anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities
that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and
liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities
include the deferred tax assets and liabilities and property, plant,
and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the
realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant
effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the
estimates of fair value under SFAS No. 107.

  In addition there are significant intangible assets that SFAS 107
does not recognize, such as the value of "core deposits," the Bank's
branch network and other items generally referred to as "goodwill."

Investments and Securities Held for Sale

The carrying amounts for short-term investments approximate fair value
because they mature in 90 days or less and do not present
unanticipated credit concerns. The fair value of longer-term
investments, except certain state and municipal securities, is
estimated based on bid prices published in financial newpapers or bid
quotations received from securities dealers. The fair value of certain
state and municipal securities is not readily available through market
sources other than dealer quotations, so fair value estimates are
based on quoted market prices of similar instruments, adjusted for
differences between the quoted instruments and the instruments being
valued. See footnotes 4 and 5 for detail disclosure of investment
securities and securities held for sale.

Loans

Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar
financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as
commercial, installment and real estate. Each loan category is further
segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by
performing and nonperforming categories.

  The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting
scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated
market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk
inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on the
contractual term of the loans to maturity.

  Fair value for significant nonperforming loans is based on recent
external appraisals and discounting of cash flows. Estimated cash
flows are discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk
associated with the estimated cash flows. Assumptions regarding credit
risk, cash flows, and discount rates are judgmentally determined using
available market information and specific borrower information.

The following table presents information for loans.

The fair value estimate for credit card loans is based on the value of
existing loans at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992. This
estimate does not include the value that relates to estimated cash
flows from new loans generated from existing card holders over the
remaining life of the portfolio.

Deposit Liabilities

Under SFAS 107, the fair value of deposits with no stated maturity,
such as non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings, NOW accounts,
money market and checking accounts, is estimated to be the amount
payable on demand as of December 31, 1993. The fair value of
certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of
contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

The fair value estimates above do not include the benefit that results
from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared
to the cost of borrowing funds in the market.

Long Term Debt

The fair value of the Company's long term debt, which consists of a
revolving credit facility at the prime interest rate, is estimated to
be book value at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992.

Other Financial Instruments

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest
receivable, accrued interest payable and short term debt are estimated
to be book value at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992.

Commitments to Extend Credit, Standby Letters of Credit, and Financial
Guarantees Written

The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the
fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into
account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present
creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan
commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current
levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of
financial guarantees written and letters of credit is based on fees
currently charged for similar agreements, or on the estimated cost to
terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the
counterparties. Fees such as these are not a major part of the Bank's
business. Therefore, based upon the above facts, book value equals
fair value and the amounts are not significant.

 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

 KPMG Peat Marwick
 Certified Public Accountants
 74 North Pearl Street
 Albany, New York 12207

 The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TrustCo Bank Corp NY:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
 condition of TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December
 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of
 income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
 of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993.
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
 the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
 opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
 audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
 auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
 perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
 financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
 includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
 amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
 includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
 estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
 financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
 provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
 above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
 position of TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December
 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their
 cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
 December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
 accounting principles.

 As discussed in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial
 statements, in 1993 the Company adopted the provisions of the
 Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" which
 changed its method of accounting for income taxes. As discussed in
 note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company also
 adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
 Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than
 Pensions" in 1993 which changed its method of accounting for
 postretirement benefits other than pensions.

Five-Year Summary

  The management of TrustCo has identified return on equity as the
principal measurement index in evaluating its effectiveness in
fulfilling its responsibility to the shareholders. Return on assets,
while an important measure of performance, is regarded as a less
sensitive indicator of true shareholder return. The Company's return
on average shareholders' equity for 1993 was 16.18 percent. This key
performance indicator has exceeded 15 percent in each of the past five
years. Return on average assets performance has remained consistently
positive throughout the period as well, providing further evidence of
steady performance.

  Cash dividends per share have increased 2.5 times over the past five
years, for a compound annual increase of 25.9 percent. Management
believes that retained earnings should be maintained at a level that
fully supports, but does not exceed, the Company's needs, with
earnings above such a level returned to the owners in the form of cash
dividends.

  This consistently strong performance in all areas indicates the
success enjoyed by the Company in promoting the Bank's image as "YOUR
HOME TOWN BANK" to a broad range of customers. Management intends to
continue to focus its attention on being the best retail banking
company in the Capital District.

Financial Review

LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST SENSITIVITY

  A sound asset/liability management program must balance the goals of
maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet depositors' requirements,
while at the same time continuing to satisfy credit needs in our
markets. Management has addressed these issues by developing a
maturity mix that maximizes flexibility in responding to both
liquidity needs and interest rate fluctuations, and by consistently
focusing attention on developing and expanding stable funding sources.
The continuing volatility of interest rates during 1993, a year in
which Federal funds rates fluctuated by 275 basis points, serves to
highlight the importance of active management of earning assets and
interest bearing liabilities in enabling the Company to attain its
financial goals.

  TrustCo has emphasized the funding of asset growth through the
expansion of its core deposit base. These funds (which represent total
deposits, less certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more) have
historically proven to be the most stable and least costly sources of
funds. Despite ongoing competitive pressures, the level of core
deposits has increased steadily, rising from 91.0 percent of average
total liabilities in 1991 to 93.9 percent in 1992. During 1993, the
level of core deposits continued to expand, reaching an impressive
95.2 percent of average total liabilities at December 31, 1993. This
growth was centered during 1993 in savings accounts, which increased
significantly, while other forms of deposits declined in aggregate.
Core deposit growth for 1993 of 6.3 percent outpaced the 5.2 percent
increase in interest earning assets, providing a further indication of
the stability of funding sources.

  Liquidity and interest sensitivity are related in that each is
affected by maturing assets and liabilities. Interest sensitivity
analysis, however, takes the additional step of considering that
certain assets and liabilities are subject to rate adjustment(s) prior
to maturity. The objective of interest sensitivity management is to
establish and maintain satisfactory net interest margins throughout
all phases of a full interest rate cycle.

  The measurement of the interest rate sensitivity position at any
specific point in time involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
Within this context, the accompanying interest sensitivity analysis,
divided into future repricing timeframes, helps to illustrate the
potential impact of future interest rate changes on net interest
income. It should be noted that interest sensitivity is only one
indicator of the extent to which changes in interest rates have the
potential to affect net interest income. The components of the earning
asset and interest bearing liability portfolios are also changing
continuously. The Company has not, to date, used financial futures or
interest rate swaps in the management of interest rate risk.

  For purposes of this analysis, the maturity and repricing of loans
is based on stated maturity or earliest repricing date. For securities
held for sale and investment securities, the earlier of average life
or stated maturity is used.

  The category of regular savings, NOW and money market accounts
includes balances of $110,630,000, $238,871,000, $11,537,000 and
$719,999,000 for Money Market accounts, NOW accounts, Investment
checking accounts and regular savings respectively. Although these
deposits are subject to immediate withdrawal, it is management's
experience that they mature or reprice over a full interest rate
cycle. Time accounts, short term debt and long term debt are based on
stated maturity.

NET INTEREST INCOME

  Net interest income represents the difference between interest
related income and expense. Taxable equivalent net interest income for
1993 rose $4.6 million, or 6.7 percent to $74.0 million, after a $23.8
million increase in 1992. Despite ongoing competitive pressure in both
funding sources and investment alternatives, taxable equivalent net
interest income as a percentage of average assets increased 6 basis
points to 4.04 percent in 1993, after declining 22 basis points in
1992.

  The following table summarizes the major components of net interest
income.

  Changes in interest income and expense result from variances in the
volume of outstanding interest earning assets and interest bearing
liabilities, from fluctuations in the level of interest rates earned
and paid, or from a combination of these factors. Average interest
earning assets have steadily increased, reaching $1.8 billion in 1993.
Taxable equivalent yields on these assets have fallen with the general
level of interest rates, declining 1.2 percent in 1992, and an
additional 1.0 percent to 7.4 percent in 1993. Interest bearing
liabilities have consistently increased, growing to $1.7 billion in
1993. Interest paid on these funds has declined steadily with overall
rate movements, decreasing 1.3 percent in 1992 and an additional 1.1
percent to 3.6 percent in 1993.

  The following table sets forth, for each major category of interest
earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, changes in 1993 and
1992 taxable equivalent interest income and expense, allocating the
changes to variances in either volume or rate.

</TABLE>

COMMERCIAL LOANS

  Both average commercial loan outstandings and taxable equivalent
interest income on commercial loans decreased during 1993. The decline
in volume is attributable in part to generally flat loan demand in the
Bank's market area, and in part to the resolution of a number of
problem credits acquired in connection with the purchase of Home &
City Savings Bank in 1991.

  Average commercial loan outstandings decreased 12.5 percent to $237
million in 1993. Taxable equivalent interest income on commercial
loans was reduced 17.3 percent during 1993 as a result of decreasing
average volume, in combination with declining interest rates. The
taxable equivalent interest rate on commercial loans was 8.6 percent
in 1993, compared with 9.1 percent in 1992 and 10.2 percent in 1991.
The Bank's commercial loan portfolio is a component of management's
asset/liability management program. As indicated in the following
table, 52.1 percent of the commercial loan portfolio either matures
within one year or has a floating interest rate.

</TABLE>

  Good corporate citizenship and a resource allocation strategy that
emphasizes diversification have led the Bank to pursue opportunities
in the commercial lending area that allow it to address the needs of
businesses within its marketplace, while at the same time maintaining
the high quality of the loan portfolio. Requests for commercial loans
secured by real estate are evaluated on an individual-case basis.
Collateral standards conform to all applicable regulatory standards.
Although commercial loans are generally granted for a specified
duration, certain loans may be renewed in the ordinary course of
business. Requests for loan renewals are based on internal credit
evaluation standards, and on market conditions in effect at the time
renewal requests are received.

  The Bank continues to hold no foreign debt. In addition, the
commercial loan portfolio contains no concentrations of credit with
either individual borrowing interests or with specific industries.
Substantially all loans in the portfolio have been originated locally,
and their diversity is reflective of the heterogeneity of the Capital
Region's economy.

REAL ESTATE LOANS

  Real estate-related credit products (primarily first mortgages and
Home Equity Credit Lines) comprised the growth portion of the Bank's
loan portfolio during 1993. Competitive pricing and aggressive
marketing of these products have allowed the Bank to expand portfolio
volume in an increasingly crowded marketplace as it works toward
fulfilling its mission of functioning as the premier retail bank in
the Capital Region.

  Home Equity Credit Lines outstanding at December 31, 1993 aggregated
$202.0 million, compared with year-end balances of $195.2 million in
1992 and $168.2 million in 1991. Mortgage balances, with attractive
rate offerings and active promotion, increased $73.3 million at
December 31, 1993.

  Average interest rates on real estate loans continued to decline,
reflecting national and local trends. The average interest rate for
1993 was 8.3 percent, compared with 9.0 percent in 1992 and 10.0
percent in 1991. The increase in the size of the Bank's portfolio,
however, contributed to an increase of 1.2 percent in 1993 in interest
income on real estate loans.

  Loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties
represented over 99 percent of the Bank's real estate loan portfolio
at December 31, 1993. The vast majority of the loans in portfolio are
collateralized by properties within Trustco's market areas. The Bank's
knowledge of local properties and market conditions enhances the
quality of its real estate loans, all of which are underwritten in
accordance with collateralization standards which conform to
applicable regulatory standards. Loans funded by the Bank in 1993, as
has been the case in prior years, are retained in portfolio rather
than being packaged for secondary market resale.

  On May 31, 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (SFAS No. 114). SFAS No. 114,
which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994, prescribes recognition criteria for
loan impairment and measurement methods for certain impaired loans and
loans whose terms are modified in troubled debt restructurings.
Although the Company has not yet performed a detailed analysis of the
effects of the implementation of SFAS No. 114, the Company does not
expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated
financial statements.

INSTALLMENT LOANS

  Tax law changes have reduced the attractiveness of installment loans
for many customers. Despite this, Trustco continues to offer a full
range of these products as part of its comprehensive commitment to
retail banking in its markets. Average balances, including credit card
outstandings, decreased 31.1 percent in 1993 to $33.1 million. The
volume of applications for all types of installment loans was reduced
during 1993. The average yield on installment loan products, after
increasing from 13.8 percent in 1991 to 14.6 percent in 1992, declined
again to 13.8 percent in 1993, reflecting the general downward trend
in interest rates.

SECURITIES HELD FOR SALE

  Securities held for sale represent that portion of the investment
portfolio which the Company does not intend to hold until maturity.
These securities are managed in conjunction with short-term investment
vehicles such as Federal funds sold, and with potentially volatile
funding sources such as short-term debt and large ($100,000 or more)
certificates of deposit in such a way as to maximize management's
flexibility in responding to structural changes in the composition of
borrowed funds and to seasonal and/or cyclical fluctuations in loan
demand.

  The portfolio of securities held for sale as of December 31, 1993
consisted of U.S. Treasury Notes with a book value of $230.6 million
and a market value of $236.5 million, and corporate bonds with a book
value of $10.2 million and a market value of $11.6 million. Securities
held for sale having a book value of $41.2 million were pledged to
secure public deposits and for purposes required by law at December
31, 1993. The average taxable equivalent yield on securities held for
sale in 1993 was 6.9 percent, a decline of 52 basis points from 1992
levels.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

  Investment securities represent that portion of the investment
portfolio which the Company has both the capacity and the intent to
hold until maturity. These securities are held to increase yield as
part of management's program for maximizing longer-term overall returns.

  The quality of the portfolio, both of investment securities and of
securities held for sale, is evidenced by the fact that over 96
percent of total holdings consist of either U.S. Treasury securities,
or instruments carrying one of the top three investment grades from at
least one leading rating agency. The December 31, 1993 book value of
securities pledged to secure public deposits or for purposes required
by law was $85.6 million. The only obligations (other than U.S.

 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 affected the income potential of the
portfolio by eliminating the deduction for carrying non-qualified
municipal investments. Accordingly, investments are selected with a
view toward safety of principal, as well as the generation of the
highest possible income. Trustco Bank New York continues to serve
Capital Region governmental units by providing capital and operating
funds through active participation in the municipal bond and note
market.

  The weighted average maturity of investment securities and
investments held for sale declined in 1993, increasing the rate
sensitivity of the portfolio. The approximate weighted average
portfolio maturity was 3 years, 7 months at December 31, 1993,
compared with 4 years, 3 months at the end of 1992, and 5 years, 9
months at year-end 1991. The following tables detail the maturity
distribution and weighted average yield of the Company's investment
securities and securities held for sale as of December 31, 1993. The
Company's mortgage backed securities are calculated in the maturity
section of the table on the basis of their stated average life of 3
years, 6 months rather than their weighted average maturity of 14
years, 8 months. Weighted average yields are calculated on the basis
of effective yield to the earlier of call or maturity date,
considering applicable premium or discount, but not converting yields
to a taxable equivalent basis.

  The market value of the investment portfolio at December 31, 1993
was $21.8 million above the book value. Market appreciation aggregated
$21.1 million and $19.2 million at the end of 1992 and 1991,
respectively. The Company realized $6.2 million in gains from the sale
of securities, primarily U.S. Treasury Notes. The proceeds of these
sales were reinvested in securities of similar quality and maturity,
which were designated as Held for Sale.

</TABLE>

  Taxable equivalent earnings on investment securities declined 33.1
percent to $29.6 million, partially as a result of the
reclassification of certain securities into the Held for Sale
designation, and partly due to a 130 basis point decline to 6.5
percent in average taxable equivalent yield. Earnings on investment
securities in 1992 rose 20.2 percent, as a 36.0 percent increase in
volume more than offset a reduction of 11.6 percent in average taxable
equivalent yield.

  U.S. Government and Agency obligations represented 60.1 percent of
the average book value of investment securities in 1993, compared to
60.3 percent in 1992 and 67.2 percent in 1991. Taxable equivalent
interest income on this segment of the portfolio decreased 35.5
percent to $16.9 million in 1993, as a generally declining trend in
interest rates combined with the reduction in book value resulting
from management's designation of a Held for Sale portfolio.

  The Company's average investment in the obligations of states and
political subdivisions declined 40.2 percent from 1992 levels to $32.7
million, or 7.2 percent of the book value of the 1993 average
investment portfolio. This decrease is associated with the limited
availability of qualifying designated small issue obligations that
meet the Company's standards for credit rating, maturity and yield.
The average taxable equivalent yield on these securities in 1993 was
6.4 percent, compared to 7.3 percent in 1992 and 8.4 percent in 1991.
Taxable equivalent income on state and municipal obligations fell 48.2
percent to $2.1 million in 1993.

  The Company holds a portfolio of mortgage backed securities, in
which management has invested because such instruments offer market
liquidity, relatively high yields, limited credit risk and simplified
payment collection. The primary risk connected with these instruments
is that declining interest rates will accelerate prepayment volume for
the loans supporting the securities, an event which reduces the
effective yield of the investment and exposes the amounts prepaid to
interest rate risk.

  Average holdings of mortgage backed securities decreased 20.1
percent from 1992 to 1993. Holdings of mortgage backed securities
backed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies (GNMA, FNMA,
and FHLMC) increased during 1993, but the Company sold its holdings of
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) late in 1992. There are no
other mortgage derivative products in the Company's portfolio at
December 31, 1993. The average yield on mortgage backed securities was
7.1 percent at December 31, 1993. Income on mortgage backed securities
was $8.4 million for 1993, as compared to $12.4 million in 1992 and
$4.5 million in 1991. Other securities in portfolio at December 31,
1993 consist primarily of investment grade corporate bonds.

  In May, 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1993. This Statement addresses the accounting for
equity issues that have readily determinable fair values, and for all
investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be classified
in three categories and accounted for as follows: debt securities that
the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity
are classified as "held-to-maturity" and reported at amortized cost.
Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for
the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as
"trading securities" and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses included in earnings. Debt and equity securities not
classified as either "held-to-maturity" or "trading securities" are
classified as "available-for-sale securities" and reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and
reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Management
believes at this time that the Statement will have no material impact
on the financial statements.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD

  The Company has historically allocated a significant portion of its
available resources to Federal funds sold. Factors considered by
management in determining appropriate levels for this form of
investment include: available rates on other short-term products, the
volume of short-term borrowings and large-denomination ($100,000 and
over) certificates of deposit, and overall corporate liquidity goals.
Average Federal funds balances in 1993 were $163.6 million, a 44.2
percent increase over 1992. Interest income from Federal funds sales
rose 28.9 percent in 1993 to $4.9 million. The average interest rate
on this investment continued to decline, decreasing 39.2 percent
between 1991 and 1992, and exhibiting a further 36 basis point
reduction to an average rate of 3.0 percent in 1993.

==========================================================================================
</TABLE>

  Despite an increase of $88.0 million in aggregate interest bearing
deposits, interest expense on deposits decreased $14.3 million in
1993, a reflection of continuing downward movement in interest rates.
The average rate paid on interest bearing time deposits was 3.6
percent, as compared to 4.7 percent in 1992 and 6.0 percent in 1991.

  Non-interest bearing demand deposits are a significant funding
resource for the Bank, and play an important role in liability
management, with a direct effect on net income. Average demand
deposits rose 4.6 percent in 1993 to $92.8 million. These funds
represented 5.2 percent of average total deposits in 1993 as compared
to 5.3 percent in 1992 and 8.2 percent in 1991.

  The categories of interest bearing deposits which experienced growth
in 1993 were regular savings and NOW accounts. Both of these products
were marketed aggressively during 1993, and the growth in outstandings
represents the attraction of new funds and expansion of Capital Region
market share.

  Average regular savings account balances rose 26.4 percent to $730.2
million. Approximately half of the increase represented new customer
accounts, with the balance consisting of internal transfers and
interest credits. Despite the increase in average balances, a decline
of 121 basis points in the average rate paid on these accounts
resulted in a decrease of $2.1 million in interest expense on savings
accounts.

  Average NOW account balances grew 3.7 percent to $242.9 million
during 1993. However, interest expense declined 34.1 percent in 1993
due to continuing reductions in average rates, which dropped from 4.2
percent in 1991, to 2.7 percent in 1992, and to 1.7 percent in 1993.

  Other types of interest bearing deposits decreased in 1993. The
average volume of money market checking accounts decreased by 14.6
percent to $113.6 million during 1993. Other time accounts, comprised
primarily of certificates of deposit under $100,000 and Individual
Retirement Accounts, fell 7.1 percent in 1993. The average rate paid
on these accounts dropped from 7.3 percent in 1991, to 6.0 percent in
1992, and to 5.2 percent in 1993.

  The Bank does not rely to any significant extent on certificates of
deposit in amounts of $100,000 or more. During 1993, the average
volume of these instruments fell to $33.4 million, a drop of 25.0
percent from the 1992 average volume of $44.6 million. The average
rate paid on these certificates declined from 5.78 percent in 1992 to
5.44 percent in 1993. The following table sets forth, by time
remaining until maturity, the aggregate amount of certificates of
deposit of $100,000 or more that were carried on the books of the
Company as of December 31, 1993.

  There is no concentration of deposits whose loss could have a
material adverse effect on the business operations of TrustCo. Public
funds are secured by the pledge of collateral in accordance with
applicable state and federal regulations. TrustCo's investment
portfolio is managed in a manner which accommodates such requirements.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

  Short-term debt consists primarily of securities sold under
agreements to repurchase. These transactions involve contracts under
which the Bank sells a U.S. Treasury security to a customer, while
simultaneously agreeing to repurchase the same security on a specified
future date at a predetermined price. The transactions do not normally
exceed ninety days in duration.

  The average volume of the Company's short-term debt declined 31.6
percent to $17.4 million in 1993, following a 40.6 percent decline in
1992. The average rate paid on these transactions in 1993 was 2.2
percent, as compared to 3.0 percent in 1992 and 5.1 percent in 1991.
Interest expense on short-term debt for 1993 was $380 thousand, down
from $757 thousand in 1992 and $2.2 million in 1991.

LONG-TERM DEBT

  At December 31, 1992, consolidated long-term debt consisted solely
of $5.0 million in 9.4 percent senior notes. These obligations were
paid in full on September 30, 1993.

  Consolidated long-term debt at December 31, 1993 consists entirely
of $2.75 million borrowed by ORE Subsidiary Corporation at the prime
rate under a $10 million revolving credit facility. Interest paid on
long term debt declined to $357 thousand in 1993, after aggregating
$470 thousand in both 1992 and 1991.

PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES

  The provision for possible loan losses represents a charge to
expense related to potential future loss in the loan portfolio. The
amount charged in each period reflects management's assessment of the
risks inherent in the portfolio at a specific point in time, based on
loan volume, economic conditions, and the Bank's historical loan loss
experience. The 1993 provision for loan losses of $11.6 million was
8.8 percent lower than the amount charged in 1992, while the provision
of $12.7 million in 1992 was 95.6 percent higher than in 1991. The
average allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of average loans
outstanding, was 3.0 percent in 1993, as compared with 2.4 percent in
1992 and 2.6 percent in 1991.

the largest component of other income in 1993, rising 1.7 percent to
$6.5 million. Net gains on securities designated as "held for sale"
aggregated $5.9 million in 1993, primarily as the result of sales of
U.S. Treasury Notes. Fee income in the Trust Department in 1993 was
$4.3 million, an increase of 12.4 percent over 1992 levels, which had
declined 2.6 percent since 1991.

</TABLE>

  Aggregate non-interest expenses grew 1.7 percent to $43.5 million in
1993. Non-interest expenses for 1992 were 51.7 percent above 1991
levels, primarily due to the acquisition of Home & City Savings Bank.

  The largest component of non-interest expense continues to be
salaries and employee benefits. These costs rose 5.0 percent in 1993
after increases of 35.7 percent in 1992 and 17.7 percent in 1991. The
increases were primarily due to routine wage adjustments, increased
payroll taxes, and the growing cost of providing employee benefits.
While compensation costs continue to represent a significant component
of non-interest expense, the effectiveness of management controls in
this area is evidenced by the Bank's consistent placement in the most
efficient quartile of comparable organizations as defined in the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Uniform Bank
Performance Reports.

  Significant items within the category of other expenses for 1993
included a reduction of $1.2 million, or 53.9 percent, in advertising
and promotional expense as a result of management's decision to scale
down all advertising campaigns. Professional expenses decreased $1.8
million, or 41.6 percent in 1993, mainly as the result of eliminating
computer consultant services. These costs, which were associated with
various systems conversions, totalled $1.4 million in 1992. Other real
estate expenses increased $4.5 million in 1993, as several sizable
problem assets acquired in the Home & City purchase moved toward
resolution.

  In 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Statement No. 106
requires a calculation of the present value of expected benefits to be
paid to employees after their retirement and an allocation of those
benefits to the periods in which the employees render service to earn
the benefits. The Company adopted Statement No. 106 on January 1, 1993
at a cost of $5,770,000. The Company funded the resulting liability
during the first quarter of 1993 with investments which will generate
earnings that will reduce period post retirement benefit costs in
future years.

APPLICABLE INCOME TAXES

  Applicable income taxes and effective tax rates were $12.5 million
and 34.6 percent for 1993, $9.3 million and 34.8 percent for 1992 and
$4.9 million and 27.4 percent for 1991. Income taxes for financial
reporting purposes differ from the amount computed by applying the
statutory rate to income before taxes. This difference is due
primarily to tax-exempt income from certain loans and investment
securities and non-deductible expenses, primarily goodwill. For
additional information concerning income taxes, refer to Note 11 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

  The Company currently accounts for income taxes under FASB Statement
No. 109, which changed the Company's method of accounting for income
taxes from the deferred method required under APB 11 to the asset and
liability method. Under the deferred method, annual income tax expense
is matched with pretax accounting income by providing deferred taxes
at current tax rates for timing differences between the determination
of net income for financial reporting and tax purposes. The objective
of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and
liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such
amounts are realized or settled. The tax effects of temporary
differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities are detailed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

  TrustCo meets all the regulatory requirements for designation as a
well capitalized bank holding company. The Company has established the
regulatory standards for designation as a well capitalized company as
its internal minimum capital requirement.

  Designation by the regulatory agencies as a well capitalized bank
holding company requires: a leverage ratio of 5.0 percent or greater;
a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent or greater; and a
total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater. At December
31, 1993, Trustco had a leverage ratio of 6.67 percent, a Tier I risk-
based capital ratio of 12.06 percent, and a total risk-based capital
ratio of 13.34 percent. The Company's capital ratios were all in
excess of regulatory minimums for designation as well capitalized for
1992 and 1991 as well.

  Equity capital stood at $129.9 million at December 31, 1993, an
increase of $9.5 million over the 1992 level, which in turn had grown
$9.3 million from year-end 1991. Substantially all of the increase in
equity capital in this period was the result of earnings retention. At
December 31, 1993, equity capital represented 6.6 percent of total
assets, compared with 6.2 percent at year-end 1992 and 6.3 percent at
the end of 1991. The strength of the equity capital of the Company and
its subsidiary Bank affords protection to the depositors, and also
affords the Company ready access to the debt and equity markets.

  The book value of TrustCo stock has increased steadily, growing from
$8.50 per share at year-end 1991, to $9.15 at the end of 1992, and to
$9.82 per share at December 31, 1993. The Company had no commitments
for the future issuance of securities, other than its stock option
plan, in place at December 31, 1993.

  Dividends paid on common stock in 1993 totalled $11.6 million, or
56.9 percent of net income. In addition, the Company paid a 2 for 1
stock split in November, 1993, while simultaneously raising the
annualized dividend rate to $1.00 per share. During 1992, cash
dividends represented 51.1 percent of income, and a 5 for 4 stock
split was paid. The 1991 cash dividend payout of 45.0 percent of
income was supplemented with a 10 percent stock dividend.

CREDIT RISK REVIEW

  Much of what is discussed in this financial review is based on the
underlying principle of prudent management of the Company's resources.
Management has consistently endeavored to be appropriately responsive
to a variety of changes in the Company's markets, while at all times
preserving its financial strength. The Company has a well-established
tradition of avoiding high-risk resource allocation strategies in
favor of more secure opportunities based on sound financial
relationships. Historical levels of non-performing loans, charge-offs,
and the allowance for loan losses are all indicative of the prudence
of this approach.

  However, the extension of credit involves the inherent risk that
funds advanced will not be repaid. Weighing risks against rewards
within the context of the Company's overall business strategy is the
primary task in portfolio management. This effort requires the
thorough review of a prospective borrower's business strategy,
financial statements, credit history and available collateral prior to
the extension of credit. It also requires the regular scrutiny of
existing loans, affording management the opportunity to respond
quickly to deteriorating credits in order to minimize their
consequences. The loan portfolio is subject to ongoing internal
review, as well as to periodic examination by state and federal
supervisory authorities and the Company's independent certified public
accountants.

  The Company has historically experienced modest levels of net loan
losses. Net loans charged against the allowance for loan losses during
1993 were $4.4 million, as compared to $4.8 million in 1992 and $1.6
million in 1991. Net charge-offs represented 0.43 percent of average
outstanding loans in 1993, 0.48 percent in 1992, and 0.26 percent in
1991. The increase in net charge-offs after 1991 is associated with
the volume of problem credits acquired in connection with the purchase
of Home & City Savings Bank. Management currently anticipates that
charge-offs will continue in the range of 0.40 percent of average
outstanding loans.

  The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1993 was $34.1
million, or 3.2 percent of net loans outstanding as of that date. At
year-end 1992 and 1991, the allowance for loan losses represented,
respectively, 2.6 and 1.9 percent of outstanding loans. Charge-off
coverage (the ratio of the year-end allowance for loan losses to net
charge-offs for the year) is an indicator of the adequacy of the
allowance. This ratio was 7.7 times for 1993, as compared with 5.6
times for 1992 and 11.8 times for 1991. The most recent examination by
the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Bank
found that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at the date of
the examination.

  The table which follows details the historical relationship among
outstanding loans, the loan loss allowance, additions to the allowance
charged to operating expense, charge-offs and recoveries.

DISCUSSION OF LOAN PORTFOLIO RISK ELEMENTS

  Management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses is influenced by a variety of factors, including: the Company's
standards for granting new loans and evaluating existing credits; the
component elements of the loan portfolio and the growth patterns
exhibited therein; current economic conditions; the loss potential of
loans classified by internal reviewers, supervisory authorities and
independent accountants; the level of past due and non-accrual loans;
and the Company's historical loan loss experience.

  The allowance for loan losses over the past five years has averaged
2.61 percent of average loans outstanding, while net loan losses for
the same period have averaged a significantly lower 0.34 percent of
average loans. Additionally, while it is common industry practice for
the total of non-accrual loans, loans in excess of 90 days delinquent
and renegotiated loans to exceed the allowance for loan losses, the
Company's volume of loans so classified of $1.9 million at year-end
1993 and $7.4 million at year-end 1992 was far lower than the year-end
allowance for loan loss levels of $34.1 million in 1993 and $26.9
million in 1992.

  The ratio of recoveries on prior period charge-offs to loans charged
off is a test of both the conservatism of charge-off practices and the
forcefulness of collection efforts. Over the past five years, the
Company's recovery ratio has averaged 27.0 percent on a weighted
basis, indicating that charge-offs are taken in a timely manner and
that recovery efforts are effective.

  The adequacy of the loan loss allowance is further supported by the
lack of foreign debt in the portfolio, the absence of single-borrower
or single-industry concentrations, and the local composition of the
loan portfolio. Past experience suggests that it is not practical for
management to allocate the allowance for loan losses to specific
categories within the loan portfolio on a statistical or other basis.

NON-PERFORMING LOANS

  Loans categorized as "non-performing" include those credits on a non-
accrual basis, credits contractually past due 90 days or more, and
credits whose terms have been renegotiated due to the financial
deterioration of the borrower. Non-performing loans receive
management's close attention.

  Loans are placed in non-accrual status when, in the opinion of
management, the collection of additional interest is in doubt.
Thereafter, no interest is taken into income unless received in cash
or until such time as the borrower demonstrates the ability to make
scheduled payments of interest and principal. The following table sets
forth information with regard to non-performing loans:

</TABLE>

  Non-performing year-end 1993 commercial loans of $114 thousand were
0.05 percent of outstandings (compared with 1.6 percent and 0.1
percent at year-end 1992 and 1991 respectively). Real estate loans of
$1.5 million were 0.2 percent of outstandings (compared with 0.4
percent at year-end 1992 and 0.6 percent at year-end 1991). There were
$250 thousand in non-performing installment loans, or 0.9 percent of
outstandings, at year-end 1993 compared to 0.9 percent at year-end
1992 and 0.5 percent at year-end 1991. Most of the increase in non-
performing loans was due to loans acquired from Home & City Savings
Bank in 1991. With respect to loans in non-accrual status at December
31, 1993, the gross interest income that would have been recorded
during 1993 had the loans remained current was $1 thousand, and the
amount that was actually recorded amounted to $1 thousand. As of
December 31, 1993, there were no other loans classified for regulatory
purposes that management reasonably expects will materially impact
future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

  Real estate properties acquired in satisfaction of loans are
classified as other assets and recorded on an individual basis at the
lower of fair value minus estimated costs to sell or "cost" (defined
as the fair value at initial foreclosure). The value of real estate
owned was $6.2 million at December 31, 1993 and $5.9 million at
December 31, 1992. In-substance foreclosures were valued at $14.9
million at the end of 1993 and $20.7 million at the end of 1992. Most
of the increase in real estate owned and in-substance foreclosure was
due to assets acquired from Home & City Savings Bank in 1991.

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity; Interest
Rates and Interest Differential

  The following table summarizes the component distribution of average
balance sheet, related interest income and expense and the average
yields on earning assets and rates on interest bearing liabilities of
the Company and the Bank on a tax equivalent basis for each of the
reported periods. Non-accrual loans are included in loans for this
analysis. When a loan is placed in non-accrual status, interest income
is recorded only to the extent actually received in cash.

     subdivisions, and equity securities are exempt from federal and state
     taxation. Appropriate adjustments have been made to reflect the
     equivalent amount of taxable income that would have been necessary to
     generate an equal amount of after tax income. Federal and New York
     State tax rates used to calculate income on a tax equivalent basis
     were 35.0 percent and 10.35 percent respectively for 1993, and 34.0
     percent and 10.35 percent respectively for 1992 and 1991.

                           INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

KPMG Peat Marwick
Certified Public Accountants
74 North Pearl Street
Albany, New York 12207

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TrustCo Bank Corp NY:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition
of TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1993. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 1993 the Company adopted the provisions of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" which
changed its method of accounting for income taxes. As discussed in
note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company also
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" in 1993
which changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions.
