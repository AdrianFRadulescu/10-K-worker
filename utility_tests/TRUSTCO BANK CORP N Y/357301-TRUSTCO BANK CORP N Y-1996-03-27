                            PART I
Item 1. Business

General
- --------
    TrustCo Bank Corp NY  ("TrustCo") is a one-bank holding
company having its principal place of business at 320 State
Street, Schenectady, New York 12305. TrustCo was incorporated
under the laws of New York in 1981 to acquire all of the
outstanding stock of Trustco Bank, National Association,
formerly known as Trustco Bank New York, and prior to that The
Schenectady Trust Company.  Following receipt of necessary
regulatory approvals, TrustCo commenced business on July 1,
1982.  In 1991, TrustCo acquired, for a combination of cash
and TrustCo common stock, Home & City Savings Bank ("Home &
City") located in Albany, New York.  At the time of the
acquisition, Home & City operated 16 branches, and had total
assets of approximately $ 848 million, deposits of $ 750
million and shareholders' equity of $ 93 million.  Through
policy and practice, TrustCo continues to emphasize that it is
an equal opportunity employer. There were 434 full-time
equivalent employees at year-end 1995.  TrustCo had 5,092
shareholders of record  as of December 31, 1995, and the
closing price of the stock at that date was $22.125.

Bank Subsidiary
- ----------------
   On November 16, 1994 TrustCo initiated the process to
convert its banking subsidiary, Trustco Bank New York, a New
York state chartered trust company, to a national banking
association operating under the name Trustco Bank, National
Association (the  Bank ).  The conversion was undertaken to
minimize duplicative federal/state compliance issues.  The
conversion became effective on February 1, 1995.  The Bank is
a national banking association engaged in a general commercial
banking business serving individuals, partnerships,
corporations, municipalities and governments of New York.
Trustco operates 23 automatic teller machines and 47 banking
offices in Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga,
Schenectady, Warren, and Washington counties of New York
State.  The largest part of such business consists of
accepting deposits and making loans and investments. The Bank
provides a wide range of both personal and business banking
services. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System
and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. The Bank accounted
for substantially all of TrustCo's 1995 consolidated net
income and average assets.

    The trust department of the Bank serves as executor of
estates and trustee of personal trusts, provides estate
planning and related advice, provides custodial services and
acts as trustee for various types of employee benefit plans
and corporate pension and profit sharing trusts. The aggregate
market value of the assets under trust, custody or management
was approximately $777 million as of December 31, 1995.

    The daily operations of the Bank remain the responsibility
of its Board of Directors and officers, subject to the overall
supervision by TrustCo. TrustCo derives most of its income
from dividends paid to it by its subsidiary Bank. The accounts
of the Bank are included in TrustCo's consolidated financial
statements.

ORE Subsidiary
- ---------------
    During 1993, TrustCo created ORE Subsidiary Corp., a New
York corporation, to hold and manage certain foreclosed
properties acquired by the Bank. The accounts of this
subsidiary are included in TrustCo's consolidated financial
statements.

Competition
- -------------
    TrustCo faces strong competition in its market areas, both
in attracting deposits and making loans.  The Bank's most
direct competition for deposits, historically, has come from
other commercial banks, savings associations and credit
unions, which are located, or have branches in those areas.
The Bank also faces competition for deposits from national
brokerage houses, short-term money market funds, and other
corporate and government securities funds.  Factors affecting
the acquisition of deposits include pricing, office locations
and hours of operation, the variety of deposit accounts
offered, and the quality of customer service provided.
Competition for loans has been especially keen during the last
five years.  Commercial banks, local thrift institutions,
traditional mortgage brokers affiliated with local, but
nationally franchised real estate brokers, are all active and
aggressive competitors.  The Bank competes in the environment
by providing a full range of financial services based on a
tradition of financial strength and integrity dating from its
inception.  It competes for loans, principally through the
interest rates and loan fees it charges, and the efficiency
and quality of services it provides to borrowers.

     TrustCo operates in a number of communities where the
competition ranges from other locally based commercial and
savings banks, to branches of the largest financial
institutions in the United States.  In the Capital District
area of New York State, TrustCo's principal competitors are
local operations of super regional banks, branch offices of
money center banks, and locally based commercial and savings
banks.  TrustCo is the largest commercial bank headquartered
in the Capital District area.

Supervision and Regulation
- ----------------------------
    Banking is a highly regulated industry, with numerous
federal and state laws and regulations governing the
organization and operation of banks and their affiliates. As
a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"), TrustCo is
regulated and examined by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the "Board"). The Act requires as a
national banking association, TrustCo to obtain prior Board
approval for bank and non-bank acquisitions and restricts the
business operations permitted to TrustCo. The Bank is subject
to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency.
     Virtually all aspects of TrustCo's and the Bank's business
are subject to regulation and examination by the Board, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.

    Most of TrustCo's revenues consist of cash dividends paid
to TrustCo by its subsidiary Bank, payment of which is subject
to various regulatory limitations.  (Note 1 of the
consolidated financial statements contained in TrustCo s
Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31,
1995, which appears on pages 32 and 33 thereof and contains
information concerning restrictions of TrustCo s ability to
pay dividends, is hereby incorporated by reference.)  In
addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the
Board have established guidelines with respect to the
maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by a bank holding
company under their jurisdictions. Compliance with the
standards set forth in such guidelines could also limit the
amount of dividends which a bank or a bank holding company may
pay to its shareholders.  The banking industry is also
affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal
government, including the Board, which exerts considerable
influence over the cost and availability of funds obtained for
lending and investing.

    Proposals to change various laws and regulations governing
the operation and taxation of banks, bank holding companies
and financial institutions are frequently raised in Congress
and before various federal and state regulatory authorities.
Recently, on September 29, 1994 the Riegle-Neal Interstate
Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 was enacted which
permits, beginning one year from date of enactment, bank
holding companies to acquire banks in any state (subject to
state and nationwide deposit limitations) and for full
interstate branching commencing June 1, 1997 (subject to an
individual state's earlier decision to opt out of or opt into
the interstate branching provision).

Foreign Operations
- --------------------
Neither TrustCo nor the Bank engage in material operations in
foreign countries or have any outstanding loans to foreign
debtors.

Statistical Information Analysis
- --------------------------------
    The "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages 5
through 23 of TrustCo's Annual Report to Shareholders for the
year ended December 31, 1995, which contains a presentation
and discussion of statistical data relating to TrustCo, is
hereby incorporated by reference. This information should not
be construed to imply any conclusion on the part of the
management of TrustCo that the results, causes or trends
indicated therein will continue in the future. The nature and
effects of governmental monetary policy, supervision and
regulation, future legislation, inflation and other economic
conditions and many other factors which affect interest rates,
investments, loans, deposits and other aspects of TrustCo's
operations are extremely complex and could make historical
operations, earnings, assets and liabilities not indicative of
what may occur in the future.

 
Item 2. Properties

    TrustCo's executive offices are located at 320 State
Street, Schenectady, New York, 12305. The Bank operates 47
offices, of which 20 are owned and 27 are leased from others.
The asset value of these properties, when considered in the
aggregate, are not material to the operation of TrustCo.

In the opinion of management, the physical properties of
TrustCo and the Bank are suitable and adequate and are being
fully utilized.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

    The nature of TrustCo's business generates a certain
amount of litigation against TrustCo and its subsidiaries
involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management of TrustCo, there are no
proceedings pending to which TrustCo or either of its
subsidiaries is a party, or of which its property is the
subject which, if determined adversely to TrustCo or such
subsidiaries, would be material in relation to TrustCo's
consolidated stockholders' equity and financial condition.


Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None.

shall be consummated any consolidation, merger or other
business combination involving the Corporation or the
securities of the Corporation in which holders of voting

securities of the corporation surviving such transaction)
having less than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting
power in an election of Directors of the Corporation (or
such other surviving corporation); (c) during any period of
two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of

the Corporation was approved by a vote of at least two-
thirds of the Directors of the Corporation then still in
office who were Directors of the Corporation at the
beginning of any such period; (d) removal by the
stockholders of all or any of the incumbent Directors of the

     Guaranty Corporation interest rate in effect on the
     Valuation Date, plus

     (b)   the same percentage of Earnings as is allocated
     as of such Valuation Date to participants under the

     SECTION 8.1.   The benefits provided hereunder will be
paid directly from the Corporation out of its general assets

to incorporate such other changes as have been deemed necessary
and advisable by the parties;
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above, the
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety

Accrued Benefit under the Trustco Retirement Plan, the interest
rates used to make an Actuarial Equivalent determination are
the immediate and deferred annuity rates the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") would use for a trusteed single
employer plan to value a benefit upon termination of an

Executive.  In the event that the Executive fails to designate
a Beneficiary or if no such designated Beneficiary is living
upon the death of the Executive or if for any reason such
designation shall be legally ineffective, then the amount which
would have been paid to a designated living Beneficiary shall
be paid to the trustee of the Executive's living trust if no
personal representative is named or to the personal
representative of the estate of the Executive.
     1.3  "Cause" means the Executive's having committed an act
of fraud, embezzlement, or theft constituting a felony, or an
act intentionally against the Corporation which causes the

services to the Corporation.

consolidation, merger or other business combination involving
the Corporation or the securities of the Corporation in which
holders of voting securities of the Corporation immediately
prior to such consummation own, as a group, immediately after
such consummation, voting securities of the Corporation (or, if
the Corporation does not survive such transaction, voting
securities of the corporation surviving such transaction)
having less than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power
in an election of Directors of the Corporation (or such other
surviving corporation); (c) during any period of two
consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such

shareholders, of each new Director of the Corporation was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Directors of
the Corporation then still in office who were Directors of the
Corporation at the beginning of any such period; (d) removal by
the stockholders of all or any or the incumbent Directors of
the Corporation other than a removal for Cause; or (e) there
shall be consummated any sale, lease, exchange or other
transfer (in one transaction or a series of related

the Corporation (on a consolidated basis) to a party which is

                             ______________

     2.1  Benefit Amount.  When the Executive's employment with
the Corporation and all of its subsidiaries is terminated, the
Executive will be entitled to a benefit in an amount equal to
his Supplemental Account Balance payable at such time and in
such manner as provided herein.
     2.2  Supplemental Account Balance at December 31, 1993.
The Executive's Supplemental Account Balance at December 31,
1993, is equal to the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of the
Executive's Supplemental Retirement Benefit payable under the
provisions of the Plan in effect on December 31, 1993.  The
Actuarial Equivalent shall be determined based on the annual
Supplemental Retirement Benefit beginning on the Executive's
Normal Retirement Date but based on his Final Average Earnings
and Years of Service as of December 31, 1993.
     2.3  Redetermination of Supplemental Account Balance on or
Before Normal Retirement Date.  The Executive's Supplemental
Account Balance shall be redetermined on each Valuation Date
and on his Normal Retirement Date.
     (a)  The Supplemental Account Balance on any Valuation
Date after December 31, 1993 is equal to:
          (i)  the Supplemental Account Balance as of the
     immediately preceding Valuation Date, plus
         (ii)  the Account Balance Increment for the
     Determination Year ending on the Valuation Date; less
        (iii)  the amount of his Supplemental Retirement
     Benefit distributed under the Plan pursuant to Section
     3.4, or its successor, since the immediately preceding
     Valuation Date.
     (b)  (1)  The Account Balance Increment for the
Determination Year ending December 31, 1994 shall be determined
as of January 1, 1994 and is equal to:
          (i)  the projected Supplemental Account Balance at
     Normal Retirement Date, measured as of December 31, 1993,
     minus
         (ii)  the accrued pension expense as determined by the
     Trustco Retirement Plan actuary under the Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 as of December 31,
     1993, divided by
        (iii)  the number of years and months from December 31,
     1993 to the Executive's Normal Retirement Date, minus
         (iv)  the Supplemental Account Balance as of December
     31, 1993, plus
          (v)  the accrued pension expense as determined by the
     Trustco Retirement Plan actuary under the Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 as of December 31,
     1993.
Notwithstanding the above, the Account Balance Increment for
the Determination Year ending December 31, 1994 shall not be
less than zero.
          (2)  The Account Balance Increment for any
Determination Year beginning on and after January 1, 1995 and
through the Determination Year in which the Executive's Normal
Retirement Date occurs shall be determined on the immediately
preceding Valuation Date and is equal to:
          (i)  the projected Supplemental Account Balance at
     Normal Retirement Date, measured as of the immediately
     preceding Valuation Date, minus
         (ii)  the Supplemental Account Balance as of the
     immediately preceding Valuation Date, divided by
        (iii)  the number of years and months from the
     immediately preceding Valuation Date to the Executive's
     Normal Retirement Date.
Notwithstanding the above, the Account Balance Increment for
any Determination Year beginning on and after January 1, 1995
shall not be less than zero.
     A portion of the Account Balance Increment constitutes
interest which is determined by using the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation interest rate in effect as of the first
day of the applicable Determination Year.
          (c)  The Executive's projected Supplemental Account
Balance at Normal Retirement Date is equal to the lump sum
Actuarial Equivalent of:
          (i)  his Projected Total Retirement Benefit, less
         (ii)  the amount of his Projected Accrued Benefit
     under the Trustco Retirement Plan; less
        (iii)  the amount of his Supplemental Retirement
     Benefit previously distributed under the Plan pursuant to
     Section 3.4, or its successor.

     2.4  Determination of Supplemental Account Balance After
Normal Retirement Date.  If the Executive remains in the
employment of the Corporation beyond his Normal Retirement
Date, his Supplemental Account Balance shall be increased as of
each Valuation Date subsequent to his Normal Retirement Date by
an amount equal to:
          (a)  the interest on the Supplemental Account Balance
     as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date (adjusted
     for any distributions made to the Executive in accordance
     with Section 3.4 since the immediately preceding Valuation
     Date) at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest
     rate in effect on the Valuation Date, plus
          (b)  the same percentage of Earnings as is allocated
     as of such Valuation Date to participants under the Profit
     Sharing Plan of Trustco Bank New York.
For the Valuation Date immediately following the Executive's
Normal Retirement Date, his Account Balance Increment shall be
the greater of the amount determined under Section 2.3 or the
amount determined under this Section 2.4.
     2.5  Monthly Allocation Date.  The Supplemental Account
Balance on the last day of any month during the Determination
Year (the "Monthly Allocation Date") shall be equal to:
          (i)  the Supplemental Account Balance as of the
     immediately preceding Valuation Date, plus
         (ii)  the Account Balance Increment, times the
     quotient of the number of months from the immediately
     preceding Valuation Date to the Monthly Allocation Date,
     divided by 12.
     2.6  Reduction of Supplemental Account Balance.  The
Executive's Supplemental Account Balance will be reduced by the
amount of any distribution made to the Executive pursuant to
Sections 3.3 or 3.4.

one of its subsidiaries is terminated (a) by retirement, (b) by

will be entitled to his Supplemental Account Balance determined

the Executive or his Beneficiary in the same manner, and at the
same time, as benefit payments to such Participant or his
Beneficiary under the Trustco Retirement Plan or in one lump
sum or a series of installments as elected by the Executive.

discretion, may at any time elect to distribute to the
Executive or his Beneficiary a single lump sum equal to the
Supplemental Account Balance as of a date specified by the
Corporation.  The Actuarial Equivalent of any single lump sum
distribution will be included in the amount offset under

effective January 1, 1994; and
     WHEREAS, the Corporation desires to amend the Plan
effective January 1, 1994;
     NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation hereby amends the
Plan effective January 1, 1994, in the following respects:



I.  New sections, designated sections 1.3a and 1.3b, are

following events:  (a) any individual, corporation (other
than the Corporation), partnership, trust, association,
pool, syndicate, or any other entity or any group of
persons acting in concert becomes the beneficial owner, as
that concept is defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the securities
Exchange Act of 1934, of securities of the Corporation
possessing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting
power for the election of Directors of the Corporation;
(b) there shall be consummated any consolidation, merger
or other business combination involving the Corporation or
the securities of the Corporation in which holders of
voting securities of the corporation immediately prior to
such consummating own, as a group, immediately after such
consummation, voting securities of the Corporation (or, if
the Corporation does not survive such transaction, voting
securities of the corporation surviving such transaction)
having less than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting
power in an election of Directors of the Corporation (or
such other surviving corporation); (c) during any period
of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning
of such period constitute the Directors of the corporation
cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
thereof unless the election, or the nomination for
election by the corporation's shareholders, of each new
Director of the Corporation was approved by a vote of at
least two-thirds of the directors of the Corporation then
still in office who were Directors of the Corporation at
the beginning of any such period; (d) removal by the
stockholders of all or any of the incumbent Directors of
the Corporation other than a removal for Cause; or (e)
there shall be consummated any sale, lease, exchange or
other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related
transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets
of the Corporation (on a consolidated basis) to a party
which is not controlled by or under common control with
the Corporation."



II.  Section 2.2 of the Plan is hereby deleted in its
entirety and the following is substituted in lieu thereof:

     "Section 2.2.  Subject to the provisions of Sections
2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 herein, individuals assigned to a
position designated for participation in the Plan during
the course of a Plan Year will be eligible for receipt of
Incentive Awards even if they are in such positions only
part of the Plan Year.  The Incentive Award to such
Participants will be prorated based upon the number of
full calendar months of service in the participating
position."



III. A new section, designated Section 2.6, is hereby
added to article II of the Plan and shall read as follows:

     Section 2.6.  A Participant who terminates employment
within two (2) years after a Change in Control will be
entitled to an Incentive Award for the Plan Year based
upon the portion of the base Salary actually paid to such
Participant during the Plan Year in which he terminates."

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this
Amendment No. 1 to be executed this 18th day of October,
1994.

return on their investment.

Executive and Senior Officers of Trustco Bank

President's Message

Dear Shareholder:

TrustCo had another record year in 1995. 1995 was generally a good year in
the banking industry, and I'm pleased that we continue to provide record
performance with unerring consistency. We are grateful to our employees and
Board of Directors for their strong support and enthusiasm.

During 1995 shareholder values continued in the right direction with net
income at $25.5 million, up a significant 12% over 1994. TrustCo's most
important ratio, return on shareholders' equity, was 18.03%, up from 17.01%
in 1994. We are committed to insuring that return on equity compares
favorably in any peer group, and we are comfortable that it does. TrustCo's
five year ROE was 16.69% and we plan an increase to 19% for the current
fiscal year.

During 1995, we issued a 20% stock split maintaining the cash dividend level
on the newly issued shares, effectively increasing dividend income for
TrustCo owners by 20%. The quarterly cash dividend has increased at a 23%
compound annual rate over the last five years, a major accomplishment. It is
our intention to continue monitoring our internal generation of capital;
should excess capital exist, we would recommend steps to the Board to
correct that situation. These steps could include any measures that would
return excess capital to TrustCo's owners.

I think it appropriate to thank all our Board members for their continued
guidance throughout the year. We note with sorrow the passing of Henry D.
Wright and Donald E. Craig, Honorary Directors, who served the Board with
distinction for many years. During 1995 William D. Powers joined the Boards
of the bank and holding company. We believe Bill brings significant
additional strength to the Board.

A senior staff addition during 1995 was Robert J. McCormick, appointed Vice
President, Senior Commercial Loan Officer. Rob comes to us from Albank after
12 years service. Peter Zakriski, Administrative Vice President, retired
December 1. We thank Pete for his many contributions over the years.

TrustCo's branch expansion program continues and we opened four additional
branches during 1995. Our plans call for two to three branch openings a year
until we have filled the gaps in our market territory. The targeted upgrading
continues with each branch receiving a major review and renovation at
approximately seven year intervals.

During 1995, we evaluated and discussed a number of acquisition
opportunities. Unfortunately, our discussions were not successful. Our
approach to acquisitions is quite simple -- we are extremely careful to avoid
damage to shareholder value in the existing TrustCo franchise.

Since its inception, Trustco Bank has been a New York State chartered
institution regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New
York State Banking Department. We applied for and completed a change from a
New York State charter to a national charter during the first quarter of 1995.
We think changes in the industry suggest the most appropriate direction
for the future is a national charter regulated by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency. We are pleased with the change results to date.

TrustCo's Affordable Housing Program, which was designed to assist with
homeownership, continues to be a success in new markets. We consider this
program a model for community reinvestment and one of the most effective in
the state.

1995 was another year in which TrustCo avoided most of the industry
difficulties while moving forward to new records. We intend to continue this
"boring" path to the benefit of the owners, employees, and community for the
foreseeable future.

1996 will provide income and growth success with emphasis continuing on the
Home Equity Loan and Home Equity Credit Line products and our improved NOW
and savings accounts on the deposit side.

Our Trust department, which currently manages assets in excess of $777
million has ambitious expectations, and is moving forward under the new
management team.

1996 and beyond should benefit from the solid performance of the superb
employee team here at TrustCo. For 1995 the often quoted efficiency ratio for
our Company was 42.52% at a time when most banking companies would like to
see 60.00%. This level of performance efficiency will benefit us through
reduced operating expense for years to come.

1995 was a year of significant asset growth from $1.976 billion to $2.176
billion, an increase of 10%, in a time of continuing deposit outflows from
banks. This solid performance will provide us with investment opportunities
going forward. Our loan portfolio continued to grow during 1995, increasing
by 6%, with continued emphasis on the retail side of the product mix.

The quality of the loan portfolio is excellent, and our allowance for loan
loss has a coverage ratio 3.1 times nonperforming loans, an important area
of reserve.

Community needs have expanded, and TrustCo has responded appropriately.
TrustCo has provided increased employee and management participation in
charitable and community organizations, increased its corporate charitable
contributions throughout the Capital District, and our Affordable Housing
Program continues to grow.

TrustCo continues to receive solid external comment. During 1995 we received
favorable mention in Kiplingers' July edition; Advest re dividend yield;
Forbes' July and November editions.

We are enthusiastic about TrustCo's future. It is the intention at every
level in the Company to continue our past success into the future. Our
products are tailored to the needs of our community, we have an unmatched
employee team to deliver them, and a management style that can adapt to any
change the marketplace may bring almost immediately.

We are sure the combination mentioned above and enthusiastic commitment of
the Board of Directors will ensure our continuing success in the years ahead,
whatever the banking environment.

Sincerely,

Robert A. McCormick,
President and Chief Executive Officer

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations

The financial review which follows will focus on the factors affecting the
financial condition and results of operations of TrustCo Bank Corp NY (the
"Company" or "TrustCo") and Trustco Bank, National Association (the "Bank" or
"Trustco") during 1995 and, in summary form, the preceding two years. Net
interest income and net interest margin are presented in this discussion on a
taxable equivalent basis. Balances discussed are daily averages unless
otherwise described. The consolidated financial statements and related notes
and the quarterly reports to shareholders for 1995 should be read in
conjunction with this review. Certain amounts in years prior to 1995 have
been reclassified to conform with the 1995 presentation.

During 1995, TrustCo adopted new accounting pronouncements dealing with the
identification, reporting and accounting for impaired loans, which are more
fully described in the enclosed notes to the consolidated financial
statements. The new standards had no impact on the operations of the Company
for 1995.

All per share information has been adjusted for the 6 for 5 stock split in
August 1995.

Overview

TrustCo recorded net income of $25,527,000 or $1.42 per share for the year
ended December 31, 1995, compared to $22,888,000 or $1.28 per share for the
year ended December 31, 1994. This represents an increase of 12% in the full
year earnings and an 11% increase in the per share results.

During 1995 TrustCo achieved:

* taxable equivalent net interest income of $83.5 million, an increase of 3%
over 1994,

* a reserve coverage ratio of nonperforming loans of 3.1 times. The
allowance set aside for problem loans reached 3.94% of loans at year end 1995,
compared to 3.34% for 1994,

* an efficiency ratio of 42.52% for the year. Industry goals look for the
attainment of a 60% efficiency ratio. TrustCo outperformed the industry on
this ratio for 1993, 1994 and 1995, and

* growth in average deposits to $1.9 billion, representing a 3% increase over
1994. The net interest margin for 1995 was 7 basis points lower than in 1994
as a result of the increased cost of attracting new deposits.

Asset/Liability Management

TrustCo's objectives in managing its balance sheet are to manage the
sensitivity of net interest income in relation to actual or potential changes
in interest rates and to enhance profitability through strategies that
promise sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk. The Company has
established guidelines for liquidity so as to maintain adequate levels in
light of loan and deposit demands. TrustCo does not engage in any high risk
investing activities nor does it invest in financial derivatives. The Company
relies on traditional banking investment instruments and its large base of
"core" deposits to help in asset/liability management.

</TABLE>

Earning Assets

Average earning assets during 1995 were $2.0 billion, which is $84 million,
or 4%, over the prior year. The increase in average earning assets was
dependent on three factors:

* growth in funding sources (deposits and borrowings),
* movement of assets from nonearning to earning categories, and

* the internal generation of capital retained by the Company.

The $84 million increase in average earning assets was the result of a $69
million increase in funding sources, the conversion of $5 million from
nonearning asset categories, and the retention of $8 million in capital
during 1995. In addition, a small increase in various other liabilities
provided $2 million toward the growth in average earning assets.

The table, "Mix of Average Earning Assets" shows how the mix of the earning
assets has changed over the last three years. While growth in earning assets
is critical to improved profitability, changes to the mix of earning assets
can also have a significant impact on profitability.

Loans: Average total loans increased $65.1 million, or 5.8%, during 1995. Net
loans grew from 58.9% of average earning assets in 1994 to 59.6% of average
earning assets in 1995. The steady growth of the loan portfolio as a
component of the Company's asset mix, as well as the continued high quality
of the portfolio, have contributed significantly to the Company's superior
operating results for 1995.

Loan products related to residential real estate continued to exhibit
significant growth during 1995. Average residential mortgage loans rose $62.0
million, or 9.5%, during 1995. TrustCo continued to outpace the competition
by offering mortgage loan products that offer a quick decision on
application, low closing costs and no escrow requirement.

The overwhelming majority of TrustCo's real estate loans are secured by
properties within the Bank's market area. Management's specific knowledge of
local market conditions and trends enhances the quality of the loan
portfolio. During 1995, management continued its established practice of
retaining all new real estate loan originations in the Bank's portfolio
rather than packaging them for sale in the secondary mortgage market.

The average balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans was
largely unchanged during 1995. New loan originations were slightly outpaced
by amortizations and problem loan resolutions, a portfolio trend reflective
of general economic uncertainty.

TrustCo's commercial lending activities are focused on balancing the
Company's commitment to meeting the credit needs of businesses within its
market area with the necessity of maintaining a high quality loan portfolio.
In accordance with these ideals, the Bank has consistently emphasized the
origination of loans within its market area. The portfolio contains no
foreign loans, nor does it contain any concentrations of credit extended to
any single borrower or industry. The Bank's commercial portfolio reflects
the diversity found in the Capital Region's economy.

TrustCo continues to offer a full range of consumer credit products. During
1994, the Bank commenced a program to promote its
credit card products. This program, which combined aggressive marketing and
attractive pricing, resulted in significant growth in credit card receivables
during 1994 and 1995.

The average balance of the installment loan portfolio increased to $35.3
million for 1995, a 16.6% increase over 1994. Virtually all of the increase
is concentrated in the credit card portfolio. Credit card outstandings
averaged $17.9 million in 1995 compared to $12.0 million in 1994.

</TABLE>

Securities available for sale and investment securities: The Company adopted
new accounting standards during 1994 for its securities portfolio. The
Company identifies securities available for sale and those securities that
are for investment purposes and will be held to maturity. The following
contains information related to these securities.

Securities available for sale: During 1995, the portfolio of securities
available for sale was actively managed by the Company to take full advantage
of the changes in interest rates occurring during that time period. At
December 31, 1995, securities available for sale amounted to $640.2 million
compared to $117.5 million at year end 1994.

As more fully described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial
statements, due to changes in the accounting for investment securities, in
December 1995 TrustCo transferred the held to maturity securities portfolio
to the securities available for sale portfolio. In the fourth quarter of
1995, the accounting regulatory authorities allowed a one time transfer of
securities from the held to maturity category to the available for sale
category. Approximately $288.5 million of securities were transferred to the
available for sale portfolio as a result of this opportunity. Therefore, at
year end 1995, there are no securities identified as held to maturity.

Securities classified as available for sale are utilized as an integral
element in the asset/liability management process of the Company. These
securities are actively managed to take advantage of changes in interest
rates or other banking opportunities that become available. The decision to
transfer the held to maturity securities into the category of securities
available for sale allows TrustCo to manage these newly transferred assets
similarly. Sales of securities from the held to maturity portfolio are
allowed only under very limited circumstances and, therefore, active
portfolio management is not allowed.

For 1995, the average balance of securities available for sale was $301.1
million, down $31.9 million from the average balance of $333.0 million in
1994. The average yield earned on this portfolio for 1995 was 7.49% compared
to 6.38% in 1994. Approximately 85% of the average balance of the available
for sale securities was in the category of U.S. Treasuries and agencies
securities, up from 81% in 1994. These securities provide a consistent source
of liquidity, and are readily acceptable from a credit risk perspective. The
increase in rates earned during 1995 of 111 basis points more than offset
the reduction in the average balances, thereby producing a 6.1% increase in
the taxable equivalent interest income to $22.5 million in 1995.

Also, TrustCo recognized $200 thousand of securities gains during 1995, as
compared to $8.9 million in securities losses recognized in 1994. During much
of 1994, interest rates in the securities markets were rising as a result of
actions by the Federal Reserve Bank that affected the federal funds rate and
the discount rate. TrustCo's response to these changes was to actively purge
the securities portfolio of low yielding investments, which generally
resulted in losses, and to replace them with higher yielding assets. The
results of this strategy are clearly demonstrated in the significant yield
increase in the securities available for sale portfolio.

TrustCo does not invest in exotic investment products such as interest rate
swaps, forward placement contracts, options or any other instrument commonly
referred to as a derivative. By actively managing a portfolio of high quality
securities, the objectives of asset/liability management and liquidity can be
met, while at the same time producing a constant earnings stream that meets
or exceeds alternative rates offered in the marketplace.

Securities available for sale are recorded at their fair value with any
unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, recognized as a component of
shareholders' equity. At year end 1995, the market value of TrustCo's
portfolio of securities available for sale had an unrealized gain of $21.1
million.

Investment securities: As discussed above, there are no securities in this
classification at year end 1995, compared to $347.9 million at the same time
period in 1994. On average, the investment securities portfolio was $292.9
million in 1995 and earned an average yield of 7.17%, compared to the 1994
average balance of $250.8 million and an average yield of 6.81%. This
resulted in an increase in interest income on these securities of $3.9
million to $21.0 million in 1995. The change in the average balance accounted
for three quarters of the increase in interest income, with the remaining
increase the result of the change in rates during the two time periods.

Maturity and call dates of securities: Many of the securities in the
investment portfolio have a call date in addition to the
stated maturity date. Call dates allow the issuer of the bond to redeem the
bond prior to maturity at selected dates and at predetermined prices.
Normally, securities are redeemed at the call date because the issuer can
reissue the bond at a lower yield. Therefore, for cash flow, liquidity, and
interest rate management purposes, it is important to monitor both maturity
dates and call dates. The following table details the portfolio of
securities available for sale, for both the maturity date and call date as
of December 31, 1995.

Federal funds sold: During 1995, the average balance of these funds was
$212.3 million, up from $203.9 million in 1994. The
average rate earned on these funds was 5.91% for 1995 and 4.44% for 1994.
TrustCo utilized this category of earning assets during 1995 as a means of
keeping strong liquidity as interest rates in the securities markets changed.
Rather than invest this excess liquidity during 1995, the Company chose to
place these funds in overnight federal funds sold. This decision had the
short term effect of suppressing potential earnings for 1995, but positioned
TrustCo to take advantage of other banking opportunities as they emerge in
1996.

Portions of income earned on certain commercial loans, U.S. Government
obligations, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and equity
securities are exempt from federal and/or state taxation. Appropriate
adjustments have been made to reflect the equivalent amount of taxable income
that would have been necessary to generate an equal amount of after tax
income. Federal and New York State tax rates used to calculate income on a
tax equivalent basis were 35.0 percent and 9.68 percent for 1995, 35.0
percent and 10.13 percent for 1994, and 35.0 percent and 10.35 percent for
1993. The average balances of securities available for sale is calculated
using amortized costs for these securities. Included in the balance of
shareholders' equity is $3.9 million and $2.4 million in 1995 and 1994,
respectively, of unrealized appreciation, net of tax, in the available for
sale securities portfolio.

</TABLE>

Deposits: Average total deposits (including time deposits greater than $100
thousand) were $1.859 billion in 1995 compared to $1.808 billion in 1994.
Deposit increases centered primarily in the time deposit category, which
increased $194.0 million, or 30%, over the average balance in 1994. The
demand deposit category increased 4% to $97.9 million in 1995 compared to
$93.8 million in 1994. Deposit outflows were experienced in all other
categories with the largest decrease occurring in the savings category.

In order to stop the outflow of savings deposits, TrustCo implemented a
successful marketing and advertising campaign beginning March 1995 to promote
the increase of the savings account interest rate to 4%, a level which was
significantly higher than that offered by any other bank in the Capital
Region. As a result, savings account balances increased from $588.0 million
at March 31, 1995 to $649.0 million at December 31, 1995.

Past experience at TrustCo has demonstrated that once customers are attracted
to the Bank as a result of a deposit generation campaign, they tend to
maintain their deposit relationship with TrustCo through various interest
rate cycles. It is the Company's belief that these deposits are a very stable
source of core customers. These customers provide a tremendous opportunity
for cross selling other banking services in addition to their deposit
accounts.

Interest expense on deposits increased from $60.0 million in 1994 to $78.4
million in 1995. The increase of $18.3 million was primarily due to the
increase in rates paid on deposit accounts which increased to 4.45% in 1995
from the 3.50% in 1994.

In addition to the deposit generating activities described previously,
TrustCo also opened four new retail branches in 1995. These new branches
increased the marketing territory of the Bank and contributed significantly
to the deposit increases noted in 1995. For 1996, TrustCo anticipates opening
three new branches. These new retail outlets will provide new sources of
funding and additional opportunities for cross selling to a new depositor
base.

Interest expense on certificates of deposit greater than $100,000 was $4.9
million, $2.6 million and $2.1 million for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense due to both
rate and volume have been allocated to the two categories of variances
(volume and rate) based on the percentage relationship of such variances to
each other.

</TABLE>

The increase in short-term borrowing balances from $18.1 million in 1994 to
$38.1 million in 1995 is due almost exclusively to the introduction of the
Trustco Short Term Investment Account. This account was developed for the
Bank's Trust Department as an investment vehicle for trust accounts.
Balances are transferred daily by the Trust Department into this account
and are collateralized by securities owned by the Bank.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the principal contributor to net income. Therefore,
growth in net income is directly dependent upon the ability of the Company to
increase net interest income. TrustCo's 1995 change in net interest income is
primarily the result of increased earning asset balances invested at higher
rates in 1995 compared to 1994.

Taxable equivalent net interest income for 1995 was $83.5 million, up $2.3
million or 3% over 1994. The yield on average earning assets rose 79 basis
points to 8.21% during 1995 while the rate paid on average interest-bearing
liabilities increased 96 basis points to 4.46%. Together, this resulted in a
7 basis point decrease in the net margin to 4.18%.

The changes between 1995 and 1994, as illustrated in the table "Volume and
Yield Analysis," resulted in an increase in interest on earning assets of
$21.8 million and an increase in interest expense of $19.5 million. The
increase in the interest on earning assets was primarily the result of
increases in the rates earned from 7.42% in 1994 to 8.21% in 1995. Rate
changes accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total increase in
interest income. The increase in interest expense is also principally the
result of increases in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which
rose from 3.50% in 1994 to 4.46% in 1995. As with the increase in interest
income on earning assets, the increase in interest paid on interest-bearing
liabilities was approximately two-thirds the result of increases in rates
paid.

Risk Management

The responsibility for balance sheet risk management oversight is the
function of the Asset Allocation Committee. This committee meets monthly and
includes the executive officers of the Company as well as other department
managers as appropriate. The meetings include a review of the balance sheet
structure, formulation of strategy in light of expected economic conditions,
and a review of performance against guidelines established to control
exposure to various types of risk.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is managed through a network of loan officer authorities, review
committees, loan policies, and oversight from the senior executives of the
Company. Management follows a policy of continually identifying, analyzing,
and evaluating the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio. As a result of
management's ongoing review of the loan portfolio, loans are placed in
nonaccrual status, either due to the delinquent status of principal and/or
interest payments, or a judgment by management that, although payment of
principal and/or interest is current, such action is prudent. Loans are
generally placed in nonaccrual status when principal and/or interest is 90
days past due. Thereafter, no interest is taken into income unless received
in cash or until such time as the borrower demonstrates the ability to make
scheduled payments of interest and principal.

</TABLE>

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include loans in non-accrual status, loans which have
been treated as troubled debt restructurings, loans past due 90 days or more
and still accruing interest, and foreclosed real estate properties.

Nonperforming assets at year end 1995 totalled $19.4 million, an increase of
$2.6 million from the balance at year end 1994. Nonperforming loans increased
from $11.7 million in 1994 to $15.7 million in 1995. Nonperforming loans as a
percentage of loans were 1.28% in 1995 and 1.01% in 1994. These percentages
are well below industry and peer group averages, and reflect TrustCo's
conservative lending policy and its aggressive collection and charge off
policies.

The increase in the nonperforming loans of $3.9 million is the result of two
commercial loans reaching nonaccrual status in 1995. Both loans are well
secured and management does not anticipate any loss as a result of collecting
these loans.

TrustCo has a very diversified loan portfolio with no concentrations to any
one borrower or industry. As an indication of this diversification, there
are only three loans greater than $1 million identified as nonperforming at
December 31, 1995. This is significant because it demonstrates sound business
judgments made by TrustCo in loan portfolio risk management.

Nonperforming assets at year end 1995 included $3.7 million of foreclosed
properties compared to $5.1 million in 1994.

There are no other loans in the Bank's portfolio that management is aware of
that pose any significant risk of the eventual non-collection of principal.
As of December 31, 1995, there were no other loans classified for regulatory
purposes that management reasonably expects will materially impact future
operating results, liquidity, or capital resources.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The balance in the allowance for loan losses has been accumulated over the
years through periodic provisions, and is available to absorb losses on
loans which have been determined to be uncollectible. The adequacy of the
allowance is evaluated continuously, with emphasis on nonperforming and other
loans that management believes warrant special attention. The balance of
the allowance is maintained at a level that is, in management's judgment,
representative of the loan portfolio's inherent risk given present and
anticipated future conditions.

The table "Summary of Loan Loss Experience" includes an analysis of the
changes to the allowance for the past five years. Loans charged off in 1995
were $7.3 million, compared to $4.8 million in 1994. Recoveries were $4.1
million in 1995 and $1.5 million in 1994. Provisions recorded in 1995 and
1994 were $12.7 million and $8.1 million, respectively.

Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.27% in 1995 and 0.29%
in 1994. The allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding grew to 3.94% in
1995 from 3.34% in 1994. The Company has a policy of recognizing problem loan
charge offs early and aggressively pursuing collection efforts. This policy
of early intervention has proven to be a cornerstone of the strong lending
performance that TrustCo has achieved.

TrustCo adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114 (Statement 114), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,"
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 118 (Statement 118),
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and
Disclosure," effective as of January 1, 1995. The enclosed consolidated
financial statements have been presented in accordance with these new
accounting pronouncements. The footnotes to the consolidated financial
statements provide additional details with respect to the adoption and
accounting requirements of these pronouncements.

TrustCo has classified nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans
as impaired loans, as well as all loans restructured under a troubled debt
restructuring since the adoption of these new accounting requirements as of
January 1, 1995. At year end 1995, there were $10.0 million of impaired
loans. The average balance of impaired loans during 1995 was $10.5 million
and the Company recognized approximately $400 thousand of interest income on
these loans during the year.

Statement 114 substantially modified the definition of "in-substance
foreclosure" loans. Consequently, certain loans identified at year end 1994
as being in-substance foreclosure loans and classified as real estate owned
have been reclassified as of January 1, 1995 to the loan portfolio. At
January 1, 1995, $9.2 million of loans previously included in real estate
owned were reclassified to the loan balance. Prior to adoption of Statements
114 and 118, in-substance foreclosed properties included those properties
where the borrower had little or no remaining equity in the property,
considering its fair value; where repayment was expected to come only from
the operation or sale of the property; and where the borrower had effectively
abandoned control of the property or it was doubtful the borrower would be
able to rebuild equity in the property.

Interest Rate Risk

Management of interest rate risk involves continual monitoring of the
relative sensitivity of asset and liability portfolios to changes in rates
due to maturities or repricing. Forecasting models are utilized to quantify
the impact of changes in rates on the Company's net income. Specific targets
for interest rate sensitivity have been established by the Company.

Interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing of assets and
liabilities through maturity and interest rate changes. The objective is to
maintain an appropriate balance between income growth and the risk associated
with maximizing income through the mismatch of the timing of interest rate
changes between assets and liabilities. Perfectly matching this funding can
eliminate interest rate risk but net interest income is not always enhanced.

One measure of interest rate risk, the so called "gap," is illustrated in the
table "Interest Rate Sensitivity."

The table measures the incremental and cumulative gap, or the difference
between assets and liabilities subject to repricing/maturity during the
periods indicated. For purposes of this analysis the maturity and repricing
of loans is based on the stated maturity or earliest repricing date. For
securities available for sale, the earlier of average life or stated maturity
is used. NOW, money market, demand, and savings accounts are presented with a
maturity or repricing cycle over the full interest rate cycle and TrustCo's
actual experience, even though they are subject to immediate withdrawal. Time
deposit accounts are presented based upon their maturity dates.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1995, the Company's gap position indicates an excess of assets
repricing in the 0-90 day period of $323.7
million. This positive gap position is significantly enhanced by the $239.0
million federal funds balance at year end. The gap position turns negative in
the 91 to 365 day period and in the 1 to 5 year period. This situation
reflects the significant amount of time deposits that mature in these time
bands. Over 5 years, the gap position again reflects an excess of repricing
assets over liabilities of $651.8 million.

In evaluating interest rate sensitivity at year end 1995, the Company would
have a slight benefit from an increase in interest rates, as the Bank would
be able to redeploy short-term assets that are repricing into higher yielding
investments. Conversely, the Company would be slightly disadvantaged given a
decrease in interest rates, since the assets that are repricing would do so
at lower interest rates.

The Company's gap position is constantly under evaluation by the Asset
Allocation Committee in relation to products, services, and the marketplace.

There are significant shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis
presented in the Interest Rate Sensitivity table. For example, although
certain assets and liabilities have similar periods to maturity or to
repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates.
Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may
fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while other
interest rates may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain
assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term
basis and over the life of the asset (certain annual caps and lifetime
caps). Further, in the event of significant changes in interest rates,
prepayment and early withdrawal levels would be likely to deviate
significantly from those assumed in the table. Finally, the ability of many
borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a significant
interest rate increase. Management takes these factors into account when
reviewing the Bank's gap position and establishing future asset/liability
strategy.

Liquidity Risk

TrustCo seeks to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain
prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands.
In addition to serving as a funding source for maturing obligations,
liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs.
Many factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including variations
in the markets served by the Bank's network of branches, the mix of assets
and liabilities, and general economic conditions.

The Company actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios
established under the Asset/Liability Management policies. Continual
monitoring of these ratios, both historically and through forecasts under
multiple interest rate scenarios, allows TrustCo to employ strategies
necessary to maintain adequate liquidity levels. Management has also
developed various liquidity alternatives should abnormal situations arise.

The Company achieves its liability based liquidity objectives in a variety of
ways. Net liabilities can be classified into three categories for the
purposes of managing liability based liquidity: net core deposits, purchased
money, and capital market funds. TrustCo seeks deposits that are dependable
and predictable, ones that are based as much on interest rate as they are on
the level and quality of service. At December 31, 1995, core deposits
representing total deposits less those time deposits greater than $100,000,
amounted to $1.846 billion. Average balances of core deposits are detailed
in the table "Average Sources of Funding."

In addition to core deposits, another funding source available to TrustCo is
purchased money. These are principally long-term and short-term borrowings,
federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and
time deposits greater than $100,000. The average balances of these purchased
liabilities are detailed in the table "Average Sources of Funding." During
1995, the average balance in purchased liabilities was $121.0 million,
compared with $69.6 million in 1994, and $59.0 million in 1993.

Off-Balance Sheet Risk

Commitments to extend credit: TrustCo makes contractual commitments to
extend credit, and extends lines of credit which are subject to the Bank's
credit approval and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
commitments to extend credit in the form of loans, including unused lines of
credit, amounted to $220.8 million and $217.3 million respectively. In
management's opinion, there are no material commitments to extend credit that
represent unusual risk.

Letters of credit and standby letters of credit: TrustCo guarantees the
obligations or performance of customers by issuing letters of credit and
standby letters of credit to third parties. These letters of credit are
frequently issued in support of third party debt, such as corporate debt
issuances, industrial revenue bonds, and municipal securities. The risk
involved in issuing letters of credit and standby letters of credit is
essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities
to customers, and they are subject to the same credit origination,
portfolio maintenance, and management procedures in effect to monitor other
credit and off-balance sheet products. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
outstanding letters of credit and standby letters of credit were
approximately $19.0 million and $20.8 million, respectively.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk: TrustCo does not engage in activities involving
interest rate swaps, forward placement contracts, options, or any other
instrument commonly referred to as a "derivative." Management believes these
instruments pose a high degree of risk, and that investing in them is
unnecessary.

</TABLE>

Noninterest Income and Expense

Noninterest income: Noninterest income is a significant source of revenue
for the Company and an important factor in the overall results for the year.
Total noninterest income was $14.1 million for 1995 compared to $4.6 million
in 1994. Included in the 1995 results are $200 thousand of securities gains
compared to securities losses of $8.9 million during the comparable period in
1994. Excluding these securities transactions, noninterest income would
have been $13.8 million and $13.4 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively. As
noted earlier, these securities losses for 1994 were realized in an effort to
reinvest the available for sale portfolio at the year end higher interest
rates. Therefore, future periods will benefit from these enhanced rates.

The Trust Department contributes the largest recurring portion of noninterest
income through fees generated by the performance of fiduciary services.
Income from these fiduciary activities totalled $4.9 million in both 1995 and
in 1994.

Changes in the other categories of noninterest income reflect the fee scale
used by the Bank for pricing its services.

</TABLE>

Noninterest expense: Noninterest expense was $44.4 million in 1995,
$40.6 million in 1994, and $43.5 million in 1993. TrustCo's
operating philosophy stresses the importance of monitoring and controlling
the level of noninterest expense. The efficiency ratio is a strong indicator
of how well controlled and monitored these expenses are for a banking
enterprise. TrustCo's efficiency ratio was 42.52% for 1995, 41.82% for 1994,
and 44.63% for 1993. Industry goals look for the attainment of a 60%
efficiency ratio. TrustCo outperformed the industry on this ratio for 1993,
1994, and 1995.

Salaries and employee benefits are the most significant component of
noninterest expense. At year end 1995, these expenses amounted to $19.9
million, compared to $18.3 million and $16.6 million for 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflects the
addition of four new branches during 1995, merit increases, and raises given
to the Bank staff. Increased costs for benefits, such as health insurance
and retirement benefits, account for the remainder of the increase.

During 1995, FDIC insurance premiums decreased by $2.0 million compared to
1994 as a result of the reduction and eventual elimination of the insurance
premium on the TrustCo deposits. Net occupancy expenses have increased by
$1.1 million due to the four new branch facilities opened during 1995 and a
write down on selected bank premises recognized in 1995. Professional
services increased by $1.0 million in 1995 over 1994, which was almost equal
to 1993 expenses. The increase in 1995 expense was the result of costs
associated with resolving certain litigation relative to nonperforming loans.
Other real estate expense is also up by $2.1 million over 1994 due to the
cost of disposing of or preparing for sale certain properties that had been
acquired through foreclosure.

Income Tax

In 1995, TrustCo recognized income tax expense of $12.8 million as compared
to $12.6 million in 1994 and $12.5 million in 1993. The tax expense on the
Company's income was lower than tax expense at the statutory rate of 35% due
primarily to tax exempt income and the reduction of the deferred tax asset
valuation reserve, offset in part by state income taxes, net of the federal
tax benefit.

Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that
realization is more likely than not. During 1995, the valuation reserve was
reduced as a result of the resolution of several tax return audits and
management's reassessment of the realization of certain deferred tax assets.
The valuation allowance of $2.1 million at December 31, 1995, is primarily
reserved for federal and state tax law restrictions on the deductibility of
certain temporary differences. The valuation allowance of $4.7 million at
December 31, 1994 was reserved primarily for federal and state tax law
restrictions on the deductibility of certain temporary differences, as well
as uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of certain other deferred
tax assets. Based primarily on the sufficiency of historical and future
taxable income, management believes it is more likely than not that the
remaining net deferred tax asset of $30.4 million and $20.6 million at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, will be realized.

Capital Resources

Consistent with its long-term goal of operating a sound and profitable
financial organization, TrustCo strives to maintain strong capital ratios.
New issues of equity securities have not been required, since most of the
Company's capital requirements have been provided through retained earnings.

Part of TrustCo's operating philosophy is that the Company will not retain
any excess capital. All capital that is generated by the Company that is in
excess of the levels considered by management to be necessary for the safe
and sound operations of the Company has been distributed to the shareholders
in the form of cash dividends. Consequently, the capital ratios that are
maintained are adequate but not excessive. This philosophy has led to a
dividend payout ratio for 1995 of 69.55%, 1994 of 62.52%, and 1993 of 56.88%.
These are significant payouts to the Company's shareholders and are
considered by management to be a prudent use of the retained capital in
TrustCo. As to the likelihood of future dividends, the philosophy stated
above will continue into 1996 and, where appropriate, the Board of Directors
will declare dividends consistent with that operating philosophy.

At December 31, 1995, TrustCo's Tier 1 capital was $147.7 million or 12.45%
of risk adjusted assets. The Tier 1 capital to total assets or the leverage
ratio at December 31, 1995 was 7.36% as compared to 7.05% in 1994 and 6.59%
in 1993. At December 31, 1995 the subsidiary bank, Trustco Bank, met the
regulatory definition of a "well capitalized" institution.

The Bank converted to a nationally chartered bank in early 1995 and changed
its legal name to Trustco Bank, National Association. All of the operations
of the Bank were consistent with those allowed of a nationally chartered
bank. The national charter allowed the Bank to streamline its regulatory
process by having the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as the
primary bank regulator.

As mentioned earlier, TrustCo will be expanding its branch network by three
locations in 1996. It is not anticipated that additional capital will be
required to support this expansion program. Likewise, operating costs during
1996 can be expected to rise modestly as a result of these new branches, but
will be offset by the additional revenue generated by the new branches.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of
financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars
without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money
over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the
increasing costs of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all
the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary.

As a result, changes in interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's
performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation, since
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same
extent as the price of goods and services.

Impact of Changes in Accounting Standards

Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions: On January 1,
1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
(Statement 106), "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
than Pensions." In implementing the new accounting standard, the Company
recorded a one time transition charge of $3.3 million, net of tax benefits,
which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
in the 1993 consolidated statement of income.

Accounting for Income Taxes: On January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (Statement 109),
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Statement 109 significantly changed the method
of accounting for income taxes for financial statement purposes without
affecting the actual cash tax liability. In adopting Statement 109, the
Company elected not to restate prior period financial results. The
implementation of Statement 109 had no material impact on the 1993 results of
operations. The Company's complete disclosure related to Statement 109 is
included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan: The Company adopted
Statements 114 and 118 effective as of January 1, 1995. These statements
require that an impaired loan be measured at the present value of expected
cash flows. The Statements also narrow the application of the concept of
in-substance foreclosure to situations where the creditor has received
physical possession of the debtor's collateral. The adoption of Statements
114 and 118 did not have a material impact on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities: The Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (Statement 115),
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," effective
January 1, 1994. Upon adoption of Statement 115, the Company identified
securities that are "available for sale" and those that are "held to
maturity" (the Company has no trading account assets as prescribed by
Statement 115). Securities classified as available for sale are those that
can be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, liquidity
requirements, or other investment alternatives. Securities classified as held
to maturity are not available for sale and are held until contractual
maturity or call. Securities available for sale are recorded at market value
with the unrealized appreciation and depreciation, net of tax, recorded as an
element of shareholders' equity. Securities identified as held to maturity
are recorded at amortized cost.

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of: In May 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (Statement 121),
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of." Various assets are excluded from the scope of
Statement 121, including financial instruments which constitute the majority
of the Company's assets. For long-lived assets included in the scope of
Statement 121, such as premises and equipment, an impairment loss must be
recognized when the estimate of total undiscounted future cash flows
attributable to the asset is less than the asset's carrying amount. The
Company will adopt Statement 121 in the first quarter of 1996. Management
anticipates that the adoption of Statement 121 will not have a material
effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation: In October 1995, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (Statement 123), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which
establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock options, such
as the Company's stock option plans. Under Statement 123, entities can
recognize stock-based compensation expense in the basic financial statements
using either (1) the intrinsic value based approach set forth in the
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB Opinion 25), or (2) the fair
value based method introduced in Statement 123. Companies electing to remain
with the accounting in APB Opinion 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share, as if the fair value based method of
accounting defined in Statement 123 had been applied. Under the method
currently utilized by TrustCo (APB Opinion 25), compensation expense is
determined based upon the option's intrinsic value. Under the fair value
based method introduced by Statement 123, compensation expense is based on
the estimate of the option's fair value at the grant date and is generally
recognized over the vesting period. Management anticipates that it will elect
to continue to measure stock-based compensation costs in accordance with APB
Opinion 25 and will adopt the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement
123 in 1996.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TrustCo Bank Corp NY:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of
TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1995. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TrustCo
Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

January 1, 1995, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and Disclosures" which prescribe
recognition criteria for loan impairment and measurement methods for impaired
loans. As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in
1994 the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" which
changed its method of accounting for certain investments in debt and equity
securities. As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company also adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" in 1993 which

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of TrustCo Bank Corp NY
(Company or TrustCo) and Trustco Bank, National Association (Bank or Trustco)
conform to general practices within the banking industry and are in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A description of
the more significant policies follows.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
the subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions.

Securities Available for Sale

Securities available for sale are carried at market value with any unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of value, net of tax, included as an element of
the capital accounts. Management maintains an available for sale portfolio in
order to provide maximum flexibility in future balance sheet management. The
designation of available for sale is made at the time of purchase based upon
management's intent to hold the securities for an indefinite period of time.
These securities, however, would be available for sale in response to changes
in market interest rates, related changes in liquidity needs, or changes in
the availability of and yield on alternative investments. Unrealized losses
on securities that reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary,
if any, are charged to income. Nonmarketable equity securities (principally
stock of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank) are
included in securities available for sale at cost since there is no readily
available market value.

Gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are based on
the amortized cost of the specific security sold.

Investment Securities

Securities classified as investment securities are held to maturity to meet
longer term investment objectives, including yield and liquidity purposes.
At the time of purchase, securities are identified as held for investment
based upon the Company's intention and ability to hold the securities to
maturity. Investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discounts on a method that equates
to the level yield. Unrealized losses on securities that reflect a decline
in value which is other than temporary, if any, are charged to income.

Loans

Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned income
and unamortized loan fees and costs, which are recognized as income over the
applicable loan term.

Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, and loans
which are 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Generally,
loans are placed in nonaccrual status, either due to the delinquency status
of principal and/or interest payments, or a judgment by management that,
although payments of principal and/or interest are current, such action is
prudent. Future payments received on nonperforming loans are recorded as
interest income or principal reductions based upon management's ultimate
expectation for collection.

Impaired loans are commercial and commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual
status and loans restructured in a troubled debt restructuring since January
1, 1995.

Allowance for Loan Losses

An allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by
management to provide for potential loan losses based on consideration of the
credit risk of the loan portfolio, including a review of past experience,
current economic conditions, and underlying collateral value. The allowance
is increased by provisions charged against income and reduced by net charge
offs.

In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan
losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the
allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the
time of their examination.

Bank Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization computed on either the straightline or accelerated methods over
the remaining useful lives of the assets.

Real Estate Owned

Real estate owned are assets taken through foreclosures on loans.

Foreclosed assets held for sale are recorded on an individual basis at the
lower of (1) fair value minus estimated costs to sell or (2) "cost" (which is
the fair value at initial foreclosure). When a property is acquired, the
excess of the loan balance over fair value is charged to the allowance for
loan losses. Subsequent write downs are included in other noninterest
expense.

Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, TrustCo adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Deferred taxes are recorded
for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the
financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates.
Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that
realization is more likely than not.

Dividend Restrictions

Banking regulations restrict the amount of cash dividends which may be paid
during a year by the Bank to the Parent Company without the written consent
of the appropriate bank regulatory agency. Based on these restrictions, the
Bank could pay $20.6 million plus 1996 net profits. For all practical
purposes, TrustCo could not declare dividends to shareholders materially in
excess of the aggregate amount of dividends that could be paid by the Bank.

Pension Plan

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of
its employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the
employee's compensation.

Reclassification of Prior Year Statements

It is the Company's policy to reclassify prior year financial statements to
conform to the current year presentation.

(2) Balances at Other Banks

The Bank is required to maintain certain reserves of vault cash and/or
deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank. The amount of this reserve
requirement, included in cash and due from banks, was approximately
$15,571,000 and $14,576,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

(3) Securities Available for Sale

The amortized cost and approximate market value of the securities available
for sale are as follows:

line on the consolidated statement of condition.

In December 1995, the Company reclassified the entire portfolio of investment

Financial Accounting Standards Board and the various federal banking
regulators.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, loans to executive officers, directors, and
to associates of such persons aggregated $7,742,000
and $7,641,000, respectively. During 1995, new loans of $5,973,000 were made
and repayments of loans totalled $5,872,000. In the opinion of management,
such loans were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the
same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions. These loans do not involve more than
normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.

TrustCo lends primarily in the Capital District region of New York State and
in the geographic territory surrounding its borders. Although the loan
portfolio is diversified, a substantial portion of its debtors' ability to
repay is dependent upon the economic conditions prevailing in New York State.

The following table sets forth the information with regard to nonperforming
loans:

</TABLE>

Interest on nonaccrual and restructured loans of $1.3 million, $639 thousand,
and $964 thousand would have been earned in
accordance with the original contractual terms of the loans in 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively. Approximately $607 thousand,
$292 thousand and $288 thousand of interest on nonaccrual and restructured
loans was collected and recognized as income in 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively. There are no commitments to extend further credit on nonaccrual
or restructured loans.

Transactions in the allowance for loan losses account are summarized as

</TABLE>

Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114 (Statement 114), "Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." Statement 114 was amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 118 (Statement 118),
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and
Disclosure." These new accounting standards prescribe recognition criteria
for loan impairment and measurement methods for impaired loans, and loans
whose terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring subsequent to the
adoption of these new standards. A loan is considered impaired when it is
probable that the borrower will be unable to repay the loan according to the
original contractual terms of the loan agreement. These new standards are
applicable principally to commercial and commercial real estate loans,
however, certain provisions dealing with restructured loans also apply to the
retail loan products. Once a loan is identified as impaired, the new
accounting standards require measurement of the loan at the lower of fair
value of the anticipated proceeds to be received or the recorded investment
in the loan. The accounting standards provide certain guidelines as to how
fair value is to be determined. As of January 1, 1995, the Company adopted
the provisions of Statements 114 and 118 and has provided the required
disclosures.

In addition, Statement 114 substantially modified the definition of
"in-substance foreclosure" loans. Consequently, certain loans identified at
year end 1994 as being in-substance foreclosure loans, and classified as real
estate owned, have been reclassified into the loan portfolio. At January 1,
1995, $9.2 million of loans previously included in real estate owned have
been reclassified to the loan balance.

At December 31, 1995, there were $9.4 million of commercial and commercial
real estate loans that were in nonaccrual status and were classified as
impaired loans. In addition, there were newly restructured retail loans
totalling $600 thousand that as of December 31, 1995, are identified as
impaired loans.
None of the allowance for loan losses has been allocated to these impaired
loans because of the significant charge offs that have been taken in prior
years, and the fact that the collateral values support the loan balances.
Cash payments received are normally applied to reduce the outstanding loan
balance on the impaired loans (exclusive of cash payments received on
restructured loans).

During 1995 the average balance of impaired loans was $10.5 million, and
there was approximately $405 thousand of interest income recorded on these
loans in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

There were $7.1 million and $8.4 million of loans pledged for various
purposes at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

</TABLE>

Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that
realization is more likely than not. During 1995, the
valuation reserve was reduced as a result of the resolution of several tax
return audits and management's reassessment of the realization of certain
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance of $2,051,000 at December 31,
1995 is primarily reserved for federal and state tax law restrictions on the
deductibility of certain temporary differences. The valuation allowance of
$4,706,000 at December 31, 1994 was primarily reserved for federal and state
tax law restrictions on the deductibility of certain temporary differences,
as well as uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of certain other
deferred tax assets. Based primarily on the sufficiency of historical and
future taxable income, management believes it is more likely than not that
the remaining net deferred tax asset of $30,446,000 and $20,635,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, will be realized.

In addition to the deferred tax items described in the preceding table, the
Company also has a deferred tax liability of $8,693,000 at December 31, 1995,
and a deferred tax asset of $29 thousand at December 31, 1994, relating to
the net unrealized gains and losses, respectively, on securities available
for sale.

The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate.
The reasons for these differences are as follows:

(9) Employee Benefits

The Company maintains a trusteed non-contributory pension plan covering
employees that have completed one year of employment and 1,000 hours of
service. The benefits are based on the sum of (a) a benefit equal to a prior
service benefit plus the average of the employees' highest five consecutive
years' compensation in the ten years preceding retirement multiplied by a
percentage of service after a specified date plus (b) a benefit based upon
career average compensation. The amounts contributed to the plan are
determined annually on the basis of (a) the maximum amount that can be
deducted for federal income tax purposes or (b) the amount certified by a
consulting actuary as necessary to avoid an accumulated funding deficiency as
defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Contributions
are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date
but also for those expected to be earned in the future. Assets of the plan
are invested primarily in common stock and fixed income common funds
administered by the Bank. The following table sets forth the plans' funded
status and amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of
condition at December 31, 1995 and 1994:

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (Statement 106), "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Statement 106
requires a calculation of the present value of expected benefits to be paid
to employees after their retirement and an allocation of those benefits to
the periods that employees render service to earn the benefits. The Company
permits retirees under age 65 to participate in the Company's medical plan by
paying the same premium as the active employees. At age 65, the Bank provides
a Medicare Supplemental Program to retirees.

The Company adopted Statement 106 effective January 1, 1993, and has reported
the cumulative effect of that change in the December 31, 1993 Consolidated
Statement of Income.

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 1995 and 1994:

</TABLE>

The Company funded the plan in full through the use of a benefit trust during
the first quarter of 1993. Assets of the plan are
invested primarily in common stock and fixed income common funds administered
by the Bank.

The trust holding the plan assets is subject to federal income taxes at a
35.0 percent tax rate. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
after estimated income taxes, was 4.0%, 4.2%, and 3.3% for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. For measurement purposes, an
8 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
(i.e., health care cost trend rate) was assumed for 1995 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost
trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995, by
approximately $1.1 million, and the aggregate of the service and the interest
cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year
ended December 31, 1995, by approximately $189 thousand.

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 6.50 percent at December 31, 1995 and
6.75 percent at December 31, 1994.

(10) Lease Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

(a) Leases

The Bank leases certain banking premises. These leases are accounted for as
operating leases with minimum rental commitments in the amounts presented
below. The majority of these leases contain options to renew.

</TABLE>

(b) Litigation

Existing litigation arising in the normal course of business is not expected
to result in any material loss to the Company.

(11) Off-Balance Sheet Financing

Loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require a fee. Commitments sometimes expire without being
drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. These arrangements have credit risk
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are
subject to the Bank's normal credit policies, including obtaining collateral.
The Bank's exposure to credit loss for loan commitments, including unused
lines of credit, at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $220.8 million and $217.3
million, respectively.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These arrangements
have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to
customers and are subject to the Bank's normal credit policies, including
obtaining collateral. The Bank's exposure to credit loss for standby letters
of credit at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $19.0 million and $20.8 million,
respectively. No losses are anticipated as a result of loan commitments or
standby letters of credit.

(12) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values shown below represent management's estimates of values at
which the various types of financial instruments could be exchanged in
transactions between willing, unrelated parties. They do not necessarily

The specific estimation methods and assumptions used can have a substantial
impact on the resulting fair values of financial instruments. Following is a
brief summary of the significant methods and assumptions used in the above
table:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying values of these financial instruments approximates fair values.

Securities

Fair values for all securities portfolios are based upon quoted market
prices, where available. The carrying value of certain local, unrated
municipal obligations was used as an approximation of fair value.

Loans

The fair values of all loans are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses with discount rates equal to the interest rates currently being
offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.

Deposit Liabilities

The fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing deposits, NOW accounts,
savings accounts and money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the
amount payable on demand at the balance sheet date. The carrying value of all
variable rate certificates of deposit is assumed to approximate fair value.
The fair value of fixed rate certificates of deposit is estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses with discount rates equal to the interest rates
currently being offered on certificates of similar size and remaining
maturity. For 1995, the fair value of fixed rate certificates of deposit is
less than the carrying value because the average rate paid by the Company on
the deposits at December 31, 1995, is greater than the market rates at that
date. At December 31, 1994, the fair value of fixed rate certificates of
deposit is assumed to equal carrying value due to the interest rate
environment at year end 1994.

Borrowings and Other Financial Instruments

The fair value of all borrowings and other financial instruments is assumed
to be the carrying value.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.
Such financial instruments consist of commitments to extend financing and
letters of credit. If the commitments are exercised by the prospective
borrowers, these financial instruments will become interest-earning assets of
the Company. If the commitments expire, the Company retains any fees paid by
the prospective borrower. The fair value of commitments is estimated based
upon fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into
consideration the remaining terms of the agreements and the present credit
worthiness of the borrower. For fixed rate commitments, the fair value
estimation takes into consideration an interest rate risk factor. The fair
value of these off-balance sheet items at December 31, 1995 and 1994
approximates the recorded amounts of the related fees, which are considered
to be immaterial.

The Company has no derivative investment products at year end 1995 and 1994,
nor has the Company ever invested in such investment vehicles. Therefore, the
disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
119, "Disclosures about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of
Financial Instruments," are not presented except as it relates to fair value
disclosures in this footnote.

               Independent Auditors  Report
           ------------------------------------
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TrustCo Bank Corp NY:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition
of TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1995.  These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
TrustCo Bank Corp NY and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted the provisions of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board s Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 118,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition
and Disclosures" which prescribe recognition criteria for loan
impairment and measurement methods for impaired loans.  As discussed in
note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1994 the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115  Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities  which changed its
method of accounting for certain investments in debt and equity
securities.  As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company also adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board s Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106,  Employers  Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions  in 1993 which changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions.
