                                  PART I

Item 1.  BUSINESS

Twentieth Street Bank was originally incorporated on September 11, 1905, as a
state bank under the laws of West Virginia, and has operated as such since that
time.  In 1983, the Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Twentieth Bancorp,
Inc., which is a one-bank holding company.

Twentieth Street Bank's Milton Branch was originally a separate corporation
(Bank of Milton) incorporated on September 7, 1904 as a state bank under the
laws of West Virginia and operated as such up to being acquired by Twentieth
Street Bank on June 30, 1985.

Twentieth Street Bank's West Hamlin, Alum Creek and Harts Branches, were
originally a separate corporation (First National Bank of West Hamlin)
incorporated on October 24, 1964, as a national bank.  The First National Bank
of West Hamlin was acquired by Twentieth Bancorp, Inc. on December 31, 1984.
It continued to operate as a national bank until January 1, 1990, when its
operations became branches of The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc.  The Alum Creek
Branch was closed on March 31, 1994.

In December, 1995, the Twentieth Street Bank added a new full service branch
facility in Hamlin, West Virginia on State Route 3 located in Lincoln County.
Twentieth Street Bank offers all services normally offered by a full-service
commercial bank, including: commercial and individual demand and time deposit
accounts; commercial and individual loans; trusts; and drive-in banking
services.  The Milton Branch, Pea Ridge Branch and Lincoln County Branches
offer all such services, with the exception of trust services.  In the opinion
of management, no material portion of the bank's deposits have been obtained
from a single or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer's
deposits or a small group of customers' deposits would not have a material
adverse effect on the business of the Bank.

The operations of The Twentieth Street Bank are conducted in Huntington, West
Virginia, at the main office of the bank located at the corner of Third Avenue
and Twentieth Street.  The main office has two drive-in facilities.  One is
located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Nineteenth Street and one behind the
main facility.  The operations of the Milton Branch are conducted in Milton,
West Virginia, at the main office of the bank located at 1041 Church Street.
The operations of the Pea Ridge Branch are conducted at 5263 Route 60 East,
Huntington, West Virginia.  The operations of the West Hamlin Branch are
conducted in West Hamlin, West Virginia, at the corner of Sheridan Street and
Shelton Avenue.  Other locations in Lincoln County are in Pleasant View, Hamlin
and Harts, West Virginia.  The bank is a member of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and its deposits are insured as provided by law.

<PAGE>   3
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

The operations of the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes, which
apply to state chartered banks.  Bank operations are also subject to
regulations of the West Virginia Banking Commissioner and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.  Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern,
among other things, the scope of a bank's business, the investments a bank may
make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, loans a bank makes
and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and
consolidation and the establishment of branches.  The Federal Reserve Board
provides guidelines to impose a risk-based capital framework.  The guidelines
establish the framework that make capital requirements more sensitive to risk
profiles of bank holding companies.  Attainment of the minimum required ratios,
known as Tier I capital and Tier II capital, were phased in between 1990 and
1993.  Tier I includes stockholders' equity and must be at least 4% while Tier
II capital includes the allowance for loan losses.  On December 31, 1993, bank
holding companies must have a total capital ratio, including Tier I and Tier II
capital, of at least 8%.  In light of the risk-based capital guidelines and
existing balances at the end of 1995, Twentieth Bancorp, Inc. substantially
exceeds the minimum requirements in all profiles.  The Bank has been operating
under a FDIC's "Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)" for excessive number of
apparent compliance violations since December 12, 1994, (see financial
statements note 13).

COMPETITION

The primary market area of Twentieth Street Bank is generally  defined as
Cabell, Wayne and Lincoln Counties, West Virginia.  As of December 31, 1995,
there were 5 banks operating in those three counties.  As of December 31, 1995,
The Twentieth Street Bank was second in total assets of all banks within the
three counties.

The Bank competes actively with national and state banks and other financial
institutions, including savings and loan associations, and credit unions in
their market area.  In addition, the bank, like other depository institutions,
has been subjected to competition from less heavily regulated entities such as
brokerage firms, money market funds, consumer finance and credit card companies
and other financial services companies.  As a result of deregulation presently
existing in government, numerous legislative proposals are pending which would
either liberalize many of the regulatory restrictions now imposed on the banks
or require the banks' nonbanking competitors to comply with similar regulatory
restrictions.  Merger and acquisition activity has been on the increase
state-wide in West Virginia over the past five years.

Sheridan and Shelton Street.  The 8,640 square foot two-story building stands
on a 200 x 120 foot lot and the building measures approximately 54 x 80 with
potential of three drive-in lanes.  An adjacent lot was purchased in 1986 for
the purpose of providing additional parking.  The off premises drive-in
facility on leased land was opened in the spring of 1986 on State Route 10
south of West Hamlin in the community of Pleasant View.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
               CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The following management's discussion and analysis is provided to assist in
understanding the performance of the Twentieth Bancorp, Inc..

Twentieth Bancorp, Inc. is a one bank holding company.  The operations of The
Twentieth Street Bank, Inc. are conducted in Huntington, West Virginia, at the
main office of the bank located at the corner of Third Avenue and Twentieth
Street, with 6 branches in Cabell and Lincoln Counties.  Twentieth Street Bank
offers all services normally offered by a full-service commercial bank,
including:  commercial and individual demand and time deposit accounts;
commercial and individual loans; drive-in banking; and trust services.

Twentieth Bancorp reported net income of $3,411 December 31, 1995, an increase
of $257 or 8.15% from the $3,154 reported in 1994.  These increases reflected
the continued positive effects of improved net interest margins and management
of controllable expenses.  Earnings per common share was $1.90 in 1995 an
increase of 8.57% from $1.75 a share earned in 1994.  Some of the increased
earnings are attributed to the FDIC reducing the insurance premiums banks are
required to pay on deposits.

Comparisons of total assets and net income were positive.  Total interest
income for the year increased $2,702 or 12.86%, and interest expense increased
$2,004 or 28.16% from the same period a year earlier.  This reflects the
increased cost of money as rates stabilize in 1995 as compared to the rising
interest trend in 1994.

Total assets increased $4,637 or 1.48% to $317,308 for the year ended December
31, 1995, from $312,671 for the year ended December 31, 1994.  Total deposits
increased $1,193 or .43% for the same comparative period a year earlier.
Growth in deposits is substantially attributed to the nine month certificate
introduced in April and May, 1995, at 6.50%.  Since that time the rate has been
lowered to 5.35%, in line with our market competitiveness on traditional
deposit instruments.

The combination of increased earnings, net of dividends, and net increase of
$1,635 in the unrealized position of securities available for sale resulted in
a shareholders' equity growth of $3,966 for year to date comparisons.
Resulting from the positive trends of 1995, the market price of Twentieth
Bancorp, Inc. stock had increased from $17.50 to $20.00, at year end per share
following the 3 for 1 stock split-up in May, 1995.

We opened our Hamlin, West Virginia branch in December, 1995.  This is a full
function branch with an automated teller machine, but no drive in facility.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Bancorp's
cumulative total shareholder return on its Common Stock for the five year
period ending December 31, 1995, with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ
Stock Index and the Media General Industry Group Index - 04, which consists of
all banks and bank holding companies within the United States whose stock has
been publicly traded for at least six years.  The listings of the banks and
bank holding companies in the index are not listed by SIC code.  The graph
assumes (i) the reinvestment of all dividends and (ii) an initial investment of
$100.  There is no assurance that Bancorp's stock performance will continue in
the future with the same or similar trends as depicted in the graph.  The
Bancorp's Common Stock is not traded on any formalized exchange.  Therefore,
assumption of reinvestment of dividends may be effected by the lack of
availability of shares to purchase.

PROFITABILITY MEASURE AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The return on average assets (ROA) and the return on average equity (ROE) are
key measures of profitability.  ROA measures how effectively Twentieth Bancorp
utilizes its assets to produce net income while ROE measures the amount of
income earned relative to the amount of shareholders' investment in Twentieth
Bancorp.  Bancorp's ROA increased to 1.09% for the year ending December 31,
1995, compared to 1.03%, and .98% for the years 1994, and 1993, respectively.
ROE was 10.80% for December 31, 1995, compared to 10.84% and 10.81% for the
years 1994, and 1993, respectively.  Average equity to average assets of 10.10%
for December 31, 1995 increased 63 basis points from 9.47% in December 31,
1994, reflected higher retained earnings.

The board of directors has recently initiated an evaluation of the bank's
strategic alternatives and methods to improve shareholder value and liquidity.
To assist us, we hired a nationally recognized investment banking firm, Baxter
Fentriss and Company.  The conclusions of this evaluation resulted in the Board
taking additional steps to enhance the value of Bancorp's stock including the
exploration of mergers or a sale of the bank.  On February 6, 1996, The
Twentieth Bancorp, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to be merged into
the Horizon Bancorp, Inc. with its primary office located in Beckley, West
Virginia.  This merger is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 1996
and will be accounted for as a pooling-of interest.  The agreement provides for
the exchange of 1.01 shares of Horizon Bancorp capital stock for each of the
1,800,000 outstanding shares of the Twentieth Bancorp.  The agreement
stipulates certain market price conditions that could rescind the merger.  The
transaction is also subject to the approvals of both the shareholders and the
appropriate regulatory authorities.  The Horizon Bancorp is listed on the
NASDAQ Stock Exchange.

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Twentieth Bancorp will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Horizon Bancorp.  Horizon Bancorp, a bank holding
company, headquartered in Beckley, West Virginia had total assets of $614,745,
total deposits of $514,475 and shareholders equity of $71,107 at December 31,
1995.

NET INTEREST INCOME

The most significant component of earnings is net interest income.  This
category of income is very sensitive to changes in the volume, mix and interest
yield/rate of earning assets, and interest bearing liabilities.  Net interest
income on a federal tax equivalent basis (FTE) improved 4.1% to $14,766 in 1995
compared to $14,188 earned in 1994, which follows an increase of 10.9% for 1994
over 1993.  Twentieth Bancorp's net interest income grew during 1995 by $697 or
5.02% to $14,595 from $13,898 for 1994 which followed an increase of $1,439
from 1993.  This trend primarily is a result of the repricing effects of loans
versus deposits whereas loan rates changed more rapidly during the upward trend
in interest rates since 1993.  The tax equivalent basis adjustment has been
included in interest income to reflect the level of income had income on
obligations of state and political subdivision exempt from income tax, being
taxed at a rate of 34%, for all periods reported.

The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased to
5.04%, an improvement of 12 basis points from the net interest margin recorded
a year earlier of 4.92% and 44 basis points increase from 4.48% in 1993.
Yields paid on interest bearing liabilities increased to 3.84% for the year
ended December 31, 1995 when compared to 2.99% and 3.32% for 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The increase in loan volume and yield is the primary reason for
the continued increases in average earning asset yields.  Total earning assets
yields increased 76 basis points to 8.16% in 1995 as compared to 1994 which was
7.49%.  This followed an 11 basis point increase from the 7.29% yield for 1993.
Yield levels paid on interest bearing liabilities also increased 85 basis
points to 3.84% in 1995 as compared to 1994 at 2.99% which had declined from
3.32% in 1993.  However, the volume of interest bearing liabilities have
declined from $241,017 in 1993 to $238,534 and $237,987 in 1994 and 1995,
respectively.  The net interest margin increased to 5.04% during 1995 from
4.92% in 1994 which had increased from 4.48% in 1993 is directly linked to the
increase in total earning asset volume as compared to the decrease in total
interest bearing liabilities.  Interest income is presented in Table 2 of
Distribution of Average Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity; Interest
Rates and Interest Differential in further detail.

A Rate Volume Analysis of the Changes in Interest Margin is provided in Table 3
including the effects of changes in average volume and in average interest
rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

Interest income (FTE) from average earning assets increased $2,588 or 12.1% in
1995 following an increase of $542 or 2.6% in 1994.  Changes in the rates on
average earning assets, primarily loans, contributed to the growth in 1995.
During 1995, management tightened credit with higher interest rates which had
an effect of reducing loans, while utilizing increased security yields to
re-invest the loan proceeds.  In addition to loan monies, matured investment
securities were primarily reinvested in securities available for sale to
increase liquidity for potential shifts in the market.

Interest bearing liabilities include time and savings deposits, federal funds
purchased, repurchase agreements, and other borrowings.  These are the primary
sources of funds which support earning assets.  The total expense on average
interest bearing liabilities increased $2,010 or 28.2% for 1995 over 1994.
This compares to a decrease in 1994 over 1993 of $852 or 10.6%.  The 1994
decrease occurred from a decline of 33 basis points in average interest rates
paid on interest bearing liabilities.  The shift from savings and interest
bearing demand deposits to time deposits was primarily due to higher yields
paid on certificates of deposits.  The changes in composition of the deposits
is a result of late year interest rate increases which attracted customers away
from the demand accounts to time deposits in 1994.  This trend continued into
1995 and resulted in higher costs for interest bearing deposits and marginal
narrowing of increases in net interest margin spreads.

The effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different
than non-banking companies since virtually all of a bank's assets and
liabilities are monetary in nature.  In particular, interest rates are
significantly affected by inflation, but neither the timing nor magnitude of
the changes are directly related to price level indices; therefore, the
corporation can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net
interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and
expenses.

NONINTEREST INCOME

Excluding securities gains and losses (net of tax benefit), noninterest income
increased $114 or 7.6% in 1995 following a 1994 increase of $46 or 3.2% over
1993.  As a percentage of average total assets, other noninterest income,
excluding security gains and losses, increased to .51% for 1995 from .49% and
 .47% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Trust Department income decreased $22 or
4.8% in 1995 following a 1994 increase of $45 or 10.7% when compared to 1993.
Service charges on deposits increased $115 or 14.9% in 1995 following an
increase of $68 or 9.7% in 1994 when compared to 1993.  The increases in 1993
through 1995 were due to increases in service charges for all consumer deposit
account products.  The trust department decrease for 1995 compared to 1994 was
a result of a one-time estate charges volume in 1994 for existing customers
while the normal trend in regular fees have increased.

Security gains and losses are taken in accordance with investment strategies
for improving the quality, liquidity, or average yield of the investment
portfolio. There were no sales of investments held to maturity in 1995 and
1994, however, 1994 exchanges made within 90 days of maturity yielded gross
gains of $5 and gross losses of $4.  Early call of securities, held to
maturity, in 1993 resulted in a gross gain of $10.  There were no sales of
investments held for sale during 1995, however, gross realized losses from
securities held for sale during 1994 were $347 on proceeds of $9,049.

NONINTEREST EXPENSES

The management of noninterest expenses is essential in achieving growth and
stability in earnings, to the extent that long-term goals are not abandoned for
short-term gains.  This is accomplished by managing a comprehensive budgeting
process and continuing the review of operating efficiencies at all levels of
operations.  Noninterest expenses are frequently referred to as overhead, they
are the costs which are incurred through normal operation.  During 1995, total
noninterest expenses decreased $176 or 1.9% over 1994 following an increase of
$233 or 2.5% for 1994 over 1993.

Pension and employee benefits increased $104 or 22.8% in 1995 over 1994.  This
increase is directly attributable to the increase in profit sharing
contribution of $80, and a $114 or 3.4% increase in salaries.  Salaries
increased $76 or 2.3% in 1994 over 1993.  Salary increases represent normal
increases to existing employees throughout the periods from 1993 through 1995.
Employee benefit increases coincide with salary increases for the periods 1993
through 1995, except for the inclusion of $237 in 1993.  This was for the
redirection of pension assets, on the termination of the defined benefit plan,
receivable by the Bancorp but reverted to its employees.  This is discussed in
Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

Occupancy, furniture and equipment expenses have increased to $1,139 in 1995 as
compared to $1,079 in 1994 and $1,001 in 1993.  These increases represent
routine maintenance cost increases as a result of the normal aging of the
facilities and inflation.

The decrease in other operating expenses of $454 or 9.9% in 1995 over 1994
consists primarily of a decrease in dealer commission to $315 in 1995 as
compared to $777 in 1994, and $326 in 1993.  The primary reason was due to the
credit policy change initiated by management toward indirect lending by
increasing rates on auto loans.  Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation reduced the insurance premiums banks are required to pay on
deposits, as a result a refund of $168 was received in the third quarter of
1995.

The remaining decrease in noninterest expense is broad based and not associated
with any one specific item.  Control of other expense accounts has also
contributed to the reduction in this area.  As a percentage of average total
assets, other expenses were 3.0%, 3.1% and 3.0 for the years 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Current federal income taxes increased to $1,738 for 1995 as compared to $1,472
and $1,240 for 1994 and 1993, respectively.  This increase stems from a
combination of investment strategies in reducing the holding of tax exempt
securities and increased earnings in the loan portfolio.  The State of West
Virginia liability amounted to $343, $293 and $249 in the years 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.

The statutory federal tax rate was 34% for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993.  The
primary differences between applying statutory rates to income before income
taxes and deriving the current federal income tax expense is tax-exempt loan
and security income.  The effective tax rate, applicable income taxes expressed
as a percentage of income before taxes, was 37.17% in 1995, 34.32% in 1994 and
30.15% in 1993.  During 1995 an examination by the Internal Revenue Service was
completed for the years 1993 and 1992.  The examination resulted in an
additional net federal and state income tax provision of $30 which has been
included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1995.
The resulting net interest paid of $43, due primarily to timing differences in
loan loss recognition, also is reflected in current operations.  Additional
information concerning income taxes are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to the
Financial Statements.

Additionally, reported federal income taxes do not represent the total tax
cost.  The benefit of paying reduced federal income taxes on interest earned
from tax-exempt loans and securities is partially offset by accepting lower
pre-tax yields on these investments, when compared to yields available on
alternative taxable transactions.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A summary of quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994 is presented in the table below.  The results of operations for
the first three quarters of 1995 have been discussed in our quarterly reports
to shareholders.  Net income for the fourth quarter of 1995 decreased $122 or
13.4% as compared to the same quarter in 1994.  On a per share basis, fourth
quarter earnings were $0.44 compared to $0.50 in 1994.  The primary reasons for
the reduction was increased provision for loan losses of $401 when compared to
1994 primarily due to late quarter charge-offs of two large commercial
customers.  The decrease in net interest income of $293 or 7.5% was primarily
due to the increase of total interest expense of $541 or 29.2% net of an
increase in total interest income of $248 or 4.3% in the fourth quarter over
the same period in 1994.  This is the result of the late year narrowing of the
interest margin as loans declined from earlier periods.  Other income for the
second quarter of 1994 contains security losses of $188.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

Loans are the primary use of financial resources and represent the largest
component of earning assets.  The prime rate stabilized in 1995 as compared to
the sharp increase experienced in 1994.  Total gross loans outstanding
decreased 5.4% to $194.2 million for 1995 over 1994 which compared to an
increase of 12.9% for 1994 over 1993.  Expressed as a percentage of average
earning assets, average total loans on a consolidated basis increased to 67.6%
in 1995 from 66.0% in 1994 and 62.0% in 1993.  However, loans were declining
throughout the year of 1995 as management tightened credit with higher interest
rates which had the effect of reducing loans.

A majority of loans are priced at a floating rate as shown in the table below
which produces a positive impact on margins during an increasing interest rate
environment.  The yield on loans has increased to 9.1% in 1995 from 8.1% in
1994 and 7.8% in 1993, resulting from increased interest rates due to increase
prime rate changes throughout 1994, and the tightening of credit policies on
indirect lending and commercial loans.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

The second largest component of earning assets is investment securities.
Investments play a major role as a source of liquidity and in the management of
the overall sensitivity of earning assets to changes in market interest rates.
Twentieth Bancorp's investment portfolio is composed of U. S. Treasury and
other U. S. government agency obligations, government agency issued mortgage-
backed securities, state and municipal securities, and other securities.  On
January 1, 1994, Bancorp adopted SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities" which requires investment securities to be
classified as either held to maturity, available for sale, or trading
securities.  SFAS 115 changed the accounting for investment securities
available for sale from the lower of cost or market to fair value as well as
requiring trading securities to be carried at fair value.  In addition, certain
securities were reclassified to available for sale on January 1, 1994 as a
result of the adoption.  Total carrying value of investment securities
increased $13.9 million or 16.9% in 1995 following a decrease of $17.5 million
or 17.6% in 1994 following a decrease of $6.5 million or 6.1% in 1993.  The
fair values of investment securities were 101.1% of amortized cost as of the
end of 1995 as compared to 97.4% of amortized cost as of the end of 1994 as
compared to 102.0% for 1993.

Investment securities available for sale are being carried with a net
unrealized gain of $583 at December 31, 1995 as compared to a net unrealized
loss of a $1,894 at December 31, 1994.  The unrealized gain, net of $198 in
deferred taxes, is being carried as an increase in shareholders' equity in 1995
as compared to a loss, net of $644 in deferred taxes, which was carried as a
reduction in shareholders' equity in 1994.  In 1994 management utilized
proceeds from the maturity of securities to fund its aggressive loan policy
which yielded 199 basis points better in 1994 than investment securities.
While in 1995 the tightening of loan rates spurred the increase in investments.

However, available for sale securities were purchased two-to-one over those
held to maturities to allow for the shifting of yield concentrations in the
future between loans and securities.

The losses reflected under SFAS #115 in 1994 were temporary in nature due to
the rapid increase in interest rates during 1994 by the Federal Reserve board
in conjunction with the mix of securities being held in the investment
portfolio.  Unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale, which is
recorded as a component of shareholders' equity, will continue to be subject to
change in future periods due to fluctuations in market value, purchased, sales,
maturities and calls of securities classified as available for sale.  However,
it is management's opinion, after reviewing the portfolio that any remaining
unrealized losses are deemed temporary in nature.

Bancorp has three securities in U. S. government agencies available-for-sale
that are structured notes.  Structured notes are debt securities whose cash
flow characteristics (coupon rate, redemption amount, or stated maturity)
depend upon one or more indices and/or that have embedded forwards or options
or are otherwise commonly known as "structured notes."  These three securities
are all Federal Home Loan Bank Floater issues and their interest is reset
quarterly.  These securities total $3,250 book value and $3,153 at fair value.

OVERNIGHT INVESTMENTS

Federal funds sold totaled $2,275 at December 31, 1995 which represents the
increase over the prior year as the balance at December 31, 1994 was $-0-.  In
1994 reductions of federal funds sold helped to finance the growth of the loan
portfolio.

DEPOSITS

Total deposits at December 31, 1995, increased $1,193 or .4%.  The shift from
savings and interest-bearing demand deposits to time certificates was
substantially attributed to the nine month certificate introduced in April and
May, 1995 at 6.50%.  Since that time the rate has been lowered to 5.35%, in
line with our market competitiveness on traditional deposit instruments.
Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $41,970 and decreased $3,512 or 7.7% from
December 31, 1994. Interest-bearing demand or NOW accounts totaled $46,660 down
$4,954 or 9.6% from December 31, 1994.  Savings accounts also decreased $20,330
or 20.9% to $76,713 at December 31, 1995 as compared to 1994.  Time Deposits
increased $29,989 or 35.3% to $114,914 at December 31, 1995 as compared to 1994
totals. The interest rate sensitivity of these deposits is outlined in Table 8.
<PAGE>   19


BORROWED FUNDS

In connection with the acquisition of property adjacent to the main branch of
the Twentieth Street Bank, the Bank issued a 6% promissory note to the owners,
at their request, to be amortized over ten years.  There are no significant
amounts of long-term debt due in any one year.

</TABLE>

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $1,245 at December 31,
1995, and decreased $1,980 or 61.4% from December 31, 1994.  The reduction in
federal funds purchased was a direct result of liquidity needs at the end of
1994 as compared to the surplus at December 31, 1995.


LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

Bank Liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate and maintain sufficient
cash flows to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors
and borrowers promptly and in a cost-effective manner.  Liquidity is provided
through securities available for sale, federal funds sold, maturing loans and
securities, and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowing as needed.
Bancorp's liquidity position is measured on a daily basis, and monitored
regularly by the Asset/Liability Management Committee.  The objective is to
optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital
adequacy, liquidity needs, the interest rate and economic outlook, market
opportunities, and customer requirements.  General strategies to accomplish
this objective include maintaining a strong balance sheet, achieving solid core
deposit growth, accepting manageable interest rate risk, adhering to
conservative financial management principles and practicing prudent dividend
policies.

As of December 31, 1995, the Bancorp's cash and cash equivalents totaled
$17,728 compared to $15,324 on December 31, 1994 as a result of an increase in
federal funds sold stemming from loan policies.  Bancorp's securities portfolio
includes $82,576 in unencumbered value that could have been converted to cash
at December 31, 1995.  On December 31, 1995, total shareholders' equity was
$33,276 compared to $29,310 on December 31, 1994.  This increase of $3,966 or
13.5% was primarily due to retention of profits of approximately $2,331 and the
change in the unrealized gain/loss position from a $1,250 unrealized loss at
December 31, 1994 to a $385 unrealized gain on December 31, 1995 on investment
securities available-for-sale.

Asset and liability management consists of planning, implementing, and
controlling the process for determining the mix and maturities of assets
relative to the interest margin.  The primary method for achieving this is
through managing the gap position of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive
liabilities, which is presented in Table 8 below.

EARNINGS, DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL

A central principle in the capital planning process is to attain sufficiently
high levels of profitability to ensure that capital adequacy is maintained
while generating a consistent level of dividends.  Total equity at December 31,
1995 was $33.3 million, an increase of 13.5% over year-end 1994.  This increase
of almost 4 million in equity for 1995 followed an increase of $1 million or
3.5% in 1994.  These increases resulted from income retained after dividends as
shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.  Equity
was also increased by $1.6 million at December 31, 1995 from the change in net
unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities.

Risk-based capital ratios are another measure of capital adequacy.  At December
31, 1995, the consolidated risk-adjusted capital ratios were 16.06% for Tier 1
and 17.06% for total capital, well above the required minimums of 4.0% and
8.0%, respectively.  The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.09% at December 31, 1995
also was significantly above the regulatory minimum of 4.0%.  Twentieth
Bancorp's subsidiary bank was considered "well capitalized" as of December 31,
1995, the highest category of capitalization defined by regulatory authorities,
allowing the lowest level of FDIC insurance payments.  This was reduced to
zero, down from 23 cents per $100 rate that existed.  A refund from FDIC is
reflected in 1995 earnings.

Asset growth in 1995 was outpaced by capital growth which caused the primary
capital ratio to increase to 11.1 % for 1995 from 9.9% for 1994.  Primary
capital is total primary capital plus allowance for loan losses divided by
total assets plus allowance for loan losses.  The dividend per share on common
stock, taking into effect the 3 for 1 stock split, in 1995 was $.60 compared to
$.50 in 1994.  Dividend levels paid on common stock increased 20% per share in
1995.

As of March 16, 1996, the approximate number of shareholders of Twentieth
Bancorp's common stock totaled 433.  Part II, Item 5 sets forth the market
prices of common stock and cash dividends declared per share of common stock.

Dividends paid by the subsidiary bank to Twentieth Bancorp are the primary
source of funds available to Twentieth Bancorp for the payment of dividends to
its shareholders.  Dividends paid by Banks are subject to restriction by
banking regulations.  Dividends declared in any year cannot exceed the year's
net income, as defined, plus the retained net profits of the two preceding
years.  As of December 31, 1995, the net retained profits available for
distribution as dividends in 1996 without regulatory approval are approximately
$4,521 for The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc.

RISK EXPOSURES AND CREDIT QUALITY

Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses
are impacted by many factors, including general economic conditions, actual and
prospective credit losses, loan performance measures, historical trends, and
other circumstances, both internal and external. The provision for loan losses
is established by charging operating expenses with an amount which will
maintain the allowance for possible loan losses at a sufficient level to
provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio.  Loan losses are charged
directly to the allowance when they occur, while recoveries are credited to the
allowance.  The provision for loan losses is determined by management, upon
consideration of several factors, which includes the following: changes in the
character and size of the loan portfolio and related loan loss experience, a
review and examination of overall loan quality which includes the assessment of
problem loans, and an analysis of anticipated economic conditions in the market
area.  An analysis of the provision for loan losses and charge-off activity to
the allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table.
Management's evaluation and resulting provision and allowance decisions are
reviewed by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.  Increased provisions
in loan loss reserves are directly impacted by current net charged-off loans.
This history is used in conjunction with request from the regulatory
authorities.

The provision for loan losses in 1995 was $1,444, as compared to $739 for 1994.
The provision for loan losses increased over net charge-offs by $175 for 1995
and 1994, respectively, and decreased $85 for 1993.  Net charge-offs, as a
percent of average loans outstanding, for 1995 was .64% as compared to .30% in
1994, and .26% in 1993.  The upward trend in charge-offs on consumer loans are
a result of aggressive indirect lending on automobile loans during the end of
1993 through 1994.  The commercial net loan loss increase is primarily due to a
few non recurring customer loans.  See Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information in regards to nonaccruing and impaired
loans.

<PAGE>   23
Bancorp adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (FASB 114), as of January 1,
1995.  This new accounting  standard requires that a loan which meets the
definition of impairment be measured at the present value of expected future
cash flows using the loan's effective interest rate, or as a practical
expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  A loan is impaired when, based
on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be
unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement.  The applicable valuation allowance and other pertinent
information on impaired loans are disclosed in Note 4 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements.  The year-end allowance for possible loan losses was
increased from 1994's balance of $1,825 to a balance of $2,000 in 1995.  The
allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the major loan categories for
the past five years is provided in the table below.  The allocation is made
according to the charge-off experience in each category in the preceding year.

The loan classification schedule showing a summary of non-performing assets is
included in the table below.  Non-performing assets consist of (a) loans on a
nonaccrual basis; (b) loans contractually past due ninety days or over as to
interest or principal payments and not included in the nonaccrual total; (c)
other real estate owned taken as loan collateral.  Non-performing loan status
is determined and identified by; individual loan officers; normal management
information data; Internal Audit Department; Independent Auditors; Loan Review
Department; or the Regulatory Examiners; and the status of such loans is
monitored on an ongoing basis.  In many cases, non-performing loans involve
elements of collectibility such as marketable collateral or substantial outside
guarantees, which would ensure the ultimate recovery of all principal and
interest.  Non-performing loans, which present elements of risk regarding
recovery of principal and interest, require a non-interest accrual status.
Loans on a nonaccrual status are those loans which (a) contain elements of
principal or interest loss potential in which the principal or interest is
ninety days past due; or (b) are now current but management has serious doubts
as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms.
Any unpaid amounts at risk and previously accrued on these loans are reversed
from income, and thereafter interest is recognized only to the extent payments
are received or the loan has otherwise been rehabilitated.  As a result of
consumer lending and the company's intention to spread the credit risk among
many borrowers, losses were concentrated more in the consumer sector as opposed
to the commercial and real estate loans.  That trend was reversed in 1995
through the use of increased interest rates.

The $200 decrease in other real estate owned is primarily due to the sale of
the Alum Creek Branch which was closed in early 1994 and sold in 1995.

Item 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA


                     TWENTIETH BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
                 MANAGEMENT'S STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL REPORTING

The accompanying financial statements and related financial information
contained in this Annual Report were prepared by the management of Twentieth
Bancorp, Inc. and its Subsidiary, The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc. in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and where appropriate reflect
management's best estimates and judgments.  The financial information appearing
throughout this 10-K is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility, management relies on systems of internal control
which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are
reliable for preparing financial statements, maintaining accountability for
assets and that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or
dispositions.  The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of
a system of internal control should not exceed the benefits derived.
Management believes the Bancorp's system of internal control provides
reasonable assurance that the Bancorp's assets are safeguarded and that its
financial records are reliable.

The Bancorp's internal auditors and independent auditors have direct access to
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  This Committee is comprised
entirely of outside directors and meets periodically with management, the
internal auditor and the independent auditors to ensure the financial
accounting and audit process are properly conducted.

The independent auditors, Diamond, Leftwich, Goheen & Dunn, CPA's, whose report
is contained herein, are responsible for auditing the Bancorp's financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Their
audits include procedures designed to enable them to report that the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Twentieth Bancorp,
Inc. and its Subsidiary, The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


                        DIAMOND, LEFTWICH, GOHEEN & DUNN
                          Certified Public Accountants


To the Shareholders and the
Board of Directors of Twentieth Bancorp, Inc.
Huntington, West Virginia


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TWENTIETH
BANCORP, INC. and its Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
TWENTIETH BANCORP, INC. and its Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each

                     TWENTIETH BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    The accounting and reporting policies of Twentieth Bancorp, Inc. and its
wholly-owned Subsidiary conform with generally accepted accounting principles
and prevailing practices of the banking industry.  The policies which
materially affect the determination of financial position, changes in financial
position or results of operations are summarized as follows:


o   Basis of presentation:

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twentieth
Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned Subsidiary, The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  All liability changes due to acquisitions have also been
eliminated.

o   Accounting method:

    The accompanying financial statements are prepared on the accrual method.

o   Investment securities:

    Prior to January 1, 1994, all investment securities were carried at
historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.  On January 1, 1994, the Bancorp adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities."  Investment securities are classified in two categories
and accounted for as follows-

    Securities to be Held to Maturity represent bonds, notes and debentures for
which the Bancorp has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts which are recognized in interest income using the interest method
over the period to maturity.

    Securities Available for Sale represent bonds, notes, debentures and
certain equity securities not classified as securities to be held to maturity
and are carried at fair value.

    Declines in the fair value of individual held to maturity and available for
sale securities below their cost that are other than temporary would result in
write-downs of the individual securities to their fair value.  The related
write-downs would be included in earnings as realized losses.

    Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, on securities available
for sale are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders'
equity until realized.

    Gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are
determined using the specific-identification method.
<PAGE>   33

o   Loans and allowances for loan losses:

    Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned
discount and allowance for loan losses.  Interest income on discounted loans is
recognized using methods which approximate the interest method.  Interest
income on other loans is recognized using the simple interest method based upon
the principal amount outstanding.

    The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan
losses charged to expenses.  The allowance represents an amount which, in
management's judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing
loans that may become uncollectible.  Management's judgment in determining the
adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of
loans.  These evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in
the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that
may affect the borrower's ability to pay, overall portfolio quality and review
of specific problem loans.

    Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when management believes that the
borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and
business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest
is doubtful.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when
management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely.

    Loan origination, commitment fees and direct loan origination costs are
being recognized as collected and incurred.  The use of this method of
recognition does not produce results that are materially different from results
which would have been produced if such costs and fees were deferred and
amortized as an adjustment of loan yield.

o   Premises and equipment:

    Buildings and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation,
computed principally on the straight-line method for buildings, and an
accelerated method for equipment, over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.

    Estimated lives of the principal items of premises and equipment are:
building and improvements - 15 to 40 years; and furniture, fixtures and
equipment - 5 to 10 years.  The costs of major renovations are capitalized,
while the costs of ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

o   Other real estate:

    Other real estate, acquired through partial or total satisfaction of loans,
is carried at the lower of cost or fair market value minus estimated costs to
sell, determined at date of acquisition with applicable write-downs being
charged to allowance for loan losses.  Any subsequent write-downs to reflect
current market value and expenses incurred in connection with operating these
properties are charged to other operating expenses.

o   Excess of cost over net assets of acquisitions:

    The excess of cost over net assets of acquisitions included with other
assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is being amortized on the
straight-line method over periods ranging from fifteen to twenty-five years.
<PAGE>   34

o   Income taxes:

    Provisions for income taxes are based on amounts reported in the statements
of income (after exclusion of non-taxable income such as interest on state and
municipal securities) and include deferred taxes on temporary differences in
the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.
Deferred taxes are computed on the liability method as prescribed in SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

    The Bancorp and its Subsidiary, The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc., file a
consolidated income tax return.

o   Trust assets:

    Assets (other than cash deposits with the Bank) held by the Trust
Department in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in
the financial statements since such items are not assets of the Bank.  Trust
income is recognized on the accrual basis.

o   Earnings per share:

    Earnings per share computations are based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during each year.  The average shares outstanding for 1995,
1994 and 1993 were 1,797,840, 1,799,703, and 1,799,838, respectively, and have
been restated to incorporate the three-for-one (3-for-1) stock split on May 15,
1995.

o   Cash and cash equivalents:

    For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash on hand, amounts due from banks, food coupons and federal funds sold.
Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods.

o   Other:

    Bancorp capital stock when acquired for the treasury is stated at cost.
Upon issuance, the treasury stock account is reduced on the first-in/first-out
basis.

    Reciprocal corporate bank balances and receivables have been eliminated.

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121 (SFAS 121), "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of", was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in March
1995.  The Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles to be held and used by a company be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable.  In performing the review for
recoverability, the company should estimate the future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  An impairment
loss would be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows,
undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the assets.  Measurement of
an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset.  The
statement excludes financial instruments, long-term customer relationships of
financial institutions, mortgage and other servicing rights, and deferred tax
assets.  Adoption of the new accounting standard is expected to occur on
January 1, 1996.  Bancorp does not expect any impact to the Corporation's net

NOTE 2. PENDING AFFILIATION

    On February 6, 1996, the Twentieth Bancorp, Inc. entered into a definitive
agreement to be merged into the Horizon Bancorp, Inc. with its primary office
located in Beckley, West Virginia.  This merger is expected to be completed in
the third quarter of 1996 and will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interest.
The agreement provides for the exchange of 1.01 shares of Horizon Bancorp
capital stock for each of the 1,800,000 outstanding shares of the Twentieth
Bancorp.  The agreement stipulates certain market price conditions that could
rescind the merger.  The transaction is also subject to the approvals of both
the shareholders and the appropriate regulatory authorities.  The Horizon
Bancorp is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.

NOTE 3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES

    On January 1, 1994, Bancorp adopted SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which requires Investment
Securities to be classified as either Held to Maturity or Available for Sale.
SFAS 115 changed the accounting for investment securities available for sale
from the lower of cost or market to fair value.  In addition, certain
securities were reclassified to Available for Sale on January 1, 1994 as a
result of the adoption.

   Investment securities with an amortized cost of $13,591,429 and $13,497,495
and fair value of $13,918,230 and $13,344,779 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and for other purposes as required by law.

   There were no sales of investments held to maturity in 1995 and 1994,
however, 1994 exchanges made within 90 days of maturity yielded gross gains of
$5,449 and gross losses of $4,222.  Early call of securities, held to maturity,
in 1993 resulted in a gross gain of $10,000.

   There were no sales of investments held for sale during 1995, however, gross
realized losses from securities held for sale during 1994 were $347,219 on
proceeds of $9,049,375.

     Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued or reduced
amounted to $2,192,436 and $492,334 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,

     If these loans had been current throughout their terms, interest income
would have approximated $160,994, $36,564, and $56,212 for 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.  Interest income on those loans, which recorded only when
received, amounted to $4,251, $3,103, and $27,065 in 1995, 1994, and 1993.

    The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan"  (SFAS 114) in 1993.  SFAS 114 was further amended by the FASB in
1994 through the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and
Disclosures" (SFAS 118).  Effective January 1, 1995, SFAS No. 114, as amended
by SFAS 118, required that an impaired loan be measured and reported on the
basis of the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the loan's collateral if the
loan is deemed "collateral dependent."  Impaired loans are specifically
reviewed loans for which it is probable that the creditor will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement.  SFAS 118
allows a creditor to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on an
impaired loan.  For Bancorp nonaccrual loans and impaired loans, interest
receipts are recognized as interest revenue or are applied to principal when
management believes the ultimate collectibility of principal is in doubt.

    SFAS 114 does not apply to larger groups of homogeneous loans such as
consumer installment, bank card and real estate mortgage loans, which are
collectively evaluated for impairment.  Impaired loans are therefore primarily
business loans, which include commercial loans and income property and
construction real estate loans.  Small balance populations of business loans,
which are not specifically reviewed in accordance with Bancorp's normal credit
review procedures are also excluded from the application of SFAS 114.
Bancorp's  impaired loans are non-accrual loans, as generally loans are placed
in nonaccrual status on the earlier of the date that principal or interest
amounts are 90 days or more past due or the date that collection of such
amounts is judged uncertain based on evaluation of the net realizable value of
the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower.

   Impaired loans and the applicable valuation allowance at December 31, 1995
were as follows:

   The balance of impaired loans at January 1, 1995 totalled $290,202.  Because
the majority of loans deemed impaired during the first year were collateral
dependent, valuations of impaired loans did not vary materially from the values
previously assigned to this population of loans.  The initial adoption of the
new accounting standard did not require an increase to Bancorp's allowance for
loan losses.  The impact of adopting SFAS 114, as amended by SFAS 118, was
therefore immaterial to the financial condition and operations of Bancorp for
the year ended December 31, 1995.  In accordance with SFAS 114, no retroactive
application of its provisions has been made to the consolidated financial
statements for periods prior to January 1, 1995.

    In December, 1995 a new branch of the Twentieth Street Bank was opened,
located in Hamlin, West Virginia.  Related costs of premises and equipment
totalled $197,205 through December 31, 1995.

    The Alum Creek Branch, of the Twentieth Street Bank, was closed on March
31, 1994.  Bank premises totalling $371,105 with a book value of $276,263 was
transferred to other real estate owned at an estimated fair value of $200,000.
However, it was subsequently sold in 1995 for $175,000.  The losses of $25,000
and $76,263 were charged to operations for 1995 and 1994, respectively.

</TABLE>

    During 1995 an examination by the Internal Revenue Service was completed
for the years 1993 and 1992.  The examination resulted in an additional net
federal and state income tax provision of $29,968 which has been included in
the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1995.  The resulting
net interest paid of $43,431, due primarily to timing differences in loan loss
recognition, also reflected in current operations.

   The provision for current income taxes above include amounts related to
securities transactions of $-0-, ($131,477) and $3,800 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

   Accumulated deferred income taxes of $238,416 and $220,000, respectively, at
December 31, 1995 and 1993 are included in accrued interest and other
liabilities.  A deferred income tax benefit of $541,058 at December 31, 1994 is
included in other assets.

NOTE 10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

   On March 30, 1995, the shareholders approved an increase in the authorized
capital stock from 1,200,000 shares to 3,600,000 shares, reduced the par value
of capital stock from $2.50 to $1.00 per share.  Subsequently the Board of
Directors declared a twenty percent (20%) stock split effected in the form of a
dividend for shareholders of record on May 15, 1995 which capitalized $300,000
of retained earnings into capital stock.  The combined results of these
transactions complete a three-for-one (3-for-1) capital stock split.  All
references to per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements
reflect the stock split.

NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

o  Pension plan

   All employees of the Bancorp and its subsidiary who have attained the age of
21 and have completed one year of service automatically become participants in
the Bancorp's profit-sharing/salary savings plan (voluntary deferred
compensation plan) on the next January 1 or July 1 entry date immediately
following the one year service date.  Cash contributions paid or payable for
the plan years 1995 and 1994 were $280,000 and $200,185 for the profit-sharing
feature of this plan.  Amounts paid or payable for the deferred compensation
matching provision of the salary savings plan were $29,834, $33,262 and $36,666
for the plan years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Twentieth Street
Bank, Inc. serves as Trustee of this plan.  Employer profit-sharing
contributions are integrated with social security benefits and covered
employees on the salary savings plan may contribute between 2% and 15% of their
annual salary, for which the employer matches the contribution on the first 5%
at a rate of 25%.  Employer contributions to the profit-sharing plan vests
after 5 years of service, whereas, the salary savings plan vests concurrent
with the contribution.

    Prior to 1992, Bancorp employees participated in a defined benefit plan in
which benefits were determined using the actuarial cost method.  The plan
benefits were frozen as of May 1, 1992 and only benefits accruing from May 2,
1992, through plan settlement date on August 1, 1993, were the responsibility
of the Corporation.  Employees were considered 100% vested at date of
termination.  There were no cash contributions payable for the plan year 1993
by Bancorp or its subsidiary.

   On termination of the defined benefit plan on August 1, 1993, plan assets of
$4,421,698 were distributed to or on behalf of the participants in full
satisfaction of all accumulated benefit obligations.

    The excess of the fair value over the projected benefit obligation was
recognized in 1992 as a gain in accordance with the "Accounting for Plan
Curtailment" provisions, under SFAS No. 88.  This was reduced by termination
benefits payable to the employees net of the excise tax on the asset reversion
transaction to be returned in 1993.  In July, 1993 the employer awarded to the
plan participants 100% of the excess remainder after funding mandatory employee
contribution balances instead of the 50% originally approved.  The effect of
this decision eliminated the monies to be returned to the employer and the
payment of the related excise tax.

   Pension gain attributable to the defined benefit plan was comprised of the
following:

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

   The Bancorp's Subsidiary, The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc., is party to
financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of
business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial
instruments include loan commitments, unused credit card limits and standby
letters of credit.  The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
financial statements.

   The Bancorp grants retail, commercial and commercial real estate loans to
customers located throughout western West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and
southern Ohio.  Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon
extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the
customer.  Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable,
inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial
properties.  Although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial
portion of the debtors' ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the
economic conditions in each loan's respective location.

   Substantially, all of the Bank's loans, commitments, and commercial and
standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Bank's market
area.  Most of such customers are depositors of the Bank.  Investments in state
and municipal securities also involve governmental entities within the Bank's
market area.  The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in
Note 4.  The distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the
distribution of loans outstanding.  Commercial and standby letters of credit
were granted primarily to commercial borrowers.

  The total amounts of off-balance-sheet instruments with credit risk at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 are as follows:

   Loan commitments                $26,660,000       $22,451,000
   Unused credit card lines          3,884,000         3,728,000
   Standby letters of credit         3,105,000         2,676,000
</TABLE>

   Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Those guarantees are
primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements,
including normal business activities, bond financing and similar transactions.

   Commitments to extend credit are obligations to loan to customers at
prevailing market rates specific sums, as long as there is no violation of any
preestablished condition of the loan agreement.  Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of
a fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements.  The Bank evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a
case-by-case basis.

   The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and
standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those
instruments.  The Bank uses the same credit and collateral policies in making
commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending.  Collateral
which secures these types of commitments is the same type as collateral for
other types of lending such as accounts receivable, inventory, real estate and
equipment.

   Various legal proceedings are pending for and against The Twentieth Street
Bank, Inc.  Management, after reviewing this litigation with legal council,
believes that the aggregate liability, if any, resulting from them will not
have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
<PAGE>   44

NOTE 13.  REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS

   The primary source of funds for the dividends paid by the Bancorp is
dividends received from its subsidiary bank. Dividends paid by banks are
subject to restriction by banking regulations.  Dividends declared in any year
cannot exceed the year's net income, as defined, plus the retained net profits
of the two preceding years.  As of December 31, 1995, the net retained profits
available for distribution as dividends in 1996 without regulatory approval are
approximately $4,521,013 for The Twentieth Street Bank, Inc..

   Banking regulations also require the Bank to maintain certain minimum
capital levels in relation to Bank assets.  At December 31, 1995, regulations
required a ratio of capital to assets of 6 percent.  The Bank's capital, as
defined by regulation, was 10.64 percent of assets at December 31, 1995.

   Regulations have been issued requiring maintenance of minimum capital levels
based on asset risk.  A minimum risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent and a
minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent is required.  The Bank's total risk-based
capital ratio at December 31, 1995, was approximately 16.85 percent and its
leverage ratio was approximately 10.00 percent.

   The subsidiary bank has maintained sufficient cash reserves, approximately
$251,057 at December 31, 1995, to meet specific daily average balances as
required by the Federal Reserve Bank and correspondent banks.

   The subsidiary bank has been operating under a FDIC's "Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU)" for an excessive number of apparent compliance violations
since December 12, 1994.  This mandated immediate implementation of additional
effective compliance programs.  The progress, of the programs, were reported
and reviewed quarterly by the FDIC's Division of Compliance and Consumer
Affairs.  The Bank was revisited by the FDIC in May of 1995 with no systemic
violations being noted and the Bank was subsequently relieved from the
quarterly progress report requirement in December, 1995.  However, the Bank's
compliance rating of "3" and the "MOU" will remain in place until a full-scope
examination is completed which is scheduled for the third quarter of 1996.

NOTE 14.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

   In the course of its business, the subsidiary bank has granted loans to
executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and to affiliates of
executive officers and directors.  As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, loans
aggregating approximately $5,273,264 and $5,237,656 respectively, were
outstanding to such parties.  During 1995, new loans aggregating $3,881,682 and
amounts collected of $3,846,074 were transacted with such parties.

NOTE 16.  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

    Cash, cash equivalents and federal funds sold -

    For those short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

   Investment securities -

   For investment debt securities, fair values are based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes.  For other securities held as investments, fair value
equals quoted market price, if available.  If it is not available, fair value
is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.

   Loan receivable -

   The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers for
the same remaining maturities.  The value of loans computed under this method
is reduced under the assumption that the allowance for loan losses will remain
at the carrying value.
<PAGE>   46

   Deposits liabilities -

   The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, individual retirement
accounts and certain money  market deposits is the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date.  The fair value of fixed-maturity  certificates of deposit
and individual retirement accounts are estimated using the rates currently
offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

   Federal funds purchased and securities sold under an agreement to
repurchase-

   For those federal funds purchased and securities sold under an agreement to
repurchase, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Commitments to extend credit, unused credit card lines and standby letters
of credit -

   The fair value of commitments, credit card lines and standby letters of
credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements, taking into
account the remaining terms of the agreement and the creditworthiness of the
borrower.  All loan commitments are made on a variable rate basis and the
carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   The estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments are as
follows:
