Part I

Item 1.  Business

         (a)General Description of Business

            Woodward Governor Company, established in 1870, serves the
            prime mover control and accessory markets.  The company
            designs and manufactures controls and accessory products for
            prime movers such as diesel engines,  steam turbines,
            industrial and aircraft gas turbines, hydraulic turbines and
            for prime-mover-driven devices, such as aircraft propellers.

            Woodward products range from hydromechanical devices to
            advanced digital electronic control systems.  These products
            precisely control the speed and/or other functions of a prime
            mover under demanding conditions.

            Woodward sells directly to original equipment manufacturers,
            service providers and equipment users world wide.

            There have been no material changes in the mode of conducting
            the business during the last five years.

         (b)Industry Segments

            Information with respect to business segments is set forth in
            Note M to the consolidated financial statements on Page 25 of
            the registrant's annual report for the fiscal year ended
            September 30, 1994 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

         (c)(1) Narrative Description of Business

          (i)  Information with respect to business segments is set forth
               in Note M to the consolidated financial statements on Page
               25 of the registrant's annual report for the fiscal year
               ended September 30, 1994 and is hereby incorporated by
               reference.

         (ii)  There has been no public information regarding a new
               product or line of business requiring the investment of a
               material amount of total assets.
         
          (iii)     Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron,
                    cast aluminum and bar steel.  In addition to the machined
                    parts, there is an increasing number of purchased
                    electrical components used.  There are numerous sources of
                    most of the raw materials and components used by the
                    Company in its operations, and they are believed to be in
                    adequate supply.

         (iv)  The Company has pursued a policy of applying for patents in
               both the United States and certain other countries on
               inventions made in the course of its development work.  The
               Company regards its patents collectively as important, but
               does not consider its business dependent upon any one of
               such patents.




<PAGE>
Item 1.  Business (Con't)
         
          (v)  The Company's business is not subject to significant
               seasonal variation.

         (vi)  The Company maintains inventory levels sufficient to meet
               customer demands.  The Company's working capital
               requirements are not materially affected by return policies
               or extended credit terms provided to customers.

          (vii)     One customer, General Electric Company, accounted for
                    approximately 17% of consolidated sales during the fiscal
                    year ended September 30, 1994.  Nine other customers in
                    total accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated sales
                    in the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994.  Sales to
                    these customers involve several autonomous divisions and
                    agencies.  Products are supplied on the basis of individual
                    purchase orders and contracts.  There are no other material
                    relationships between the Company and such customers.

         (viii)     Unfilled orders at September 30, 1994 totalled $155,006,000
                    or 1% lower than the September 30, 1993 total of
                    $156,075,000.  Management believes that unfilled orders is
                    not necessarily an indicator of future shipment levels.  As
                    customers demand shorter lead times and flexibility in
                    delivery schedules, they have also revised their purchasing
                    practices.  As a result, orders may become firm only within
                    thirty to sixty days of delivery.  Consequently, the
                    backlog of unfilled orders at the year-end cannot be relied
                    upon as a valid indication of profitability in a subsequent
                    year.  Of the September 30, 1994 total, $130,495,000
                    currently is scheduled for fiscal year 1995 delivery.   
 
         (ix)  The Company does business with various U.S. government
               agencies, principally in the defense area, as both a prime
               contractor and a subcontractor.  Substantially all
               contracts are firm fixed price and may require cost data to
               be submitted in connection with contract negotiations.  The
               contracts are subject to government audit and review.  It
               is anticipated that adjustments, if any, with respect to
               determination of reimbursable costs, will not have a
               material effect on the Company's financial condition. 
               Substantially all of the Company's business, including both
               commercial and government contracts, is subject to
               cancellation by the customer.  The military portion of all
               shipments has dropped from 11 percent of total company
               shipments last year to approximately 10 percent this year. 
               Military shipments are principally made by the Company's
               Aircraft Controls business.  


<PAGE>
Item 1.  Business (Con't)

          (x)  The Company competes with several other manufacturers,
               including divisions of large diversified and integrated
               manufacturers.  The Company also competes with other
               divisions of its major customers.  Although competition has
               increased worldwide, the Company believes it maintains a
               significant competitive position within its line of
               business.  The Company has 30-40 main competitors in all
               product applications.  However, published information
               pertinent to the Company's product line is not available in
               sufficient detail to permit an accurate assessment of its
               current relative competitive position.  The principal
               methods of competition in the industry are price, product
               quality and customer service.  In the opinion of
               management, the Company's prices are generally competitive
               and its product quality and customer service are favorable
               competitive factors.

         (xi)  Information with respect to research and development is set
               forth in Note A to the consolidated financial statements on
               Page 20 of the registrant's annual report for the fiscal
               year ended September 30, 1994 and is hereby incorporated by
               reference.  The Company's products, whether proposed by the
               Company or requested by a customer, are offered for sale as
               proprietary designs and products of the Company. 
               Consequently, all activities associated with basic
               research, the development of new products and the
               refinement of existing products are Company-sponsored.

          (xii)     Compliance with provisions regulating the discharge of
                    materials into the environment has caused and will continue
                    to require capital expenditures. The Company is involved in
                    certain environmental matters, in several of which it has
                    been designated a "de minimis potentially responsible
                    party" with respect to the cost of investigation and
                    cleanup of third-party sites.  The Company's current
                    accrual for these matters is based on costs incurred to
                    date that have been allocated to the Company and its
                    estimate of the most likely future investigation and
                    cleanup costs.  There is, as in the case of most
                    environmental litigation, the theoretical possibility of
                    joint and several liability being imposed upon the Company
                    for damages which may be awarded.
             
               It is the opinion of management, after consultation with
               legal counsel, that additional liabilities, if any,
               resulting from these matters are not expected to have a
               material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
               Company, although such matters could have a material effect
               on quarterly or annual operating results when (or if)
               resolved in a future period.

         (xiii)     Information with respect to the number of persons employed
                    by the Company is set forth in the "Summary of
                    Operations/Ten Year Record" on Page 27 of the registrant's
                    annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994
                    and is hereby incorporated by reference.  As of November
                    30, 1994, 3411 members were employed by the Company.

Item 1.  Business (Con't)
         (d) Company Operations

            Information with respect to operations in the United States
            and other countries is set forth in Note M to the consolidated
            financial statements on Page 25 of the registrant's annual
            report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994 and is
            hereby incorporated by reference.  Management is of the
            opinion there are no unusual risks attendant to the conduct of
            its operations in other countries.

TO ALL SHAREHOLDER AND WORKER MEMBERS
Woodward Governor Company

   Fiscal year 1994 sales figures did not reach initial expectations. Industrial
markets remained flat, and the aircraft industry continued its decline.
Although we saw many encouraging opportunities last year, they did not mature
quickly enough to generate the business we envisioned. We remain optimistic
because most of these opportunities are still viable, and we are well prepared
to take advantage of them as they develop.
   
   Total sales during fiscal year 1994 were $333.2 million, a slight increase
from last year's $331.2 million. Earnings (loss) before income taxes and
cumulative effect of accounting changes decreased from $23.1 million to $(5.2)
million due principally to a restructuring expense of $23.7 million. In fiscal
1994, earnings (loss) per share before the cumulative effect of accounting
changes were $(1.11) compared to $4.50 last year.

   Throughout the year, we have invested a great deal of time and effort 
analyzing global markets to determine the proper areas in which to concentrate
our resources. We did so because it is good business, and because we take the
confidence placed in us by shareholder members very seriously. The best way we
can fulfill our obligation to maximize shareholder investment is to focus on
meeting customer needs, not only during the short term but also over the long
term.

   In today's markets, customers have increased expectations of prime mover
controls and control systems. In the "Focusing on World Markets" section of this
report, we describe how we continue to make considerable investment in the
research and development needed to meet market demands. As a result, we recently
introduced several products, and we diligently work to develop new control 
concepts to meet emerging customer needs.

   Where we once made products to perform discrete functions, we now deliver
integrated systems capable of performing a variety of tasks, at the lowest
cost possible. To be the supplier of choice, we must exceed market demands
and use our unique strengths to our advantage.

   To reduce operating costs and eliminate excess aircraft capacity, we will
close a leased facility in Rockford and eliminate aircraft parts manufacturing
operations at Stevens Point, Wisconsin. We will consolidate all aircraft 
operations into the two remaining Rockford-area plants and sell the Stevens
Point plant. The Hydraulic Turbine Controls operation will remain in Stevens
Point for the time being. We also intend to divest ourselves of Bauer Aerospace


<PAGE>
as it has continued to operate at a loss and no longer matches our long-term
strategic goals. Although these actions will result in a one-time restructuring
expense of $23.7 million, they will help improve profitability in future years.

   As our markets change and require complete systems, we must quickly acquire
or develop new technology by using the most cost-effective means possible. We
have taken appropriate steps to meet this requirement.  To address the needs of
medium and large diesel engine markets, we acquired two firms in Germany:
Einspritzgertewerk Aken, a manufacturer of fuel injection pumps, and
Feingertebau Kelbra, a firm making fuel injection nozzles. These operations have
become Woodward Governor Germany GmbH. We also bought HSC Controls, Inc. in
Buffalo, New York. HSC makes key components required for new generations of
aircraft controls. Total shipments of the three companies included in 1994
results were $10.7 million.

   This year we implemented our new management information system (MIS), 
completing a major five-year commitment in both time and money. The new system's
flexibility allows members to input and retrieve information on a real-time 
basis. In addition, the system's modular design allows for expansion or
modification as our business needs change.

   On the organizational side, the Board elected Michael T. Yonker and Lawrence
E. Gloyd to serve as directors, and we welcome them to the organization. Mr.
Yonker is President and Chief Executive Officer at Portec, Inc. of Chicago,
Illinois, and Mr. Gloyd is Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer at
CLARCOR, Inc. of Rockford, Illinois. On January 12, 1994 the Board of Directors
elected Stephen P. Carter to serve as Assistant Treasurer. He has been with the
company for seven years.

   As we reported last year, we had anticipated that 1994 would place increased
demands on Woodward Governor Company, and this past year has certainly fulfilled
that expectation. Next year, 1995, also holds a full slate of challenges for us.
In addition to the effective implementation of the 1994 decisions, we must
maintain a strong, focused effort to develop new business while we continue with
aggressive efforts to reduce our cost base. Competitive markets, demanding
unique solutions to engine control needs, require that we supply complex 
controls at lower costs than ever before. We are moving aggressively to meet
these requirements, and we will be successful.

<PAGE>

   It goes without saying that the single most important element in our success
is our persevering, dedicated, talented membership. We all have proven we have
the ability to accomplish great things by setting goals, making commitments to
one another, and following through on them.  Time and again, the members have
demonstrated they are conscientious and take their promises seriously.

   We will redouble our efforts to ensure that we not only maintain the
atmosphere that fosters this commitment but also will work diligently to improve
it. Working together through every level of our company, we intend to eliminate
barriers and encourage communication concerning every activity, every decision,
every interaction to flow quickly through the company. By doing so, everyone 
will be able to pull together toward our common goal the success of Woodward
Governor Company.

   Woodward Governor Company is fortunate to have a strong foundation based on
the Corporate Partnership philosophy. With the full support of both our worker
and shareholder members, we will take the necessary steps to realign our
resources within the global marketplace, as we better prepare ourselves to 
convert opportunity into reality. Working together, we shall meet the challenges
ahead and maintain the position of leadership, quality, and service that is the
hallmark of Woodward Governor Company.

Sincerely,

   

Calvin C. Covert
Chairman of the Board

FOCUSING ON WORLD MARKETS
Woodward Governor Company

   Customers throughout our markets demand more from the products they purchase,
and they want them at the lowest price possible. Not only do customers demand
more, but competition has become fierce. Pure prime mover control no longer is
sufficient. The industrial marketplace wants systems capable of managing
additional plant operations, and many customers need to exert control from a
remote location. In the aviation marketplace, control systems based on
electronic technology have become industry standards as customers increasingly
move in that direction.
   
   Over the past two decades, we steadily improved the features of our controls
and the benefits they deliver. In keeping with our worldwide market commitment,
we continue to meet the demands of a broadening customer base and customers have
recognized us for our accomplishments. Because of these achievements, we see
important opportunities opening to us. Foremost is the opportunity to expand
further into markets throughout the world. Furthermore, as emission laws 
continue to drive technology, we will work with our customers to design and
develop new controls and accessories for the emerging clean-burning, fuel-
efficient engines and turbines used in tomorrow's industrial and aviation
applications.

<PAGE>

INDUSTRIAL CONTROLS

   With the advent of digital controls, competition has become intense. To be
successful, we are making every effort to increase our customer associations and
continue to discover and respond to market needs.
   
   We hold relatively strong positions with the traditional market of original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and we have achieved increased success with end
user markets. Although many OEMs make their own controls, and generally use them
when they can, we provide them with controls to solve unique problems.
Woodward's specialized know-how offers OEMs a cost effective approach to meet
unusual or specialized control requirements.

   Retrofit markets exist throughout the world and increasingly offer
opportunities for our controls. The world's need for automation, improved fuel
efficiency, emission control, and reliability are the primary drivers for these
markets. Electrical power generation, oil and gas transmission (pipelines), and
process industries are some industries that offer substantial growth 
possibilities for retrofit applications.

   The development of available energy resources will be important if many
emerging countries are to become world-class industrial nations. Effective prime
mover control will be an important part of this development, and we are making
our products known in these areas.

   Our business units interact with customers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle
East, including countries once part of the Soviet Union. Throughout Eastern
Europe, there exist untapped markets for turbine controls, including hydropower
applications.

   One area where there is particularly strong competition is the Asia/Pacific
region. This situation highlights the significant market potential existing
there.

   China also offers an almost unlimited range of opportunities for all our 
industrial controls including hydroturbine controls.

   The use of electronic control applications is growing throughout South 
America. This area has a need for upgraded hydroturbine controls.  Throughout 
all our industrial markets, we believe 1995 offers strong sales potential.

<PAGE>

Turbomachinery Controls

   For turbomachinery applications, the NetCon 5000(@) system remains a premier
control for large retrofit applications. This year, Turbomachinery Controls
members developed the LinkNet(TM) distributed I/O, the TM1001 precise fuel
metering system, the EM35(TM) all-electric actuator for use with established
3103 valves, GAP(TM) software, and the Loopmate control system module. In
addition, they significantly enhanced the field-proven 505 and 511 control
systems.
   
   Turbomachinery Controls has emerged as a world leader in dry low emissions 
(DLE) turbine control technology. We are working with the three leading
aeroderivative gas turbine manufacturers (GE Marine & Industrial Engines, Turbo
Power and Marine Systems, and Rolls-Royce) to develop controls and fuel 
management systems for their DLE turbines.

   An indicator of Turbomachinery Controls' strong capabilities is the
completion of some extremely complex retrofit projects. For example, we
completed the electrical and mechanical retrofit of one of the largest mainline
steam turbines for Consolidated Edison of New York. Such projects have
strengthened our presence in retrofit markets; consequently, we enjoy an
increased acceptance rate on proposals. Significant credit for this success goes
to the regional offices, which we established five years ago.

Hydraulic Turbine Controls (Hydro)

   This year, Hydro continued to solve intricate hydroelectric control problems
through the use of specialized digital technology. The members also developed
the ModuFlo(TM) valve, which will significantly reduce hydroturbine control
costs and manufacturing times. Hydro members are improving control designs to
give operators a cleaner environment. These are the types of actions that 
indicate our commitment to listen to our customers and produce products capable
of meeting their needs.
   
   Another example of our commitment to meet customer needs occurred when a
customer had limited water flow, but needed to obtain maximum benefit from those
available resources. Hydro installed a system specifically designed to help
generate the maximum amount of electrical power from the available water flow.

<PAGE>

   Currently we have a group of members working with turbine manufacturers in
Japan and have received control systems orders for several large projects.
Shipments will begin in fiscal year 1995. We also are prepared to enter into the
market as an engineering resource by supplying controls to several generating
stations and operating them as a grid from a central location.

Engine Controls

   In October 1993 we introduced our North America network of Central
Distributors (CDs) and Authorized Dealers (ADs). Currently we have eleven CDs
and fourteen ADs. Already the network has made contact with a large number of
end users, increasing Woodward business opportunities. During the year the group
achieved good sales growth and 1995 projections indicate continued growth. CDs
and ADs are important avenues for us to introduce new products to the end users,
who then may request OEMs to include those products on new engines.
   
   During FY 1994, we introduced new products at a rate sufficient to overcome
the decline of our more traditional controls. The TQ-125 control, an integrated
control system for small engines, mounts directly on the engine and caters to 
the large standby engine-generator market. Another new product, the Flo-Tech
valve, a low-cost, linearizing flow throttle body actuator/driver with a 
separate or integrated speed control, has become particularly attractive for use
on carbureted gas engine vehicles as well as for wastegate control on these
vehicles.

   The new digital sychronizer and load control (DSLC) integrates the function
of several older stand-alone electronic units, creating a cost-effective
solution for the normal generator-set control. It also offers networking
capabilities for future distributed control systems technology.

   We are finding many opportunities to develop new products for OEMs supplying
equipment to be world's emerging gas engine markets. As emission laws continue
to become more stringent, many users are turning to natural gas engines as a
source of power in both vehicular and power generation applications. Our
opportunities include supplying everything from small portions to complete
systems, depending on the engine manufacturer's control strategy. The mobile
applications of these engines are very cost sensitive, and we are making headway
at understanding how to achieve low-cost, on-engine electronics.

   We also have enjoyed continued success in the application of existing
controls, such as the CLC(TM), a complete locomotive control, the locomotive
engine control (LEC), and the 721 digital control. These products are gaining
increased acceptance in the United States as well as world markets.

   We made significant progress in the electronic fuel injection market. We
developed new products, such as electronic rail valves and solenoid operated gas
admission valves, for this market. Also, we acquired assets and product rights
of two companies in Germany. In November 1993, we acquired Einspritzgertewerk
Aken (EGA), a fuel pump manufacturer, and in September, 1994, Feingertebau

<PAGE>

Kelbra GmbH, a firm manufacturing fuel injection nozzles. When we combine
our extensive fuel control technology with the products of these two
firms, we offer a very strong fuel injection system for medium and slow speed
engine applications throughout the world.

AIRCRAFT CONTROLS

   Aviation markets have redefined themselves and stabilized at a growth level
much lower than that of the booming '80s. The industry is demanding quieter,
less expensive, more fuel efficient turbines to increase operating efficiency
and maintain lower levels of noise and exhaust pollution. Electronic control
systems play an important role in meeting these objectives.
   
   As the use of electronics increases, the complexity of individual
hydromechanical control assemblies decreases. Although we have maintained market
share, the value added per control has decreased. The old main engine "can"
control, so popular just a short time ago, required in excess of 2,000 
individual parts. Newer hydromechanical fuel metering units generally have fewer
than 1,000 parts. In addition, new systems have a higher purchased-part content,
while the parts manufactured in-house are very specialized.

   This past year, we acquired HSC Controls, Inc. in Buffalo, New York. HSC is a
recognized leader in electromagnetic devices, such as torque motors and
servovalves, and its acquisition underlines our commitment to develop electro-
magnetic technologies. With HSC, we now have established direct control over
increasingly critical components in aircraft control systems. HSC works with
other industries, supplying devices used in eye surgery, in respirators, in
blood pressure monitors, and in semi-conductor manufacturing. These activities
open avenues into new markets.

Large and Small Aircraft Controls

   As aircraft-control markets increasingly ask for total system solutions for
control problems, our ability to work with customers to develop and integrate


<PAGE>
such system components has become essential. Our first application of a fully
integrated electronic fuel control system will enter operation in the Williams
F129 turbofan engine. The Swedish Air Force selected this engine model to re-
engine its fleet of SK-60 trainers. We continue to make significant additional
investments to enhance our system integration capabilities.
   
   To further illustrate our dedication to meet special market needs, we have 
developed specialized valving to help turbine manufacturers reduce exhaust 
emissions without sacrificing power. Another advanced development project,
our hydraulic multiplexer, has the potential to replace several older components
while weighing less and offering greater reliability.

This year the GE90 underwent initial evaluation on a flight-test aircraft. It 
performed successfully and soon should be ready for certification testing on the
Boeing 777. This will be the first of many applications for this engine and its
derivatives.

   Also, we are developing controls for the BMW Rolls-Royce BR700 series of 
engines and working closely with this company. Intended for medium-sized
business and commercial aircraft, the BR700 family of engines will make BMW 
Rolls-Royce a market leader.

Aircraft Product Service Centers

   In spite of the downturn in aircraft markets, our Aircraft Product Service 
Centers, and other aircraft-control support operations, have been quite
successful. Although sales of our new controls declined, revenues from these
support services rose. We have gained market share and are benefiting from the
the increased population of Woodward controls in the field.
   
   Thousands of commercial aircraft are equipped with engines using Woodward
controls, and these engines will be in use for many decades. As we introduce
new products into the world's aviation marketplace, we will continue to upgrade
the services offered by our aftermarket support organization. We believe fast,
reliable, available support is a critical function to the success of any control
or auxiliary device.

     Aircraft controls is a difficult, highly competitive market. Clearly, the 
aviation industry has experienced momentous change before stabilizing at lowered
activity levels. However, we believe our technical know-how, our reputation for
producing quality products, and our commitment to work closely with customers
will ensure continued success.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY & ANALYSIS
Woodward Governor Company




RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1994 Compared to 1993

Shipments

   Shipments during 1994 were $333,207,000, .6% above the $331,156,000 shipped 
in 1993. Price increases accounted for .6%, volume decreases accounted for 3.9% 
and increases due to acquisitions accounted for 3.2% of the change in 1994 
shipments. In addition, shipments from overseas plants translated into over
$2,300,000 or .7% more U.S. dollars compared to prior year exchange rates. A
decline in Aircraft Controls' shipments was offset by an increase in Industrial
Controls' shipments. Military sales continue to decline, dropping from 11.0% of
total company shipments in 1993 to 9.6% this year.
   
   In 1994, the company acquired HSC Controls, Inc. of Buffalo, New York. HSC 
designs and manufactures torque motors and servovalves primarily for aerospace 
applications. HSC's shipments from the date of acquisition are included in the
Aircraft Controls group. The company also acquired two companies in Germany:
Einspritzgertewerk Aken, a diesel fuel pump manufacturer, and Feingertebau 
Kelbra, a manufacturer of fuel-injection nozzles. These two companies have been
consolidated to become Woodward Governor Germany GmbH. Shipments from the dates
of acquisition for these companies are included in the Industrial Controls group
this year. Combined shipments included in 1994 results for these three 
acquisitions amount to $10,699,000.

   Aircraft Controls' shipments were $141,632,000, down 7.0% from last year's
total of $152,238,000. In 1994, Aircraft Controls' shipments were 42.5% of total
company shipments compared to 46.0% in 1993. The depression in the commercial
aircraft industry continues to influence shipments.

   Industrial Controls' shipments in 1994 were $191,575,000 compared to
$178,918,000 last year, a 7.1% increase. Shipments made in 1994 represented   
57.5% of total company shipments, compared to 54.0% last year. However, 
shipments of the newly acquired Woodward Governor Germany GmbH accounted for 
4.1% of the increase, while existing operations accounted for a 3.0% increase.
The importance of worldwide marketing efforts is evidenced by shipments at 
overseas business units increasing at a higher rate than domestic shipments.

Cost of Goods Sold

   Cost of goods sold was $248,839,000 or 74.7% of net sales in 1994, compared 
to $246,254,000 or 74.4% in 1993. Material costs increased due to the greater 
purchased material content of our products, but direct labor costs were reduced
as a result of improvements in productivity. Although research and development
costs decreased from the prior year, we continue to be committed to these
efforts which are necessary for future growth. Engineering costs overall
continued to increase because of the need to provide even greater support to
current products. Spending on research and development in 1994 amounted to
$16,400,000, compared to $18,500,000 in 1993.

Sales, Service, and Administrative Expenses

   In 1994, sales, service, and administrative expenses were $58,557,000, 
compared to $52,559,000 in 1993. This represents 17.6% of sales, compared to

<PAGE>
15.9% in 1993. Included in the 1994 total are the sales, service, and
administrative expenses since the dates of acquisition for the three acquired
companies. That and the cost of implementing the final phase of the new 
management information system at all domestic locations were the primary reasons
for the increase.

Restructuring Expense

   Restructuring expense in 1994 was $23,700,000, compared to $3,480,000 in 
1993, and reflects the major restructuring of the Aircraft Controls group to 
bring manufacturing capacity in line with current and projected shipment
requirements. These costs include the closing of the Stevens Point plant,
divesting of Bauer Aerospace, and consolidating all aircraft manufacturing,
assembly, and test operations into the two remaining Rockford-area plants.
Included in both years are the costs of severance pay offered to terminated
workers. The cost of an early retirement program offered to eligible members is
included in 1993.

Interest Expense

   Interest expense was $3,941,000 in 1994 compared to $2,722,000 in 1993. The 
increase over last year is a result of higher levels of borrowing combined with
higher interest rates, in addition to $665,000 of interest as the result of
completing an income tax review.

Interest Income

   Interest income in 1994 was $708,000 compared to $748,000 in 1993.

Other Expense-Net

   Other expense-net was $4,073,000 in 1994, compared to $3,805,000 in 1993.

Income Taxes

   Income taxes were a benefit of $1,922,000 in 1994 compared to an expense of
$9,695,000 in 1993. The primary reason for the benefit this year is the
significant restructuring charge.

Accounting Changes

   In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company elected to adopt Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106). SFAS 106 requires the
company to accrue the cost of postretirement benefits (principally health care)
over the years members provide service. This resulted in a one-time charge in
1993 of $17,341,000 (after reduction for income tax of $11,087,000). The company
also elected to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 112). SFAS 112
requires the accrual method of accounting for benefits to former or inactive
members after active membership, but before retirement. Implementation of this
statement last year resulted in a one-time charge of $427,000 (after reduction
for income tax of $273,000).
   
   In 1993, the company also adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires a change
from the deferred method to the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. The cumulative effect of this adjustment was to increase earnings
by $351,000. The cumulative impact of the three accounting changes, net of tax,


<PAGE>
amounted to a $17,417,000 charge against net earnings in 1993, or $5.86
per share.

Net Earnings (Loss)

   The 1994 (loss) before the cumulative effect of accounting changes was 
($3,273,000), a decrease of $16,662,000 from 1993 earnings of $13,389,000 before
the cumulative effect of accounting changes. The results for 1994 included a
restructuring expense of $23,700,000 compared to $3,480,000 in 1993. Return on
sales was (1.0)% compared to 4.0% in 1993. Return on average net worth was 
(1.7)%, compared to 6.3% in 1993. Earnings (loss) per share before the 
cumulative effect of accounting changes were ($1.11) in 1994, compared to $4.50
in 1993. After deducting the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of 
tax, of ($5.86) per share, the net (loss) per share in 1993 was ($1.36). The net
(loss) in 1994 was ($3,273,000) compared to ($4,028,000) in 1993.
   
   Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting changes from
foreign operations in 1994 were $12,550,000 on shipments of $89,128,000, 
compared to the 1993 total of $15,238,000 on shipments of $78,018,000. The
(loss) before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting changes from
domestic operations this year was ($17,745,000) on shipments of $244,079,000,
compared to $7,846,000 of earnings in 1993 on shipments of $253,138,000. Without
the restructuring expense of $23,700,000, 1994 would have reflected earnings
before income taxes from domestic operations of $5,955,000. In 1994, the net
(loss) was ($10,710,000) compared to ($13,145,000) in 1993 for domestic
operations.

   Management expects that sales and earnings will improve next year. This 
expectation is based on a flat shipment level for the Aircraft Controls group 
and an increase in shipments for the Industrial Controls group. We expect the
increase in shipments of Industrial Controls to be driven principally by the
continued expansion of the company's overseas markets. The restructuring within
Aircraft Controls and the increased shipment level of Industrial Controls should
lead to higher earnings next year. The restructuring announced in 1994 also 
results in reduced membership levels for 1995.

   The company is currently involved in matters of litigation arising from the 
normal course of business, including certain environmental and product liability
matters, as well as a pricing provisions claim. For a further discussion of
these issues refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Footnote K,
"Contingencies," on page 24.

Financial Condition

   Cash and cash equivalents were $10,272,000 in 1994 and $10,497,000 in 1993. 
Combined short- and long-term debt increased to $61,591,000 from $58,258,000
in 1993.
   
   Accounts receivable increased from $64,024,000 at September 30, 1993 to
$69,778,000 at September 30, 1994. The increase is principally due to additional
receivables of acquired companies. In addition the allowance for losses was
increased from $1,989,000 in 1993 to $3,021,000 in 1994.

   Inventories decreased to $80,272,000 at September 30, 1994 from $83,128,000 
at September 30, 1993. The reduction is a net result of the decreased shipment
volume at certain business units and the additional inventory from acquisitions.

   Property, plant, and equipment net decreased from $144,016,000 at September 
30, 1993 to $122,911,000 at September 30, 1994. This decrease is due to the
writedown of these assets as a result of the restructuring and capital
expenditures for 1994 being less than depreciation.


<PAGE>
   Deferred income taxes increased $10,419,000 from $24,909,000 in 1993 to
$35,328,000 in 1994. The main reason for the increase is $9,208,000 related to
the 1994 restructuring charges and an acquired net operating loss carryforward.
A valuation allowance of $7,518,000 in 1994 and $2,492,000 in 1993 was recorded
principally due to foreign tax credit and acquired foreign net operating loss
carryforward limitations. Remaining deferred tax assets are expected to be
realized through future earnings.

   Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased from $35,915,000 in 1993 to
$37,972,000 in 1994.

   Other liabilities reflects the non-current accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation.

   Shareholders' equity at September 30, 1994 decreased to $193,846,000 from
$206,222,000 at September 30, 1993.

Liquidity and Capital Expenditures

   Cash dividends paid to shareholders in 1994 were $3.72 compared to $3.72 in
1993.
   
   Cash flows provided from operations were $35,805,000 in 1994 compared to 
$37,222,000 for 1993.

   Cash flows (used) in investing activities were ($23,902,000) in 1994. This 
compares to ($18,088,000) in 1993. Capital expenditures are the primary use of 
cash, even though these expenditures have been reduced significantly the last
two years. In 1994 the company also acquired HSC Controls, Inc. and the two
companies that now comprise Woodward Governor Germany GmbH.

   Net cash (used) in financing activities was ($11,833,000) in 1994,
($16,204,000) in 1993. The principal financing activities are short-term
borrowing and long-term debt. Dividend payments continue to be the principal use
of cash in this area.

Membership

Worldwide membership increased from 3,264 in 1993 to 3,439 in 1994. The 
membership in newly acquired companies accounted for an increase of 273, while
the membership from existing operations declined by 98 through attrition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1993 Compared to 1992

Shipments

   Shipments of $331,156,000 in 1993 were 11.5% below the $374,173,000 shipped 
in 1992. Price increases accounted for 1.2% and volume decreases for 12.7% of 
the change in 1993 shipments. Military shipments declined from 14.6% of total
company shipments in 1992 to 11.0% in 1993.
   
   Industrial Controls' shipments rose in 1993 to $178,918,000 compared to
$175,487,000 in 1992, a 2.0% increase from 1992. Industrial Controls' shipments
represent 54.0% of total company shipments in 1993 compared to 46.9% in 1992.

   The company achieved a modest increase in Industrial Control business levels.
Close customer contact has allowed us to regularly introduce controls designed
to meet customer needs and resulted in increased market share.


<PAGE>
   Aircraft Controls' shipments in 1993 dropped to $152,238,000, a 23.4%
reduction from the $198,686,000 in 1992. As a result, the percent of total
company shipments from Aircraft Controls declined from 53.1% in 1992 to 46.0% 
in 1993.

   The recession in the aircraft industry proved to be deeper and longer-lasting
than expected. Cancellations and delays of new aircraft orders combined with 
customer inventory reductions drastically curtailed sales throughout the
industry. Pressure from customers put demands on the company to reduce prices,
which further strained profitability.

Cost of Goods Sold

   Cost of goods sold was 74.4% of net sales in 1993 compared to 75.6% in 1992. 
Even though we have made progress in reducing our manufacturing costs, these
reductions have not kept pace with customers' demands for price reductions.
Also, since research and development projects represent a vital ingredient in
our future success, we continue to devote resources to fund these projects in
order to ensure future growth. Spending on research and development in 1993
amounted to $18,500,000 compared to $16,000,000 in 1992.

Sales, Service, and Administrative Expenses

   In 1993, sales, service, and administrative expenses were $52,559,000 
compared to $51,036,000 in 1992. This amounted to 15.9% of sales, compared to 
13.6% in 1992. Ongoing customer needs required sales and service activities to
remain at previous levels, and even demanded increased efforts to achieve the
shipment level. In addition, there were increased costs associated with the new
Turbomachinery Controls facility in Loveland, Colorado.

Restructuring Expense

   Restructuring expense in 1993 was $3,480,000 compared to $2,741,000 in 1992. 
Included in this is the severance pay offered to terminated members affected by 
workforce reductions, along with provisions for the cost of early retirement
programs offered to eligible members.

Interest Expense

   Interest expense was $2,722,000 in 1993 compared to $3,009,000 in 1992. The 
decline in interest expense reflects the lower level of borrowing and favorable 
rates compared to the previous year. Reduced capital expenditures in 1993
contributed to the decrease in borrowing.

Interest Income

   Interest income in 1993 was $748,000 compared to $966,000 in 1992.

Other Expense-Net

   Other expense-net was $3,805,000 in 1993, compared to $2,356,000 in 1992. The
increase over the previous year is due mainly to postretirement expenses 
associated with the adoption of SFAS 106.

Income Taxes

   The effective income tax rate in 1993 was 42.0%, compared to 38.7% in 1992. 
Although the federal tax rate increased from 1992, the major reason for this 
rate increase was the fact that a significant portion of our income was
generated at overseas locations at tax rates higher than in the United States.


<PAGE>
Accounting Changes

   In 1993, the company adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"; SFAS 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits"; and SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The
cumulative effect of all three accounting changes, net of tax, was a $17,417,000
charge against net earnings.

Net Earnings (Loss)

   The 1993 earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes were
$13,389,000 ($4.50 per share), a decrease of 34.0% from 1992 earnings of
$20,212,000 ($7.23 per share). Return on sales was 4.0%, compared to 5.4%
in 1992. Return on average net worth was 6.3%, compared to 9.4% in 1992.  After
deducting the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of tax, of $5.86 per
share, the net (loss) per share was ($1.36). The net (loss) in 1993 was
($4,028,000) compared to net earnings of $20,212,000 in 1992.
   
   In 1993, earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting
changes from foreign operations were $15,238,000 on shipments of $78,018,000 
compared to the 1992 total of $12,593,000 on shipments of $80,352,000. Earnings
before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes on domestic
operations was $7,846,000 on shipments of $253,138,000 compared to $20,383,000
of earnings in 1992 on shipments of $293,821,000. In 1993 the net (loss) was
($13,145,000) compared to net earnings of $13,114,000 in 1992 for domestic
operations.

Financial Condition

   Cash and cash equivalents were $10,497,000 in 1993 and $7,633,000 in 1992. 
Combined short- and long-term debt decreased to $58,258,000 from $64,375,000 in 
1992. The lower level of capital expenditures helped to reduce the borrowing. In
1992, the company restructured its debt by selling 256,806 shares of treasury
stock to the Woodward Stock Plan, a qualified employee stock ownership plan 
(ESOP). Under the terms of the transaction, the Stock Plan borrowed $25,000,000
from an institutional lender and purchased 256,806 shares. The company 
guaranteed payment of the loan and agreed to make future contributions to the
Stock Plan sufficient to repay the loan. The loan is repayable in installments
through September 30, 2003.
   
  Accounts receivable decreased from $71,544,000 at September 30, 1992 to 
$64,024,000 at September 30, 1993. The decrease was due to the lower volume of
shipments in 1993.

   Inventories remained flat and totaled $83,128,000 on September 30, 1993 
compared to $82,412,000 at September 30, 1992.

   Deferred income taxes increased from $12,339,000 in 1992 to $24,909,000 in 
1993. The increase is due primarily to a $12,025,000 increase related to the 
cumulative effect of accounting changes.

   Other liabilities reflect the non-current accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation of $27,634,000, incurred as a result of the decision to adopt SFAS
106.

   As a result of the cumulative effect of accounting changes on 1993 earnings, 
total shareholders' equity at September 30, 1993 decreased to $206,222,000 from
$219,690,000 at September 30, 1992.


<PAGE>
Liquidity and Capital Expenditures

   Cash dividends paid to shareholders in 1993 increased slightly to $3.72 
compared to $3.70 paid in 1992.
   
   Cash flows provided from operations were $37,222,000 in 1993, compared to
$54,127,000 for 1992. The principal source of cash is earnings before cumulative
effect of accounting changes which was down significantly in 1993 from 1992.

   Cash flows (used) in investing activities were ($18,088,000) in 1993. This 
compares to ($53,203,000) in 1992. The primary use of cash was for capital
expenditures, which were significantly less in 1993 than 1992.

   Net cash provided (used) in financing activities was ($16,204,000) in 1993, 
and $705,000 in 1992. The principal financing activity is borrowing, and the 
major use of cash is dividends.

Membership

   Worldwide membership decreased 10.1% in 1993 to 3,264, a decrease of 368 from
3,632 in 1992. The reduction in 1993 was accomplished through early retirements,
attrition, and by a permanent reduction in the workforce.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In Thousands of Dollars except per share amounts)

A. Significant accounting policies are as follows:

Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its subsidiaries, the majority of which are 
wholly-owned Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Foreign currency translation: The balance sheets of substantially all 
subsidiaries outside the United States have been translated at year-end rates of
exchange and earnings statements at weighted average rates of exchange. In 
addition, gains and losses from translation are accumulated as a separate 
component of shareholders' equity; gains or losses resulting from overseas
currency transactions are included in net earnings (loss) and are not
significant.

Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior 
years' data to the current presentation.

Inventories: Inventories, substantially all of which are work in process and
component parts, are valued at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out 
basis) or market.

Property, plant, and equipment: Expenditures for major renewals and improvements
are capitalized at cost while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense.
Depreciation is provided principally on the declining-balance method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets (5 to 45 years for buildings and 
improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment). Upon disposal of an
asset the resulting gain or loss is included in net earnings. Certain property, 
plant, and equipment have been reduced to their appraised and estimated net
realizable values due to restructuring.

Intangibles: The excess of purchase price over the fair values of net assets 
acquired has been recorded as an intangible which is being amortized using the 
straight-line method over 10 years, subject to impairment write-offs determined
by underlying cash flows.

Statements of cash flows: For purposes of the statements of cash flows, all 
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Income taxes: In 1994 and 1993, deferred income taxes are provided for the 
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of
the company's assets and liabilities. In 1992 the provision for deferred income 
taxes represents the tax effect of differences in the timing of income and
expense recognition for tax and financial reporting purposes. The company has
provided for taxes which would be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas
subsidiaries were to be remitted to the United States.

Revenue recognition: Revenue is recognized from product sales primarily upon
shipment to the customer.

Research and development costs: Expenditures related to new product development 
are charged to expense when incurred and total approximately $16,400, $18,500, 
and $16,000, for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Interest rate swap agreement: The differential to be paid or received is accrued
as interest rates change and is recognized over the life of the agreement.

<PAGE>

B. Acquisitions: The company purchased all of the shares of Einspritzgertewerk 
Aken GmbH (EGA) in Aken, Germany, on November 8, 1993. Woodward Governor Germany
GmbH, formerly EGA, manufactures high quality fuel pumps for large diesel
engines.

On May 16, 1994, the company purchased all of the shares of HSC Controls, Inc. 
(HSC) of Buffalo, New York. HSC designs and manufactures torque motors and 
servovalves for aerospace, industrial, and medical applications.

Woodward Governor Germany GmbH acquired the assets of Feingertebau Kelbra GmbH
(Kelbra) on September 1, 1994. Kelbra manufactures injection nozzles and 
injection nozzle-holders for diesel engines.

The acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
and the operating results of the acquisitions are included in the company's 
consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. The excess of 
cost over fair value of the assets acquired is being amortized over a 10-year 
period. Pro forma results of these acquisitions, assuming they had been made at
the beginning of each year presented, would not be materially different from the
results reported.

C. Restructuring Charges: In the fourth quarter of 1994, the company recognized
$23,700 in connection with a board-approved restructuring initiative. The
restructuring charge reflects costs associated with closing facilities and the
divestiture of Bauer Aerospace, manufacturer of the test equipment product line.
The charge includes approximately $1,913 in severance costs based on a company 
designed severance package; $19,148 in write-downs of property, plant and 
equipment, and intangible assets to their appraised and estimated net realizable
values; and $2,639 in other expenditures, including contractual commitments to 
third parties and management's estimate of closing costs.

As of September 30, 1994, $4,310 of this amount remained in accrued liabilities
representing approximately $1,913 in severance costs and $2,397 in other
expenditures. It is anticipated that these remaining costs will be paid in
fiscal 1995.

In fiscal years 1993 and 1992, restructuring charges included severance payments
to terminated members and provisions for the cost of early retirement programs 
offered to eligible members. As of September 30, 1994, $4,524 remains in accrued
liabilities.

</TABLE>

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which
required a change from the deferred method to the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes.

The company elected to adopt SFAS No. 109 as of October 1, 1992. The cumulative
effect of accounting change for income taxes as of October 1, 1992 decreased the
net loss by $351 ($.12 per share) and is reported separately in the statements

<PAGE>
of consolidated earnings (loss) for the year ended September 30, 1993. Excluding
the amount recognized as the cumulative effect of accounting change, the effect 
of applying SFAS No. 109 on the net loss for the year ended September 30, 1993, 
was a benefit of $589 ($.20 per share). Prior years' financial statements were
not restated.

The components of the deferred tax benefit in 1994 and 1993 were as follows:

</TABLE>

The company has recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount 
of deferred tax assets which may not be realized principally due to foreign tax 
credit and acquired foreign net operating loss carryforward limitations. 
Remaining deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future 
earnings. The change in the valuation allowance for the year ended September 
30, 1994, is as follows:

lines require compensating balances or commitment fees. The lines, generally 
reviewed annually for renewal, are subject to the usual terms and conditions
applied by the banks.

The company has a note agreement dated July 1990, wherein the company issued a
$20,000 unsecured note due August 1, 2000 with an interest rate of 9.45%. 
Principal payments are due annually, with interest due semi-annually.

The principal payments required on the 9.45% note and other debt in each of the 
5 years succeeding 1994 are: $2,252 in 1995, $2,367 in 1996, $2,582 in 1997,
$2,497 in 1998, and $2,783 in 1999.

In 1991, the company established the Woodward Stock Plan, a qualified employee 
stock ownership plan (ESOP), within its existing Deferred Profit Sharing Plan, 
which covers all worker members meeting certain service requirements. Using this
ESOP feature, on June 18, 1992, the Stock Plan borrowed $25,000 for a term of 11
years at an interest rate of 8.01% and used the proceeds to buy 256,806 shares 
of common stock from the company. The company guaranteed payment of the loan and
agreed to make future contributions to the Stock Plan sufficient to repay the 
loan. The loan and guarantee, a non-cash transaction, are recorded in the

<PAGE>
company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt and unearned Stock Plan
compensation. The related shares are being allocated to participants over 11
years as the debt is repaid. The Stock Plan debt requires principal payments
each September 30, through 2003; a payment of $2,000 was made in 1994 and 
$1,500 in 1993. Payments increase to $2,500 with a final payment of $2,000.
Interest of $1,882 was paid in 1994 and $2,003 in 1993.

Dividends on these common shares are paid to the Stock Plan and, together with
company contributions, are used by the Stock Plan to repay principal and 
interest on the outstanding debt. Shares are allocated to participants based 
upon the ratio of the current year's debt service to the sum of total principal
and interest payments over the life of the loan.

The company recognized Stock Plan related expense on the Shares Allocated Method
as follows:
<TABLE>
                       1994     1993    1992

</TABLE>

Company cash contributions to the Stock Plan for debt service were $2,933,
$2,546, and $310 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. Dividends on these 
shares used for debt service were approximately $949 in 1994, $956 in 1993, and
$257 in 1992.

Federal income tax benefits of $393, $373, and $98 in 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively, resulting from the deductibility of certain dividends paid on
unallocated shares by the company to the Stock Plan, were credited directly to
retained earnings.

The provisions of the note and the guarantee limit the ability of the company 
to, among other things, incur debt, pay cash dividends, sell certain assets, 
acquire other businesses, and purchase the company's capital stock. The
agreements include a provision that change in control of the company may result 
in all unpaid principal and interest becoming due. The company must maintain 
consolidated net worth of $150,000 and a consolidated current ratio of 1.25. At
September 30, 1994, the company could pay dividends and purchase the company's
common stock up to an amount not exceeding $18,379.

G. Interest rate swap agreement: At September 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, the 
company had outstanding an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank, 
having a total notional principal amount of $15,000. The notional amount is used
to measure the volume of this agreement and does not represent exposure to 
credit loss. This agreement, which effectively converts fixed rate debt into
variable rate debt, is indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate. The LIBOR rate 
changes every 6 months and the market risk is that the rate will exceed the
fixed rate of 5.0%. The interest rate swap agreement matures on August 29, 1995.
The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the 
other party to the interest rate swap agreement. However, the company does not
anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty.

</TABLE>

I. Retirement and benefit plans: The company provides certain health care 
benefits to eligible retired members and their dependents and survivors. 
Generally, participants become eligible after reaching age 55 with 10 years of
service or after reaching age 65. The health plans (medical, dental, vision,
and hearing) are unfunded and pay 100% of eligible expenses not paid by 
Medicare. A maximum reimbursement amount exists for each plan. The plan requires
cost-sharing by the members in varying amounts based on years of service. The
company has the right to modify or terminate these benefits.

In 1993, the company elected to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 106, "Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  The Statement
requires companies to accrue the expected cost of providing postretirement 
benefits other than pensions over the years that members render the necessary 
service rather than the cash basis previously used. This resulted in a one-time 
charge of $17,341 (after reduction for income tax of $11,087), related to prior
service cost, and was a non-cash transaction recognized as a cumulative effect 
of accounting change as of October 1, 1992, decreasing net earnings by $5.83
per share.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were as follows:

</TABLE>

The company has included $29,279 and $27,634 in other liabilities and the 
balance in current liabilities for 1994 and 1993, respectively.


<PAGE>
The periodic postretirement benefit cost consists of:

                                         ----------------------
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost    $3,094     $3,143
</TABLE>

For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits of 9.5% for 1994 and 10.5% for 1993 was assumed; 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.25% by 2007 in 1994 and to 4.0% 
by 2005 in 1993. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant 
effect on the amounts reported. A 1.0% increase in the health care trend rate 
per year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$5,280 and the net periodic cost by $695 for 1994. The weighted average discount
rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
8.25% at September 30, 1994, 7.0% at September 30, 1993, and 8.0% at
October 1, 1992.

The cost of postretirement health care benefits incurred and expensed prior to
adoption of SFAS No. 106 was approximately $1,890 in 1992.

In 1993, the company also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits."  This statement requires the accrual method of
accounting for benefits to former or inactive members after membership but 
before retirement. The company's postemployment benefits consist principally of
disability medical benefits. This resulted in a one-time charge of $427 (after 
reduction for income tax of $273). The charge is related to prior service cost
and was a non-cash transaction recognized as a cumulative effect of accounting
change as of October 1, 1992, decreasing net earnings by $.15 per share in 1993.

The company has a Deferred Profit Sharing Plan which covers all worker members
meeting certain service requirements. The company makes annual contributions to 
the plan based on net earnings of the company as defined by the plan document, 
with total contributions not to exceed the amount deductible for federal income
tax purposes.

The company is required, under local regulations, to provide a defined benefit 
plan covering approximately 120 members in a foreign country. The accumulated 
benefit obligation at September 30, 1994 and 1993 was $12,492 and $11,260, 
respectively. The value of plan assets as of September 30, 1994 and 1993 was
$12,541 and $10,877, respectively.

The total amounts contributed to the Deferred Profit Sharing Plan and defined 
benefit plan and charged to expense were $658, $1,565, and $3,921 for 1994, 
1993, and 1992, respectively.

J. Leases: The company has entered into leases for certain facilities. The 
leases are for 5 years with options to extend. Future minimum rental commitments
under these operating leases are: $702 in 1995, $263 in 1996, $190 in 1997, and 
$48 in 1998. Rent expense for leases was approximately $867, $796, and $2,076
for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

K. Contingencies: The company is currently involved in matters of litigation 
arising from the normal course of business, including certain environmental and 
product liability matters. The company had accruals of approximately $3,427 and 
$3,716 at September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. These accruals are based on

<PAGE>
the company's current estimate of the most likely amount of losses that it 
believes will be incurred. These amounts, which are expected to be paid over the
next several years, have been included in accounts payable and accrued expense. 
The most significant portion of these accruals relates to the matters in the
following two paragraphs:

The government conducted a review of the company's allocation of certain costs
to government contracts. As a result of this review, the company has reached a
preliminary settlement with the government on this matter with payment expected 
to be made in the first quarter of 1995.

The company is involved in certain environmental matters, in several of which it
has been designated a "de minimis potentially responsible party" with respect to
the cost of investigation and cleanup of third-party sites. The company's 
current accrual for these matters is based on costs incurred to date that have 
been allocated to the company and its estimate of the most likely future
investigation and cleanup costs. There is, as in the case of most environmental
litigation, the theoretical possibility of joint and several liability being
imposed upon the company for damages which may be awarded.

It is the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, that
additional liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters are not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company, 
although such matters could have a material effect on quarterly or annual 
operating results when (or if) resolved in a future period.

The company has initiated a claim regarding pricing provisions in an alleged
agreement with a major customer. The ultimate outcome of this claim cannot be
determined at this time and, therefore, no amount has been recognized for
potential recoveries.

L. Financial instruments: The estimated fair values of the company's financial
instruments at September 30, 1994 and 1993, were as follows:
<TABLE>
                                    1994      1993
                               ---------------------
<S>                              <C>       <C>
Cash and cash equivalents        $10,272   $10,497
Short-term borrowings            (24,674)  (18,123)
Long-term debt                   (36,917)  (41,765)
Interest rate swap agreement        (160)      330


The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of 
each class of financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts approximate fair value because 
of the short-term maturity of the instruments.

Short-term borrowings: The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of 
the short-term maturity of the instruments.

Long-term debt: Fair value estimate is based on rates currently offered to the
company for similar debt of the same maturities.

Interest rate swap agreement: Fair value estimate was based on a quote from a
financial institution.

M. Company operations: The company is engaged solely in the design, manufacture 
and sale of prime mover controls and accessories in the United States and in 
other countries. The company does business with the government as both a prime

<PAGE>
contractor and a subcontractor. Substantially all contracts are firm fixed price
and may require cost data to be submitted in connection with contract
negotiations. The contracts are subject to government audit and review.

Billings to a single customer were approximately 17%, 22%, and 27% of the net
billings to customers in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. The company's
accounts receivable from the customer were $10,240, $7,471, and $9,695 at 
September 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. Billings derived from domestic
sales to unaffiliated customers in other countries were approximately 15%, 12%,
and 12% of the net billings to customers in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.
Intercompany transfers are made at established intercompany selling prices.
Summarized financial information relating to these operations is as follows:

Woodward Governor Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Woodward 
Governor Company and Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
related statements of consolidated earnings (loss), shareholders' equity, and
and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 1994, 1993, and 1992. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Woodward Governor 
Company and Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and 1993 and the results of
their consolidated operations and their cash flows for the years ended September
30, 1994, 1993, and 1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note D and Note I to the financial statements, the company 
changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions, postemployment benefits and income taxes in 1993.
