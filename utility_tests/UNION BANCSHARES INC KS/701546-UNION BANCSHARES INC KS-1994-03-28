                                        PART I

Item 1.  Business

        Union Bancshares, Inc. (UBI) is a bank holding company formed
in 1982 under the laws of the State of Kansas.  In connection with
this formation, UBI acquired all of the common stock of Union
National Bank of  Wichita (UNB) by exchange for UBI Class A common
stock on a share for share basis.  In 1987, UBI formed Union
Boulevard National Bank (UBNB), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to
acquire from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation certain
assets and liabilities previously owned by Boulevard State Bank. 
UBNB was merged into UNB in 1989.  In April 1990, UBI acquired
certain assets and liabilities from the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC) of the former First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Hutchinson.  UBI acquired two branch locations in
this purchase.  One of these branches was closed on January 12,
1991.  In November 1990, UBI acquired certain assets and
liabilities from the RTC of the former Valley Savings, A Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Hutchinson.  UBI began operations
from two branch locations in this purchase.  One branch location
was closed on January 12, 1991.  The second branch was moved from
its initial operational site to a new site on June 30, 1992.  On
February 16, 1991, UBI acquired from the RTC, certain assets and
liabilities of the Derby branch of the former Mid Kansas Savings
and Loan, F.A. of Wichita.  UBI purchased the Derby branch location
from the RTC on June 21, 1991.

        At December 31, 1993, UBI had three active, wholly-owned
subsidiaries:  UNB, UBI Growth Capital, Inc. (UBIGC), a venture
capital company, and UBI Financial Services, Inc. (UBIFS), a
community development company.  In addition, UNB owns all of the
outstanding common stock of Union Center, Inc. (UCI), a Kansas
corporation formed in 1956 to purchase and operate the building
mainly occupied by UNB.  At December 31, 1993, UBI and its
subsidiaries had 352 FTE (full-time equivalent) employees.

        UBI and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in commercial
banking and related activities authorized by the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended, or determined by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System to be so closely related to
the business of banking as to be proper incident thereto.  UBI and
its subsidiaries, therefore, did not engage in material operations
in separate reportable industry segments for the last three years.<PAGE>

Item 1.  Business (Continued)

        UBI offers a wide range of financial services in the Wichita
and Derby, Sedgwick County, and Hutchinson, Reno County, Kansas,
areas through UNB, its subsidiary bank.  These services include
deposit accounts; commercial, installment and real estate loans;
trust, investment and escrow services; and a network of automated
teller machines.  UNB has ten locations and 17 ATMs situated within
the city limits of Wichita, Hutchinson, and Derby.  UNB is the
third largest bank in Wichita and the largest bank in Hutchinson
and Derby.  In addition, customers may also access UNB services at
479 ATMs throughout the State of Kansas and at over 101,280 ATMs
throughout the United States and Canada through UNB participation
in Kansas Electronic Transfer Systems, Inc. (KETS), VIA, Cirrus,
and Plus ATM switching companies.

        UNB faces competition from banks and other financial
institutions located in Sedgwick and Reno County, Kansas.  There
are approximately 87 other financial institutions within the
Sedgwick and Reno County areas.

        UBI and its subsidiary bank are principally affected by the
monetary policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and other federal banking regulators.  UBI, being a bank
holding company, is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve
Bank.  UNB, being a national bank, is primarily regulated by the
Comptroller of the Currency.  UNB is also subject to regulation by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation because of deposit
insurance.  The bank operates under the guidance of its board and
officers, implementing policies as to lending practices, interest
rates, service charges, and other banking functions.  These
policies guide the bank in serving the communities in which it
operates.

        In 1989, Congress enacted the "Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery, and Enforcement Act" (FIRREA), which allowed bank holding
companies to acquire savings and loan associations, either in or
outside of Kansas.  It also allowed the acquisition of savings and
loan associations by out-of-state bank holding companies.  The
FIRREA Act also abolished the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation, making the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) the single insurer of deposits for financial institutions. 
This resulted in higher insurance premium rates, which had a
negative impact on noninterest expense of UBI starting in 1991.  An
analysis of noninterest expense is discussed in greater detail
starting on page A-38.

Item 1.  Business (Continued)

        Beginning July 1, 1992, bank holding companies located in
Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma were
permitted to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in
Kansas after obtaining the approval of the Kansas State Banking
Board.  No applications can be approved unless the laws of the
state, or jurisdiction in which the applicant bank holding company
is located, permit Kansas bank holding companies to acquire banks
and bank holding companies in that state or jurisdiction on
substantially the same terms as established under Kansas law.  This
has brought greater competition to Kansas and potentially to the
communities in which UBI and its subsidiaries operate.  There have
been several institutions that have made acquisitions in the state,
but none in the Wichita area.

        UBI and its subsidiaries are evaluating these changes as well
as other legislation pending before the federal and state
governments which may have an effect on its business.  At this time
it is difficult to predict what pending proposals might be adopted
and what, if any, effect they may have on UBI and its subsidiaries. 
UBI is currently implementing changes as a result of Regulation DD,
Truth in Savings, which UBI believes will add costs beyond the
perceived benefits to its customers.  The regulatory burden on
financial institutions continues without any sign of easing.  The
regulatory burden has a negative impact on financial institutions'
ability to meet customers' needs.  UBI is not currently aware of
any pending proposals that would have a materially adverse impact
on UBI and its subsidiaries.

        The principal source of UBI's cash revenues is dividends from
UNB.  The ability of UNB to pay such cash dividends is limited by
federal regulations.  Approval of the Comptroller of the Currency
is required if total dividends declared by a national bank in any
calendar year exceed the bank's net profits for that year combined
with its retained profits for the preceding two years.  At December
31, 1993, dividends of approximately $7,839,000 were available from
the bank subsidiary without such approval.


Item 2.  Properties

        UBI uses the main offices of Union National Bank, 200 Union
Center Building, 150 North Main, Wichita, Kansas, for its offices. 
Presently, UBI pays no rental to UNB, although UBI may pay to UNB
a fair and reasonable charge for all facilities and services
furnished by UNB at such time as UBI requires separate facilities.

Item 2.  Properties (Continued)

        The Union Center Building is a 10-story  structure which was
completed and occupied by UNB in 1956.  The building is owned by
UNB's subsidiary, UCI.  Approximately 81,508 square feet, or 68.0%,
of the rentable space in the building is leased by UNB at a monthly
rent of $77,760 for 1993.  UNB owns two of the thirteen lots
comprising the site of the Union Center Building, and leases two
others for a term expiring no earlier than the year 2053.  UCI owns
three of the lots comprising the Union Center Building site, and
leases the remaining six lots for terms expiring no earlier than
2047.  There are no mortgages or liens outstanding.

        UNB owns nine separate bank facilities and the land on which
they are located.  These are at the following locations in Wichita,
Hutchinson and Derby Kansas:

                                     PART IV


Item 14.  Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, and Reports on
          Form 8-K

        (a)  The following documents are filed as part of this report:

                (1)  Financial Statements

                       The financial statements, notes, and
                       accountant's report are described in
                       Item 8 to which reference is hereby
                       made.

                (2)  Financial Statement Schedules

                       None

                (3)  Exhibits

                       None

        (b)  Reports on Form 8-K

                During the last quarter of the period covered
                by this report, UBI filed two Form 8-K's.  The
                first one was dated October 20, 1993, and was
                filed under Item 4., "Change in Registrant's
                Certifying Accountants".  This discussed the
                change from Coopers & Lybrand as UBI's
                independent accountants to Allen, Gibbs &
                Houlik effective for the fiscal year ending
                December 31, 1993.

                The second 8-K dated October 13, 1993 was
                filed under Item 2., "Acquisition or
                Disposition of Assets" and discussed the
                execution of a merger agreement between UBI,
                UNB and First Community Federal Savings and
                Loan Association (First Community).  This 8-K
                was later amended with 8-K/A No. 1 filed on
                December 23, 1993.  The amendment changed it
                from an Item 2., "Acquisition or Disposition
                of Assets" to an Item 5., "Other Events"
                because this merger is not expected to be
                consummated until April of 1994.  At that time
                UBI will file an 8-K with all the required
                financial and pro forma information.<PAGE>

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


Basis of Presentation

     The consolidated financial statements in 1993, 1992 and 1991
include UBI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, UNB, UBIGC and
UBIFS.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.  In addition, adjustments made to the unaudited
interim financial statements were of a normal recurring nature.

     The 1992 and 1991 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with 1993 presentation.  Such
reclassifications have no effect on net income.


Statement of Cash Flows

     For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include
amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and securities
purchased under resale agreements.  Generally, federal funds are
sold for one-day periods.

Investment and Trading Account Securities

     Investment securities are stated at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount.  Gains or losses
on security transactions are recognized upon realization and are
reported as a separate component of noninterest income.  The
specific identification method is used in determining the cost of
investment securities sold.

     Securities are classified as "Investment Securities" when
management has the intent and ability to hold the securities for
the foreseeable future.  Normal operations do not require the sale
of investment securities for liquidity purposes.  However, on
occasion, UBI may decide to sell investment securities prior to
maturity for any of the following reasons:  (a) to meet
unanticipated short-term liquidity needs, (b) to reposition the
maturity structure of the portfolio to meet projected liquidity
needs, (c) to reposition the rate cycle structure of the portfolio
to meet projected asset/liability requirements, or (d) to
reposition the relative portion of tax-exempt securities versus
taxable securities in response to projected levels of taxable
income.  UBI sold investment securities during the years ended
December 31, 1993, and 1992, due to all the aforementioned reasons.

     Trading account securities are classified as such primarily
based on the intent of management at the time the securities are
purchased.  The securities are held for resale to customers. 
Trading account securities are stated at market value.  Gains or
losses on the sale of trading account securities are considered a
normal part of operations and are included in other income.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


Investment and Trading Account Securities (Continued)

     Effective January 1, 1994, UBI adopted Financial Accounting
Standard No. 115 (FAS 115) which relates to accounting for certain
investments in debt and equity securities.  FAS 115 requires that
banks classify all securities as "held to maturity", "available for
sale" or "trading securities".  Any new securities at time of
purchase must be placed in one of these three categories for
reporting purposes.  Any security placed in the "available for
sale" or "trading securities" must be marked to its fair value at
that time.  The fair value adjustment for "available for sale"
securities will flow through the equity section on the financial
reports.  The fair value adjustment for the trading securities will
continue to flow through the income statement.

     Management of UBI has done an extensive evaluation of all of its
securities to determine what securities will be placed in each of
these categories.  Management has considered several factors to
determine these securities classifications including liquidity
needs, loan demand, tax issues, credit quality, regulatory issues
and asset/liability positioning.  Meeting the requirements of FAS
115 is not expected to have a significant effect on either the
balance sheet or equity of UBI.


Loans

     Loans are stated at principal amount outstanding.  Interest
income on loans is accrued as earned.  Loans are placed on
nonaccrual status when principal or interest is due and has
remained unpaid for 90 days or more unless the loan is both well
secured and in the process of collection.  Loans are also placed on
nonaccrual status when there is reasonable doubt as to the ability
of the borrower to pay interest.  At the time a loan is classified
as nonaccrual, interest previously recorded but not collected is
reversed.  Interest payments received on such loans are generally
recorded as a reduction in book value unless such book value is
deemed to be collectible.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


Allowance for Loan Losses

     UBI's policy is to maintain a valuation allowance adequate to
provide for potential losses on loans currently outstanding.  The
allowance for loan losses is determined by management on the basis
of a detailed review of the risk factors affecting the loan
portfolio, including changes in the portfolio size and mix, past
loan loss experience, the financial condition of the borrowers, and
the prevailing economic environment.  The result of this review
enables management to establish the allowance at a level considered
adequate to absorb loan losses.

     Loan losses are charged to the allowance, and recoveries are
credited to the allowance.  A provision for loan losses is made to
maintain the allowance at a level that, in management's judgment,
is adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan
portfolio.


Loan Fees

     Loan commitment and origination fees, net of the related direct
loan origination costs, are amortized over the life of the related
loans as an adjustment of yield.  The unamortized balance of these
deferred fees is reported as a reduction of total loans.  Annual
fees on bankcard loans are amortized on a straight-line basis over
a twelve month period, and the unamortized balance of these fees is
included in other liabilities.


Premises and Equipment

     Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation.  Depreciation is computed by straight-line and
accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and
any resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income for the
period.  The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


Income Taxes

     In January 1993, UBI adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (FAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes".  FAS
109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
UBI's financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future
tax consequences, FAS 109 generally takes into consideration all
expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax
law or rates.  Previously, UBI used the Financial Accounting
Standards No. 96 asset and liability approach, which gave no
recognition to future events other than the recovery of assets and
settlement of liabilities at their carrying amounts.  Management
has determined that there was no significant financial statement
impact to UBI with the implementation of FAS 109.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (FAS 107),
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", became
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 1992.  FAS 107 requires disclosure of fair value
information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized
in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that
value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair
values are based on estimates using present value or other
valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected
by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates
of future cash flows.  In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
settlement of the instrument.  FAS 107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure
requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts
presented do not represent the underlying value of UBI.

     The following methods and assumptions were used by UBI in
estimating the fair value of its financial instruments as noted in
Note 16:

Cash and cash equivalents: The book values reported in the balance
sheet for cash and short-term instruments approximate their fair
values.

Investment securities (including mortgage-backed securities): Fair
value for investment securities is based on quoted market prices,
where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair
values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)

Trading account assets: Fair values for UBI's trading account
assets, which also are the amounts recognized in the balance sheet,
are based on quoted market prices where available.  If quoted
market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted
market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans receivable: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently
and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values
approximate their book value.  The fair values for fixed rate
mortgage loans (primarily one-to-four family residential), are
based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction
with securitization transactions, adjusted for differences in loan
characteristics.  The fair values for other loans (primarily
commercial real estate and rental property mortgage loans,
commercial and industrial loans, financial institution loans,
agricultural loans, and consumer loans) are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being
offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers with similar
credit quality.  The fair value of credit card loans is estimated
to be the book value due to the short-term nature considered to
exist in this portfolio.  The book value of accrued interest
receivable approximates its fair value.

Deposit liabilities: The estimated fair value of noninterest-
bearing deposits, NOW accounts, savings accounts and money market
accounts is equal to their book value, which represents the amount
payable on demand at the reporting date.  The book value for
variable rate money market and savings accounts approximates their
fair values at the reporting date.  Fair values for fixed rate
certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow
calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on
certificates of similar remaining maturities to a schedule of
aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.

Short-term borrowings: The book value of federal funds purchased,
borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term
borrowings approximates their fair values at the reporting date.

FHLB advances: The estimated fair value of variable rate FHLB
advances is the balance sheet book value.  The estimated fair value
of fixed rate advances has been determined using rates currently
available to UNB for advances with similar terms and remaining
maturities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)

Long-term borrowings: The fair values of UBI's long-term borrowings
(other than deposits) are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses, based on UBI's current incremental borrowing rates for
similar types of borrowing arrangements.


2.  Mergers and Acquisition


Mid Kansas Savings and Loan Association, F.A., of Wichita

     On February 16, 1991, UBI assumed certain liabilities and
purchased certain assets of the Derby branch of the failed Mid
Kansas Savings and Loan Association, F.A., of Wichita, Kansas, from
the RTC.  UBI paid a premium of $480,000 which was netted out of
the cash paid by the RTC to UBI to balance the difference in
liabilities assumed and assets purchased.  The amount of deposits
assumed was $15,681,000.

     This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, with the
premium allocated to the acquired core deposit as well as other
intangibles.


First Community Federal Savings and Loan Association, Winfield, Ks.

     On October 13, 1993, UBI announced the execution of a merger
agreement between UBI, UNB and First Community Federal Savings and
Loan Association (First Community) of Winfield, Kansas.  Under the
merger agreement, First Community will be merged with UNB, and each
outstanding share of First Community common stock will be converted
into $35.00 in cash.  The total cost of the transaction is
$12,646,520.

     The transaction will be financed with a $6,800,000 loan from
Harris Bank and Trust in Chicago and the remaining $5,846,520 from
internal funds.  The merger was approved by  the First Community
shareholders in January 1994 but is still subject to final
regulatory approval.  The transaction is expected to be completed
in the spring of 1994.

2.  Mergers and Acquisitions  (Continued)

     First Community is a savings and loan institution with total
assets at December 31, 1993, of $156,382,000, and offers full
service banking from three branches.  These facilities are located
in Winfield, Arkansas City and Derby, Kansas.  All three of these
offices will be part of the merger and will be operated as branches
of UNB.

     This acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase, with the
premium allocated to various intangible assets.


3.  Cash and Due From Banks

     Federal Reserve Bank regulations require the subsidiary bank to
maintain certain reserve balances relating to deposits.  The
reserves may be maintained in the form of vault cash or balances
maintained with a Federal Reserve Bank.  For the two-week reserve
period inclusive of December 31, 1993, UNB maintained daily average
reserves of $10,553,000.  For the two-week reserve period inclusive
of December 31, 1992, the daily average reserves maintained were
$11,009,000.

9.  Long-term Borrowings

        At December 31, 1993, and 1992, UBI had a note payable to
Harris Bank for $8,000,000 and $10,000,000 respectively at a fixed
rate of 8.28% until March 31, 1995.  After this date the rate will
float at Harris Bank's base rate.  The note is collateralized by
stock of UNB.  Principal payments of $500,000 per quarter began on
March 31, 1993, with final payment due on December 31, 1997. 
Interest is payable quarterly.  Proceeds of the note payable were
used to pay off short-term borrowings of UBI at Harris Bank and for
the purchase of $8,200,000 of stock in UNB.

9.  Long-term Borrowings (Continued)

        The note payable agreement with Harris Bank contains a
restriction on the amount of dividends that UBI can declare or pay
during any one calendar year without the prior written consent of
Harris Bank.  Dividends declared or paid may not exceed 25% of
consolidated net income for the calendar year.

        Other restrictions to UBI call for a minimum capital level of
$31,500,000 through December 30, 1992, and consolidated
nonperforming assets not exceed 3% of consolidated tangible assets. 
On December 31, 1992, and on the last day of each calendar year
thereafter the required minimum capital level will increase by 50%
of consolidated net income for the year then ended.  Maturities of
this note payable are as follows (in thousands):

        Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences in the
recognition of revenues, expenses, and tax credits for tax and
financial reporting purposes.

        Cumulative temporary differences resulted in a net deferred
income tax asset of $339,000 at December 31, 1993.  The gross
deferred tax asset and the gross deferred tax liability are
included in other assets and other liabilities respectively in the
1993 Consolidated Statement of Condition.   At December 31, 1992,
a $514,000 net deferred tax liability is included in other
liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Condition.  Deferred
tax liabilities (assets) are comprised of the following (in

11.  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk

        UBI is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs
of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit and standby letters of credit.

        UBI's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the
contractual notional amount of those instruments.  UBI uses the
same credit policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

        Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit
risk at December 31, 1993, and 1992, include (in thousands):

</TABLE>
        Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require
payment of a fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  UBI evaluates
each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The
amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by UBI upon
extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of
the customer.  Collateral held varies but may include accounts
receivable, inventory, property, plant, equipment, and income-
producing commercial properties.

        Standby letters of credit are a conditional commitment issued
by UBI to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. 
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities
to customers.  Credit card lines represent the unused portion of
many different customers that have credit card loans.

        UBI grants agribusiness, commercial, individual, bankcard, and
residential loans to customers throughout the State of Kansas and
bankcard loans in the states of Nebraska, Mississippi, and
Louisiana.  UBI has a diversified loan portfolio, without what it
considers undue concentration in any one economic sector.

12.  Dividend Availability

        Approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if
total dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year
exceed the bank's net profits for that year combined with its
retained profits for the preceding two years.  At December 31,
1993, dividends of approximately $7,839,000 were available from the
bank subsidiary without such approval.


13.  Retirement Plan

        UBI's bank subsidiary has an employee thrift plan covering
substantially all of its employees after one year of service. 
Contributions are made based on a percentage of each participant's
contribution.  The total expense for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992, and 1991, amounted to $201,000 ,$184,000, and $176,000
respectively.


14.  Net Income per Share

        Net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of stock outstanding during the
year.  The weighted average number of shares was 350,690 in 1993,
350,190 in 1992 and 349,109 in 1991.

                                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Union Bancshares, Inc.

We have audited the consolidated statement of condition of Union
Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and
cash flows for the period then ended, and the separate financial
statements of Union Bancshares, Inc., which are included in Note 17
to the consolidated financial statements.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of Union
Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiaries and Union Bancshares, Inc. as of
December 31, 1993, and the results of their respective operations
and their respective cash flows for the period ended December 31,
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management's Report on Financial Statements and Internal Accounting
Control                                                           

        The financial statements, management's discussion and
analysis, and statistical data of UBI and subsidiaries contained
herein have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles at the direction of management, which has the
responsibility for these representations.  In preparing the
financial information, management makes informed judgments and
estimates of the expected effects of events and transactions that
are currently being accounted for and is cognizant of the
materiality of those events and transactions.

        In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
financial statements, management depends on UBI's system of
internal accounting control.  This system is designed to provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and that assets are safeguarded. 
Such a system includes the communication of policies and procedures
to appropriate personnel, the careful selection and training of
qualified personnel, the assignment of authority and
responsibility, the accountability for performance, and a strong
program of internal audits.  The concept of reasonable assurance is
based on the recognition that the cost of a system of internal
accounting control should not exceed the benefits expected to be
derived and that the evaluation of those factors requires estimates
and judgments by management.

        Management has confidence that the internal accounting
controls currently in place, along with its strong audit programs,
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements
presented herein and transactions underlying such statements are in
accordance with management's authorization and generally accepted
accounting principles.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations                                             
              
        For 1993, UBI's net income was $5,192,000, up 20.7% from the
$4,300,000 earned in 1992.  The earnings for 1993 produced a return
on average assets of .97% compared to .79% the prior year.  The
return on average equity of 13.50% was up from the 12.45% of the
preceding year. 

        The increase in earnings was the result of a higher net
interest margin, a lower loan loss provision and lower expenses. 
The improvement in the net interest margin was the result of
liabilities repricing faster than assets in a lowering interest
rate environment in 1993.  In the fourth quarter the margin leveled
out.  Management does not see continued improvement in the margin
in 1994 as liabilities have appeared to reach a low, while asset
rates are still falling.  The change in the asset mix of the
balance sheet also contributed to the improved margin in 1993. 
Management anticipates a continued change in the mix of assets
during 1994 as more assets are deployed to loans from investments. 
This should further help the margin in 1994.  Overall, management
anticipates the net interest margin to be flat in 1994.

        The reduction in the loan loss provision was directly related
to the lowest net charge-off level (.50% of average loans) since
1982.  While management believes its systems for monitoring,
reviewing and analyzing credits contributed to this low number, it
also believes an improved economic environment assisted in holding
this number down.  Management believes that this number will
continue to remain low in 1994.

        Expenses in 1993 were down from 1992 levels, almost to 1991
levels.  This resulted from reduced marketing expenditures, data
processing expenses, supply costs and other overhead expenses.  A
change in UBI's advertising agency and marketing programs helped in
reducing marketing expenses for 1993.  Management anticipates
marketing costs to be up in 1994 from new marketing programs being
implemented during 1994.  Data processing expenses were down in
1993 as the result of reduced data processing projects.  This
savings was offset somewhat by increased equipment costs from new
systems.  These systems are reducing supply costs and helping to
position UBI for greater expansion of business without major staff
additions.

        Management anticipates slight increases in other expenses for
1994 as UBI looks to have additional system requirements to meet
the demand for products and services of its customers.  It also
anticipates further pressure on expenses from increased regulatory
burdens and the potential for increased employee benefit costs from
health care reform.<PAGE>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (Continued)                                 

        On October 13, 1993, UBI announced the execution of a merger
agreement between UBI, UNB and First Community.  Under the merger
agreement, First Community will be merged with UNB and each
outstanding share of First Community common stock will be converted
into $35.00 in cash.  The total cost of the transaction is
$12,646,520. First Community, with total assets of $156,382,000 at
December 31, 1993, offers full service banking from three branches
located in Winfield, Arkansas City and Derby, Kansas.

        First Community brings new markets and product offerings to
UNB.  It has a very strong mortgage banking business that UNB can
utilize in its Sedgwick and Reno County markets.  UNB will be able
to take its commercial and consumer products to the markets served
by First Community.  Management perceives this as a positive
benefit to customers of both institutions.  Management believes
that this will bring increased profitability to UNB through
increased markets, increased sales of products and cost savings
from operational efficiencies.

        In 1992, UBI earned $4,300,000, an increase of 22.8% over the
$3,502,000 earned in 1991.  This was a .79% return on average
assets and a 12.45% return on average equity.  This compares to a
.63% return on average assets and a 11.59% return on average equity
in 1991.  The increased earnings in 1992 resulted from a higher net
interest margin and some higher noninterest income levels.  The net
interest margin was up 8.8% in 1992 over 1991 due to increased
volumes of earning assets and a change in the mix of assets from
investments to loans.

        Net income for 1991 of $3,502,000 was up 21.4% over the
$2,885,000 in 1990.  Return on average assets was .63% in 1991
compared to .59% in 1990.  Return on average equity was 11.59%
compared to 10.25% in the prior year.  An increase in the net
interest margin of $21,352,000, or 13.8%, was the major contributor
to the increased earnings.  There were also some higher levels of
noninterest income.

        In 1990 and 1991, UBI acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of three failed savings and loan associations
in transactions with the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC).  The
liabilities assumed in these transactions consisted mainly of
deposits, in particular, certificates of deposit.  The assets
acquired consisted primarily of performing 1-4 family mortgages. 
UBI's balance sheet increased by some $170 million from these
acquisitions.  While the impact to the balance sheet was considered
significant, the resulting effect in the initial years to the
income statement was not.  The effect to the income statement has
come over the past three years through the improved net interest
margin as identified above and back room operational efficiencies.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (Continued)                                 

The improved margin is the result of repricing of liabilities and
the change in the asset mix from investments to loans.

        Management anticipates 1994 to be a very competitive year. 
Margins will continue to flatten causing management to rely on
further deployment of investment assets to loan assets to maintain
margins.  Management will look to increased sales of products and
services in 1994 to improve earnings over 1993.  They will also
continue to look for technological improvements and efficiencies to
take on additional volumes at current costs or to reduce costs
where applicable.

        Management has implemented the new rules on marking to market
of securities under FAS 115.  It is management's belief that there
will not be any major impact to UBI's balance sheet or income
statement from this change in accounting procedure.  Management is
also trying to assess what, if any, effect health care reform may
have on earnings in 1994.  It cannot be determined at this time
what the effect will be, but management believes it will have a
negative impact on earnings as costs will most likely increase. 
Management also has under review various other regulatory issues. 
It is too early to determine the effect these pending issues might
have on UBI and/or its bank subsidiary, UNB.

        Management continues to look for acquisition opportunities in
South Central Kansas.  Management believes growth through
acquisition will help provide future shareholder value and assist
in meeting competition through cost efficiencies.

        The significant elements of income and expense affecting net
income are detailed separately and in greater detail in the ensuing
analyses.

Analysis of Net Interest Income                                   

        Net interest income, the most significant element of UBI's
earnings, represents the difference between the interest earned on
loans and other investments and the interest incurred for deposits
and other sources of funds.  For purposes of the analysis below,
net interest income is adjusted to convert tax-exempt income to a
fully taxable equivalent basis.  This adjustment does not affect
net income since a statement of income prepared on a taxable
equivalent basis includes an offsetting amount in income tax
expense.

The following table reflects net interest income on a taxable
equivalent basis (1) for the years 1991 to 1993 (in thousands):

</TABLE>

        On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 1993 was
$25,115,000, representing an increase over the previous year of
$724,000 or 3.0%.  The improvement in net interest income was the
result of an increase in interest rate spreads and the mix of
earning assets.  Average loans in 1993 totaled $284,565,000, an
increase of $8,332,000, or 3.0%, over the prior year.  This
increase contributed to the improved margin, in addition to the
interest costing liabilities repriced faster in 1993 at lower rates
than did interest earning assets.

        Interest expense in 1993 decreased by $4,788,000, or 24.5%,
from 1992.  This decrease was due mainly from lower rates paid on
deposits.  Average interest costing liabilities were $413,259,000
representing a decrease of $16,481,000, or 3.8%, below 1992. 
Average time deposits less than $100,000 fell $27,305,000, or
13.9%, in the current year.

        In 1992, net interest income increased 8.9% over 1991.  This
increase was primarily the result of an improvement in the mix of
interest earning assets.  Lower yielding investments were replaced
with higher yielding loans.

Analysis of Noninterest Income                                    

        Noninterest income in 1993 was $7,904,000, representing a
decrease of $19,000, or .2%, under the preceding year.  The largest
decrease came from the security gains category which decreased
$339,000 from 1992.  This was due to the 1992 sale of
collateralized mortgage obligations discussed in the next
paragraph.  Increases in service charges and trust fees categories
for 1993 helped offset the decreases in noninterest income caused
by the security gains category.  All other categories remained
relatively unchanged.

        Noninterest income in 1992 was $7,923,000, representing a
decrease of $438,000, or 5.2%, under the preceding year.  This
decrease resulted primarily from other income.  In 1991 and 1990
there were items of income received from the RTC in the settlement
of the acquisition transactions of failed savings and loans from
the RTC that did not repeat themselves in 1992.  Bankcard fees and
service charges were also down in 1992 due to changes in customer
uses of these services.  During 1992, UNB sold collateralized
mortgage obligations because of accelerated repayments and small
principal sums remaining in certain issues.  This accounted for
almost all of the investment sales in 1992, and the security gains
noted in the table below.  The total par value sold represented
approximately 6.6% of the entire investment portfolio.  All other
categories remained relatively unchanged.
 
        Each major category of noninterest income is analyzed in the
following table (in thousands):

Analysis of Noninterest Expense                                   

        Noninterest expense in 1993 totaled $22,163,000, a decrease of
$403,000, or 1.8%, under 1992.  The largest decrease in noninterest
expense occurred in marketing expenses.  In 1992 there was
extensive media advertising that took place that did not occur in
1993.  Several other noninterest expense categories decreased in
1993 due to efforts to control costs in UBI.  The largest dollar
increase in noninterest expense came from salaries and benefits
expenses.  The increase of $522,000 was due to normal salary and
benefits increases.

Analysis of Noninterest Expense (Continued)                      

        Noninterest expense in 1992 totaled $22,566,000, an increase
of $414,000, or 1.9%, over 1991.  This increase was significantly
less than the increase from 1990 to 1991.  There were various
increases and decreases in the expense categories resulting in the
small 1.9% increase overall.  Management continues to look for ways
to cut costs.

Analysis of Investment Securities (Continued)                     

        It is the initial intent of UBI to hold securities to
maturity.  It may, from time to time, sell securities for reasons
as defined in Note 1, page A-9 (Investment and Trading Account
Securities) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

        Except for total U.S. Treasury and U.S. Agency Obligations, no
investment in a single issuer exceeds 10% of stockholders' equity.

        State and municipal securities make up approximately 22.3% of
the total investment portfolio.  UNB's investment policy states
that out-of-state municipal securities purchased shall have an A
rating or better by either Standard & Poor's or Moody's rating
service or be approved by the Investment Committee if municipal
securities with less than an A rating are considered.  The quality
ratings on Kansas municipal bonds shall be left to the investment
officer.

        At December 31, 1993, $10,443,000, or 24.5%, of the state and
municipal securities were nonrated with $6,833,000, or 65.4%, of
the nonrated municipal securities being Kansas issues.  The
majority of the nonrated municipal securities are smaller bond
issues that are not rated by Standard & Poors or Moody's but are
considered to be of appropriate investment quality and actively
traded in a liquid market.

securities at December 31, 1993, is shown below (in thousands):

        UBI has had a significant increase in installment loans
starting in 1991 through 1993.  UBI has been aggressively pursuing
indirect dealer loan business during this period.  UBI will
continue to emphasize this area of the retail market in the future
because of the potential to generate additional loan growth for
UBI.

        UBI shows a significant increase in mortgage loans in 1990
from prior years.  This increase is the result of acquisitions of
two failed savings and loans during 1990 from the RTC.  Prior to
these acquisitions, UBI's bank subsidiary, UNB, began emphasizing
home mortgage lending in the latter part of 1988.  Prior to that
time UNB did not actively promote mortgage loans.

        In 1988, when UNB began emphasizing mortgage loans, Sedgwick
County, Kansas was defined as the market area.  The acquisitions in
1990 expanded the mortgage lending market to Reno County, Kansas
with a few loans in counties adjacent to Sedgwick and Reno
counties.  UNB continues to consider Sedgwick and Reno counties as
its primary mortgage loan markets.  The majority of these loans are
1-4 family residential mortgage loans.  At December 31, 1993,
approximately 55% are adjustable rate mortgages with the remaining
45% being fixed rate.

Analysis of Underperforming Assets                                
                  
        UBI continues to place strong emphasis on the close monitoring
of underperforming assets.  It is UBI's policy to treat as
underperforming assets (a) loans that are accounted for on a
nonaccrual basis, (b) loans, the terms of which have been
renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or
principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of
the borrower, (c) other real estate, and (d) loans which are past
due 90 days or more and still accruing interest.

        Underperforming assets at December 31, 1993, were $2,213,000,
an increase of $156,000 from $2,057,000 at December 31, 1992. 
Nonaccrual loans decreased $402,000, while loans 90 days past due
increased $530,000 over the prior year.  At December 31, 1992,
underperforming assets were $544,000 higher than the $1,513,000
reported at December 31, 1991.  The increase at December 31, 1992,
was not substantial and the level of underperforming assets to
total loans and the allowance for loan losses remain at very
acceptable levels.  The decrease in 1991, was attributable to
reduced levels of past due loans and charge-offs of loans
classified as underperforming in 1990.  All underperforming loans
of $100,000 or more are specifically reviewed by management in
analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  This is
discussed further on page A-10 under Allowance for Loan Losses.

        Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or
interest is due and has remained unpaid for 90 days or more unless
the loan is well secured and/or in the process of collection. 
Loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when there is reasonable
doubt as to the ability of the borrower to pay interest or
principal.  At the time a loan is classified as nonaccrual,
interest previously recorded but not collected is reversed. 
Interest payments received on such loans are generally recorded as
a reduction in book value unless such book value is deemed to be
collectible.

        Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued
amounted to $685,000 at December 31, 1993.  If interest on these
loans had been accrued, such income would have approximated $66,000
in 1993.  No interest was recognized on these loans after
transferring them to non-accrual status.

        Underperforming assets for five-year period ended December 31,
1993, are set forth in the following table (in thousands):

Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses                             

        In the normal course of business, banks recognize that a
relatively small percentage of the loans they make will eventually
be charged off.  These future charge-offs are currently provided
for through the allowance for loan losses.  Additions made to this
allowance are charged to operating expenses under the provision for
loan losses.  Loans are charged against the allowance when they are
deemed to be uncollectible.  Recoveries are credited directly to
the allowance.

        The required level for the allowance for loan losses is
determined by management on the basis of a detailed review of the
risk factors affecting the loan portfolio.  In addition to
evaluating the financial condition of individual borrowers,
management assesses the entire portfolio as to past loan loss
experience, volumes, mix and maturity, concentration of credit,
prevailing economic conditions, both locally and nationally, and
off-balance sheet risk.  Management specifically reviews all
underperforming assets of $100,000 or more for loan loss adequacy
as well as for potential partial or complete charge-off.  The
results of these reviews along with the other above factors enable
management to establish the allowance at a level considered
adequate to absorb loan losses.

        At December 31, 1993, the allowance for loan losses was
$4,400,000, or 1.49%, of outstanding loans.  This compares with
$3,400,000, or 1.21%, of outstanding loans reported at the end of
1992.  The provision for loan losses totaled $2,412,000 in the
current year, a decrease of $157,000 from the $2,569,000 reported
a year earlier.  Net charge-offs during 1993 amounted to
$1,412,000, or .50%, of average net loans.  This compares with net
charge-offs of $2,219,000, or .80%, of average net loans for the
preceding year.

        Based upon managements detailed review and analysis of the
loan portfolio at December 31, 1993, the allowance for loan losses
was set at a level of $4,400,000 as managements best estimate of
the potential losses which might be present in the loan portfolio
at that point in time.  Management believes it is important to take
a conservative approach in evaluating the risk profile of the
company.

Analysis of Deposits                                              

        Deposits at December 31, 1993, were $433,816,000, representing
a decrease of $41,811,000, or 8.8%, below 1992.  On average for the
year, deposits were $444,364,000, down $31,280,000 over 1992.  Most
of the decrease in deposits during 1993 occurred in time deposits. 
This decrease was the result of lower interest rates in 1993 and
1992, which has caused customers to look for alternative
investments at higher yields outside the banking industry.

        The maturity of time deposits of $100,000 or more is set forth
in the following table (in thousands):

Analysis of Capital Resources                                     

        Stockholders' equity increased $4,596,000, or 12.7%, to
$40,816,000 at December 31, 1993, from the $36,220,000 reported at
December 31, 1992.  The ratio of equity capital to total assets was
7.7 % at December 31, 1993, compared to 6.6% for the same period in
1992.  This increase was the result of reinvested earnings, which 
amounted to $4,596,000, or 88.5%, of net income compared with
$3,705,000, or 86.2%, of net income a year earlier.  The dividend
payout ratio of 11.5% is consistent with UBI's policy of
maintaining an appropriate balance between earnings returned to
stockholders in the form of dividends and earnings retained to
provide internal capital growth.

        Risk-based capital guidelines established by the Federal
Reserve Bank (FRB), UBI's primary regulator, started in 1991. 
These guidelines began phase in on January 1, 1991, with final
implementation on December 31, 1992.  Under these guidelines, the
FRB will monitor three ratios for capital levels.  They are Tier I
capital, Tier II capital and a Leverage ratio.  Currently the FRB
is requiring a minimum Tier I capital guideline of 4.00%, a Tier II
capital guideline of 8.00%, and a Leverage ratio of 3.00%.  At
December 31, 1993, UBI had a 11.8% Tier I capital ratio, a 13.1%
Tier II capital ratio, and a 7.4% Leverage ratio.  All of UBI's
capital ratios are above the regulatory guidelines and placed UBI
in the "well capitalized" category currently defined by regulators. 
Well capitalized institutions are defined as those institutions
having a Tier I capital level of 6.0%, a Tier II capital level of
10.0% and a Leverage ratio of 5.0%.  This is the highest capital
level category defined by regulators.

Analysis of Liquidity                                             

        Liquidity for UBI's bank subsidiary, UNB, is represented by
UNB's ability to generate a continuing stream of funds to satisfy
its financial needs and the credit and deposit demands of its
customers.  Liquidity and interest sensitivity are managed in a
coordinated asset/liability management program within the bank.

        Asset liquidity is derived from loan repayments and scheduled
maturities of loans and other assets, primarily investment
securities.  At December 31, 1993, loan repayments and scheduled
loan maturities within one year or less totaled $86,142,000.  At
December 31, 1993, investment securities, federal funds sold, FHLB
overnight deposits, securities purchased under resale agreements
and other investments, all of which are maturing within one year or
less, totaled $54,761,000.  These short-term investment funds
equaled 11.3% of aggregate interest-earning assets.  This liquidity
provides UNB with a substantial capacity to fund customers' new
credit demands, internal financial needs, deposit payouts and to
take advantage of other attractive market conditions as they arise.

        On the liability side, the most significant sources of
liquidity for UNB consist of customers' new savings and time
deposits under $100,000 and the renewal of customers' maturing
deposits.  Other sources of liquidity include customers'
certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more, FHLB advances, and the
purchase of federal funds and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase.

        UBI relies on dividends and tax benefit payments from its
subsidiaries and borrowings from unaffiliated banks to generate
cash flow.  Federal regulations restrict the payment of dividends
by national banks by requiring approval of the Comptroller of the
Currency if total dividends declared by a national bank in any
calendar year exceed the bank's net profits for that year combined
with its retained profits for the preceding two years.  At December
31, 1993, dividends of approximately $7,839,000 were available from
the bank subsidiary without such approval.  UBI also has available
for cash flow needs a $1,000,000 line of credit with Harris Bank
and Trust Company of Chicago.  As of December 31, 1993, the line of
credit had a $0 balance.


Analysis of Interest Sensitivity                                  

        Interest sensitivity is the cornerstone of UBI's
asset/liability margin management system.  Key asset and liability
decisions are reviewed in the framework of this system with the
objective of optimizing long-term profitability at an acceptable
level of risk.
