PART I.

Item 1. Business

XTRA Corporation (the "Company" or "XTRA") was organized in 1957 and is
engaged in transportation equipment leasing. The Company conducts its business
through its subsidiaries, including XTRA, Inc. XTRA's management subsidiary
X-L-CO., INC. is located at 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109
(telephone number (617) 367-5000).

In September, 1994, the Company changed its corporate structure by
establishing a new holding company, XTRA Missouri, Inc., as an intermediate
subsidiary between the Company and XTRA, Inc. XTRA Missouri, Inc. is a holding
company for the stock of XTRA, Inc. and also holds and manages the Company's
office space for XTRA Lease, Inc. and XTRA Intermodal, Inc. The Company also
changed its operating structure so that XTRA, Inc. now conducts both its
over-the-road and intermodal business   through its subsidiaries XTRA Lease,
Inc. and XTRA Intermodal, Inc. pursuant to fleet management agreements.  Under
the fleet management agreements, which are terminable upon 30 days notice by
either party, XTRA Lease, Inc. and XTRA Intermodal, Inc. pay fees to  XTRA,
Inc. for the use of equipment owned by XTRA, Inc. Accordingly,  XTRA, Inc.'s
primary source of revenues will be payments under the fleet  management
agreements, as well as dividends and advances from its subsidiaries. At
September 30, 1994, 41% of XTRA, Inc.'s consolidated assets were accounted  for
by its subsidiaries. For fiscal 1995, approximately 94% of XTRA Inc.'s 
consolidated revenues are expected to be accounted for by its subsidiaries.
        
        XTRA's leasing equipment is offered to private fleet owners, contract
and common carriers, railroads and steamship lines in North America to cover
cyclical, seasonal or geographical shortages and as a substitute for purchasing
equipment. The Company's two leasing divisions are XTRA Lease and XTRA
Intermodal. XTRA Lease, primarily on an operating basis, leases over-the-road
trailers, older trailers for mobile storage use and to a limited extent
intermodal trailers and chassis. XTRA Intermodal leases, primarily on an
operating basis, intermodal trailers, chassis and domestic containers. Leasing
transportation equipment is a highly competitive business. The choice of
equipment used, whether that choice is made by the shipper, transportation
company or shipping agent, is primarily influenced by lease rates, terms,
location, availability, condition and size of equipment, as well as other
factors related to the general freight transportation market. The principal
categories of equipment leased by the Company are described below.

        For information regarding revenues attributable to each division, see
Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional
information, including financing, capital expenditures and equipment utilization
of each division's leasing fleet, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Such information is incorporated
herein by reference.

        The majority of the Company's leasing fleet is manufactured to its
specifications by a number of manufacturers. Some of XTRA's equipment has been
acquired through acquisitions of competitors. The Company's leasing fleet
consisted of the following units at the end of its last five fiscal years:

(1) The Company's fleet size and approximate net investment includes equipment
    owned by the Company, equipment leased-in from third parties under operating
    and capital leases and equipment leased to third parties under finance
    leases. For purposes of this presentation, the net investment in equipment
    leased to the Company on an operating basis represents the present value of
    the remaining lease payments. The net investment in revenue equipment leased
    to customers under long-term finance leases as well as equipment owned by
    the Company or leased to the Company under capital leases represents the
    net carrying value of this equipment. The significant increase in fleet size
    from 1992 to 1993 was primarily due to the Strick Lease acquisition
    completed in October, 1992 (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

<PAGE>   3
        XTRA's business is directly affected, in terms of equipment utilization
and lease rates, by the level of domestic economic activity, the supply of
available equipment, demand and other factors in the freight transportation
industry. The Company's utilization and hence its profitability is usually
seasonally lower in its second and third fiscal quarters than in its first and
fourth fiscal quarters. 

        The Company leases its equipment on both a term and per diem basis. Term
leases include both fixed-term leases and open-term leases. Under fixed-term
leases, the customer agrees to lease the equipment for an initial period of one
year or greater; the initial term is generally one to four years. Open-term
leases typically allow the Company or the lessee to terminate the lease by
giving 30 days notice, however these agreements tend to extend for three to five
years except during prolonged domestic economic downturns. Under per diem
leases, the customer generally has the option to return the equipment without
notice.

        In general, the Company's receivable collection experience has been
good. However, economic downturns tend to lengthen the collection period of
certain receivables.

Over-the-Road Trailers

XTRA's over-the-road fleet of 56,200 trailers, mostly dry cargo vans, consists
primarily of units 48' long by 102'' wide. XTRA's over-the-road trailer
equipment is leased to private fleet owners, contract carriers and common
carriers of general commodities. Approximately 43% of the trailers were leased
on a term basis at the end of 1994 with the balance available for lease on a per
diem basis. Generally, lessees are responsible for damage to equipment,
except for ordinary maintenance, with full-service leases also available. Lease
rates depend upon the length of term, the extent to which the Company provides
maintenance and the type and age of the equipment.

Storage Trailers

XTRA's storage fleet consists of older former over-the-road and intermodal
trailers. This fleet of 12,600 units is leased to a variety of customers under
the trade name XTRA SPACE. Approximately 15% of the storage fleet was leased on
a term basis at the end of 1994 with the balance available for lease on a per
diem basis.

Intermodal Transportation

Intermodal transport involves moving freight through some combination of rail
movement on rail flatcars, over water by ship and/or over-the-road. Long-haul
freight in North America is transported in intermodal trailers, domestic
containers, international ("marine") containers and over-the-road trailers.
The percentage of all domestic intermodal freight transported has been
gradually increasing with the percentage moved in domestic containers increasing
at a slightly higher rate than intermodal trailers.

Intermodal Trailers

Intermodal trailers are designed to be carried on rail flatcars, pulled by a
tractor over the highway and, to a lesser extent, transported by watercarriers  
on ships and barges. The Company's intermodal trailer fleet of 33,900 units
consists primarily of units 45' and 48' long by 102" wide.

        The Company's intermodal trailers are leased primarily to North American
railroads and watercarriers. Approximately 39% of the intermodal trailer fleet
was leased on a term basis (primarily open-term) at the end of 1994. The
remainder of the fleet is available for lease on a per diem basis. Under per
diem leases, the customer is generally responsible for damage to equipment,
except for ordinary maintenance. The customers may terminate the per diem charge
by transferring possession to another user or by removing the trailer from
service at an authorized location. 

        Under term leases, the lessee is responsible for rental fees during the
term of the lease even if the trailer is physically transferred to another
carrier. The lessee is responsible for damage to equipment and repair and
maintenance, normal wear excepted and, if necessary, pays certain costs for
reconditioning upon its return to XTRA locations. 

        The Company believes the North American fleet of intermodal trailers had
declined from approximately 121,000 in 1989 to 95,000 at the end of 1992 due to
increased use of marine containers, domestic containers and over-the-road
trailers to transport intermodal freight as well as increased efficiency in the
use of intermodal trailers by the railroads. 

                                       3

<PAGE>   4

XTRA believes the North American fleet of intermodal trailers has grown to
100,000 by the end of fiscal 1994 as a result of an improving economy, better 
service provided by the railroads and increased use of intermodal transportation
by long-haul truckers. As a result of these factors, demand for intermodal
trailers increased in fiscal 1993 and 1994, although the Company is unable to 
predict whether the demand for intermodal trailers will continue to grow in the
future. The Company monitors the size of the North American fleet relative to
current and expected future demand and bases its trailer acquisition and 
disposition decisions, in part, on these factors.

Chassis

Domestic chassis are wheeled rectangular steel frames generally 40' to 53' in
length. Marine chassis are generally 20' or 40' in length to accommodate marine 
containers. XTRA's domestic and marine chassis are used as transport vehicles
for domestic and marine containers which are then loaded or unloaded at
shippers, rail terminals or consignees.

        The Company's chassis fleet, consisting of 16,500 units, is leased to
water and motor carriers and railroads. Approximately 87% of the chassis fleet
was leased on a term basis at the end of 1994, with the balance available for
per diem use. Under term leases, lessees are generally responsible for damage
to equipment and repair and maintenance, normal wear excepted. Under per diem 
leases, the customer is responsible for damage to equipment, except for ordinary
maintenance.

Domestic Containers

Domestic containerization is the transportation of freight domestically
in containers through a combination of rail, including "double stack" service
(stacked two high on rail well cars), and over the road on chassis. Domestic
containers are used as a substitute for intermodal and over-the-road trailers,
particularly on long-haul, heavy volume routes. XTRA's fleet of approximately
7,800 units consists primarily of 48' long by 102'' wide steel-constructed
units. Domestic containers are larger than marine containers, which are
typically 20' or 40' long by 96'' wide.

        The Company's domestic containers are leased to North American railroads
and domestic transportation segments of shipping lines. At September 30, 1994,
substantially all of the Company's domestic containers were working under term
lease agreements.The lessee is responsible for damage to equipment and repair
and maintenance, normal wear excepted.

Competition 

Leasing transportation equipment is highly competitive and is affected by
factors related to the general freight transportation market. Lease terms and
lease rates, as well as location, availability, condition and size of
equipment are each important to the lessee. In addition, competition exists
among the various types of transportation equipment. Over-the-road trailers,
intermodal trailers, marine and domestic containers, and railroad rolling stock
are all potential vehicles for the domestic movement of freight.

        Recent estimates place the number of over-the-road trailers available
for lease in North America in excess of 250,000 of which approximately 116,000
are owned by two operating lessors. The Company believes it is the second
largest North American lessor of over-the-road trailers with its principal
competitor having a slightly larger fleet.

        In the operating lease market for intermodal trailers, the Company
competes principally with one other leasing company. It is estimated that there
are approximately 100,000 intermodal trailers in North America. XTRA believes it
owns approximately 34% of the North American fleet with its principal competitor
having a slightly larger sized fleet. The balance is owned by other leasing
companies and railroads.

        The use of domestic containers and chassis is a growing part of the
intermodal business. As the domestic container leasing market develops, the
Company will compete with other transportation equipment lessors entering this
market. The Company believes it is the third largest lessor of domestic
containers and its fleet represents approximately 16% of the fleet controlled by
intermodal carriers. There is also competition for the intermodal movement of
domestic freight from marine containers. Some portion of the nation-wide marine
chassis fleet of approximately 180,000 units is used to handle domestic
containers and hence competes with domestic chassis.

                                      4

Locations and Operations

XTRA Lease equipment is leased from equipment pools operated by Company
employees at 87 locations in North America. The operations of the XTRA
Intermodal fleet are primarily domestic and are coordinated by 5 regional
offices located at key points of railroad activity. 

Significant Customers

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway accounted for 11% of the Company's
consolidated revenues in 1992. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of
revenues in any of the last three fiscal years. See Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

The Company had 798 employees at September 30, 1994.

Item 2. Properties

The Company maintains 92 facilities for the storage and distribution of its
equipment throughout North America, occupying 633 acres, of which 368 are
owned. Except for installations in Chicago and the St. Louis area, consisting
of 35 and 148 acres, respectively, these facilities are generally located on
lots ranging from 11 to 30 acres.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

There are no material pending legal proceedings in which the Company is named
as a defendant.

        A subsidiary of the Company has joined a group of other parties working
with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") on the remediation 
of environmental problems at the Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site in
Edgerton, Wisconsin and provision of an alternative water supply to affected
residences in the area of the site. The subsidiary has also joined another group
of parties working with the WDNR with regard to an adjacent manufacturing
facility owned by the subsidiary prior to 1978. The Company is unable at this
time to predict with any certainty the ultimate remediation costs associated
with these sites or with provision of an alternative water supply, or the
Company's share of any such costs. Based on preliminary estimates received from
technical consultants for the Company and other similarly situated parties, the
Company believes that its share of any future costs for remediation of both
sites and provision of an alternative water supply will not be material to the
results of operations, the financial condition or the liquidity of the Company,
without consideration of any potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from
the prior owner of the manufacturing facility or the owner/operator of the
Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site.

        The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends on its Common Stock since

and will be dependent upon the earnings, financial condition  and cash
requirements of the Company and other relevant  factors existing at the time.

capital stock is advances and  dividends from its direct and indirect
wholly-owned  subsidiaries, including XTRA, Inc. Several of the Company's  loan
agreements  contain covenants that restrict the  payment of cash dividends by
the Company. In addition,  certain loan agreements contain covenants that
restrict  advances to and the payment of dividends to the Company by  its
subsidiaries, including XTRA Missouri, Inc. and XTRA,  Inc. Under the most

     Accounting for Investment in Subsidiary

     XTRA Corporation, the Parent Company, records its investment in its
     subsidiary, XTRA Missouri, Inc. at cost plus its equity in the
     undistributed earnings of this subsidiary.  All administrative and         
     interest expenses incurred by the Parent Company are allocated to its
     direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.

(B)  Capital Stock

     Dividends

     XTRA Corporation declared cash dividends of $.39, $.46 and $.54 per share

     Corporation paid out cash dividends to stockholders totaling $9,417,000,
     $10,530,000 and $9,132,000 during fiscal 1992, 1993, and 1994,
     respectively.  The principal source of dividends for the Parent Company are
     funds advanced from its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries,
     including XTRA, Inc.

     Issuance of Common Stock

     During fiscal 1993, the company issued 1,495,000 shares of common stock at
     $44.75 per share.  The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $63
     million.

     issued 300 shares of Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred
     Stock with a $30 million redemption value, a dividend rate of 10% and a
     final maturity date of five years.  On October 1, 1993, the Company elected
     to exercise its option to exchange the outstanding shares for subordinated
     debt with a coupon of 10%.  This subordinated debt which was recorded by
     its subsidiary, XTRA, Inc., was redeemed September 30, 1994.

tax identification number                        , or registered

from the Original Issue Date specified above or from the most

duly provided for, on the Interest Payment Dates in each year

will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in
whose name this security (or one or more Predecessor Securities)
is registered (which, if this Security is a Global Security, will

of Securities of this Series not less than 10 days prior to such
Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful
manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such

payment of public and private debts.  Payments of interest other
than interest payable at Maturity will be made by check mailed to
the registered Holder hereof at the address shown in the Security
Register or, at the option of the registered Holder hereof, by

Security.  The Company may treat the person in whose name this
Security is registered as the owner of this Security for the
purpose of receiving payments of principal, premium (if any) and
interest on this Security and for all purposes whatsoever.

                            Reverse of Security
                            -------------------

    This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities
of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be
issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of
August 15, 1994 as supplemented by the First Supplemental
Indenture dated as of September 30, 1994 (herein referred to as
the "Indenture"), among the Company, XTRA Corporation, as
Guarantor (herein called a "Guarantor," which term includes any
successor Guarantor to XTRA Corporation under the Indenture), the
Trustee and, as to the First Supplemental Indenture, XTRA
Missouri, Inc. as Guarantor (herein called a "Guarantor", which
term includes any successor Guarantor to XTRA Missouri, Inc. under
the Indenture and, together with XTRA Corporation, the
"Guarantors"), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a
statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties
and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon
which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and
delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the
face hereof.

    If an Initial Redemption Date is specified on the face
hereof, this Security is subject to redemption upon notice by
first-class mail given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the date fixed for redemption, at any time as a whole or
in part, on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any,
specified on the face hereof, at the election of the Company, at
the Redemption Prices, if any, specified on the face hereof,
(expressed in percentages of the principal amount), and thereafter
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
this Security, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date;
provided, that interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on
or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of
such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record
at the close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to
on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.

    "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking
institutions in Boston, Massachusetts or New York, New York are
authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

    Payments of interest hereon with respect to any Interest
Payment date will include interest accrued to but excluding such
Interest Payment Date.

    Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from
the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for
is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.  Such interest shall accrue from the Original Issue Date,


                                 -4-
<PAGE>   5

or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly
provided for, but excluding the date for which accrued interest is
being calculated. 

    In any case where any Interest Payment Date or the Stated
Maturity of the principal of this Security shall not be a Business
Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of the
Indenture) the payment of interest and/or of principal need not be
made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest
Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity, and no interest shall
accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after
such Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity to such next
succeeding Business Day.

    If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this
series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the
Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

    The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time
of (i) the entire indebtedness of this Security or (ii) certain
covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon
compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.

    The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights
and obligations of the Company and the Guarantors and the rights
of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected
under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantors and
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of 66 2/3% in
principal amount of all Outstanding Securities at the time and of
a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time
Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in principal amount of all the Securities and the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of
the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance
by the Company, the Guarantors, or both with certain provisions of
the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of
this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

    No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation
of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of, premium (if any) and interest on this Security at


                                 -5-

<PAGE>   6

the times, place and rate (except as provided for in such
Security), and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

    As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations (including, in the case of any Global Security,
certain additional limitations) therein set forth, the transfer of
this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon
surrender of such Securities for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal
of, premium (if any) and interest on this Security are payable,
duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security
Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of
like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate
principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

    The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered
form without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth,
Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate
principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of
a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same.

    No service charge shall be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable
in connection therewith.

    Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee and any agent
of the Company, the Guarantors or the Trustee may treat the Person
in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for
all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither
the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

    All terms used in this Security which are defined in the
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.

    This Security shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

    Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by
manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any
benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose.

call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made
by the Company.

    The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder
shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely surety, and
shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be
unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of
such Security or such Indenture, any failure to enforce the
provisions of such Security or such Indenture, or any waiver,
modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect
thereto, by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee or any
other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification
or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor,
increase the principal amount of such Security or change the
redemption terms thereof or alter the Stated Maturity thereof.

payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or
bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first
against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such
Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands
whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be
discharged except by strict and complete performance of the
obligations contained in such Security and this Guarantee.

    The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of such Security and the Trustee against the Company in respect of
any amounts paid to such Holder by the Guarantor pursuant to the
provisions of this Guarantee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the

payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation

Securities issued under such Indenture shall have been paid in
full.

    No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of
this Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the
guarantee of the Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional,
of the due and punctual payment of principal, premium (if any),
and interest on the Security upon which this Guarantee is
endorsed.

    This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any
purpose until the certificate of authentication of the Security
upon which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been manually
executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under such Indenture.

Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such
Indenture.

        XTRA, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of
the State of Maine (herein called the "Company", which term includes any
successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to, tax identification number  
, or registered assigns, the principal sum of                        on the
Maturity Date specified above and to pay interest thereon from the Original
Issue Date specified above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (or,
if the Interest Reset Dates specified above are weekly, from the day following
the most recent Regular Record Date (as defined herein)) to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for, on the Interest Payment Dates in each year
specified above and at Maturity, commencing on the first such Interest Payment
Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date (or, if the Original Issue Date is
after a Regular Record Date and before the Interest Payment Date immediately
following such Regular Record Date, on the second such Interest Payment Date
next succeeding the Original Issue Date), at a rate per annum equal to 


                                   -2-
<PAGE>   3

the Initial Interest Rate specified above until the first Interest Reset Date
following the Original Issue Date and on and after such Interest Reset Date at
the rate determined in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, until
the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The interest so
payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this
security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered (which, if this
Security is a Global Security, will be the Depository or a nominee of the
Depository) at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest, which shall be the 15th day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to
such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable at
Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable
(which, if this Security is a Global Security, will be the  Depository or a
nominee of the Depository.)  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly
provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on
such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the person in whose name
this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the
close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to the
Registered Holders of Securities of this Series not less than 10 days prior to
such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this
Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such
exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

        If an Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a date that is not
a Market Day (as defined herein), such Interest Payment Date will be the next
succeeding Market Day (or, if the interest rate basis specified above is LIBOR,
if such day falls in the next calendar month, the next preceding Market Day). 
Any payment on this Security due on any day which is not a Business Day (as
defined herein) in Boston, Massachusetts or New York, New York need not be made
on such day, but may be made on the next succeeding such Business Day with the
same force and effect as if made on such due date, and no interest shall accrue
for the period from and after such date.

        Payment of the principal, premium (if any) and interest on this
Security will be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America
as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private
debts.  Payments of interest other than interest payable at Maturity will be
made by check mailed to the registered Holder hereof at the address shown in
the Security Register or, at the option of the registered Holder hereof, by


                                  -3-

<PAGE>   4

wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account located in the
United States of America as the registered Holder hereof shall designate to the
Trustee in writing at least 15 days prior to such Interest Payment Date.

        The principal amount hereof and Interest due at Maturity will be paid
upon Maturity in immediately available funds by wire transfer against
presentation of this Security at the office or agency of The First National
Bank of Boston as Trustee and Paying Agent located at 150 Royall Street,
Canton, Massachusetts  02021, or at such office in New York, New York as the
Trustee shall designate by written notice to the registered Holder of this
Security.  The Company may treat the person in whose name this Security is
registered as the owner of this Security for the purpose of receiving payments
of principal, premium (if any) and interest on this Security and for all
purposes whatsoever.

        REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY SET
FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES
HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

                            Reverse of Security
                            -------------------

        This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or
more series under an Indenture, dated as of August 15, 1994 as supplemented by
the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 30, 1994 (herein
referred to as the "Indenture"), among the Company, XTRA Corporation, as
Guarantor (herein called a "Guarantor," which term includes any successor
Guarantor to XTRA Corporation under the Indenture), the Trustee and, as to the
First Supplemental Indenture, XTRA Missouri, Inc., as Guarantor (herein called
a "Guarantor", which term involves any successor corporation to XTRA Missouri,
Inc. under the Indenture and, together with XTRA Corporation, the
"Guarantors"), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of
the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder
of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities
and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated
and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face
hereof.

        If an Initial Redemption Date is specified on the face hereof, this
Security is subject to redemptio n upon notice by first-class mail given not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, at
any time as a whole or in part, on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if
any, specified on the face hereof, at the election of the Company, at the
Redemption Prices, if any, specified on the face hereof, (expressed in
percentages of the principal amount), and thereafter at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of this Security, plus accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, that interest installments whose Stated
Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders
of such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the
close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to on the face hereof,
all as provided in the Indenture.

        The rate of interest on this Security will be reset and become
effective weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually (each an
"Interest Reset Period"), as set forth on the face hereof depending on the
Interest Reset Period specified herein; provided, however, that (i) the
interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the first Interest
Reset Date (as defined below) will be the Initial Interest Rate, and (ii) the
interest rate in effect for the ten days immediately before Stated Maturity of
this security will be that in effect hereon on the 


                                    -5-

<PAGE>   6

tenth day preceding such Stated Maturity.  Except as provided in the next
sentence, the date or dates on  which interest will reset (each an "Interest
Reset Date") will be, if this Security resets weekly (unless the Interest Rate
Basis for this Security is the Treasury Rate), the Wednesday of each week; if
this Security resets weekly and the Interest Rate Basis for this Security is
the Treasury Rate, the Tuesday of each week (except as provided below); if this
Security resets monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; if this Security
resets quarterly, the third Wednesday of each March, June, September and
December; if this Security resets semiannually, the third Wednesday of two
months of each year, as specified herein; and if this Security resets annually,
the third Wednesday of one month of each year, as specified herein.  If any
Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Market Day for this
Security, the Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a
Market Day for this Security, except that if the Interest Rate Basis specified
herein is LIBOR and such next succeeding such Market Day is the next succeeding
calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding
Market Day for this Security.

        "Market Day" means, for any Security other than a Security the rate of
interest on which shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under
the heading "LIBOR" below, any Business Day, and, for any Security the rate of
interest on which shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under
the heading "LIBOR" below, any such Business Day on which dealings in deposits
in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. "Business Day",
means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day
on which banking institutions in Boston, Massachusetts or New York, New York
are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

        The rate of interest on this Security in effect on any day on or after
the first Interest Reset Date shall equal either (i) if such day is an Interest
Reset Date, the interest rate for such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day
is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate for the immediately preceding
Interest Reset Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the interest rate in effect for
the ten days immediately before the Stated Maturity of this Security will be
that in effect hereon on the tenth day preceding such stated Maturity.

        Except as otherwise specified in this paragraph, the rate of interest
on this security for each Interest Reset Date shall be the rate determined in
accordance with the provisions below under the heading below corresponding to
the Interest Rate Basis specified herein:

                                  -6-

<PAGE>   7

        COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is
the Commercial Paper Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date
shall equal (a) the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the
per annum rate (quoted on a bank discount basis) for the relevant Commercial
Paper Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index
Maturity specified herein, (i) as such rate is published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519),
Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of governors
of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15(519)") under the heading "Commercial
Paper" or (ii) if such rate is not published before 9:00 A.M., New York City
time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then as such rate is published by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its daily statistical release, "Composite
3:30 P.M. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities" or any successor
publication published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("Composite
Quotations") under the heading "Commercial Paper" or (b) if by 3:00 P.M. New
York City time, on such Calculation Date, such rate is not yet published in
either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the Money Market Yield of the
arithmetic mean of the offered per annum rates (quoted on a bank discount
basis) as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Interest
Determination Date, of three leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of
New York selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index
Maturity specified herein placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is
"AA", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating agency, in any of
the above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of
the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y) by the multiplication by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, specified herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if fewer
than three dealers selected as provided above by the Calculation Agent are
quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate herein for such
Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon in effect on such
Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first
Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).  "Money Market Yield" shall be
a yield (expressed an a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following
formula:

    Money Market Yield = 100 x    360 x D
                                  -------
                                  360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper, quoted on a bank
discount basis and expressed as a decimal 

                                    -7-

<PAGE>   8

and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which
the interest is being calculated.
        
        PRIME RATE.  If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the Prime
Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall equal (a)(i)
the rate for the relevant Prime Rate Interest Determination Date set forth in
H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan", or (ii) if such rate is not
published before 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation
Date, then the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by
each bank that appears on the display designated as page "NYMF" on the Reuters
Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the NYMF page on
that services for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates
of major United States banks) ("Reuters Screen NYMF Page") as such bank's prime
rate or base lending rate as in effect for such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date as quoted on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page on such Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date or (b) if fewer than four such rates appear on the
Reuters Screen NYMF Page on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the
arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates (quoted on the basis
of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year) as of the
close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major
banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent, in any of the
above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of the
Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y) by the multiplication by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, specified herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if fewer
than three banks selected as provided above by the Calculation Agent are
quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate hereon for such
Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon in effect on such Prime
Rate Interest Determination Date (or in the case of the first Interest Reset
Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

        LIBOR.  If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is LIBOR, the
interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall be determined in
accordance with the following provisions:

        (a) On the relevant LIBOR Interest Determination Date, the interest
rate will be determined on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the offered
rates for deposits of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 having the Index Maturity
specified herein, commencing on the second Market Day immediately following
such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that appear on the display designated

Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page on
that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of
major banks) ("Reuters Screen LIBO Page") as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on
such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, if at least two such offered rates
appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, adjusted (x) by the addition or 
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y) by the
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified herein.  If fewer
than two offered rates appear, the interest rate hereon for such LIBOR Interest
Reset Date will be determined as described in (b) below.

        (b) For a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which fewer than two
offered rates for the Index Maturity specified herein appear on the Reuters
Screen LIBO Page as described in (a) above, the interest rate hereon will be
determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time,
on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars for
the period of the Index Maturity specified herein are offered to prime banks in
the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market
selected by the Calculation Agent commencing on the second Market Day
immediately following such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal
amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that in the
Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a single transaction in such
market at such time (a "Representative Amount").  The Calculation Agent will
request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a
quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, the
interest rate hereon with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations, as adjusted (x) by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y) by the
multiplication by the Spread multiplier, if any, specified herein.  If fewer
than two quotations are provided, the interest rate hereon for such Interest
Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately
11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by
three major banks in The City of New York, selected by the Calculation Agent,
for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having the Index Maturity
specified herein commencing on the Interest Reset Date and in a Representative
Amount, as adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any,
specified herein, and then (y) by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier,
if any, specified herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if fewer than three banks
selected as provided

above by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the
interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Date will be the interest
rate hereon in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date (or, in the
case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

        TREASURY RATE.  If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the
Treasury Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall equal
(a) the rate for the auction on the relevant Treasury Interest Determination
Date of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the
Index Maturity specified herein, (i) as such rate is published in H.15(519)
under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction Average
(Investment)" or (ii) if such rate is not so published by 9:00 A.M., New York
City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the auction average rate
(expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
applicable, and applied on a daily basis) for such auction as otherwise
announced by the United States Department of the Treasury or (b) if the results
of such auction of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity specified herein
are not published or reported as provided above by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on such Calculation Date or if no such auction is held during such week,
then the rate set forth in H.15(519) for the relevant Treasury Interest
Determination Date for the Index Maturity specified herein under the heading
"U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market" or (c) if such
rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant
Calculation Date, then the yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent,
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a
daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates as of
approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury Interest
Determination Date, of three primary United States government securities
dealers in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for the issue
of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity
specified herein, in any of the above cases (a), (b) or (c) as adjusted (x) by
the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then
(y) by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified herein;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if fewer than three dealers selected as provided above
by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the
interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate
hereon in effect on such Treasury Interest Determination Date (or, in 


                                 -10-
<PAGE>   11

the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

CD RATE.  If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the CD Rate,
the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall equal (a) the rate
for the relevant CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable
certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified herein (i) as
published in H.15(519) under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)" or (ii) if
such rate is not published before 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the
relevant Calculation Date, then the rate on such CD Rate Interest Determination
Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified
herein as published in Composite Quotations under the heading "Certificates of
Deposit", or (b) if by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date
such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the
arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates, as of 10:00 A.M., New
York City time, on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading
nonbank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City
of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable certificates of
deposit of major United States money center banks with a remaining maturity
closest to the Index Maturity specified herein in a denomination of U.S.
$5,000,000, in any of the above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by the
addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y)
by the multiplication by the spread multiplier, if any, specified herein;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if fewer than three dealers selected as provided above
by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the
interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate
hereon in effect on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date (or, in the case
of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.  If the Interest Rate Basis of this security is the Federal
Funds Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall equal
(a) the rate on the relevant Federal Funds Interest Determination Date for
Federal Funds (i) as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds
(Effective)" or (ii) if such rate is not published before 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the rate on such Federal
Funds Interest Determination Date as published in Composite Quotations under
the heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate" or (b) if by 3:00 p.m., New York
City time, on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either


                                  -11-
<PAGE>   12

    H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the arithmetic mean of the rates, as of
    9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Interest Determination
    Date, for the last transaction in overnight Federal Funds arranged by three
    leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in The City of New York
    selected by the Calculation Agent, in any of the above cases (a) or (b) as
    adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any,
    specified herein, and then (y) by the multiplication by the Spread
    Multiplier, if any, specified herein;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if
    fewer than three brokers selected as provided above by the Calculation
    Agent are quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate hereon
    for such Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon in effect on
    such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the
    first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).
        
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater
than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate,
if any, specified herein. In addition, the interest rate hereon will in no
event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
        
        The Company will at all times appoint and maintain a banking
institution that is not an Affiliate of the Company as Calculation Agent
hereunder.  The Company has initially appointed The First National Bank of
Boston as such Calculation Agent and will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of any change in such appointment.  The Company will cause the
Calculation Agent to calculate the interest rate on this Security for any
Interest Reset Date in accordance with the foregoing on or before the
Calculation Date pertaining to the related Interest Determination Date.  Except
as otherwise provided herein, all percentages resulting from any calculations
will be rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next higher one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (e.g., 9.876541% (or .09876541) being
rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or
resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with
one-half cent being rounded upwards).  The Calculation Agent's determination of
any interest rate will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.

        Upon the request of the Holder of this Security, the Company will cause
the Calculation Agent to provide to such Holder the interest rate hereon then
in effect and, if determined, the interest rate hereon which will become
effective on the next Interest Reset Date.

                                 -12-
<PAGE>   13

        The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date if
the rate of interest hereon shall be determined in accordance with the
provisions under the headings above entitled "Commercial Paper Rate" (the
"Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date"), "Prime Rate" (the "Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date"), "LIBOR" (the "LIBOR Interest Determination
Date"), "CD Rate" (the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date") and "Federal
Funds Rate" (the "Federal Funds Interest Determination Date") will be the
second Market Day preceding such Interest Reset Date.  The Interest
Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date if the rate of interest
hereon shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under the heading
above entitled "Treasury Rate" (the "Treasury Interest Determination Date")
will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which
Treasury bills would normally be auctioned.  If, as the result of a legal
holiday, an auction is held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the
Treasury Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date
occurring in the next succeeding week.  If an auction date shall fall on any
Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Security, then such Interest Reset Date
shall instead be the first Market Day immediately following such auction date.

        The Calculation Date pertaining to any LIBOR Interest Determination
Date for any Security shall be such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, and the
Calculation Date pertaining to any other Interest Determination Date for any
Security shall be the tenth day after such Interest Determination Date or, if
any such day is not a Market Day for such Security, the next succeeding such
Market Day.

        Payments of interest hereon with respect to any Interest Payment date
will include interest accrued to but excluding such Interest Payment Date;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the Interest Reset Period with respect to this
Security is weekly, the interest payable on any Interest Payment Date, other
than interest payable on the date on which principal is payable, will include
interest accrued to but excluding the day following the next preceding Regular
Record Date.

        Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from the last
date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for is calculated by
multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest
factor.  Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor
calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date, or from the last date to
which interest has been paid or duly provided for, but excluding the date for
which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest 


                                 -13-
<PAGE>   14

factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day is computed by dividing the
interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such day by 360 or, if the 
Interest Rate Basis for this Security is the Treasury Rate, by the actual
number of days in the year.

        In any case where any Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity of
the principal of this Security shall not be a Business Day, then
(notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of the Indenture) the payment of
interest and/or of principal need not be made on such date, but may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on
such Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity, and no interest shall
accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest
Payment Date or Stated Maturity to such next succeeding Business Day.

        If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the securities of this series
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Indenture.

        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the Guarantors and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of
each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the
Guarantors and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of 66 2/3% in
principal amount of all Outstanding Securities at the time and of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be
affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of
specified percentages in principal amount of all the Securities and the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of
all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company, the
Guarantors, or both with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefore or in lieu
hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

        No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium (if any) and
interest on this Security at 

                                 -14-

the times, place and rate (except as provided for in such Security), and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.
        
        As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
(including, in the case of any Global Security, certain additional limitations)
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of such Securities for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium
(if any) and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities
of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

        The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering
the same.

        No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Guarantors or the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the
Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security
be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee nor any such
Agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

        All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

        This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York.

In case of the failure of XTRA, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of

failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or such Indenture, or any
waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto,
by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee or any other circumstance which
may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or

      For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, "earnings" represents income 
      from operations before taxes plus fixed charges. "Fixed charges" for operations consist of     
      interest on indebtedness and the portion of rental expense which represents interest.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations 
for the Three Years Ended September 30, 1994
(Not covered by Report of Independent Public Accountants)

           XTRA Corporation leases transportation equipment. Its utilization
           and lease rates, and hence profitability, are directly impacted by
           the level of domestic economic activity, the supply of and demand
           for available equipment and other factors in the freight
           transportation industry. The discussion and data below are presented
           on a consolidated basis.

                The Company's pretax profits are  cyclical, principally due to
           the variability of the Company's  revenues and the high percentage of
           fixed costs. To moderate  this cyclicality, the Company maintains a
           balance between the  amount of equipment leased on a per diem and
           term basis and  maintains an appropriate mix of various types of 
           transportation equipment available for lease. The Company  also
           maintains a high proportion of its debt at fixed rates  to reduce the
           impact of fluctuations in interest rates. At  September 30, 1994,
           approximately 14% of its debt had  floating rates  compared to 1% at
           September 30, 1993.

           Revenues
           Revenues increased by 63% from $203 million  in 1992 to $329 million 
           in 1993 due mainly to the significant  increase in fleet size
           resulting from the Strick Lease acquisition completed in October,
           1992. Revenues increased by 8% or $26 million in 1994, due mainly to
           an increase in working units primarily as a result of increased
           overall equipment utilization. 

                Revenues are generated by two divisions; XTRALease, which
           primarily leases over-the-road trailers and mobile storage trailers
           and XTRAIntermodal, which leases intermodal trailers, chassis and
           domestic containers for the intermodal movement of freight. 
           Revenues are a function of lease rates and working units; the 
           latter depends on fleet size and equipment utilization. For 
           information regarding revenues attributable to each division, see
           Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
           following table sets forth, for each division, average utilization
           and average fleet size in units (including units leased in under
           operating leases) during the last three years.

</TABLE>
                Utilization, representing the ratio of revenue-earning units to
           the total fleet, is derived from billing information, usage reports
           and other information from customers, assumptions based on
           historical experience and equipment inventories taken at Company
           depots, and is an approximation. Equipment utilization is directly 
           affected by the supply of available equipment as well as the volume
           of domestic freight shipments, particularly in the automotive and
           construction industries, which are believed to be major sources of
           freight.

                Revenues derived from over-the-road trailers accounted for 90%,
           91% and 92% of XTRALease revenues in 1992, 1993 and 1994,
           respectively. XTRALease revenues increased $104 million in 1993,
           primarily due to an increase in working units; the result of a
           significantly larger fleet and higher equipment utilization. The
           acquisition of Strick Lease resulted in the addition of
           approximately 38,000 units to the XTRALease rental fleet (see Note 2
           of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). XTRALease
           revenues increased by 11% or $21 million in 1994, primarily due to
           an increase in working units as a result of increased demand for the
           Company's equipment. 

                Revenues derived from intermodal trailers accounted for
           81%, 78% and 78% of XTRA Intermodal's revenues in 1992, 1993 and
           1994, respectively, with the balance being domestic containers and
           chassis revenues.  XTRAIntermodal revenues increased by 20% or $23
           million in 1993, due principally to an increase in working units as
           a result of higher equipment utilization as well as a larger chassis
           fleet. The acquisition of Strick Lease resulted in  the addition of
           approximately 4,000 intermodal trailers and  8,700 chassis to the
           XTRAIntermodal fleet. The Company's average intermodal trailer fleet
           size, including the trailers acquired from Strick Lease, decreased
           slightly from the prior year. XTRAIntermodal revenues increased 4%
           or $5 million in 1994, primarily due to an increase in average lease
           rates.

           Operating Expenses

                Depreciation expense increased 66% or $37 million in 1993
           primarily due to a net increase in the Company's overall average
           fleet size of approximately 43,100  units primarily as a result of
           acquiring the Strick Lease fleet. In 1994, depreciation expense
           increased by 4% or $3 million primarily due to new additions to the
           fleet and the  purchase of previously leased-in equipment. 

                Rental equipment lease financing increased 40% or $4 million in
           1993 due to the assumption of certain lease obligations as part of
           the Strick Lease  acquisition. In 1994, rental equipment lease
           financing decreased 52% or $8 million primarily due to the purchase
           of equipment previously leased-in. 

                Rental equipment operating expense increased 49% or $25 million
           in 1993 primarily due to higher expenses related to the operation of
           a significantly larger fleet from more branch locations. In
           1994, rental equipment operating expense increased by 12% or $10
           million primarily  due to higher repair and maintenance, tire and
           facility costs related to higher equipment utilization as well as a
           larger working fleet. 

                Selling and administrative expenses  increased 79% or $14
           million in 1993 primarily due to higher  costs related to the
           operation of a larger business and the addition of Strick Lease
           headquarters costs for accounting and administrative functions. In
           April 1993, all Strick Lease accounting and administrative functions
           were consolidated in the XTRALease home office (St. Louis),
           which resulted in some reduction in selling and  administrative
           expenses in the second half of 1993. In 1994, selling and
           administrative expense decreased 2% or $1 million primarily due to
           cost savings realized from completing the integration of the Strick
           Lease business.

           Interest Expense
<TABLE>
                Interest expense is a function of the amount of net debt
           outstanding (long-term debt less cash) and average interest rates.
           The following table shows total average net debt outstanding and
           interest expense as a percentage of total average net debt
           outstanding.

</TABLE>

                Interest expense increased by 84% or $18 million in 1993
           primarily due to an increase in the average amount of outstanding
           debt and an increase in the average interest rate, both due to debt
           assumed in connection with the Strick Lease acquisition. In 1994,
           interest expense decreased 13% or $5 million primarily due to a
           decrease in average net debt outstanding.

           Income Before Provision for Income Taxes

                Pretax earnings increased 63% or $28 million in 1993 primarily
           due to increased demand for the Company's equipment which resulted
           in higher utilization, a larger fleet size and synergies from
           combining two large over-the-road leasing businesses. In 1994,
           pretax earnings increased 36% or $26 million due primarily to higher 
           equipment utilization as well as reduced interest expense.

           Provision for Income Taxes

                The Company's effective income tax rate was approximately 48%
           in fiscal 1993. The increase in the effective income tax rate from
           1992's effective tax rate of 39% was primarily due to the enactment
           in August, 1993, of the Revenue Reconciliation Bill of 1993 which
           raised the corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1,
           1993.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 
           109") requires adjusting deferred tax liabilities and assets to
           reflect the higher rate. Accordingly, the Company recorded an
           additional tax expense of approximately $5 million or $.31 per
           share, related to prior year's accumulated deferred income tax
           assets and liabilities. Absent the required adjustment for prior
           years, the effective income tax rate for 1993 would have been
           approximately 41%. The Company's effective income tax rate was
           approximately 42% in fiscal 1994.

                For additional information regarding the provision for income
           taxes, see Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
           Statements.

           FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

                Significant capital investment is required by the Company's
           leasing operations, not only for growth but also for replacement of
           units retired from service. However, during periods of slower
           economic growth capital expenditures may be curtailed until demand
           for transportation equipment increases.

<TABLE>

                The following table sets forth the capital expenditures by
           equipment type, including units purchased, units leased-in from
           third parties under operating leases and units acquired for 1992,
           1993 and 1994, as well as the Company's committed capital
           expenditures for 1995 as of November 15, 1994.

                The Company recognizes the importance of managing capital
           spending as an essential ingredient in maintaining the quality of
           its fleet. The Company grows its fleet by purchasing new equipment
           and fleets of used equipment. Capital expenditures increased from 
           $37 million in 1992 to $410 million in 1993, including  equipment
           acquired in the Strick Lease acquisition. In 1994, capital
           expenditures were $236 million, including acquisitions (see Note 2
           of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company
           continued the significant level of capital spending in 1994 in order
           to respond to increased market demand, replace retired units and
           improve fleet quality. As of November 15, 1994, XTRA's committed 
           capital expenditures for 1995 amounted to $180 million. The  Company
           has also placed cancelable orders for an additional  $84 million of
           equipment in 1995. The Company may increase capital spending in 1995
           as conditions warrant. 

                Although some level of future capital spending can be financed
           internally, the ability to fund expenditures above that level will
           depend upon the availability of external financing.

                During the three years ended September 30, 1994, the Company
           generated $567 million of cash flow from operations and raised $63
           million from the sale of common stock. During this same period,
           XTRAinvested $679 million in property and equipment including 
           acquisitions, paid dividends of $29 million and increased net debt
           (debt less cash) outstanding by $78 million.

                In addition to cash flow from operations, XTRA generally has
           available to it a variety of external means to finance any future
           growth of its leasing equipment fleet. The Company's external
           financing options include a combination of revolving credit
           agreements, medium-term and long-term borrowings in the public debt 
           market, intermediate term bank loans, long-term financing  from
           institutional investors and banks and lease financing.  The Company
           has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission $500
           million of securities consisting of shares of Preferred Stock and
           Common Stock of the Company and Senior and Subordinated Debt
           Securities of XTRA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, fully and
           unconditionally guaranteed by XTRACorporation and XTRA Missouri,
           Inc. (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) of
           which XTRA Inc. has issued $53 million of its Medium-term Notes as
           of November 15, 1994. The Company's access to external financing 
           will depend upon prevailing market conditions and the  Company's
           credit ratings. There can be no assurance that the  Company will be
           able to borrow funds in those markets at  attractive rates or with
           covenants that are not more restrictive than the Company's current
           debt covenants. The Company also has potential access to external
           funds through the issuance of capital stock. XTRA deems its sources
           of financing adequate to meet projected needs. At November 15, 1994
           the Company had $92 million of unused credit available under its two
           Revolving Credit agreements.

                The Company's source of funds for the payment of dividends on
           its capital stock are advances and dividends from its direct and
           indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including XTRA, Inc. Several of
           the Company's loan agreements contain covenants that restrict the
           payment of cash dividends by the Company. In addition, certain loan 
           agreements contain covenants that restrict advances to and the
           payment of dividends to the Company by its subsidiaries, including
           XTRA Missouri, Inc. and XTRA, Inc. Under the most restrictive
           provisions of the Company's loan agreements, the amount of cash
           dividends which could be paid on the Company's capital stock was
           limited to $127 million at September 30, 1994. XTRA, Inc.'s primary
           sources of funds are cash flows from operations and advances from
           its subsidiaries. For additional information regarding long-term
           debt, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to Consolidated                 XTRA Corporation
Financial Statements                  and Subsidiaries


(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
                Principles of Consolidation
                The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
                XTRACorporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("the
                Company"). All material intercompany accounts and transactions
                have been eliminated. In fiscal 1994, the Company adopted a
                non-classified balance sheet format in which no distinction is
                made between current and long-term assets and liabilities.
                Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
                reclassified to be consistent with the current year's
                presentation.

                Income Taxes
                Provisions for income taxes recognize the tax effect of all
                revenue and expense transactions as well as any  change during
                the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effects
                of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax assets and
                liabilities are reflected in net income in the period in which
                such changes are enacted (See Note 5).  
                        The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
                effective as of October 1, 1991. SFAS 109 requires recognition
                of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
                tax consequences of events that have been included in the
                financial statements or tax returns. There was no material
                effect on the Company's financial statements due to the
                adoption of this statement.

                Leases
                The Company records the majority of its leases using the
                operating method of accounting. Full-payout or near
                full-payout leases are accounted for under the finance method.

                Depreciation
                The Company provides for depreciation by using the straight-line
                method to amortize the cost of property and equipment to its
                estimated residual value over its estimated useful life.
                Revenue equipment is depreciated using estimated useful lives
                of 10 to 20 years.

                        When equipment is sold or retired, its cost and
                accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet,
                and any gain or loss is included in revenues.  Revenue equipment
                with an original cost of approximately $74.5 million, which has
                reached the end of its estimated useful life, remains in
                service and is included in Revenue Equipment at September 30,
                1994.

                Repair and Maintenance
                Repair and maintenance expenses are charged to operating
                expenses when incurred and amounted to $16 million, $23 million
                and $27 million in 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively.
        
                Earnings per Share
                The computation of primary earnings per common share is based on
                net income after deduction of $1.9375 Series B Preferred Stock
                dividends and dividends on and accretion of issuance costs of
                Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock,
                divided by the weighted average number of outstanding common
                shares plus common share equivalents. Fully diluted earnings
                per share also assumes the conversion of the $1.9375 Series B 
                Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock at the beginning of  the
                period. Earnings per share have been calculated giving 
                retroactive effect to the two-for-one stock split (see Note 9).

                Foreign Currency Translation
                The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign
                subsidiary at the exchange rates in effect at year-end.
                Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange
                rates in effect during the year. Gains and losses from foreign
                currency translation are credited or charged to cumulative
                translation adjustment included in stockholders' equity in the
                accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains and losses from
                foreign currency transactions are included in selling and
                administrative expense.

(2) Acquisitions

                In October, 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of
                Distribution International Corporation ("D.I.") and certain
                subsidiaries, primarily Strick Lease, with total assets of
                approximately $350 million for approximately $114 million in    
                cash (excluding cash assumed), and the assumption of    
                approximately $236 million in debt. The cash payment includes
                $12 million to key Strick Lease personnel for covenants not to  
                compete. The transaction, which was accounted for as a purchase,
                was partially financed through the issuance of $30 million of
                Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock (see
                Note 10). The balance was funded by Revolving Credit Agreement
                borrowings. Strick Lease, a major lessor of transportation
                equipment, operated a rental fleet of approximately 50,000 units
                of transportation equipment, primarily over-the-road trailers
                and chassis.

</TABLE>
                
                        On April 1, 1994, the Company acquired the assets of
                Dykes Trailer Rentals, Inc., for approximately $4 million. On
                June 10, 1994, the Company purchased substantially all of the
                assets of Caravan Trailer Rental Co., Ltd., a Canadian lessor
                of transportation equipment for $37 million. On July 29, 1994,
                the Company acquired the assets of Integrated Transportation
                Services. Ltd., for approximately $5 million. The total rental
                fleets acquired in these three transactions amounted to
                approximately 6,000 units of transportation equipment,
                primarily over-the-road trailers. 

(3) Equipment Leases

                        The Company uses the operating method of accounting for
                the majority of its equipment leases. Under this method,
                revenue is recognized in the month earned based on the terms of
                the lease contract, and the equipment is depreciated to its
                estimated residual value over its estimated useful life.

                        The finance method of accounting is used for revenue
                equipment leased to customers on a full-payout or near
                full-payout basis at lease inception.  Under this method,
                finance lease income, the difference between the total lease
                receivable and the net book value less the residual value of
                the related equipment, is deferred and amortized as revenue
                over the lease term using the interest method, which provides a
                level rate of return on the net investment in the lease.

<TABLE>
                        The following schedule summarizes the future minimum

</TABLE>

                        The Company has two unsecured revolving credit
                agreements, each with commitments of $90 million at September
                30, 1994.  The Revolving Credit Agreements have revolving period
                maturity dates of December, 1995 and May, 1996 with pricing
                dependent on the Company's credit ratings. Both revolving
                credit agreements have current pricing of 1/2% over the London
                Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company currently pays 1/5%
                on any unused commitment in each facility.
                        Unless the Company requests and the banks approve a
                renewal or extension of these agreements, borrowings
                outstanding on the revolving period maturity dates will be
                converted to five year term loans payable in 20 equal quarterly
                installments. If converted, the facilities have final term
                maturities of December, 2000 and May, 2001. Given the Company's
                current credit ratings, the Company would borrow at 7/10% above
                LIBOR during the term loan period of each facility.
                        The Company borrows on a short-term basis by issuing
                commercial paper and using several uncommitted lines of credit.
                These short-term borrowing options are back stopped by the
                unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit 
                Agreements, and hence have been classified as Revolving Credit
                Agreement borrowings.  Revolving credit borrowings at September
                30, 1993 and 1994 include $95 million and $126 million of such
                short-term borrowings, respectively. The weighted average
                interest rates incurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement,
                including short-term borrowings during 1992, 1993 and 1994,
                were 4.9%, 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively.
                        During the three years ended September 30, 1994, the
                Company issued $164 million of Medium-term Notes under shelf
                registrations filed with the Securities and Exchange
                Commission, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.7% and
                maturities extending through 2003.  Under the present shelf
                registrations, $447 million remains available for additional
                financing. The weighted average interest rates incurred during
                1992, 1993 and 1994 were 8.6%, 8.2% and 7.9%, respectively.

                        Capital lease obligations have a weighted average
                interest rate of 8.4% and are payable in installments through
                2001. The weighted average interest rates incurred under
                capital lease obligations during 1992, 1993 and 1994 were 8.3%,
                8.5% and 8.3%, respectively.

                        Secured term loans have a weighted average interest
                rate of 11.2% and are payable in installments through 2000. The
                weighted average interest rates incurred under secured term
                loans during 1992, 1993 and 1994 were 14.2%, 10.1% and 11.7%,
                respectively.

                        In connection with the acquisition of the Strick Lease
                business (see Note 2), the Company issued 300 shares of Series
                C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock with a $30
                million redemption value, a dividend rate of 10%, and a final
                maturity date of five years. On October 1, 1993, the Company
                exchanged the outstanding shares for subordinated debt with a
                coupon of 10%. This subordinated debt was redeemed on September
                30, 1994.

                        As of September 30, 1992, 1993 and 1994, 29%, 1% and
                14%, respectively, of the Company's debt was at floating
                interest rates. The Company has three interest rate swaps with
                notional amounts totalling $66 million which have been entered
                into to effectively fix the interest rate on that amount of
                floating rate debt. Floating rate debt which has been fixed
                through interest rate swaps is treated as fixed rate debt. The
                agreements provide for the Company to exchange floating rate
                interest payments based on LIBOR for a fixed rate of 8.1% on
                $25 million through March 1995, for 7.5% on $16 million through
                October 1995 and for 8.5% on $25 million through July 1996. The
                net interest settlements are recorded as an adjustment to
                interest expense. The Company is exposed to market risk in the
                event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  Nonperformance
                by the counterparties is not anticipated nor would it have a
                material adverse effect on the  results of operations or the
                financial position of the Company.
                        The Company's several loan agreements contain a minimum
                debt service test, minimum working capital requirements and
                various restrictive covenants including, among other things,
                restrictions on incurring both short-term and long-term debt
                and a limitation on secured borrowings. Several of the
                Company's loan agreements contain covenants that restrict the
                payment of cash dividends by the Company. In addition, certain
                loan agreements contain covenants that restrict advances to and
                the payment of dividends to the Company by its subsidiaries,
                including XTRAMissouri, Inc. and XTRA, Inc. Under the most
                restrictive provisions of the Company's loan agreements, the
                amount of cash dividends which could be paid on the Company's
                capital stock was limited to $127 million at September 30,
                1994.

                        The provision differs from income taxes currently
                payable because certain items of income and expense are
                recognized in different periods for financial statement
                purposes than for tax return purposes.  The reasons for the
                difference between the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rates
                and the  Company's effective income tax rates for 1992, 1993 and
                1994 are as follows:

                        The increase in the effective income tax rate from 1992
                to 1993 was primarily due to the enactment, in August, 1993, of
                the Revenue Reconciliation Bill of 1993 which raised the
                corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993.
                The statutory federal tax rate in fiscal 1993 was 34.8%.
                Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS
                109") requires restating deferred tax liabilities and assets to
                reflect the higher rate.  Accordingly in fiscal 1993, the
                Company recorded additional tax expense of approximately $5.0
                million. Absent the required adjustment for prior years, the
                effective income tax  rate for 1993 would have been
                approximately 41%.

                carryforwards and $1 million of alternative minimum tax credit
                carryforwards available to reduce future federal income tax
                liabilities. The investment tax credit carryforwards expire
                beginning in 1999. The benefit of both tax credit carryforwards
                has been recorded in the Company's financial statements. The
                Company has not recognized a valuation allowance for deferred
                tax assets.

                respectively. Other rental expense amounted to $2 million, $4
                million and $4 million in 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively.

                        As of November 15, 1994, the Company was committed to
                make capital expenditures of $180 million, principally for
                revenue equipment in fiscal 1995. The Company has also placed
                cancelable orders for an additional $84 million of equipment in
                1995.

                        A subsidiary of the Company has joined a group of other
                parties working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural
                Resources ("WDNR") on the remediation of environmental problems
                at the Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site in Edgerton,
                Wisconsin and provision of an alternative water supply to
                affected residences in the area of the site. The subsidiary has
                also joined another group of parties working with the WDNR with
                regard to an adjacent manufacturing facility owned by the 
                subsidiary prior to 1978. The Company is unable at this time to
                predict with any certainty the ultimate remediation costs 
                associated with these sites or with provision of an alternative
                water supply, or the Company's share of any such costs. Based
                on preliminary estimates received from technical consultants
                for the Company and other similarly situated parties, the
                Company believes that its share of any future costs for
                remediation of both sites and provision of an alternative water
                supply will not be material to the results of operations, the
                financial condition or the liquidity of the Company, without
                consideration of any potential insurance recoveries or
                recoveries from the prior owner of the manufacturing facility
                or the owner/operator of the Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill
                site.

(7) Retirement Plans
                        The Company provides retirement benefits to 
                substantially all of its employees through a qualified and 
                funded defined contribution retirement plan. The Company's 
                yearly cash contributions to a trust fund are discretionary and
                the retirement trust fund's assets are administered by a 
                trustee. The Company adopted a voluntary 401(k) savings plan on
                October 1, 1993. Matching Company contributions to the 401(k)
                plan are based on a specified percentage of employee 
                contributions. Participants are entitled to their vested 
                portion of the retirement trust fund assets upon termination of
                employment. The Company recorded defined contribution pension
                expense of approximately $1 million, $2 million and $2 million
                in 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively.  The Company has no other
                significant post employment or post retirement benefit
                obligations.

(8) Business Information
                        The Company is engaged in transportation equipment
                leasing. Its two primary leasing divisions are XTRA Lease and
                XTRAIntermodal. The Company's equipment is leased to a variety
                of customers including private fleet owners, contract and
                common carriers, railroads and steamship lines.  The Atchison,
                Topeka, Santa Fe Railway accounted for 11% of the Company's
                consolidated revenues in 1992. No other customer accounted for
                10% or more of revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.

(9) Common Stock
                Stock Split

                In May 1993, the Company effected a two-for-one common
                stock split in the form of a 100% stock  dividend. All
                references to the number of shares and per common share amounts
                have been restated to reflect the split.

                Issuance of Common Stock
                During fiscal 1993, the Company issued 1,495,000 shares of 
                common stock at $44.75 per share. The net proceeds to the 
                Company were approximately $63 million.

                1987 Stock Incentive Plan
                In January 1988, the stockholders approved the 1987 Stock
                Incentive Plan, authorizing the issuance of 500,000 shares of
                common stock under the plan. The plan enables the Company to
                grant awards to key employees including restricted stock
                awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, subject
                primarily to the requirement of continuing employment. The
                awards described in this plan are available for grant over a
                period of ten years from the date on which the plan was
                adopted, but grants may vest beyond the ten year period. Stock
                options issued by the Company are exercisable at a future time
                as specified by the Company and generally expire from five to
                ten years from the date of  grant. The exercise price of stock
                options may not be less than the fair market value of the
                common stock at the date of grant. 
                        Restricted stock awards have also been granted under the
                plan.  These awards are without cost to the grantee and are
                accompanied by a cash award at the time of vesting sufficient to
                offset the expected Federal, state and local ordinary income
                taxes of participants resulting from the vesting of awards under
                the plan. Of the 212,600 shares awarded, 90,418 shares have been
                forfeited while the remaining shares have all vested, including
                12,264 in 1994. 
                        As of September 30, 1994, 30,782 shares were available
                for future grants under the 1987 Stock Incentive Plan.
                        The following summarizes the transactions pursuant to
                the Company's 1987 Stock Incentive  Plan for the three-year
                period ended September 30, 1994:

                1990 Stock Option Agreement

                In July 1990, the Company granted one employee two options to
                purchase an aggregate of 80,000 shares of common stock with
                exercise prices of $10.89 to $16.00. One-third of the
                shares subject to each option vested and became exercisable on
                each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the
                agreement. These options are now all exercisable and expire
                five years from the grant date. In July 1991, one of the 
                options was amended to change the option price from $16.00 to 
                $11.50. In May, 1994, options to purchase 30,000 shares were 
                exercised at an option price of $11.50 per share. As of 
                September 30, 1994, options to  purchase 50,000 shares  at
                $10.89 per share are outstanding.

                1991 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors

                In January 1992, stockholders approved the 1991 Stock Option
                Plan for Non-Employee Directors, authorizing the granting of
                options for a maximum of 50,000 shares. The option price per
                share is equal to the fair market value of the common   stock
                on the date of grant. The term of each option is five years,
                and options become exercisable one year after the date of
                grant.

                The XTRACorporation Deferred Director Fee Option Plan
                In January 1994, stockholders approved the Deferred
                Director Fee Option Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, a
                non-employee director may elect to receive, in lieu of his
                annual retainer fee and/or board and committee meeting fees
                (the "fees"), a non-qualified stock option covering an amount
                of shares determined by dividing the fees by 50% of the fair
                market value of the shares at the time the options are awarded.
                At September 30, 1994 there were outstanding options to
                purchase 1,484 shares of common stock at an option price of
                $24.25.

(10) Preferred Stock 
                $1.9375 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
                On December 29, 1992, the Company issued 3,604,150
                shares of its Common Stock $.50 par value per share, upon
                conversion of 2,494,222 shares of its $1.9375 Series B
                Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. A total of 3,778 shares
                of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock were not
                converted and were redeemed. Also, 5,458 shares of Common
                Stock, which would have been issued had these 3,778 shares of
                Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock been converted,
                were sold to a standby underwriter. As a result of the above
                transactions, a total of 3,609,608 new shares of Common Stock
                were issued pursuant to the Company's call for redemption which
                expired on December 28, 1992.

                Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock 
                In connection with the acquisition of the Strick Lease
                business (see Note 2), the Company issued 300 shares of Series
                C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock with a $30
                million redemption value, a dividend rate of 10% and a final
                maturity date of five years.  On October 1, 1993, the Company
                exchanged the outstanding shares for subordinated debt with a
                coupon of 10% (see Note 4). This subordinated debt was redeemed 
                September 30, 1994.

(11) Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
                The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
                the fair value of each class of financial instrument:

                Cash and Short-term Investments
                The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the 
                short maturity of those instruments.

                Long-term Debt and Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock
                The fair value of the Company's fixed rate 
                long-term debt and redeemable exchangeable preferred stock is 
                estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or 
                similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company 
                for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of 
                the Company's floating rate debt is its carrying amount.

                Interest Rate Swap Agreements
                The fair value of interest rate swaps (used for hedging 
                purposes) is the estimated amount that the Company would pay 
                to terminate the swap agreements taking into account interest 
                rates and the credit-worthiness of the swap counterparties.

Report of Independent Public Accountants


                To the Stockholders of XTRA Corporation:


                We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
                XTRA Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as
                of September 30, 1993 and 1994, and the related consolidated
                statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
                each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1994.
                These financial statements and the schedules referred to below
                are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
                responsibility is to express an opinion on these  financial
                statements based on our audits.
                        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
                accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
                plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
                whether the financial statements are free of material
                misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
                evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
                financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
                accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
                management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
                statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
                reasonable basis for our opinion.
                        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
                above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
                position of XTRA Corporation and subsidiaries as of September
                30, 1993 and 1994, and the results of their operations and
                their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
                ending September 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
                accepted accounting principles.
                        Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an
                opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. 
                The schedules listed in the index to financial statements are
                presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
                Exchange Commission's rules and are not a required part of the
                basic financial statements. These schedules have been subjected
                to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic
                financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated, in
                all material respects, in relation to the basic financial
                statements taken as a whole.
