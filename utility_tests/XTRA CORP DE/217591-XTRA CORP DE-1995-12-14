PART I.

Item 1. Business

               XTRA Corporation (the "Company" or "XTRA") leases, primarily on
               an operating basis, freight transportation equipment including
               over-the-road trailers, marine containers, intermodal trailers,
               chassis, domestic containers and older trailers for mobile
               storage use. XTRA leases equipment in North America, 
               predominantly within the United States, to private fleet owners,
               contract and common carriers and railroads, as well as to steam-
               ship lines worldwide in order to cover cyclical, seasonal and 
               geographical shortages and as a substitute for purchasing 
               equipment. The choice of equipment used, whether that choice is
               made by shipper, transportation company or shipping agent, is 
               primarily influenced by lease rates, terms, availability, 
               condition and size of equipment, as well as other factors 
               related to the freight transportation industry.

                  XTRA's equipment utilization and lease rates, and hence
               profitability, are directly impacted by the level of economic
               activity in North America, world trade activity, the supply of
               and demand for available equipment, the actions of its
               competitors and other factors in the freight transportation
               industry. The Company's equipment utilization and hence its
               profitability is usually seasonally lower in its second and third
               fiscal quarters than in its first and fourth fiscal quarters. In
               general, the Company's receivable collection experience has been
               good. However, industry downturns tend to lengthen the collection
               period of certain receivables.

                  On June 30, 1995, the Company acquired certain net assets,
               primarily a marine container fleet of approximately 170,000
               twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) from Matson Leasing Company,
               Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin,
               Inc., for total consideration of approximately $360 million.

               Lease Types and Rates

               The Company leases its equipment on a per diem and a term basis.
               Per diem leases are signed for an initial period of one year or
               less and allow the customer to return the equipment without
               notice, although some per diem leases limit the amount and
               locations of equipment termination. Term leases provide for an
               initial period of one year or greater; generally one to five
               years. Lease rates depend upon the type of lease, length of term,
               maintenance provided and the type and age of the equipment.
               Generally, customers are responsible for damage to the equipment
               except for ordinary maintenance, although full-service leases are
               available on some equipment types.

               Leasing Fleet

               The Company's leasing fleet has grown through acquisitions of
               competitors and through purchases of new equipment. The new
               equipment, supplied by a number of manufacturers, is built to the
               Company's specifications and reflects industry standards and
               customers needs. The Company's leasing fleet consisted of the
               following units at the end of its last five fiscal years:

                  (1) The Company's fleet size and approximate net investment
                    includes equipment owned by the Company, equipment leased-in
                    from third parties under operating and capital leases and
                    equipment leased to third parties under finance leases. For
                    purposes of this presentation, the net investment in
                    equipment leased to the Company on an operating basis
                    represents the present value of the remaining lease
                    payments. The net investment in revenue equipment leased to
                    customers under finance leases as well as equipment owned by
                    the Company or leased to the

                    Company under capital leases represents the net carrying
                    value of this equipment. The significant increases in fleet
                    size in 1993 and 1995 were primarily due to acquisitions.
                    See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                    for information relating to these acquisitions.

               For information regarding business information by geographic
               area, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
               Statements. For additional information, including financing,
               capital expenditures and equipment utilization of the Company's
               leasing fleet, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of
               Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Such information
               is incorporated herein by reference.

               Over-the-Road Trailers

               XTRA's over-the-road fleet of 62,000 units, mostly dry cargo
               vans, consists primarily of units 48' and 53' long by 102" wide.
               This equipment is leased to private fleet owners, contract
               carriers and common carriers. Approximately 43% of the trailer
               fleet was leased on a term basis at the end of fiscal 1995 with
               the balance available for lease on a per diem basis.

               Marine Containers

               The Company's marine containers are standard, dry cargo 20' and
               40' steel containers, which are the predominant types of
               containers used worldwide for transporting freight on ships.
               XTRA's marine container fleet consists of 126,000 units.
               Expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), an industry
               measure of fleet size, the fleet size is 178,000 TEUs.
               Approximately 32% of XTRA's marine container fleet was leased on
               a term basis at the end of fiscal 1995 with the remainder of the
               fleet available for lease on a per diem basis.

               Intermodal Trailers

               Intermodal trailers are designed to be carried on rail flatcars,
               pulled by tractor over the highway and, to a lesser extent,
               transported by water carriers on ships and barges. The Company's
               intermodal trailer fleet of 29,000 units consists primarily of
               units 45' and 48' long by 102" wide. The Company's intermodal
               trailers are leased primarily to North American railroads and
               water carriers. Approximately 32% of the intermodal trailer fleet
               was leased on a term basis at the end of fiscal 1995 with the
               remainder of the fleet available for lease on a per diem basis.

               Chassis

               Domestic chassis are wheeled rectangular steel frames generally
               48' to 53' in length and handle domestic containers. Marine
               chassis are generally 20' or 40' in length to accommodate marine
               containers. XTRA's marine and domestic chassis are used as
               transport vehicles for marine and domestic containers which are
               loaded or unloaded at shipyards, rail terminals or consignees.
               The Company's chassis fleet of 21,000 units consists primarily of
               marine chassis and are leased to steamship lines, railroads and
               motor carriers. Approximately 80% of the chassis fleet was leased
               on a term basis at the end of fiscal 1995 with the balance
               available for lease on a per diem basis.

               Domestic Containers

               Domestic containerization is the transportation of freight
               throughout North America in containers through a combination of
               rail and over-the-road on chassis. These containers are a
               substitute for intermodal and over-the-road trailers,
               particularly on long-haul, heavy volume routes. XTRA's fleet of
               approximately 8,000 units consists primarily of 48' long by 102"
               wide steel-constructed units. The Company's domestic containers
               are leased to North American railroads and domestic
               transportation segments of shipping lines. Approximately 70% of
               the Company's domestic container fleet was leased on a term lease
               basis at the end of fiscal 1995 with the balance available for
               lease on a per diem basis.

               Storage Trailers

               XTRA's storage fleet of 11,000 units consists of older former
               over-the-road and intermodal trailers. Approximately 18% of the
               storage fleet was leased on a term basis at the end of fiscal
               1995 with the balance available for lease on a per diem basis.

               Competition 

                                                                                
               Leasing transportation equipment is a highly competitive business
               and is affected by factors related to the freight transportation
               market. Lease terms and lease rates, as well as availability,
               condition and size of equipment are all important factors to the
               lessee. In addition, various types of transportation equipment
               compete for business. Over-the-road trailers, intermodal
               trailers, marine and domestic containers, and railroad rolling
               stock are all potential vehicles for the movement of freight.

                  XTRA believes it is the second largest North American lessor
               of over-the-road trailers with its principal competitor having a
               slightly larger fleet. Recent estimates place the number of
               over-the-road trailers available for lease in North America in
               excess of 260,000.

                  The world's dry cargo marine container fleet has grown in
               excess of 7% per year since 1990, in response to world trade
               growth. At the end of fiscal 1995, the world's marine container
               fleet is estimated at 9 million TEUs, of which approximately
               one-half is owned by leasing companies. In the marine container
               market, XTRA believes it is one of the ten largest container
               lessors in the world. The two largest lessors account for
               approximately 50% of the leasing market.

                  The Company believes that the North American intermodal
               trailer fleet has decreased from approximately 115,000 trailers
               at the end of 1990 to approximately 105,000 trailers at the end
               of fiscal 1995. Demand was strong in fiscal 1994 and in the first
               quarter of fiscal 1995 resulting from an overall improved
               economy, better service provided by the railroads and increased
               use of intermodal transportation by long-haul truckers. Beginning
               in the second quarter of fiscal 1995, as a result of decreased
               levels of domestic freight, truckers began competing more
               aggressively, thus diverting some intermodal freight to
               over-the-road. The Company is unable to predict what demand for
               intermodal trailers will be in the future although some industry
               analysts believe that demand will continue to decrease. The
               Company monitors the size of the North American fleet relative to
               current and expected future demand and bases its trailer
               acquisition and disposition decisions, in part, on these factors.
               XTRAbelieves it is the second largest North American lessor of
               intermodal trailers with its principal trailer competitor having
               a slightly larger fleet. The balance of the North American fleet
               is owned by other leasing companies and railroads.

                  The use of domestic containers and chassis is a growing part
               of the intermodal business. The Company believes it is the third
               largest lessor of domestic containers and its fleet represents
               approximately 14% of the national fleet. Marine containers also
               compete for the intermodal movement of domestic freight.

                  Some portion of the North American marine chassis fleet of
               approximately 450,000 units is used to handle domestic containers
               and hence competes with domestic chassis. XTRA believes its fleet
               of domestic and marine chassis represents 5% of the chassis
               fleet.

               Locations and Operations

               XTRA's domestic equipment is leased from equipment pools operated
               by Company employees at 92 locations in North America. The marine
               container operations are managed by 12 Company offices and 10
               agency locations, which utilize 106 independent depot locations
               worldwide to store and maintain equipment.

               Employees

               The Company had 883 employees at September 30, 1995.

               Corporate Organization

               The Company was organized in 1957. XTRA's management subsidiary
               X-L-CO, INC. is located at 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts
               02109 (telephone number (617) 367-5000).

                   XTRA Inc., a subsidiary of XTRA Corporation, owns
               substantially all of the Company's transportation equipment and
               conducts the Company's leasing business through certain of its
               subsidiaries pursuant to management service agreements. For
               disclosure on significant subsidiaries, see Note 13 of the Notes
               to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Properties

               The Company maintains 92 facilities for the storage and
               distribution of its over-the-road and intermodal equipment
               throughout North America, occupying 664 acres, of which 381 are
               owned. Except for locations in Chicago and the St. Louis area,
               consisting of 35 and 148 acres, respectively, these facilities
               are generally 2 to 16 acres. The marine container business is
               managed through 12 offices worldwide.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

               There are no material pending legal proceedings in which the
               Company is named as a defendant.

                  A subsidiary of the Company has joined a group of other
               parties working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural
               Resources ("WDNR") on the remediation of environmental problems
               at the Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site in Edgerton,
               Wisconsin and provision of an alternative water supply to
               affected residences in the area of the site. The subsidiary has
               also joined another group of parties working with the WDNR with
               regard to an adjacent manufacturing facility owned by the
               subsidiary prior to 1978.  The Company is unable at this time to
               predict with any certainty the ultimate remediation costs
               associated with these sites or with provision of an alternative
               water supply, or the Company's share of any such costs. Based on
               preliminary estimates received from technical consultants for the
               Company and other similarly situated parties, the Company
               believes that its share of any future costs for remediation of
               both sites and provision of an alternative water supply will not
               be material to the results of operations, the financial condition
               or the liquidity of the Company, without consideration of any
               potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from the prior owner
               of the manufacturing facility or the owner/operator of the
               Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site.

                  The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends on its Common
               Stock since January 1977. Future dividends will be determined by
               the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon the earnings,
               financial condition and cash requirements of the Company and
               other relevant factors existing at the time.

                  The Company's source of funds for the payment of dividends on
               its capital stock is advances and dividends from its direct and
               indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including XTRA Missouri, Inc.
               and XTRA, Inc. The primary sources of funds for XTRA, Inc. are
               cash flows from operations, advances from its subsidiaries and
               external financing. Several of the Company's loan agreements
               contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends by the
               Company. In addition certain loan agreements contain covenants
               that restrict advances to and payment of dividends to the Company
               by its subsidiaries, including XTRA Missouri, Inc and XTRA Inc.
               Under the most restrictive provisions of the Company's loan
               agreements, the amount of cash dividends which could be paid on
               the Company's capital stock was limited to $82 million at
               September 30, 1995.

     In January 1995, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $100
     million of its common stock. The timing of the repurchases, which could
     occur over an extended period of time, will depend on price, market
     conditions and other factors. As of November 15, 1995, the Company had
     repurchased approximately $31 million of common stock.

     Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock 

     In connection with the acquisition of the Strick Lease business the Company
     issued 300 shares of Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred
     Stock with a $30 million redemption value, a dividend rate of 10% and a
     final maturity date of five years. On October 1, 1993, the Company elected
     to exercise its option to exchange the outstanding shares for subordinated
     debt with a coupon of 10%.  This subordinated debt which was recorded by
     its subsidiary, XTRA, Inc., was redeemed September 30, 1994.

(C)  Debt and Transfers to Subsidiaries

     The Parent Company has guaranteed certain debt of its indirect
     wholly-owned subsidiary, including the Revolving Credit Agreement, Series
     Notes and Term Loans.  (See Note 4 of the Parent Company's consolidated 
     1995 Annual Report.)

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for the Three Years Ended September 30, 1995
(Not covered by Report of Independent Public Accountants)

               XTRA Corporation leases, primarily on an operating basis, freight
               transportation equipment including over-the-road trailers, marine
               containers, intermodal trailers, chassis, domestic containers and
               older trailers for mobile storage use. XTRA's equipment
               utilization and lease rates, and hence profitability, are
               directly impacted by the level of economic activity in North
               America, world trade activity, the supply of and demand for
               available equipment, the actions of its competitors and other
               factors in the freight transportation industry. The discussion
               and data below are presented on a consolidated basis.

                  The Company's pretax profits have been cyclical, principally
               due to the variability of the Company's revenues and the high
               percentage of fixed costs. To moderate this cyclicality, the
               Company maintains a balance between the amount of equipment
               leased on a per diem and term basis and maintains an appropriate
               mix of various types of freight transportation equipment
               available for lease. The June 1995 acquisition of marine
               containers from Matson Leasing Company, Inc. (Matson), in
               addition to providing a further diversification of its customer
               base, has reduced XTRA's dependence on levels of transportation
               activity within North America. Although the marine container
               business is international, substantially all transactions are
               denominated in U.S. dollars. This discussion includes the marine
               container operating results for the three months ended September
               30, 1995 and accordingly, the results for the year ended
               September 30, 1995 may not be comparable to the year ended
               September 30, 1994 and the results described may not be
               indicative of future results.

                  The Company also maintains a high proportion of its debt at
               fixed rates to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest
               rates. The Matson acquisition, initially financed with floating
               rate debt, resulted in a slightly higher than target percentage
               of floating rate debt at September 30, 1995 of 37%, as compared
               to 14% at September 30, 1994.

               Revenues

               Revenues are a function of lease rates and working units; the
               latter depends on fleet size and equipment utilization. Revenues
               increased by 8% from $329 million in 1993 to $355 million in
               1994, due mainly to increased overall equipment utilization as a
               result of improving economic conditions. The increase in working
               units was partially attributable to several non-recurring events
               in 1994 including the Teamster's strike against major
               less-than-truckload carriers in April 1994 and severe winter
               weather conditions. These conditions resulted in the dislocations
               of freight transportation equipment and increased demand for
               leased equipment.

                  Revenues increased by 6% or $22 million in 1995 primarily due
               to the acquisition of the marine container business as well as an
               increase in over-the-road working units as a result of a larger
               fleet size and an increase in average lease rates. Partially
               offsetting the increase in fiscal 1995 revenues was a decrease in
               revenues derived from intermodal trailers due to reduced demand
               attributable to the softening domestic economy, an increased
               supply of equipment, and shifting traffic trends in the industry.
               Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 1995, as a result of
               decreased levels of domestic freight, truckers began competing
               more aggressively, thus diverting some intermodal freight to
               over-the-road. In addition, the peso devaluation which began in
               December 1994, has caused a severe reduction in the southbound
               traffic into Mexico. Responding to the decreased demand for
               intermodal equipment, the Company has accelerated the disposition
               of older intermodal equipment, resulting in increased gains on
               sales in 1995.

                  The following table sets forth, for the Company, average
               utilization (dollar weighted by investment in each type of
               equipment) and average fleet size in units (including units
               leased in under operating leases) during the last three years.

                  Utilization, which is the ratio of revenue-earning units to
               the total fleet, is derived from billing information, usage
               reports and other information from customers, assumptions based
               on historical experience and equipment inventories taken at
               Company depots, and is an approximation. Equipment utilization is
               directly affected by the supply of available equipment, the
               volume of domestic freight shipments (particularly in the
               automotive and construction industries), and the volume of
               international freight shipments.

               Operating Expenses 

                  In 1994, depreciation expense increased 4% or $3 million
               primarily due to an increase in the owned fleet partially
               resulting from the purchase of previously leased-in equipment. In
               1995, depreciation expense increased 18% or $18 million due to an
               increase in average fleet size which included the effect of the
               Matson acquisition in the fourth quarter.

                  Rental equipment lease financing decreased 52% or $8 million
               in 1994 and 76% or $5 million in 1995 primarily due to the
               purchase of equipment previously leased-in.

                  Rental equipment operating expense increased 12% or $10
               million in 1994 primarily due to higher repair and maintenance,
               tire and facility costs related to higher equipment utilization
               as well as a larger working fleet. In 1995, lower operating
               expenses for over-the-road trailer and intermodal related rental
               equipment were mostly offset by operating expenses related to the
               addition of the marine container business.

                  Selling and administrative expenses decreased 2% or $1 million
               in 1994 primarily due to cost savings realized from completing
               the integration of the Strick Lease business which was acquired
               in 1993 (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
               Statements). In 1995, selling and administrative expenses
               increased 14% or $4 million principally due to the marine
               container business and increased costs related to the development
               and implementation of management information systems.

               Interest Expense

               Interest expense is a function of the amount of average net debt
               outstanding (long-term debt less cash) and average interest
               rates. The following table shows total average net debt
               outstanding and interest expense as a percentage of total average
               net debt outstanding.

</TABLE>


                  Interest expense decreased by 13% or $5 million in 1994
               primarily due to a decrease in average net debt outstanding. In
               1995, interest expense increased 22% or $8 million due to an
               increase in average net debt outstanding partially offset by a
               decrease in the average effective interest rate.

               Income Before Provision for Income Taxes

               Pretax earnings increased 36% or $26 million in 1994 due
               primarily to higher equipment utilization as well as reduced
               interest expense. In 1995, pretax earnings remained relatively
               unchanged despite lower utilization. Increased profitability
               resulting from the marine containers operations acquired late in
               the year as well as a larger working fleet of over-the-road
               trailers was offset by decreased demand for intermodal trailers
               and increased operating expenses.

               Provision for Income Taxes

               The Company's effective income tax rate was approximately 48% in
               fiscal 1993. In August, 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Bill of
               1993 raised the corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% effective
               January 1, 1993. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
               109 ("SFAS 109") requires adjusting deferred tax liabilities and
               assets to reflect the higher rate. Accordingly, the Company
               recorded, in 1993, an additional tax expense of approximately $5
               million or $.31 per share, related to prior year's accumulated
               deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Absent the required
               adjustment for prior years, the effective income tax rate for
               1993 would have been approximately 41%. The Company's effective
               income tax rate was approximately 42% in fiscal years 1994 and
               1995.

               taxes, see Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial

               FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

               Significant capital investment is required by the Company's
               leasing operations, not only for growth but also for replacement
               of units retired from service. However, during periods of slower
               economic growth, capital expenditures may be curtailed until
               demand for transportation equipment increases.

                  The following table sets forth capital expenditures by
               equipment type, including units acquired by acquisition, units
               purchased and units leased-in from third parties under operating
               leases. The Company's committed capital expenditures for 1996 are
               estimated as of November 15, 1995.

</TABLE>

                  The Company recognizes the importance of managing capital
               spending as essential to maintaining the quality of its fleet.
               The Company grows its fleet by acquiring other leasing companies
               and by purchasing new and used equipment. Capital expenditures
               for 1993 were $410 million, reflecting primarily equipment
               acquired in the Strick Lease acquisition. In 1994, capital
               expenditures were $236 million, including $46 million of
               equipment acquired in three separate acquisitions. Responding to
               the strong demand for its products in 1994 and continuing into
               mid-1995, expenditures in 1995 increased to $699 million,
               including $360 million paid to acquire the marine container
               fleet.

                  As of November 15, 1995, XTRA's committed capital expenditures
               for 1996 amounted to $115 million. The Company may increase
               capital spending in 1996 as conditions warrant. Given current
               conditions, it is unlikely that spending for new equipment will
               approach the 1995 levels for new equipment.

                  Although some level of future capital spending can be financed
               internally, the ability to fund expenditures above that level
               will depend upon the availability of external financing.

                  During the three years ended September 30, 1995, the Company
               generated $667 million of cash flow from operations and raised
               $63 million from the sale of common stock. During this same
               period, XTRA invested $1.3 billion in property and equipment
               including acquisitions, paid dividends of $30 million,
               repurchased $20 million of common stock and increased net debt
               (debt less cash) outstanding by $659 million.

                  In addition to cash flow from operations, XTRA generally has
               available to it a variety of external means to finance future
               growth of its leasing equipment fleet. The Company's external
               financing options include a combination of a revolving credit
               agreement, medium-term and long-term borrowings in the public
               debt market, intermediate term bank loans, long-term financing
               from banks, institutional investors and lease financing. The
               Company has registered with the Securities and Exchange
               Commission $500 million of securities consisting of Preferred
               Stock and Common Stock of the Company and Senior and Subordinated
               Debt Securities of its subsidiary XTRA, Inc., fully and
               unconditionally guaranteed by XTRA Corporation and XTRA Missouri,
               Inc. (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
               As of November 15, 1995, XTRA Inc. has $165 million available for
               future issuance under its Shelf Registration. The Company's
               access to external financing will depend upon prevailing market
               conditions and the Company's credit ratings. There can be no
               assurance that the Company will be able to borrow funds in those
               markets at attractive rates or with covenants that are not more
               restrictive than the Company's current debt covenants. The
               Company also has potential access to external funds through the
               issuance of capital stock. XTRA deems its sources of financing
               adequate to meet projected needs.

                  In connection with the acquisition of Matson in June 1995, the
               Company's two revolving credit agreements were replaced with a
               $590 million term loan and revolving credit agreement with an
               expanded bank group. The Company used approximately $160 million
               of the new revolver commitments to replace the borrowings
               committed under the previous revolving credit agreement and
               approximately $360 million to finance the acquisition. As of
               November 16, 1995 the Company had $88 million of unused credit
               available under its $300 million Revolving Credit Agreement.

                  The Company's source of funds for the payment of dividends on
               its capital stock are advances and dividends from its direct and
               indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including XTRA Missouri, Inc.
               and XTRA, Inc. The primary sources of funds for XTRA, Inc. are
               cash flows from operations, advances from its subsidiaries and
               external financing. Several of the Company's loan agreements
               contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends by the
               Company. In addition, certain loan agreements contain covenants
               that restrict advances to and the payment of dividends to the
               Company by its subsidiaries, including XTRA Missouri, Inc. and
               XTRA, Inc. Under the most restrictive provisions of the Company's
               loan agreements, the amount of cash dividends which could be paid
               on the Company's capital stock was limited to $82 million at
               September 30, 1995. For additional information regarding
               long-term debt, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
               Statements.

                  In January 1995, the Company authorized the repurchase of up
               to $100 million of XTRA's common stock. The timing of the
               repurchases, which could occur over an extended period of time,
               will depend on price, market conditions and other factors. As of
               November 15, 1995, the Company had repurchased $31 million of
               common stock under this authorization.

Notes to Consolidated                       XTRA Corporation
Financial Statements                        and Subsidiaries

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

               Principles of Consolidation

               The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
               XTRA Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("the
               Company"). All material intercompany accounts and transactions
               have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the prior year financial
               statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the
               current year's presentation.

               Income Taxes

               Provisions for income taxes recognize the tax effect of all
               revenue and expense transactions as well as any change during the
               period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effects of
               changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax assets and
               liabilities are reflected in net income in the period in which
               such changes are enacted (see Note 5).

               Leases

               The Company records the majority of its leases using the
               operating method of accounting. Full-payout or near full-payout
               leases are accounted for under the finance method.

               Depreciation

               The Company provides for depreciation by using the straight-line
               method to amortize the cost of property and equipment to its
               estimated residual value over its estimated useful life. Revenue
               equipment is depreciated using estimated useful lives of 10 to 20
               years. In addition, the Company reviews the condition and types
               of its revenue equipment to determine if any permanent impairment
               has occurred.

                  When equipment is sold or retired, its cost and accumulated
               depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or
               loss is included in revenues. Revenue equipment with an original
               cost of approximately $54 million, which has reached the end of
               its estimated useful life, remains in service and is included in
               Revenue Equipment at September 30, 1995.

               Repair and Maintenance

               Repair and maintenance expenses are charged to operating expenses
               when incurred and amounted to $23 million, $27 million and $26
               million in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively.

               Earnings per Share

               The computation of primary earnings per common share is based on
               net income after deduction of $1.9375 Series B Preferred Stock
               dividends and dividends on and accretion of issuance costs of
               Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock,
               divided by the weighted average number of outstanding common
               shares plus common share equivalents. Fully diluted earnings per
               share also assumes the conversion of the $1.9375 Series B
               Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock at the beginning of the
               period. Earnings per share have been calculated giving
               retroactive effect to the 1993 two-for-one stock split (see Note
               9).

               Foreign Currency Translation

               The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign
               operations at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. Revenues
               and expenses are translated using average exchange rates in
               effect during the year. Gains and losses from foreign currency
               translation are credited or charged to cumulative translation
               adjustment included in stockholders' equity in the accompanying
               Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses from foreign
               currency transactions are included in selling and administrative
               expense.

(2) Acquisitions

               In October, 1992, the Company acquired Distribution International
               Corporation ("D.I.") and certain subsidiaries, primarily Strick
               Lease, a major lessor of transportation equipment, which operated
               a rental fleet of approximately 50,000 units of transportation
               equipment, primarily over-the-road trailers and chassis. Total
               consideration for the assets acquired approximated $350 million
               consisting of approximately $114 million in cash (excluding cash
               assumed), and the assumption of approximately $236 million in
               debt. The cash payment included $12 million to key Strick Lease
               personnel for covenants not to compete. The transaction, which
               was accounted for as a purchase, was partially financed through
               the issuance of $30 million of Series C Cumulative Redeemable
               Exchangeable Preferred Stock (see Note 10). The balance was
               funded by Revolving Credit Agreement borrowings.

                  In fiscal 1994, the Company acquired the assets of Dykes
               Trailer Rentals, Inc., Caravan Trailer Rental Co., Ltd., and
               Integrated Transportation Services, Ltd., for approximately $46
               million. The total rental fleets acquired in these three
               transactions amounted to approximately 6,000 units of
               transportation equipment, primarily over-the-road trailers.

                  On June 30, 1995, the Company acquired certain net assets of
               Matson Leasing Company, Inc., a major lessor of marine container
               equipment which at that time operated a rental fleet of
               approximately 170,000 twenty-foot equivalent units. Total
               consideration for the assets approximated $360 million in cash
               and included approximately $10 million for recently purchased
               containers. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and
               therefore, includes the marine container operating results for
               the three months ended September 30, 1995. While the Company has
               not yet finalized the purchase price allocation, substantially
               all of the purchase price has been allocated to property and
               equipment.

                  The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated income
               statement of the Company, as if Matson Leasing Company, Inc. had
               been acquired on October 1, 1993 is as follows:

(3) Equipment Leases

               The Company uses the operating method of accounting for the
               majority of its equipment leases. Under this method, revenue is
               recognized in the month earned based on the terms of the lease
               contract, and the equipment is depreciated to its estimated
               residual value over its estimated useful life.

                  The finance method of accounting is used for revenue equipment
               leased to customers on a full-payout or near full-payout basis at
               lease inception. Under this method, finance lease income, the
               difference between the total lease receivable and the net book
               value less the residual value of the related equipment, is
               deferred and amortized as revenue over the lease term using the
               interest method, which provides a level rate of return on the net
               investment in the lease.

                  The following schedule summarizes the future minimum rental
               receipts on operating and finance leases by year as of September
               30, 1995:

                  The Company's Revolving Credit Agreement has bank commitments
               of $300 million at September 30, 1995, a revolving period
               maturity date of June 30, 1997 and pricing dependent on the
               Company's credit ratings; currently pricing is .38% over the
               London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company currently pays
               .15% on any unused commitment in the facility.

                  Unless the Company requests and the banks approve a renewal or
               extension of the agreement, borrowings outstanding on the
               revolving period maturity date will be converted to a five year
               term loan payable in 20 equal quarterly installments. If
               converted, the facility has a final term maturity of June 30,
               2002. Given the Company's current credit ratings, the Company
               would borrow at .45% over LIBOR during the first three years of
               the term loan period and .60% over LIBOR during the final years
               of the facility.

                  The Company borrows on a short-term basis by issuing
               commercial paper and using several uncommitted lines of credit.
               These short-term borrowing options are back stopped by the unused
               borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and
               hence have been classified as Revolving Credit Agreement
               borrowings. All borrowings classified as Revolving Credit
               Agreement borrowings at September 30, 1994 and September 30, 1995
               were comprised of such uncommitted lines and commercial paper.
               Such borrowings have a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%. At
               September 30, 1995, approximately $115 million of unused capacity
               was available. The weighted average interest rates incurred under
               the Revolving Credit Agreement, consisting primarily of
               short-term borrowings, were 3.9%, 4.1% and 6.0% during 1993, 1994
               and 1995, respectively.

                  The Company's unsecured term loan has a weighted average
               interest rate of 6.3% and is payable in quarterly installments
               through June 30, 2000. Its pricing is dependent on the Company's
               credit ratings currently pricing is .38% over the LIBOR. The
               weighted average interest rate incurred during 1995 was 6.3%.

                  The $419 million of Medium-term Notes outstanding under shelf
               registrations filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
               have a weighted average interest rate of 7.4% and maturities from
               1997 to 2007. At September 30, 1995, under the present shelf
               registration, $192 million remained available for future debt
               issuance. The weighted average interest rates incurred were 8.2%,
               7.9% and 7.6% during 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively.

                  Capital lease obligations have a weighted average interest
               rate of 8.6% and are payable in installments through 2001. The
               weighted average interest rates incurred under capital lease
               obligations were 8.5%, 8.3%and 8.5%, during 1993, 1994 and 1995
               respectively.

                  Secured term loans have a weighted average interest rate of
               11.3% and are payable in installments through 2000. The weighted
               average interest rates incurred under secured term loans during
               1993, 1994 and 1995 were 10.1%, 11.7% and 11.6%, respectively.

                  Revenue equipment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets
               related to capital leases and secured debt was as follows at
               September 30, 1994 and 1995:

                  On October 1, 1993, the Company exchanged the Series C
               Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock with a $30
               million redemption value for subordinated debt with a coupon of
               10%. This subordinated debt was redeemed on September 30, 1994.

</TABLE>

                  As of September 30, 1993, 1994 and 1995, 1%, 14% and 37%,
               respectively, of the Company's debt was at floating interest
               rates. The Company has two interest rate swaps with nominal
               amounts totalling $40 million which have been entered into to
               effectively fix the interest rate on that amount of floating rate
               debt. Floating rate debt which has been fixed through interest
               rate swaps is treated as fixed rate debt. The agreements provide
               for the Company to exchange floating rate interest payments based
               on LIBOR for a fixed rate of 7.5% on $14 million through October
               1995, and for 8.5% on $25 million through July 1996. The net
               interest settlements are recorded as an adjustment to interest
               expense. Exposure to market risk exists in the event of
               nonperformance by the counterparties as the Company is required
               to continue making payments. Nonperformance by the counterparties
               is not anticipated nor would it have a material adverse effect on
               the results of operations or the financial position of the
               Company.

                  The Company's several loan agreements contain minimum debt
               service tests and various restrictive covenants including,
               without limitation, restrictions on incurring debt in relation to
               revenue equipment and stockholders' equity and limitations on
               secured borrowings. Several of the Company's loan agreements
               contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends by the
               Company. In addition, certain loan agreements contain covenants
               that restrict advances to and the payment of dividends to the
               Company by its subsidiaries, including XTRA Missouri, Inc. and
               XTRA, Inc. Under the most restrictive provisions of the Company's
               loan agreements, the amount of cash dividends which could be paid
               on the Company's capital stock was limited to $82 million at
               September 30, 1995.

                  The provision differs from income taxes currently payable
               because certain items of income and expense are recognized in
               different periods for financial statement purposes than for tax
               return purposes.

                  The reasons for the difference between the statutory U.S.
               Federal income tax rates and the Company's effective income tax
               rates for 1993, 1994 and 1995 are as follows:

</TABLE>

                  The higher effective income tax rate in 1993 was primarily due
               to the enactment, in August, 1993, of the Revenue Reconciliation
               Bill of 1993 which raised the corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%
               effective January 1, 1993. The statutory federal tax rate in
               fiscal 1993 was 34.8%. Statement of Financial Accounting
               Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109") requires restating deferred tax
               liabilities and assets to reflect the higher rate. Accordingly in
               fiscal 1993, the Company recorded additional tax expense of
               approximately $5.0 million. Absent the required adjustment for
               prior years, the effective income tax rate for 1993 would have
               been approximately 41%.

                  The Company estimates that after filing its fiscal 1995 tax
               return, it will have $3 million of investment tax credit
               carryforwards and $10 million of alternative minimum tax credit
               carryforwards available to reduce future federal income tax
               liabilities. The investment tax credit carryforwards expire
               beginning in 2000. The benefit of both tax credit carryforwards
               has been recorded in the Company's financial statements. The
               Company has not recognized a valuation allowance for deferred tax
               assets.

(6) Commitments and Contingencies

               The Company's offices and certain facilities are occupied under
               leases expiring at various dates. In addition, the Company has
               leased revenue equipment with an original cost of $56 million
               under operating leases.

                  At September 30, 1995, the Company's rental commitments under
               the non-cancelable portion of these leases for the next five
               years and in total thereafter were as follows:

                  Rental equipment lease financing expense amounted to $15
               million, $7 million and $2 million in 1993, 1994 and 1995,
               respectively. Other rental expense amounted to $4 million in
               1993, 1994 and 1995

                  As of November 15, 1995, the Company had committed capital
               expenditures of $115 million, principally for revenue equipment
               in fiscal 1996.

                  A subsidiary of the Company has joined a group of other
               parties working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural
               Resources ("WDNR") on the remediation of environmental problems
               at the Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site in Edgerton,
               Wisconsin and provision of an alternative water supply to
               affected residences in the area of the site. The subsidiary has
               also joined another group of parties working with the WDNR with
               regard to an adjacent manufacturing facility owned by the
               subsidiary prior to 1978. The Company is unable at this time to
               predict with any certainty the ultimate remediation costs
               associated with these sites or with provision of an alternative
               water supply, or the Company's share of any such costs. Based on
               preliminary estimates received from technical consultants for the
               Company and other similarly situated parties, the Company
               believes that its share of any future costs for remediation of
               both sites and provision of an alternative water supply will not
               be material to the results of operations, the financial condition
               or the liquidity of the Company, without consideration of any
               potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from the prior owner
               of the manufacturing facility or the owner/operator of the
               Edgerton Sand and Gravel Landfill site.

(7) Retirement Plans

               The Company provides retirement benefits to substantially all of
               its employees through a qualified and funded defined contribution
               retirement plan. The Company's yearly profit sharing cash
               contributions are discretionary and the retirement trust fund's
               assets are administered by a trustee. The Company's contributions
               include an employee-matching contribution to a 401(k) plan and a
               profit sharing contribution and are based on a specified
               percentage of employee qualified compensation. Participants are
               entitled to their vested portion of the retirement assets upon
               termination of employment. The Company recorded defined
               contribution pension expense of approximately $2 million in each
               of 1993, 1994 and 1995.

(8) Business Information

               The Company leases domestic and international transportation
               equipment. XTRA's over-the-road and intermodal equipment is
               leased throughout North America and its marine containers are
               moved between countries in international commerce over many trade
               routes. Information about the business of the Company by
               geographic area for 1995 is presented in the table below. Prior
               to 1995, all of the Company's business was conducted throughout
               North America.

(9) Common Stock

               Stock Split

               In May 1993, the Company effected a two-for-one common stock
               split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All references to the
               number of shares and per common share amounts have been restated
               to reflect the split.

               Issuance of Common Stock

               During fiscal 1993, the Company issued 1,495,000 shares of common
               stock at $44.75 per share. The net proceeds to the Company were
               approximately $63 million.

               Repurchase of Common Stock

               In January 1995, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to
               $100 million of its common stock. The timing of the repurchases,
               which could occur over an extended period of time, will depend on
               price, market conditions and other factors. As of November 15,
               1995, the Company had repurchased approximately $31 million of
               common stock.

               1987 Stock Incentive Plan

               In fiscal 1988, the stockholders approved the 1987 Stock
               Incentive Plan, authorizing the issuance of 500,000 shares of
               common stock under the plan. In January 1995, the stockholders
               approved an increase in the number of shares reserved for
               issuance under the Plan by 650,000 to 1,150,000. The plan enables
               the Company to grant awards to key employees including restricted
               stock awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights,
               subject primarily to the requirement of continuing employment.
               The awards under this plan are available for grant over a period
               of ten years from the date on which the plan was adopted, but
               grants may vest beyond the ten year period. Stock options issued
               by the Company are exercisable at a future time as specified by
               the Company and generally expire from five to ten years from the
               date of grant. The exercise price of stock options may not be
               less than the fair market value of the common stock at the date
               of grant.

               1990 Stock Option Agreement

               In fiscal 1990, the Company granted one employee two options to
               purchase an aggregate of 80,000 shares of common stock with
               exercise prices of $10.89 to $16.00. In fiscal 1991, one of the
               options was amended to change the option price from $16.00 to
               $11.50. In fiscal 1994, options to purchase 30,000 shares were
               exercised at an option price of $11.50 per share. In fiscal 1995,
               options to purchase the remaining 50,000 shares at $10.89 per
               share were exercised.

               1991 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors

               In fiscal 1992, stockholders approved the 1991 Stock Option Plan
               for Non-Employee Directors, authorizing the granting of options
               for a maximum of 50,000 shares. The option price per share is
               equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
               grant. The term of each option is five years, and options become
               exercisable one year after the date of grant.

               The XTRA Corporation Deferred Director Fee Option Plan

               In fiscal 1994, stockholders approved the Deferred Director Fee
               Option Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, a non-employee director
               may elect to receive, in lieu of his annual retainer fee and/or
               board and committee meeting fees (the "fees"), a non-qualified
               stock option covering a specified amount of shares. The option
               exercise price is 50% of the fair market value of the shares at
               the time the options are awarded and the amount of shares is
               determined by dividing the directors' fees by the exercise price.
               At September 30, 1995 there were outstanding options to purchase
               4,002 shares of common stock option prices ranging from $22.81 to
               $25.31.

(10) Preferred Stock

               $1.9375 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock

               On December 29, 1992, the Company issued 3,604,150 shares of its
               Common Stock $.50 par value per share, upon conversion of
               2,494,222 shares of its $1.9375 Series B Cumulative Convertible
               Preferred Stock. A total of 3,778 shares of Series B Cumulative
               Convertible Preferred Stock were not converted and were redeemed.
               Also, 5,458 shares of Common Stock, which would have been issued
               had these 3,778 shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible
               Preferred Stock been converted, were sold to a standby
               underwriter. As a result of the above transactions, a total of
               3,609,608 new shares of Common Stock were issued pursuant to the
               Company's call for redemption which expired on December 28, 1992.

               Series C Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock

               In connection with the acquisition of the Strick Lease business
               (see Note 2), the Company issued 300 shares of Series C
               Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock with a $30
               million redemption value, a dividend rate of 10% and a final
               maturity date of five years. In October 1993, the Company
               exchanged the outstanding shares for subordinated debt with a
               coupon of 10% and redeemed the debt in September 1994. (see Note

(11) Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

               The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
               fair value of each class of financial instrument:

               Cash and Short-term Investments

               The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
               maturity of those instruments.

               Long-term Debt

               The fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt is
               estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or
               similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for
               debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the
               Company's floating rate debt is its carrying amount.

               Interest Rate Swap Agreements

               The fair value of interest rate swaps (used for hedging purposes)
               is the estimated amount that the Company would pay to terminate
               the swap agreements taking into account interest rates and the
               credit-worthiness of the swap counterparties.

                  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the
               Company's financial instruments are as follows:

(13) Selected Financial Data of Significant Subsidiaries

               XTRA Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary, XTRA Missouri, Inc.,
               is a holding company which owns the stock of XTRA, Inc. and also
               manages the Company's office space. Both XTRA Corporation's and
               XTRA Missouri, Inc.'s assets consist substantially of the
               aggregate assets, liabilities, earnings and equity of XTRA, Inc.
               Therefore, the Company's management has determined that separate
               financial statement disclosure of XTRA Missouri, Inc. is not
               material to investors. In addition, both XTRA Corporation and
               XTRA Missouri, Inc. are jointly and severally liable on the
               guarantee of the debt of XTRA, Inc.

                  The condensed consolidated data for XTRA Inc., a wholly-owned
               subsidiary of XTRA Missouri, Inc., included in the consolidated
               financial information of the Company, is summarized below:

Report of Independent Public Accountants

               To the Stockholders of XTRA Corporation:

               We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
               XTRA Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of
               September 30, 1994 and 1995, and the related consolidated
               statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
               each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1995.
               These financial statements are the responsibility of the
               Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
               on these financial statements based on our audits.

                  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
               auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
               perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
               the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
               audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
               the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
               also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
               significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
               the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
               audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
               present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
               of XTRA Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and
               1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
               for each of the three years in the period ending September 30,
               1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
               principles.
