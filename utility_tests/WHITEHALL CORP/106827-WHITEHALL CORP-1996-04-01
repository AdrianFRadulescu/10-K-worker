                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

         Whitehall Corporation ("Whitehall" or the "Company" hereinafter) was
incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1963 as a successor to a Minnesota
corporation organized in 1960.

         The Company operates in three segments:  Ocean Systems, Aircraft
Maintenance and Electronics.  Reference is made to Note I of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 19 herein for pertinent financial
data of each segment as well as information regarding the Company's major
customers.

         OCEAN SYSTEMS SEGMENT: The Ocean Systems segment manufactures and
sells underwater sensing systems used for naval surveillance and offshore
geophysical surveys.  The principal subsidiary of the Company constituting the
Ocean Systems segment is Hydroscience, Inc. ("Hydroscience"), which is engaged
in the design and manufacture of marine sensor systems for geophysical and
military applications.  Because of reductions in defense spending, the Company
invested in the development of a new 24-bit digital seismic streamer known as
CenturyMux. The Company has had some success in using this new technology to
offset the decline in military revenues. However, further growth in this
segment could require expenditures, which may be substantial, for new product
research and development.  The Company is currently evaluating options ranging
from making the necessary investment to divesting some or all of the Company's
ownership interest in Hydroscience.

         Rogers Explorations, Inc., an additional subsidiary in this segment,
which experienced no operating activity during the past several years was
liquidated in 1995.

         AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SEGMENT:  The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,
Aero Corporation ("Aero"), located in Lake City, Florida, rebuilds, modifies
and maintains turboprop and jet aircraft.  Aero operates as a service business.
Aero's primary business is  the modification and maintenance of commercial
passenger and freighter aircraft. Aero has invested heavily in a major
renovation of its facility in Lake City, Florida and has expanded its employee
base in order to attract additional commercial customers.   Aero's facility can
accommodate most narrow-body aircraft and has undergone modification to
accommodate nearly all wide-body aircraft in current production.  The Company
includes in its customer base passenger airlines, cargo carriers and private
and corporate executive jets.  The Company believes that the commercial market
represents a significant opportunity because of the potential associated with
the maintenance and modification of aging aircraft in commercial fleets and
because the current downsizing trend in the airline industry could lead to the
outsourcing of maintenance work to low cost facilities.  As an FAA approved
repair station, Aero is qualified to work on DC-8, DC-9, DC-10, 707, 727, 737,
L-100, L-188, C-130 and other military and commercial aircraft.  During 1994
Aero acquired a 40% interest in AvAero, a joint venture which developed  jet
engine Hushkits for Boeing 737- 100/200 aircraft (see Note M page 24).  Aero is
also selectively  pursuing military contracts.

         ELECTRONICS SEGMENT:  Crystek Crystals Corporation, ("Crystek") a
subsidiary of the Company located in Fort Myers, Florida, manufactures and
distributes quartz crystals and oscillators.  The products are utilized in
various electronic end products including communications equipment, computers
and timing devices.  The Electronics segment provides products to customers in
the computer and communication industries.

         RAW MATERIALS:  The primary basic raw materials utilized by the
Company are wire, plastics and electronic components primarily used in the
Ocean Systems segment.  The Company is not dependent upon any single supplier
or group of suppliers for any of the raw materials it uses in manufacturing its
products and has encountered no difficulties in purchasing sufficient
quantities in the open market.

         PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISES AND CONCESSIONS:  Most
technology utilized by the Company is proprietary technology and attributed to
the Ocean Systems segment.  The Company has applied for patent protection for
its CenturyMux product. In the opinion of the Company, no single patent or
group of patents is material to any segment of its business, and it does not
pay or receive substantial royalties under license agreements.  The Company
seeks patent protection in the normal course of business with respect to
inventions and improvements developed by its employees which it considers
patentable.  The Company holds no franchises or concessions.

         COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS:  The Company is subject to severe competitive
conditions in all segments of its business. The Company believes other
companies have substantially greater resources available with which to compete.
Although the Company does not have data available to determine its exact
relative market position, the Company does not believe that it presently has a
substantial position in any of the markets for its products and services.
Competition in each segment is primarily related to price and service.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (CONTINUED)

         CUSTOMERS:  The Company has two customers in the Aircraft Maintenance
segment that account for at least 10% of 1995 consolidated revenues: Valujet
Airlines and Continental Airlines.  Valujet Airlines accounted for
approximately 30% of consolidated net sales in 1995 and 11% of consolidated net
sales in 1994.  Continental Airlines accounted for 21% of consolidated sales in
1995. The United States Government accounted for approximately 2% of net sales
in 1995, 10% of consolidated net sales in 1994 and 14% of consolidated net
sales in 1993.  Emery Worldwide accounted for 9% of consolidated net sales in
1995, 25% of consolidated net sales in 1994 and 27% of consolidated net sales
in 1993.  Southern Air Transport accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated
net sales in 1995, 18% of consolidated net sales in 1994 and 6% of consolidated
net sales in 1993.  The Mexican Government accounted for approximately 1% of
consolidated net sales in 1995, 3% of consolidated net sales in 1994 and 13% of
consolidated net sales in 1993.

         ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION: Aero is taking remedial action pursuant to
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") regulations at the Lake City, Florida
facility.   The Company does not anticipate any material direct effects upon
the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company from
compliance with present Federal, State and local provisions which have been
enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment,
or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  The Company does
expect, however, that compliance with such regulations will require, from time
to time, both increased operating costs and capital expenditures which may be
substantial.  As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company had reserved
approximately $625,000 and $736,000 respectively for anticipated environmental
remediation costs at the Aero facility.  The decrease in accrued environmental
remediation costs was due to expenditures and additional information obtained
relating to the nature and extent of required remediation.  The Company will
install a clay barrier over one section of the leased property and additional
testing determined  another clay barrier will not be required over a second
section of the property.  Other remaining costs to be incurred will include
testing and monitoring to be performed over a 20 to 30 year period.  Actual
costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimate, given the
inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.  These
uncertainties include the extent of required remediation based on testing and
evaluation not yet completed and the varying costs and effectiveness of
remediation methods.

         BACKLOG:  At December 31, 1995, the Company's consolidated firm
backlog totaled $65,800,000 compared to $21,874,000 at the end of 1994, and
$3,938,000 at the end of 1993. This backlog is not indicative of sales for the
coming year as some portion of the backlog relates to work to be performed
beyond 1996.  In addition, the backlog is based on management's estimate of
work to be performed in accordance with customer supplied aircraft input dates
and does not include any drop-in aircraft nor contracts for which the Company
is currently bidding.

         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES:  Reference is made to Note A of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 14 herein for the
amounts of research and development expenditures during the past three calendar
years.

         NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES:  The Company and its subsidiaries employed a
total of 682 persons at December 31, 1995.  The Company has generally enjoyed
good relations with its employees.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  On May 10, 1991, an action was filed in the District Court of Dallas County,
Texas, by Lee D. Webster, former Chairman, Chief  Executive Officer and
President of Whitehall, against the Company, each of its directors (other than
Mr. Webster) and Cambridge Capital Fund, L.P., alleging, among other things,
that (i) the defendants' actions, both individually and in concert, constituted
willful interference with Mr. Webster's employment relationship with the
Company and were the direct cause of Mr. Webster's termination as its President
and Chairman of the Board, and (ii) the defendants' actions forced Mr. Webster
into retirement without providing Mr. Webster with retirement benefits which
Mr. Webster was purportedly promised.  On August 17, 1994, the defendants were
granted a partial summary judgment.  On October 24, 1994, Mr. Webster filed a
third amended petition and alleged the following causes of action: tortious
interference with contractual relations against Cambridge Capital Fund, L.P.,
and directors George F. Baker and John J.  McAtee; intentional infliction of
emotional distress and breach of oral contracts.  The third amended petition
sought compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $35 million.  On January
12, 1995, the Court entered an abatement on one of the breach of oral contract
claims against the Company and entered a summary judgment in the defendants'
favor on all remaining claims alleged by Mr. Webster.  On February 26, 1996,
the Court granted a summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Mr.
Webster's remaining claims and entered a take nothing final judgment which
dismissed all of Mr.  Webster's claims with prejudice to refiling.  On March
26, 1996, Mr. Webster appealed the final judgment to the Dallas, Texas Court of
Appeals.  Management intends to vigorously defend the appeal.

  On September 22, 1992, Mr. Webster filed an action in the District Court of
Dallas County, Texas, against First City, Texas-Dallas ("First City"), the
Company and a former employee of the Company.  As receiver for First City, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has intervened and removed this case to
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  The petition
alleged, among other things, that (i) the Company interfered with Mr. Webster's
existing and prospective contractual relationship with the former employee and
First City, a national banking institution; (ii) the Company has converted to
its own use the former employee's Company stock which allegedly was owned by Mr.
Webster; (iii) the Company, First City and the former employee conspired to
commit fraud against Mr. Webster; and (iv) the actions of the Company, First
City, and the former employee were intentionally done to cause Mr. Webster
emotional distress.  The petition sought, among other things, not less than $1
million in compensatory damages, not less than $5 million in exemplary damages
and not less than $1 million as damages for emotional distress.  By orders dated
June 2, 1994 and June 20, 1994, the Company was granted a summary judgment on
all claims alleged by Mr. Webster.  On July 31, 1995, the Court entered a final
judgment disposing of all claims alleged against all parties.  Mr. Webster has
appealed the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit. Management intends to vigorously defend the appeal.

  The Company is also involved in certain legal proceedings in the normal
course of its business.

  After consultation with counsel, management is of the opinion that the
outcome of the above-mentioned proceedings will not have a material effect on
the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OPERATING RESULTS

         Consolidated sales totaled $56,229,000 for 1995, an increase of 75%
over sales of $32,098,000 in 1994.  Aircraft Maintenance segment  sales
increased by $17,238,000 to $42,641,000 in 1995, primarily as a result of its
continued expansion into the third party commercial aircraft maintenance
market.  Sales in the Ocean Systems segment increased by $6,126,000 to
$9,948,000 in 1995.  Revenues in the Ocean Systems segment increased primarily
as a result of new product sales in the commercial geophysical market.  Sales
in the Electronics segment increased by $767,000 to $3,640,000 in 1995.
Information about the Company's operations in each segment is summarized in
Note I on page 19.

         Sales in 1994 increased by 4% over sales in 1993.  As a result of
increased commercial aircraft maintenance business,  the Aircraft Maintenance
segment's sales increased to $25,403,000 in 1994 from $22,182,000 in 1993.
Sales in the Ocean Systems segment declined to $3,822,000 in 1994 from
$5,527,000 in 1993 as a result of the decline in military business.  Sales in
the Electronics segment decreased to $2,873,000 in 1994 from $3,201,000 in
1993.

         The Company recorded income from operations of $2,875,000 in 1995
compared to an operating loss of $2,588,000 in 1994.  This improvement resulted
from increased profitability  (operating profit of $3,430,000 in 1995 compared
to operating profit of $743,000 in 1994)  in the Aircraft Maintenance segment,
accomplished through stringent cost control measures coupled with the increase
in sales volume.  The Ocean Systems segment's improvement (operating profit  of
$419,000 in 1995 compared to an operating loss of $2,156,000 in 1994) resulted
from the increase in sales coupled with a reduction in research and development
spending.  The Electronics segment's profitability improved (operating profit
of $796,000 in 1995 compared to operating profit of $580,000 in 1994) through
the increase in sales volume.  Corporate office general and administrative
expenses totaled $2,128,000 in 1995 compared to $1,672,000 in 1994.

         The Company recorded a loss from operations of $2,588,000 in 1994
compared to an operating loss of $4,140,000 in 1993.   Primarily as a result of
an increase in sales volume, the Aircraft Maintenance segment reported an
operating profit of $743,000 in 1994 compared to an operating profit of
$506,000 in 1993.  The Ocean Systems segment recorded a loss from operations of
$2,156,000 in 1994 compared to an operating loss of $2,589,000 in 1993.  The
Ocean Systems segment's losses resulted from declining military revenues
coupled with research and development expenditures totaling $1,993,000 in 1994
and  $1,936,000 in 1993.  The Electronics segment reported an operating profit
of $580,000 in 1994 compared to an operating profit of $259,000 in 1993. The
increase in the Electronic segment's profitability resulted from improved
operating efficiencies. Corporate office general and administrative expenses
totaled $1,672,000 in 1994 compared to $2,137,000 in 1993.

         Other income decreased to $963,000 in 1995 from $1,364,000 in 1994.
Other income includes gains on sales of fixed assets of $650,000 in 1995,
$512,000 in 1994, and $159,000 in 1993 as well as interest earned of $671,000
in 1995, $791,000 in 1994 and $610,000 in 1993.

         The Company  recorded net income tax expense of $889,000 for 1995. The
Company did not record a net income tax benefit related to the loss before
income taxes in 1994 since the Company had used all available loss carrybacks
and any tax benefits resulting from losses must now be carried forward.  The
income tax benefit of $1,322,000  was recorded in 1993 since a carryback to
1990 was available. (See Note E on Page 16).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         During 1995, cash used in operating activities totaled $1,802,000
compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1,990,000 in 1994. The
accounts receivable balance of $17,397,000 at year end led to the deficit in
operating cash flow in 1995.   Cash collected from recoverable income taxes of
$4,596,000  was the primary source of cash provided by operations in 1994.
Increases in prepaid expenses and operating losses contributed to the negative
cash flow in 1993.

         The Company made capital expenditures during 1995 of approximately
$1,668,000 compared to $467,000 and $2,313,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The majority of the capital expenditures in 1995 and 1993  relate to the
Aircraft Maintenance segment and were made to renovate the Aero facility in
Lake City, Florida. The 1994 expenditures mainly relate to CenturyMux test
equipment in the Ocean Systems segment.  The Company will make capital and
other expenditures during 1996 as conditions warrant.  The Company believes its
cash balances and line of credit facility are sufficient to meet its short and
long-term capital requirements. Any future acquisitions may require additional
capital.

         Cash and cash equivalents decreased from approximately $9,456,000 in
1994 to $7,382,000 in 1995.  The decrease is primarily the result of capital
expenditures ($1,668,000)  and cash used in operating activities ($1,802,000).

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Whitehall Corporation and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whitehall
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995
and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations and retained
earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995.  These financial statements and the schedule referred to
below are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Whitehall Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in the index to
financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                     WHITEHALL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE A -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements of Whitehall Corporation
and subsidiaries (the "Company") include the accounts of all subsidiaries after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates: Generally accepted accounting principles require management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:  Certain reclassifications have been made to 1994 and 1993
amounts to conform with the 1995 presentation.

Long-Term Contracts:  Revenue on long-term contracts is recognized using the
percentage of completion or unit of delivery method.  On contracts where the
percentage of completion method is applied, revenue and income is accrued in
the proportion that costs incurred bear to management's estimate of total
contract costs.  Any known or anticipated losses are provided for currently.

Concentration of Credit Risk:  Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary
cash investments and accounts receivable.  The Company places its temporary
cash investments with creditworthy financial institutions and, thus, limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one entity.  The Company's customer base is
comprised primarily of U.S. airlines and air transport companies.

Inventories:  Inventories are carried at average cost, not in excess of market.

Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost.  Provisions for depreciation and amortization have been computed
generally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.

Research and Development:  Research and development costs are included in
selling, engineering and administrative expenses and amounted to approximately
$45,000 in 1995, $1,993,000 in 1994 and $1,936,000 in 1993.

Federal Income Taxes:  The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and
liability approach for financial accounting and income tax reporting.  Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and are adjusted
whenever tax rates or other provisions of income tax statutes change.

The Company and all subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return.
Deferred Federal income taxes have been provided for temporary differences
between tax and financial reporting resulting primarily from depreciation
provisions, allowances and expense accruals.

Per Share Amounts:  Per share computations are based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding of 2,821,152 in 1995, 2,698,615 in 1994,
and 2,781,174 in 1993.

Joint Venture Investment:  See Note M on page 24.

Future Accounting Changes:  The Company plans to adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS No.  121"), "Accounting for the impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of", effective
January 1, 1996.  Under SFAS No. 121, impairment losses are recognized when
information indicates the carrying amount of long-lived assets will not be
recovered through future operations or sale.  Impairment losses for assets to
be held or used in operations will be based on the excess of the carrying
amount of the asset over the asset's fair value.  SFAS No. 121 will be applied
prospectively from the date of adoption and, based on current circumstances,
management does not believe the effect of adoption will be material.

The Company also plans to adopt Statement of Accounting Standards No. 123
("SFAS No. 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based compensation" effective January
1, 1996.  SFAS No. 123 requires the use of an option pricing model to calculate
the value of stock-based compensation transactions, but then allows for two
alternative methods of reporting the transactions.  One method recognizes this
value as a cost of compensation and as an expense for the current period.  The
alternative method permits footnote disclosure of the compensation cost,
without charging the amount against earnings.  The Company intends to implement
the method which utilizes the footnote disclosure alternative and does not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123 to have a significant impact on
consolidated results of operations or financial position of the Company.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




NOTE A -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES (CONTINUED)

Cash Equivalents:  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Treasury Shares:  During 1991, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  An additional
authorization of 250,000 shares was made by the Board of Directors in March
1993.  As of December 31, 1994, a total of 628,900 shares had been purchased
under these authorizations.  The Company did not acquire any treasury stock
during 1995. The Company acquired 12,900 and 214,600 shares of its common stock
in 1994 and 1993 at prices averaging $13.52 and $16.03 per share, respectively.

Other Income:  Other income includes interest earned of $671,000 in 1995,
$791,000 in 1994, and $610,000 in 1993.  Other income also includes gains on
sales of fixed assets of $650,000 in 1995, $512,000 in 1994, and $159,000 in
1993.

Employee Benefits

The Company offers no significant post-employment or post-retirement benefits.

NOTE F -- STOCK OPTION PLANS

In May 1992, the stockholders approved the Whitehall Corporation Incentive
Stock Option Plan ("Incentive Plan") and the Whitehall Corporation Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors Plan").  The Incentive Plan provides
for the grant of incentive stock options for up to 325,000 shares of Common
Stock to key employees.  The Directors Plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options for up to 65,000 shares of Common Stock to non-employee Directors
of the Company.  Under the Plans, the exercise price for stock options will not
be less than the fair market value of the optioned stock at the date of grant.
The options granted generally become exercisable over a five-year period
beginning one year from the date of grant.  At December 31, 1995, 98,100
options were exercisable.  The option period under both Plans may not be more
than ten years from the date the option is granted.  Transactions involving the
Plans are summarized as follows:

NOTE I -- INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS

The Company operates in three segments: Ocean Systems, Aircraft Maintenance and
Electronics.  The Ocean Systems segment manufactures and sells  underwater
sensing systems used for naval surveillance and offshore geophysical surveys.
The Aircraft Maintenance segment rebuilds and modifies aircraft airframes and
electronic systems.  The Electronics segment manufactures and markets quartz
crystals and oscillators.

Operating profit represents total revenue less operating expenses, excluding
general corporate expenses and interest expense.  Total revenue for the
segments includes interest income earned by the segments of approximately
$12,000, $1,400, and $4,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Identifiable

Mr. Webster) and Cambridge Capital Fund, L.P., alleging, among other things,
that (i) the defendants' actions, both individually and in concert, constituted
willful interference with Mr. Webster's employment relationship with the
Company and were the direct cause of Mr. Webster's termination as its President
and Chairman of the Board, and (ii) the defendants' actions forced Mr. Webster
into retirement without providing Mr. Webster with retirement benefits which
Mr.  Webster was purportedly promised.  On August 17, 1994, the defendants were
granted a partial summary judgment.  On October 24, 1994, Mr. Webster filed a
third amended petition and alleged the following causes of action: tortious
interference with contractual relations against Cambridge Capital Fund, L.P.,
and directors George F. Baker and John J.  McAtee; intentional infliction of
emotional distress and breach of oral contracts.  The third amended petition
sought compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $35 million.  On January
12, 1995, the Court entered an abatement on one of the breach of oral contract
claims against the Company and entered a summary judgment in the defendants'
favor on all remaining claims alleged by Mr. Webster.  On February 26, 1996,
the Court granted a summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Mr.
Webster's remaining claims and entered a take nothing final judgment which
dismissed all of Mr.  Webster's claims with prejudice to refiling. On March 26,
1996, Mr. Webster  appealed the final judgment to the Dallas, Texas Court of
Appeals.  Management intends to vigorously defend the appeal.

         On September 22, 1992, Mr. Webster filed an action in the District
Court of Dallas County, Texas, against First City, Texas-Dallas ("First City"),
the Company and a former employee of the Company.  As receiver for First City,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has intervened and removed this case
to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  The petition
alleged, among other things, that (i) the Company interfered with Mr. Webster's
existing and prospective contractual relationship with the former employee and
First City, a national banking institution; (ii) the Company has converted to
its own use the former employee's Company stock which allegedly was owned by Mr.
Webster; (iii) the Company, First City and the employee conspired to commit
fraud against Mr. Webster; and (iv) the actions of the Company, First City, and
the former employee were intentionally done to cause Mr. Webster emotional
distress.  The petition sought, among other things, not less than $1 million in
compensatory damages, not less than $5 million in exemplary damages and not less
than $1 million as damages for emotional distress.  By orders dated June 2, 1994
and June 20, 1994, the Company was granted a summary judgment on all claims
alleged by Mr. Webster.  On July 31, 1995, the Court entered a final judgment
disposing of all claims alleged against all parties.  Mr. Webster has appealed
the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Management intends to vigorously defend the appeal.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




NOTE K -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)


Aero is taking remedial action pursuant  to Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") regulations at the Lake City, Florida facility.  The Company does not
anticipate any material direct effects upon the capital expenditures, earnings
and competitive position of the Company from compliance with present Federal,
State and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment.  The Company does expect, however, that
compliance with such regulations will require, from time to time, both
increased operating costs and capital expenditures which may be substantial.
As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company had reserved approximately
$625,000 and $736,000 respectively for anticipated environmental remediation
costs at the Aero facility.  The decrease in accrued environmental remediation
costs was due to expenditures and additional information obtained relating to
the nature and extent of required remediation.  The Company will install a clay
barrier over one section of the leased property and  additional testing
determined  another clay barrier will not be required over a second section of
the property.  Other remaining costs to be incurred will include testing and
monitoring to be performed over a 20 to 30 year period.  Actual costs to be
incurred in future periods may vary from the estimate, given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.  These uncertainties
include the extent of required remediation based on testing and evaluation not
yet completed and the varying costs and effectiveness of remediation methods.

The Company is also involved in certain legal proceedings in the normal course
of its business.

After consultation with counsel, management is of the opinion that the outcome
of the above-mentioned proceedings will not have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

To comply with the financial assurances required by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP), the Company requested and a bank issued a
$2,800,000 standby letter of credit in favor of the FDEP.  This letter of
credit meets all conditions required by the FDEP.

In January 1996, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with a
bank for a total availability of $8 million.

NOTE L -- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

On December 31, 1995, two officers of the Company were indebted to the Company
in the aggregate amount of approximately $363,000.  This amount is classified
as accounts receivable and is fully reserved.

A company owned by an officer of the Company was paid $9,000 in 1994 and
$66,000 in 1993 for facilities and services provided in connection with Company
functions held for personnel and clients.

The Company paid $12,000 in 1995 and $18,400 in 1994 in consulting fees to a
member of the Board of Directors.
