                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     Wyle Electronics (the "Company") is a leading international electronics
distributor marketing semiconductors and computer products, as well as providing
value-added services. These services include complex materials management
systems and engineering design services for application-specific integrated
circuits, including field and programmable logic devices. Wyle Electronics,
formerly Wyle Laboratories, was founded in 1949 and incorporated in California
in 1953.

     On January 2, 1996, the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock
of Sylvan Ginsbury, Ltd., a New Jersey corporation, and certain affiliated
entities ("Ginsbury"), an international distributor of active, passive and
interconnect electronic products with operations in the United States and six
European countries.

     On December 23, 1994, the Company completed the sale of its Scientific
Services & Systems ("SS&S") business to a buy-out group led by William E. Simon
& Sons and certain members of the SS&S management along with two former and one
current member of the Company's Board of Directors.

     In January 1995, the Company changed its name from Wyle Laboratories to
Wyle Electronics to more accurately reflect the Company's business activities
following the sale of discontinued operations.

                          CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS SERVED
                          ----------------------------
                                        
     The Company serves a broad base of customers in the computer,
telecommunications, military and industrial markets. The Company believes it
offers its products and services in all major electronic products markets within
the United States, through a network of 33 sales facilities. The Company's sales
facilities are located in Huntsville, Alabama; Phoenix, Arizona; Garden Grove,
Irvine, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Santa Clara, California; Denver,
Colorado; Wallingford, Connecticut; Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa, Florida;
Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Boston Massachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pine Brook, New Jersey; Long Island and Rochester, New
York; Raleigh, North Carolina; Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio; Portland, Oregon;
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Austin, Dallas and Houston, Texas; Provo and Salt
Lake City, Utah; Seattle, Washington; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

     With the acquisition of Ginsbury, the Company also provides products and
services to European markets from sales locations in Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

                                       1
<PAGE>
 
                      PRODUCTS SOLD AND SERVICES RENDERED

     The Company stocks approximately 35,000 items from over 50 electronic
component and computer product suppliers.  Principal products distributed
include semiconductors and computer products (e.g., microcomputer systems, board
level subsystems and peripherals).  For the year ended December 31, 1995,
semiconductor and computer product sales represented approximately 75% and 25%,
respectively, of total sales.

     Most manufacturers of electronic components and computer products rely on
industrial distributors to augment their own sales and marketing operations.
Distributors provide stocking, marketing, technical, design and financing
services, reducing a manufacturer's operating costs associated with stocking and
selling its products.  These services also reduce the manufacturer's investment
in finished goods inventories and accounts receivable, while providing
geographically dispersed sales and delivery capabilities.

     During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company's ten largest
suppliers, which in aggregate represented 80% of its sales, were Intel, Digital
Equipment Corporation, Texas Instruments, Motorola, Advanced Micro Devices,
Altera, Quantum, Micron Technology, LSI Logic and Philips. For the year ended
December 31, 1995, Intel and Digital Equipment Corporation, the Company's two
largest suppliers, accounted for approximately 17% and 12%, respectively, of its
sales.

     The Company focuses on providing higher complexity semiconductor products
such as user-configurable and fixed ASIC (application-specific integrated
circuit) devices.  The Company distributes a full range of semiconductor
technologies, from discrete transistors through field programmable logic and
gate arrays.

     The principal computer products offered by the Company include medium and
small scale multi-user systems, workstations, personal computers, motherboards
and related peripheral equipment products.  The Company's peripheral equipment
products include mass storage products, terminals, controllers, and printers.

     The Company provides specialized value-added services such as kitting,
turnkey manufacturing, autoreplenishment, design engineering, programming and
testing of semiconductor products, computer systems integration and technical
support. These value-added services are designed to enhance the competitiveness
of the Company's customers by providing cost efficiencies and the ability to
introduce products into the marketplace more quickly and efficiently.

     The Company's Liberty Contract Services operation provides management
services for materials and complex inventory processes for customers in areas
such as kitting, turnkey manufacturing, autoreplenishment, final assembly and
test, and systems integration. This operation offers customers value-added
services of varying levels of complexity from the traditional distributor
function, through fully-integrated just-in-time inventory management systems.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
     Under its kitting program, Liberty Contract Services provides the complete
bill-of-materials of components for a customer's product which is inspected and
packaged in production-ready kit form to customer specifications. Completed kits
are typically shipped directly to the customer's production line on a just-in-
time (JIT) basis. Turnkey manufacturing solutions are offered through alliances
with independent contract manufacturers as an extension of the Company's
JIT/kitting business. Under such arrangements, the Company supplies components
directly to contract manufacturers who perform assembly and test to produce a
completed product, such as a printed circuit board, to customer specifications .

     The Company's design engineers, located in the field, provide capabilities
to develop customized semiconductor products for unique customer applications.
The Company operates seven IDEAL(R) (Integrated Design Engineering And Logic)
centers that provide customers with services such as programming, testing and
symbolization in a controlled environment for programmable logic devices.
Products from suppliers such as Actel, Advanced Micro Devices, Altera, Intel,
Motorola, Philips and Texas Instruments can be programmed and tested at these
centers as required by individual customers.

     The Company's System Enhancement Center, located in Phoenix, Arizona,
provides a full range of value-added services for integration of system and
peripheral products to a particular customer requirement. System Enhancement
Center personnel perform design engineering and all aspects of systems
integration, including systems configuration, networking and software
verification, as well as assembly and testing.

     In September 1995, the Company completed the construction of its 200,000
square foot Value-Added Distribution Center. This high-technology facility will
support the further growth of the Company's value-added services and allow for
the consolidation of existing warehouse activities into one location. The
Company has begun relocating its existing warehouses and a portion of its value-
added services. The transition is expected to be completed by mid-1996.

                          RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPPLIERS

     The Company has distribution agreements with its component and computer
products manufacturers. Distribution agreements are nonexclusive and are subject
to cancellation at will or upon 30 days' notice. Although the loss of a major
supplier could significantly impact operating results, the Company does not
regard any one supplier of products to be essential to its operations. In
addition, the Company believes that most products currently sold are available
from other suppliers at competitive prices.

                                       3
<PAGE>
     The Company's distribution agreements generally provide, among other
things, that the Company can return inventory declared obsolete by the
manufacturer or inventory in excess of current requirements, up to a specified
percentage of the dollar amount purchased from the manufacturer. Most
manufacturers protect the Company against subsequent manufacturer price
reductions by issuing credits to the Company with respect to the affected
product in the Company's inventory. As part of its value-added services, the
Company purchases certain products from suppliers that have not entered into
distribution agreements with the Company. Consequently, the Company may not
receive the same level of inventory protection as that available under its
distribution agreements, particularly the ability to return obsolete or excess
inventory.

                                  RISK FACTORS

      The Company intends to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company's business is
subject to intense competition from international, national, regional and local
independent distributors along with direct sales by manufacturers. The principal
factors of competition are quality of service, price, variety and availability
of products carried and value-added services capability.

     The Company's business is affected by the cyclical nature of the
electronics industry and the effect of general economic and market conditions.
The electronics distribution industry is highly sensitive to fluctuating market
conditions, primarily caused by changes in the supply and demand for
semiconductors and computer products, which can dramatically effect market
prices and product availability. Accordingly, the Company's financial results
may reflect significant variations from period-to-period due to these factors.

     In addition to the potential adverse impact of the above factors, the
Company cautions that its future financial results also could be negatively
affected by various other circumstances which include, but are not limited to:
loss of significant supplier franchises or material changes in supplier
distribution agreements affecting pricing, inventory obsolescence protection or
other terms; loss of significant customers; uncollectible customer accounts
receivable; inventory obsolescence and other charges related to non-franchised
product; losses due to substantial damage or destruction of major facilities and
contents; technological obsolescence of machinery, equipment and software;
increased selling and administrative expense due to changes in business
strategies, asset valuations and organizational structures; inability to
successfully access capital markets; and the affect of governmental regulations
including those relative to environmental matters.


                                    BACKLOG

     Most orders received by the Company are for short-term delivery.
Consequently, the dollar amount of unfilled orders is subject to rapid change
and represents customer orders for products for which the Company is awaiting
delivery from the manufacturer, or customer orders for products with delivery
dates scheduled as much as twelve months in advance.  However, since these
orders are for products normally stocked, cancellation of an order would not
have a significant effect on the operations of the Company.

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
                                   EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed a total of 1,452 persons.

              FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

     There is hereby incorporated by reference the information appearing in Note
11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report
to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 1995.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     At December 31, 1995, the Company had facility leases for its marketing,
inventory and distribution activities, with terms expiring from 1996 through
2003, aggregating 381,566 square feet located in Arizona, California, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. The
Company has a lease for 512,180 square feet of land in Arizona, on which its new
Value-Added Distribution Center is located, that expires in 2014.

     The Company also occupies owned facilities in Alabama, Arizona and
California totaling 314,757 square feet. The Company believes that its
facilities are in good operating condition, well-maintained and adequate for its
present needs.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- --------------------------

     In May 1993, Avnet, Inc. ("Avnet") and Hall-Mark Electronics Corporation
("Hall-Mark") filed a civil action against the Company and a former employee of
Hall-Mark in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, seeking injunctive
and unspecified monetary damages, alleging inter alia, that the Company
tortiously interfered with the employment relations of Hall-Mark and its
employees and that the Company tortiously interfered with a proposed business
combination between the plaintiffs, which combination was consummated
subsequently.  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was denied in
part by the trial court and affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court in December
1993.  The Company filed a counterclaim against plaintiffs, alleging, inter
alia, that plaintiffs had tortiously interfered with the Company's business and
employment relations. On October 31, 1995, plaintiffs dismissed their claims
without prejudice in Georgia, and the Georgia court then entered summary
judgment against the Company on the counterclaim and dismissed same.

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
     In September 1995, the plaintiffs had refiled the same action against the
Company and certain Company employees in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough
County, Florida, which the Company has now moved to dismiss. The Florida
litigation is still pending. While this litigation is in the pretrial stage, the
Company believes that plaintiffs' complaint is without merit and will contest it
vigorously.  The Company recorded a special charge of $1,900,000 during the
third quarter of 1994, primarily for anticipated legal expenses associated with
the defense of this litigation.  Although management cannot predict the ultimate
outcome with any certainty, management believes that a result adverse to the
Company in this matter is unlikely.

     The Company also has other contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary
course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
such matters will not materially affect the Company's results of operations or
financial position.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 1995.

To Wyle Electronics:


     We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial statements included in Wyle Electronics' Annual
Report to Shareholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have
issued our report thereon dated February 16, 1996.  Our audits were made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The
schedule listed in the accompanying index is the responsibility of the Company's
management and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and

statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audits of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole.

                                   AGREEMENT



     This Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of January 1,
1995, by and between Charles M. Clough ("Clough") and Wyle Laboratories, a
California corporation (the "Company") with reference to the following facts.

     Clough  is currently serving as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company under that certain Employment Agreement dated February 1,
1989, as amended (the "Prior Agreement").  Clough has been an essential,
instrumental ingredient in the growth and success of the Company's Electronics
Marketing Group business and the Company overall during a twelve-year period.

     The Company and Clough have had extensive discussions regarding Clough's
desire to retire as an employee at the close of business on March 31, 1995, and
Clough's role with the Company in future years following such retirement.  In
order to induce Clough to continue his relationship with, and to devote his
singular efforts to, the Company, during and following his employment, the
parties hereto propose to enter into this Agreement and to replace and supersede
the Prior Agreement effective January 1, 1995.

     The parties therefore agree as follows:


     1.  Scope of Services.
         ----------------- 

     1.1  Title & Duties.  Clough shall continue to serve as Chairman of the
          --------------                                                    
Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company through March 31, 1995.  As of
the close of business on March 31, 1995, Clough will relinquish his position and
the title of Chief Executive Officer and shall retire as an employee from the
Company.  From April 1, 1995 until the 1998 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,
currently scheduled for May 12, 1998, Mr. Clough shall retain the title of
Chairman of the Board and serve as an outside director of the Company, subject
to the approval of the shareholders, thereby allowing another individual to
assume the position and title of Chief Executive Officer.

     1.2  Place.  Clough shall not be required to perform any duties as
          -----                                                        
described in section 1.1 at any place other than in the County of Orange, State
of California, except insofar as his duties shall require reasonable business
trips and/or visits to suppliers or customers or Company facilities.

                                      -1-
<PAGE>
 
     2.  Extent of Services; Noncompetition.
         ---------------------------------- 

     2.1  General.  It is recognized that the services to be rendered by Clough
          -------                                                              
are of such a nature as to be peculiarly rendered by Clough, encompass the
individual ability of Clough and cannot be measured exclusively in terms of
hours or services rendered in any particular period.  Clough agrees to devote
his best efforts to the performance of his duties and exclusively to advance the
interests of the Company, which interests shall include the allocation of a
reasonable amount of Clough's time to the Company's Electronics Marketing Group.

     2.2  Vacation.  From January 1, 1995 through March 31, 1995, Clough shall
          --------                                                            
be entitled to such vacations and other absences from work as shall be
reasonably consistent with the performance of his duties as provided in this
Agreement.

     2.3  Noncompetition.  Clough agrees that during the term of this Agreement
          --------------                                                       
and for a period of two years thereafter, he will neither directly nor
indirectly engage in a business competing with any of the businesses conducted
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in any county in the
state of California and each state of the United States, nor without the prior
written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
have any interest in, own, manage, operate, control, be connected with as a
stockholder, joint venturer, officer, employee, partner or consultant, or
otherwise engage, invest or participate in any business which is competitive
with any of the businesses conducted by the Company or by any subsidiary or
affiliate of the Company; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
section 2.3 shall prevent Clough from investing or trading in stocks, bonds,
commodities, securities, real estate or other forms of investment for his own
account and benefit (directly or indirectly), so long as such investment
activities do not significantly interfere with Clough's services to be rendered
hereunder and are consistent with the conflict of interest provisions contained
in the Company's Business Ethics Policy as it exists from time to time.

     3.  Term.  Subject to the provisions for earlier termination provided
         ----                                                             
herein, the term of this Agreement shall continue through the 1998 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders, currently scheduled for May 12, 1998, and will then
terminate, or on June 30, 1998, whichever date shall first occur (the
"Termination Date").

     4.  Compensation.
         ------------ 

     4.1  Cash Compensation.  The Company shall compensate Clough for services
          -----------------                                                   
rendered under this Agreement as set forth below, it being is understood by the
parties that Clough will remain eligible to participate in the Company's
executive bonus plan for calendar year 1994.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
     (a) Effective January 1, 1995 through March 31, 1995, Clough will be
compensated at a salary of $75,000 per month, and shall have no incentive
compensation participation for calendar year 1995.

     (b) Effective April 1, 1995 through the Termination Date, Clough will
receive for services as Chairman of the Board an annual fee of $250,000, payable
monthly, such fee to be inclusive of any and all director and committee fees.

     4.2  Benefits.
          -------- 

     (a) Employee Benefits.  Until Clough's scheduled retirement as a full time
         -----------------                                                     
employee at the close of business on March 31, 1995, Clough shall be entitled to
receive fringe benefits consistent with his duties and position, which benefits
shall be no less than those to which he is entitled as of the date hereof,
including, but not limited to all plans of life, accident, health, salary
continuation and other insurance which is or becomes generally available to
other employees, officers or executives of the Company and participation in the
Company's Retirement Plan.  Clough shall be provided with a full time use of an
automobile consistent with the Company's corporate executive policy on
automobiles as in effect from time to time.  The Company reserves the right to
modify, suspend or discontinue any and all of its fringe benefits referred to in
this section 4.2 at any time without recourse by Clough so long as such action
is taken generally with respect to other similarly situated peer executives and
does not single out Clough.

     (b) Post-Employment Benefits.  Effective April 1, 1995, Clough shall be
         ------------------------                                           
entitled to appropriate office space and secretarial services at the Company's
corporate office, Irvine, California.  He shall also be entitled to participate
in outside director benefit plans as may be in effect from time to time,
including the Outside Directors' Retirement Plan, the Deferred Directors'
Compensation Plan and the 1993 Eligible Directors' Stock Option Plan.

     4.3  Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, Clough shall be
          --------                                                     
reimbursed for all expenses reasonably incurred in the furtherance of the
business of the Company.  Clough shall keep complete and accurate records of all
expenditures such that Clough may fully account to the Board of Directors, if
requested, or as may then be required by the Internal Revenue Service.

     4.4  Automobile Transfer Bonus.  Upon Clough's retirement as a full time
          -------------------------                                          
employee, the Company shall transfer to Clough without charge the automobile he
is then using under section 4.2 hereof.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
     5.  Confidential Information.
         ------------------------ 

     5.1  General.  Clough acknowledges that during his employment by, and as a
          -------                                                              
result of his relationship with, the Company he has obtained knowledge of and
has gained access to information regarding the Company's business, operations,
products, proposed products, production methods, processes, customer lists,
advertising, marketing and promotional plans and materials, price lists, price
policies, financial information and other trade secrets, confidential
information and material proprietary to the Company or designated as being
confidential by the Company which is not generally known to non-Company
personnel, including information and material originated, discovered or
developed in whole or in part by Clough (collectively referred to herein as
"Confidential Information").  Clough agrees that during the term of this
Agreement and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, thereafter, he will, in a
fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company, hold all Confidential
Information strictly in confidence and will not directly or indirectly reveal,
report, disclose, publish or transfer any of such Confidential Information to
any person, firm or other entity, or utilize any of the Confidential Information
for any purpose, except in furtherance of his services under this Agreement.

     5.2  Return of Materials.  Clough agrees that upon the expiration or
          -------------------                                            
earlier termination of this Agreement, he will, at the Company's request,
surrender and return to the Company all lists, books, records and other
Confidential Information of the Company, or obtained in connection with the
Company's business, it being expressly acknowledged by Clough that all such
items are the exclusive property of the Company, and all other property
belonging to the Company then in the possession of Clough, and Clough shall not
make or retain any copies thereof.

     6.  Termination Prior to Termination Date.  Clough's rights under this
         -------------------------------------                             
Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of the term of this
Agreement (as provided in section 3 hereof) only as provided in this section 6.

     6.1  Discharge or Resignation.
          ------------------------ 

     (a) Clough may be discharged prior to the Termination Date (1) for "Just
Cause"; or (2) upon 60 days written notice, even if "Just Cause" does not exist.

     (b) For a discharge which occurs prior to a "Change in Control," as defined
herein, "Just Cause" shall mean that the Company, acting in good faith based
upon the information then known to the Company, determines that Clough has:  (1)
committed a material breach of his duties and responsibilities to the Company
(other than as a result of incapacity due to Clough's disability); or (2) been
convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude; or (3) refused to perform his
required 

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
duties and responsibilities or performed them incompetently; or (4)
violated any fiduciary duty to the Company; or (5) taken actions which are
injurious to the Company and which involve moral turpitude or actual malice
towards the Company.  For a discharge which occurs coincident with or after a
"Change in Control," "Just Cause" shall mean (x) Clough's conviction of a crime
involving moral turpitude; or (y) actions of Clough which are injurious to the
Company and involve moral turpitude or actual malice toward the Company.

     (c) Clough may resign prior to the term of this Agreement (1) for "Good
Reason"; or (2) upon 60 days written notice, even if "Good Reason" does not
exist.  Regardless of whether a resignation occurs prior to, coincident with or
after a "Change in Control," "Good Reason" shall mean the material failure by
the Company to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, to the extent not
remedied in a reasonable period of time after receipt of written notice by
Clough specifying the material failure by the Company.  Any reduction or
attempted reduction of compensation or benefits below that required by section 4
or services to be rendered in section 1.1 is deemed material.  For a resignation
which occurs coincident with or following a Change in Control, "Good Reason"
shall also mean the failure by the Company or its successors to assume expressly
and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company would be required to perform it if a Change in Control had not
occurred.

     (d)  (1)  If Clough is discharged for "Just Cause" or resigns without "Good
Reason," the Company shall not be obligated to pay Clough any sums of money
other than all compensation and benefits due Clough as of the date of his
discharge or resignation.

     (2) If Clough is discharged without "Just Cause" or resigns for "Good
Reason," Clough shall be entitled to the following:

     (i)       all compensation and benefits due Clough as of the date of
               discharge or resignation; plus

     (ii)      A lump sum payment equal to the present value of the compensation
               which would be received by Clough through the term of this
               Agreement had the resignation or discharge not occurred.  The
               present value shall be determined by using the applicable federal
               mid-term rate, compounded monthly, as determined under Section
               127(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
               "Code"), or its successor, as of the date of discharge or
               resignation.  The entire lump-sum amount shall be paid within 30
               days of the date of resignation or discharge.  Clough shall have
               no duty to mitigate or attempt to mitigate his 

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
damages.

     (e)  (1)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
payments to Clough which constitute "parachute payments," as defined in Section
280G of the Code, shall be limited, if necessary, so that the maximum amount of
such payments to the Clough shall be one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount
which would cause the payments to Clough (including payments to Clough which are
not included in this Agreement) to be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code.

     (2) Any determination that payments to Clough must be limited and the
assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by
Arthur Andersen LLP  (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to the Company and Clough within 15 business days
of the time such calculation is requested by the Company or Clough.  In the
event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the
individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, Clough shall
appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations
required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne solely by the Company.  If the Accounting Firm determines that payments
to Clough shall be limited, it shall furnish Clough with written opinion that
failure to limit the payments would result in the imposition of a tax under
Section 4999 of the Code.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon the Company and Clough.  As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination
by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that payments to Clough which
will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment").
The Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has
occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or
for the benefit of Clough.  In the event that any payment made to Clough shall
be determined by the Accounting Firm to result in the imposition of any tax
under Section 4999 of the Code, Clough shall promptly reimburse the Company for
the amount of such excess together with interest on such amount (at the same
rate as is applied to determine the present value of payments under Section 280G
(or any successor thereto), from the date the reimbursable payment was received
by Clough to the date the same is repaid to the Company.  The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the amount of any such reimbursement shall be deemed
never paid to Clough.

     (f) For purposes of this Agreement; a "Change of Control" shall be deemed
to have occurred if (1) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) is or becomes the "beneficial
owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
1934), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 35% or
more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities;
or (2) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the
beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, unless
the election, or the nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, of
each new Board member was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths of the
Board members then still in office who were Board members at the beginning of
such period.

     6.2  Disability.  If the Company in good faith determines that Clough has
          ----------                                                          
become ill or injured and such illness or injury will prevent Clough from
performing the services required under this Agreement for a period of more than
12 consecutive months on substantially a full time basis, the Company may give
Clough written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement.  Such
termination shall become effective 30 days after receipt of such notice by
Clough, provided that, within 30 days after such receipt, Clough shall not have
returned to full time performance of his duties.  If Clough is so terminated,
Clough shall be entitled to receive his full compensation and benefits until the
expiration of 12 months from the date on which he was first unable to
substantially perform his duties hereunder.

     6.3  Death.  The death of Clough shall result in automatic termination of
          -----                                                               
this Agreement, and the Company shall not be obligated to pay the estate or
personal representative of Clough any sums of money other than any and all
compensation and benefits due Clough at the date of his death and bonus for the
period prior to death.

     7.  Arbitration.
         ----------- 

     7.1  General.  Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating
          -------                                                               
to this Agreement, the breach hereof or the coverage or enforceability of this
arbitration provision shall be settled by arbitration in Orange County,
California, conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, as such rules are in effect in Orange County
on the date of delivery of demand for arbitration.  The arbitration of any such
issue, including the determination of the amount of any damages suffered by
either party hereto by reason of the acts or omissions of the other, shall be to
the exclusion of any court of law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party
hereto may seek any provisional remedy in a court, including but not limited to
an action for injunctive relief or attachment, without waiving the right to
arbitration.

     7.2  Procedure.  There shall be three arbitrators, one to be chosen by each
          ---------                                                             
party at will within 10 days from the date of delivery of demand for arbitration
and the third arbitrator to be selected by the two arbitrators so chosen.  If
the two 

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
arbitrators are unable to select a third arbitrator within 10 days after
the last of the two arbitrators is chosen by the parties, the third arbitrator
will be designated, on application by either party, by the American Arbitration
Association.  The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and
binding on both parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
personal representatives, successors and assigns. The Company shall have the
burden of proving Just Cause for any discharge of Clough under section 6.1
hereof; for a resignation which occurs prior to a Change in Control, Clough
shall have the burden of proving Good Reason, and for a resignation which occur
after a Change in Control, the Company shall have the burden of proving that
Good Reason did not exist.  Judgment upon any award of the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to any such
court for the judicial acceptance of the award and for an order of enforcement.

     7.3  Costs and Expenses.  The Company shall pay the fees of all
          ------------------                                        
arbitrators, witnesses and such other expenses as may be generated by the
arbitration, except Clough's attorneys fees, unless a majority of the
arbitrators concludes that such arbitration procedure was not instituted in good
faith by Clough.  In such event the arbitrators shall be empowered to allocate
fees and assess costs and other expenses of the arbitration, except attorneys
fees, as they may deem appropriate, bearing in mind the relative financial
abilities of the parties and the respective merits of their positions.

     8.  Non-Assignment.  This Agreement shall not be assignable nor the duties
         --------------                                                        
hereunder delegable by Clough.  None of the payments hereunder may be
encumbered, transferred or in any way anticipated.  The Company shall not assign
this Agreement nor shall it transfer all or any substantial part of its assets
without first obtaining in conjunction with such transfer the express assumption
of the obligations hereof by the assignee or transferee.

     9.  Remedies.  Clough acknowledges that the services he is to render under
         --------                                                              
this Agreement are of a unique and special nature, the loss of which cannot
reasonably or adequately be compensated for in monetary damages, and that
irreparable injury and damage will result to the Company in the event of any
default or breach of this Agreement by Clough.  Because of the unique nature of
the Confidential Information, Clough further acknowledges and agrees that the
Company will suffer irreparable harm if Clough fails to comply with his
obligations in section 5 hereof and that monetary damages would be inadequate to
compensate the Company for such breach.  Accordingly, Clough agrees that the
Company will, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law, in
equity or, without limitation, otherwise, be entitled to injunctive relief
and/or specific performance to enforce the terms, or prevent or remedy the
violation, of any provisions of this Agreement.  This provision shall not
constitute a waiver by the Company of any rights to damages or other remedies
which it may have 

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
 
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

     10.  Survival.  The provisions of sections 5, 7 and 9 shall survive the
          --------                                                          
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

     11.  Notices.  Any notices or other communications relating to this
          -------

                                RETIREMENT PLAN
                   FOR OUTSIDE DIRECTORS OF WYLE ELECTRONICS
                     (AS AMENDED EFFECTIVE AUGUST 31, 1995)


     1.  Establishment of Plan.
         --------------------- 

     There is hereby established for the benefit of the directors of Wyle
Electronics (the "Company") who are not employees of the Company (the "Outside
Directors") an unfunded plan of deferred compensation to be known as the
"Outside Directors Retirement Plan" (the "Plan").

     2.  Effective Date.
         -------------- 

     This plan shall be effective as of January 1, 1995 (the "Effective Date").

     3.  Eligibility and Participation.
         ----------------------------- 

         (a) All Outside Directors presently serving on the Board of Directors
of the Company (the "Board") shall be eligible and become participants in this
Plan ("Participants") upon the Effective Date. Each Outside Director hereafter
elected to the Board shall be eligible and become a Participant upon his or her
acceptance of election to the Board.

         (b) A copy of this Plan shall be given to all Participants.

         (c) A Participant shall cease to be a Participant upon the earlier of
(i) the payment of the total amount of the Participant's vested Accrued Benefit
under Section 5; (ii) the payment of the total amount payable to the Participant
under Section 11; (iii) the Participant's death; or (iv) the date the
Participant ceases to be director of the Company if on such date the Participant
is not 100% vested in his or her Accrued Benefit.

                                       1
<PAGE>
 
     4.  Accrued Benefit and Vesting.
         --------------------------- 

         (a) The "Accrued Benefit" of a Participant as of any date is the
Participant's Normal Retirement Benefit.

         (b) The Accrued Benefit of a Participant shall vest only in accordance
with the following schedule:

             Consecutive 12-Month
             Periods of Service as      Vested Percentage
             an Outside Director       of Accrued Benefit
             ----------------------    -------------------

             Less than five                  None

             Five or more                    100%

     5.  Benefits.
         --------
 
         (a) Normal Retirement Benefit.  Commencing upon a Participant's Normal
             -------------------------                                         
Retirement Date (as defined in Paragraph (b) of this Section 5), and except as
provided in Paragraph (d) of this Section 5, the Company shall pay a Participant
while living an annual benefit (the "Normal Retirement Benefit") in the amount
equal to 100% of the Outside Director retainer in effect at the time of the
Participant's Normal Retirement Date, for the lesser of 10 years or the number
of years equal to the number of consecutive 12-month periods (including periods
prior to the effective date of this Plan) the Participant served as an Outside
Director of the Company.

         (b) Normal Retirement Date. A Participant shall have reached the
             ----------------------  
"Normal Retirement Date" upon the later of (1) the date the Participant attains
age 65 or (ii) the date the Participant actually retires from the Board, i.e.,
the date the Participant ceases to be a director (other than a "Director
Emeritus") of the Company.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
         (c) Payment of Normal Retirement Benefit. The Normal Retirement Benefit
             ------------------------------------
payable in the year a Participant reaches the Normal Retirement Date shall be
pro rated for that portion of the Company's current fiscal year after the
Participant reaches the Normal Retirement Date. Such pro rated benefit shall be
due within 30 days after the Participant reaches the Normal Retirement Date.
Thereafter, the Normal Retirement Benefit shall be due on February 1 of each
succeeding year.

         (d) Cessation Upon Death.  Upon the death of a Participant, all Normal
             --------------------                                              
Retirement Benefits payable hereunder after the date of death shall cease;
provided, however, that the estate of the deceased Outside Director shall remain
entitled to any Normal Retirement Benefits paid (or due but not yet paid) prior
to the date of death.

         (e) Increase in Normal Retirement Benefit. In the event that the Plan
             -------------------------------------
is amended to increase the amount of the Normal Retirement Benefit, such
increase for Participants currently receiving payments under the Plan shall be
prospective only.

     6.  Accounting.
         ---------- 

     No fund or escrow deposit shall be established for any benefits payable
pursuant to this Plan, and the obligation to pay benefits hereunder shall be a
general unsecured obligation of the Company.  The Secretary of the Company shall
keep a record of the vested amount of the Accrued Benefit of each Participant.
Within sixty (60) days after the close of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall
furnish each Participant with a statement of the vested amount of the
Participant's then Accrued Benefit as of the last day of the preceding fiscal
year.

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
     7.  Nonalienation of Benefits.
         ------------------------- 

     No right or benefit under this Plan shall be subject to anticipation,
alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to
alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber of charge the same shall be void.  No
right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the
debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the person entitled to such right or
benefit, nor shall any right or benefit be subject to attachment for legal
process.

     8.  Amendment or Termination of Plan.
         -------------------------------- 

     The Board may amend or terminate this Plan at any time; provided, however,
that any amendment or termination of this Plan shall not affect the rights of ny
Participant to continued payments or payments upon retirement in accordance with
Section 5 of the Participant's vested Accrued Benefit as of the time of such
amendment or termination. Thus, for example, if at the time of amendment or
termination of this Plan, a Participant has served as an Outside Director for 10
years, then regardless of the Participant's age, no amendment or termination of
this Plan may affect the Participant's right to the payment of a Normal
Retirement Benefit for 10 years following the Normal Retirement Date as provided
in Section 5.

     9.  Administration.
         -------------- 

     This Plan shall be administered by the Board, which shall interpret the
Plan, adopt and revise rules and regulations relating to the Plan and make any
other determinations which it believes necessary or advisable for the proper
administration

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
of the Plan.  The interpretation and construction of the Plan or any of its
provisions by the Board shall be final.

     10.  Merger or Consolidation.
          ----------------------- 

     In the event of a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party
but of which it is not the surviving corporation, the Board will make provision
in connection with such transaction for the continuance of this Plan and the
assumption of all liabilities for Accrued Benefits to which Participants are
entitled.

     11.  Effect of Change of Control.
          --------------------------- 

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control, unless
prior to the date of such Change of Control a Participant has elected in writing
by notice delivered to the Secretary of the Company that this Section 11 shall
not apply with respect to such Change of Control, the rights of each Participant
in his or her Accrued Benefit shall thereupon become fully vested and
nonforfeitable notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, and the Company
shall pay each Participant, within 10 days after the date of such Change of
Control, a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the present value, as of
the date of such lump sum payment, of either:

     (a) If benefits are not then being paid to such Participant pursuant to
this Plan, the benefits which would but for the provisions of this Section 11
otherwise have thereafter been payable to him or her pursuant to the Plan upon
the Participant's reaching his or her Normal Retirement Date; provided, however,
that in calculating the amount of such benefits, the Participant shall be 100%
vested in his or her Accrued 

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
Benefit; and further provided, however, that in calculating the amount of such
benefits, the Participant shall be credited for, and the amount of benefits
shall be based on, the number of consecutive 12-month periods (including periods
prior to the effective date of this Plan) that the Participant served as an
Outside Director of the Company through the date of such Change of Control; or

     (b) if benefits are then being paid to such Participant pursuant to this
Plan, the benefits which would but for the provisions of this Section 22
otherwise thereafter be payable to him or her or them pursuant to this Plan.

     When such payment has been made, the Participant shall have no further
rights under this Plan.  For purposes hereof (i) in determining the amount of
benefits which would have been payable or are thereafter payable pursuant to
this Plan, the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table shall be employed; (ii) the
present value of the benefits which would have been payable or are thereafter
payable pursuant to this Plan shall be determined by using a discount rate equal
to 100 percent of the applicable Federal Rate (determined under Section 1274(d)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) for the month during which the
lump sum payment is required to be made pursuant to this Section 11, compounded
semiannually; (iii) if benefits are not then being paid to a Participant as of
the date of such Change of Control, then in employing the mortality table to
determine the amount of such Participant benefits pursuant to clause (i) above,
and in determining the present value of such amount pursuant to clause (ii)
above, it shall be assumed that the Company would have commenced the payment of
such benefits to such Participant upon the later of (x) the 

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
Participant's 65th birthday, or (y) the date of such Change of Control; and (iv)
a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if any "person" (as such
term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
then outstanding securities; or during any period of two consecutive years,
individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") cease for any reason to constitute at
least a majority thereof, unless the election, or the nomination for election by
the Company's shareholders, of each new Board member was approved by a vote of
at least three-fourths of the Board members then still in office who were Board
members at the beginning of such period.

Stock shall be subject to full compliance with all then applicable requirements
of law and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock of
the Corporation may be listed.

investment and not with a view to their resale or distribution, (ii) that upon
such purchase, the Employee will furnish to the Corporation an investment letter
in form and substance satisfactory to the Corporation, (iii) prior to selling or
offering for sale any such shares, the Employee will furnish the Corporation
with an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it to the effect that such sale may
lawfully be made and will furnish it with such certificates as to factual
matters as it may reasonably request, and (iv) that certificates representing
such shares may be marked with an appropriate legend describing such conditions
precedent to sale or transfer.

Bank shall be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit or purchase a
participation, as applicable, if (w) such issuance or purchase would cause such
Bank's portion of the aggregate Stated Amount outstanding plus the aggregate
amount of such Bank's Loans outstanding to exceed such Bank's Commitment; (x)
such issuance or purchase would cause such Bank's portion of the aggregate
Stated Amount outstanding to exceed such Bank's Percentage times the Letter of

Stated Amount outstanding plus the aggregate amount of all Loans outstanding to
exceed the aggregate Commitments; or (z) such issuance or purchase would cause
the aggregate Stated Amount outstanding to exceed the Letter of Credit
Commitment.

               2.1.2  Loans. Each Bank will make loans to the Company on a

of all Loans outstanding plus the aggregate Stated Amount outstanding to exceed
the aggregate Commitments. Any bid loans made from time to time to the Company

assume that such Bank has made such amount available to the Agent and, in

available to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent in such
circumstances has made available to the Company such amount, that Bank shall on
the Business Day following such borrowing date make such amount available to the
Agent, together with interest at the

                                     - 17 -

interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such borrowing, at a
rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans
comprising such borrowing.  Nothing set forth in this clause (a) shall relieve

          (b)  Unless the Agent receives notice from the Company prior to the
due date for any payment hereunder that the Company does not intend to make such
payment, the Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment and, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to each Bank its share of such
payment. If and to the extent that the Company has not made any such payment to
the Agent, each Bank which received a share of such payment shall repay such
share (or the relevant portion thereof) to the Agent forthwith on demand,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date repaid by such Bank.
Nothing set forth in this clause (b) shall relieve the Company of any obligation
                          ----------

San Francisco time, on the proposed date of such conversion, and (b) in the case
of a conversion into or continuation of a Eurodollar Loan, 10:00 a.m., San

of issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each such notice shall be accompanied by a
Letter of Credit Application, duly executed by the Company and in all respects
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, together with such other documentation as the
Issuing Bank may reasonably request in support thereof, it being understood that
each Letter of Credit Application shall specify, among other things, the date on
which the proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued and the expiration date of
such Letter of Credit (which shall not extend beyond the earlier of (i) one year
from the date of issuance or (ii) thirty days prior to the Termination Date).
Such notice and Letter of Credit Application may be delivered to the Issuing
Bank and the Agent by facsimile; provided, however, that the original notice and

with respect to the issuance or extension of such Letter of Credit, the Issuing
Bank shall issue such Letter of Credit on the requested issuance date.  In the
event the Company requests that the expiration date of any Letter of Credit be
extended, the Company shall notify the Issuing Bank, with a copy to the Agent,
in accordance with the applicable notice provision set forth in the Letter of
Credit with respect to extensions, or, in the event the Letter of Credit
contains no such notice provision, on a Business Day which is at least five
Business Days (or fewer Business Days if agreed to by the Issuing Bank) prior to
the existing expiration date under the Letter of Credit.  Such notice shall be
duly executed by the Company and in all respects satisfactory to the Issuing
Bank, together with such other documentation as the Issuing Bank may reasonably
request in support thereof, and shall state the proposed extended expiration
date (which date shall not extend beyond the earlier of (i) one year from the
date of such extension or (ii) thirty days prior to the Termination Date).  Such
notice may be delivered to the

the issuance of Letters of Credit, the issuing Bank shall extend the expiration
date of such Letter of Credit to the requested expiration date.

          2.7  Determination of Issuing Bank: Replacement of Credit.  BofA
               ----------------------------------------------------       
Illinois shall be the Issuing Bank with respect to each Letter of Credit, unless
each of the Company, BofA Illinois, the Agent and another Bank designate such
other Bank to be the Issuing Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit, in which
case such other Bank shall be the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of
Credit.  A Letter of Credit may be replaced by a Letter of Credit issued by
another Issuing Bank selected pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.7, upon
                                                            -----------      
receipt of the existing Letter of Credit for cancellation by the issuer thereof.

          2.8  Participations in Letters of Credit.  Concurrently with the
               -----------------------------------                        
issuance of each Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold
and transferred to each other Bank, and each other Bank shall be deemed
irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Issuing
Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to
the extent of such other Bank's Percentage, in such Letter of Credit and the
Company's reimbursement obligations with respect thereto.  For the purposes of
this Agreement, the unparticipated portion of each Letter of Credit shall be
deemed to be the Issuing Bank's "participation" therein.  The Issuing Bank
hereby agrees, upon request of the Agent or any Bank, to deliver to such Bank
and the Agent a list of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank, together with such information related thereto as such other Bank may
reasonably request.

          2.9  Reimbursement Obligations.  The Company hereby unconditionally
               -------------------------
and irrevocably agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank for each payment or
disbursement made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit honoring any
demand for payment made by the beneficiary thereunder, in each case on the date
that such payment or disbursement is made, including, without limitation, under
the following circumstances:

          (i)   any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;

          (ii)  the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
     which the Company or any other account party may have at any time against a
     beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any persons or
     entities for whom any

                                     - 20 -

     such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank, any Bank or any other
     Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
     contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying
     transaction between the account party or one of the other Loan Parties and
     the beneficiary for which the Letter of Credit was procured);

          (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or any other document presented
     under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect;

          (iv)  payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does
     not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

          (v)   any other circumstances or happening whatsoever, which is
     similar to any of the foregoing; or

          (vi)  the fact that an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
    shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided that the obligation of the Company to so reimburse the Issuing Bank
- --------

the result of any event set forth in clauses (iii), (iv) or (v) above which is
                                     -------------  ----    ---               
finally judicially determined to constitute gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Issuing Bank.  To the extent that any obligation of the
Company to reimburse the issuing Bank is reduced pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Issuing Bank shall reimburse the Banks for any such
amounts which the Banks have paid on account of such unreimbursed obligations.

Any amount not reimbursed on the date of such payment or disbursement (by the
making or deemed making of Base Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.11 (i) or
                                                       ---------------   
otherwise, notwithstanding if any such Loans would cause a default under Section
                                                                         -------

issuing Bank is reimbursed by the Company therefor, payable on demand, at a rate
per annum equal to the Base Rate from time to time in effect plus two percent

(2%) per annum.  The Issuing Bank shall notify the Company and the Agent
whenever any demand for payment is made under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereunder within five Business Days of receiving such demand;
provided, however, that the failure of the Issuing Bank to so notify the Company
- --------  -------                                                               
or the Agent shall not affect the rights of the Issuing Bank or the Banks in any
manner whatsoever.

          2.10  Limitation on the Issuing Bank's Obligations.  As between the
                --------------------------------------------                 
Company, any Issuing Bank and the Banks, the Company assumes all risks of the
acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit, except to the
extent of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Issuing Bank.  In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, neither any Issuing Bank nor
any Bank shall be responsible, except to the extent of its own gross negligence
or wilful misconduct: (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection
with the application for and issuance of such Letters of Credit, even if it
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or insufficiency of any
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any
such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof,
in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to
comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of
Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or
delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether
or not they be in cipher; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical terms;
(vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document
required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the
proceeds thereof; and (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any
such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of
Credit.  None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any
of the Issuing Bank's or any Banks' rights or powers hereunder.  In furtherance
and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set
forth, any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Bank under or in connection
with the Letters of Credit issued by it, if taken or omitted in good faith,
shall not put such Issuing Bank under any resulting liability to the Company or
the Banks, except to the extent of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
such Issuing Bank.

          2.11  Reimbursement Obligations Deemed to be Loans; Funding by Banks

to an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank shall immediately notify the Agent upon
- ------------------    
making any payment or disbursement under any Letter of Credit and upon receipt
of any reimbursements with respect thereto. If an Issuing Bank makes any payment
or disbursement under any Letter of Credit and the Company has not reimbursed
such Issuing Bank in full in cash for such payment or disbursement by 11:00
a.m., San Francisco time, such Issuing Bank shall notify the Agent accordingly,
and on the date of such payment or disbursement (i) if such payment or
disbursement is made prior to the Termination Date, the Banks shall be deemed to
have made Base Rate Loans (pro rata according

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>
 
to their respective Percentages) (notwithstanding if any such Loans would cause
a default under Section 2.1.3 or any other provision hereunder) to the Company
                -------------                                                 
in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such payment or disbursement or
(ii) if such payment or disbursement is made on or after the Termination Date,
or if any reimbursement received by such Issuing Bank from the Company is or
must be returned or rescinded upon or during any bankruptcy or reorganization of
the Company or otherwise, each other Bank shall be obligated to pay to such
Issuing Bank, in full or partial payment of the purchase price of its
participation in such Letter of Credit, its pro rata share (according to its
Percentage) of such payment or disbursement (but no such payment shall diminish
the obligations of the Company under Section 2.9), and in either of the cases
                                     ------------                            
described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Agent shall promptly notify each
             -----------    ----                                            
other Bank thereof.  Each other Bank irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to
so pay to the Agent in immediately available funds for such Issuing Bank's
account the amount of such other Bank's Percentage of such payment or
disbursement.  If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made such amount
available to the Agent by 2:00 p.m., San Francisco time, on the Business Day on
which such Bank receives notice from the Agent of such payment or disbursement,
such Bank agrees to pay interest on such amount to the Agent for such Issuing
Bank's account forthwith on demand for each day from and including the date such
amount was to have been delivered to the Agent to but excluding the date such
amount is paid, at a rate per annum equal to (a) for the first three days after
demand, the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (b) thereafter,
the Base Rate from time to time in effect.  Any Bank's failure to make available
to the Agent its Percentage of any such payment or disbursement shall not
relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to make available to the
Agent such other Bank's Percentage of such payment, but no Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make available to the Agent
such other Bank's Percentage of any such payment or disbursement.

          2.12  Warranty.  Each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3 and
                --------                                        -----------    
the delivery of each Letter of Credit Application pursuant to Section 2.6 shall

automatically constitute a warranty by the Company to the Agent and each Bank to
the effect that on the date of such requested borrowing or the issuance of the
requested Letter of Credit, as the case may be, (a) the warranties of the
Company contained in Section 9 of this Agreement shall be true and correct as of
                     ---------                                                  
such requested date as though made on the date thereof and (b) no Event of
Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall have then occurred and be continuing
or will result therefrom.

          2.13   Conditions.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                 ----------                                              
Agreement, (a) no Bank shall be obligated to make any Loan, (b) no Bank shall be
obligated to convert into or permit

                                     - 23 -

the continuation at the end of the applicable Interest Period of any Eurodollar
Loan and (c) an Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of
Credit if, in any such case, an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
exists or would result therefrom.

          2.14   Commitments Several.  The failure of any Bank to make a
                 -------------------                                    
requested Loan or to purchase a participation in any Letter of Credit on any
date shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make a Loan or
purchase a participation in any Letter of Credit on such date, but no Bank shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make any Loan or purchase
any participation in any Letter of Credit to be made by such other Bank.

          2.15  Transfer Instructions.  All funds to be transferred to Agent
                ---------------------                                       
shall be wire transferred in immediately available funds to the Agent's Payment
Office re: Wyle Electronics, Attention:  Agency Management Services #5596,
maintained at BofA, ABA no. 1210-00358, with the purpose of the payment
indicated, or shall be transferred as the Agent may otherwise request from time
to time.

          2.16  Extension of Termination Date.  The Termination Date shall be
                -----------------------------                                
extended for an additional year on each Extension Date upon satisfaction of each
of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.16:
                                    ------------ 

               (a)  The Company and each other Loan Party shall have delivered a
          written request of such extension to the Agent (who shall promptly
          notify the Banks) not less than 45 nor more than 90 days prior to the
          applicable Extension Date; and

               (b)  The Agent and each Bank, each in its sole and absolute
          discretion, shall have agreed to such extension by written notice to
          the Agent (which in turn shall notify the Company and the Banks), no
          later than 45 after delivery of the extension request described in
          subparagraph (a) above (it being understood that if the Agent or any
          Bank does not agree to such extension (any failure by the Agent or any
          Bank to respond within the required time period shall be deemed to be
          a decision by such non-responding party not to agree to such
          extension), then such extension shall not be granted);

provided, that nothing in this Section 2.16 shall limit the right of the Company
- --------                       ------------                                     
to request any extension of the Termination Date at any time or the right of the
Agent and the Banks, each in their sole and absolute discretion, to grant or to
not grant any such extension.

          SECTION 3 EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS.

          3.1  Loan Accounts.  The Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by
               -------------                                                    
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Bank in the ordinary course
of business.  The accounts or records maintained by each Bank shall be
conclusive evidence, absent demonstrable error, of the amount of the Loans made
by the Banks to the Company, and the interest and payments thereon.  The failure
to so record any such amount or any error in so recording any such amount shall
not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company hereunder
to repay the principal amount of the Loans made by such Bank together with all
interest accruing thereon.

          3.2  Notes.  Upon the request of any Bank made through the Agent, the
               -----                                                           
Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced by a promissory note (as amended,
supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time, individually
each a "Note" and collectively for all Banks the "Notes") substantially in the
form set forth in Exhibit A, with appropriate insertions, dated the Effective
                  ---------                                                  
Date (or such earlier date as shall be satisfactory to the Agent and the
Company), payable to the order of such Bank in an amount equal to such Bank' s
Percentage of the Commitments (or, if less, in the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of such Bank's Loans).

          3.3  Recordkeeping.  Each Bank shall record in its records, or at its
               -------------                                                   
option on the schedule attached to its Note, the date and amount of each Loan
made by such Bank, each repayment or conversion thereof and, in the case of each
Eurodollar Loan, the dates on which each Interest Period for such Loan shall
begin and end.  The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be
conclusive evidence, absent demonstrable error, of the principal amount owing
and unpaid on such Note.  The failure to so record any such amount or any error
in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect
the obligations of the Company hereunder or under any Note to repay the
principal amount of the Loans evidenced by such Note together with all interest
accruing thereon.


          SECTION 4 INTEREST.

          4.1  Interest Rates.  The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the
               --------------                                                 
account of each Bank interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan for
the period commencing on and including the date of such Loan to but excluding
the date such Loan is paid in full in cash, which in no event shall be less than
one day, as follows:

                                     - 25 -
<PAGE>
 
               (a)  at all times while such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, at a rate
          per annum equal to the Base Rate from time to time in effect; and

               (b)  at all times while such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, at a rate
          per annum equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted)
          applicable to each Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan plus the
          Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans;

provided, however, that at any time an Event of Default exists, the interest
- --------  -------                                                           
rate otherwise applicable to each Loan shall be increased by two percent (2%)
per annum.

          4.2  Interest Payment Dates.  Accrued interest on each Base Rate Loan
               ----------------------                                          
shall be payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and on the Termination
Date, commencing with the first of such dates to occur after the date of such
Loan.  Accrued interest on each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on the last day
of each Interest Period relating to such Loan (and, in the case of each
Eurodollar Loan with an Interest Period in excess of three months, the date
which falls three months after the beginning of such Interest Period) and on the
Termination Date.  After the Termination Date, accrued interest on all Loans
shall be payable on demand.

          4.3  Interest Periods.  Each interest period for a Eurodollar Loan
               ----------------                                             
(each an "Interest Period") shall commence on the date such Eurodollar Loan is
made or converted from a Base Rate Loan, or on the date of expiration of the
immediately preceding Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan, and shall end on
the date which is one, two, three or six months thereafter, as the Company may
specify:

               (a)  in the case of an Interest Period which commences on the
          date a Eurodollar Loan is made or converted from a Base Rate Loan, in
          the related Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation
          pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.4, or
                      -----------    ---    

               (b)  in the case of a succeeding interest Period with respect to
          any Eurodollar Loan, by written or telephonic notice to the Agent not
          later than 10:00 a.m., San Francisco time, at least three Business
          Days prior to the first day of such succeeding Interest Period, it
          being understood that (i) each such notice shall be effective upon
          receipt by the Agent and (ii) if the Company fails to give such
          notice, such Loan shall automatically become a Base Rate Loan at the
          end of the then-current Interest Period.

Each Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan which would otherwise end on a day
which is not a Business Day shall end on the immediately succeeding Business Day
(unless such immediately succeeding Business Day is the first Business Day of a
calendar month, in which case such Interest Period shall end on the immediately
preceding Business Day).  The Company may not select any Interest Period which
would end after the Termination Date.

          4.4  Setting and Notice of Eurodollar Rates.  The applicable
               -------------------------------------- 
Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Agent, and
notice thereof shall be given by the Agent promptly to the Company and each
Bank. Each determination of the applicable Eurodollar Rate by the Agent shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, in the absence of demonstrable
error.

          4.5  Computation of Interest.  Interest shall be computed for the
               -----------------------                                     
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days, which results
in more interest than if a 365/366-day year were used.  The applicable interest
rate for each Base Rate Loan shall change simultaneously with each change in the
Base Rate.


          SECTION 5 FEES.

          5.1  Participation Fee.  The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for
               -----------------  
the account of each Bank on the Effective Date a participation fee equal to
eight basis points on the net increase in each Bank's final allocated Commitment
hereunder from its commitment under the Existing Credit Agreement.

          5.2  Facility Fee.  The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the
               ------------                                                 
account of each Bank a facility fee for the period from and including the
Effective Date, to but excluding the Termination Date, equal to the Applicable
Margin for the facility fee on the average daily portion of each Bank's
Commitment.  Such facility fee shall be payable in arrears on the last day of
each calendar quarter, commencing in March 1996 and on the Termination Date for
any period then ending for which such facility fee shall not have been
theretofore paid.  The facility fee shall be computed for the actual number of
days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days, which results in a higher fee
than if a 365/366-day year were used.

          5.3  Letter of Credit Fees.  (a) The Company agrees to pay to the
               ---------------------
Agent for the account of the Banks pro rata according to their respective
Percentages a letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit in an amount equal
to the Applicable Margin for Letter of Credit fees per annum (computed for the
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days, which results
in a higher fee than if a 365/366-day year were used) of the face

                                     - 27 -
<PAGE>
 
amount of such Letter of Credit, payable in arrears on the last day of each
calendar quarter and on the Termination Date for the period from and including
the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit to but excluding the date such
payment is due or, if earlier, the date on which such Letter of Credit expired
or was terminated.

          (b)  In addition, with respect to each Letter of Credit, the Company
agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank (i) such fees and expenses as and when such
Issuing Bank customarily requires in connection with the issuance, negotiation,
processing, extension and/or administration of letters of credit in similar
situations and (ii) a letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Bank in an amount equal to 0.125% per annum (computed for the
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days) of the face
amount of such Letter of Credit, payable in arrears on the last day of each
calendar quarter and on the Termination Date for the period from and including
the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit to but excluding the date such
payment is due or, if earlier, the date on which such Letter of Credit expired
or was terminated.

          5.4  Agent's and Arranger's Fees.  (a)  The Company agrees to pay to
               ---------------------------                                    
the Agent, individually, an agent's fee in the amount agreed upon in writing by
the Company and the Agent pursuant to a fee letter dated on or about December
29, 1995.

          (b)  The Company agrees to pay to the Arranger, individually, an
arrangement fee in the amount agreed upon in writing by the Company and the
Arranger pursuant to a fee letter dated on or about December 29, 1995.

          5.5  Interest.  All fees provided for in this Section 5 shall bear
               --------                                 ---------           
interest from and including the date such fees become payable to but not
including the date that such payments are made, payable on demand, at a rate per
annum equal to the then applicable rate charged on Base Rate Loans.


      SECTION 6 REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF THE COMMITMENTS; PREPAYMENTS.

          6.1  Reduction or Termination.  The Company may from time to time on
               ------------------------ 
at least five Business Days' prior written notice received by the Agent (which
shall promptly advise each Bank thereof) permanently reduce the amount of the
Commitments to an amount not less than the sum of (i) the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Loans plus (ii) the aggregate Stated Amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit. Any such reduction shall be in an amount not less
than $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000. The Company may at any
time on like notice terminate the Commitments upon payment in full in cash of

                                     - 28 -

or (iii) delivery to the applicable Issuing Bank, with a copy to each Bank and
the Agent, of evidence satisfactory to the Banks that a replacement letter of
credit has been issued to replace any applicable Letter of Credit and that such
applicable Letter of Credit is to be returned promptly for cancellation.  All
reductions of the Commitments shall be pro rata among the Banks according to
their respective Percentages.

          6.2  Voluntary Prepayments.  The Company may from time to time prepay
               ---------------------                                           
the Loans in whole or in part; provided that (a) the Company shall give the
                               --------                                    
Agent (which shall promptly advise each Bank) written notice thereof (i) on or
before 10:00 a.m., San Francisco time, not less than three Business Days prior
thereto in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) on or before 10:00 a.m., San
Francisco time, on the date of such prepayment in the case of Base Rate Loans,
specifying the Loans to be prepaid and the date and amount of prepayment, (b)
any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of an Interest Period
therefor shall be subject to Section 8.4, (c) each partial prepayment of a
                             -----------

          SECTION 7 MAKING AND PRORATION OF PAYMENTS; SETOFF; TAXES.

          7.1  Making of Payments.  All payments of principal or interest on the
               ------------------                                               
Notes, of all fees, and of all other amounts payable hereunder by the Company,
shall be made by the Company to the Agent in immediately available funds without
offset or counterclaim at its office in San Francisco not later than noon, San
Francisco time, on the date due; and funds received after that hour shall be
deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next following Business Day.
The Agent shall promptly remit to each Bank or other holder of a Note its share
of all such payments received in collected funds by the Agent for the account of
such Bank or holder.

          7.2  Application of Certain Payments.  Each payment shall be applied
               -------------------------------              
to such Loans or other obligations of the

                                     - 29 -
<PAGE>
 
Company hereunder as the Company shall direct by notice to be received by the
Agent on or before the date of such payment or, in the absence of such notice or
during any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default under Section 12.1.3,
                                                                -------------- 
as follows:

          (a)  first, to pay all obligations hereunder or under any Loan
               -----  
     Document in respect of any fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then
     due to the Agent (solely in its capacity as the Agent and not as a Bank);

          (b)  second, to pay ratably interest due in respect of (i) all Loans
               ------                                           
     and (ii) (without duplication) reimbursement obligations in connection with
     Letters of Credit;

          (c)  third, to pay or prepay ratably the principal amount of all Loans
               -----                                                            
     and (without duplication) reimbursement obligations in connection with
     Letters of Credit (or to provide collateral in respect of Letters of Credit
     to the extent such reimbursement obligations are contingent);

          (d)  fourth, to pay ratably all obligations hereunder or under any
               ------
     Loan Document in respect of any fees and expenses and indemnities then due
     to the Banks (including any issuing Bank); and

          (e)  fifth, to pay ratably all other obligations hereunder or under
               ----- 
    any Loan Document.

The order of priority set forth in this Section and the related provisions of
this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of
the Agent and the Banks as among themselves and may at any time or from time to
time be changed, and any application of funds hereunder may be reversed and
reapplied, by the Agent and the Banks in writing as they may elect, without
necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by the Company or any other
Person, provided that such change shall not have the result of causing amounts
not otherwise due under this Agreement to become due.  The Agent shall advise
the Banks as to the application of any payment upon request.

          7.3  Due Date Extension: Payments Due on Business Days.  If any
               -------------------------------------------------    
payment of principal or interest with respect to any of the Notes, facility
fees, Letter of Credit fees, or other obligations of the Company hereunder falls
due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended
to the next following Business Day (unless, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan,
such next following Business Day is the first Business Day of a calendar month,
in which case such due date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day)
and, in the case of principal and any other amounts on which interest is payable
hereunder, additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the period of any
such extension.

<PAGE>
 
          7.4  Setoff.  The Company agrees that the Agent, each Bank and each
               ------                                                        
other holder of a Note have all rights of set-off and bankers' lien provided by
applicable law, and in addition thereto, the Company agrees that at any time any
Unmatured Event of Default under Section 12.1.3 or any Event of Default exists,
                                 --------------                                
the Agent, each Bank and each such holder may apply to the payment of such
payment or other amount (or, in the case of clause (ii), to any obligations of
                                            -----------                       
the Company hereunder, whether or not then due) any and all balances, credits,
deposits, accounts or moneys of the Company then or thereafter with the Agent,
such Bank or such holder.

          7.5  Proration of Payments.  If any Bank shall obtain any payment or
               ---------------------                                          
other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of set-off or
banker's lien or otherwise) on account of principal of or interest on any Note
(or on account of its participation in any Letter of Credit) or any other
obligation under any of the Loan Documents, whether from any Loan Party or any
other Person, in excess of its pro rata share of payments and other recoveries
obtained by all Banks on account of principal of and interest on Notes and on
such participations then held by them (other than in respect of an Affected Loan
to the extent contemplated by Section 8.3 or indemnities or other obligations
                              -----------                                    
owed solely to such Bank and not owed to the Banks generally based upon their
respective Percentages), such Bank shall purchase from the other Banks such
participations in the Notes (or sub-participations in Letters of Credit) held by
them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess
payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if
                                                     --------  -------         
all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Bank, the purchase shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery.

          7.6  Taxes.  All payments of principal of, and interest on, the Loans
               -----                                                           
and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
(except to the extent required by law) without deduction for any present or
future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties,
withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing
authority, but excluding franchise taxes and taxes imposed on or measured by any
Bank's net income or receipts (all non-excluded items being called "Taxes"). If
any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the company
hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law,
rule or regulation, then the Company will

          (a)  pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required
     to be so withheld or deducted;

                                     - 31 -
<PAGE>
 
          (b)  promptly forward to the Agent an official receipt or other
     documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such
     authority; and

          (c)  pay to the Agent for the account of the Banks such additional
     amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually
     received by each Bank will equal the full amount such Bank would have
     received had no such withholding or deduction been required.

Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against the Agent or any Bank with
respect to any payment received by the Agent or such Bank hereunder, the Agent
or such Bank may pay such Taxes and the Company will promptly pay such
additional amounts (including any penalty, interest and expense) as is necessary
in order that the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such
Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount
such Person would have received had such Taxes not been asserted.

          If the Company fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent, for the account of the
respective Banks, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence,
the Company shall indemnify the Banks for any incremental Taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by any Bank as a result of any such failure.

          Upon its execution of this Agreement, and thereafter on each
anniversary thereof, and in addition upon the request from time to time of the
Company or the Agent, each Bank that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America shall, pursuant to Section
13.10, execute and deliver to the Company and the Agent one or more (as the
Company or the Agent may reasonably request) United States Internal Revenue
Service Forms 4224 or Forms 1001 or such other forms or documents, appropriately
completed, as may be applicable to establish that any payment to such Bank is
exempt from withholding or deduction of Taxes.  The Company shall not be
required to pay any additional amount to any Bank under this Section 7.6 if such
                                                             -----------        
Bank shall have failed to satisfy the requirements of the immediately preceding
sentence; provided that if a Bank shall have satisfied such requirements on or
          --------                                                            
about the date that it became a party to this Agreement, nothing in this
paragraph shall relieve the Company of its obligation to pay any amounts
pursuant to this Section 7.6 in the event that such Bank is no longer properly
                 -----------                                                  
entitled to deliver certificates, documents or other evidence at a subsequent
date establishing the fact that such Bank is not subject to withholding as
described in the immediately preceding sentence.

     SECTION 8  INCREASED COSTS; SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR EURODOLLAR LOANS.

          8.1  Increased Costs.  (a) If, after the date hereof, (i) Regulation D
               ---------------                                                  
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or (ii) any applicable
law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Bank (or any Eurodollar Office of such Bank) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency

          (A)  shall subject any Bank (or any Eurodollar Office of such Bank) to
     any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, its
     Note or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or shall change the basis
     of taxation of payments to any Bank of the principal of or interest on its
     Eurodollar Loans or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect
     of its Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans (except
     for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or
     its Eurodollar Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Bank's
     principal executive office or Eurodollar Office is located); or

          (B)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including,
     without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of the
     Federal Reserve System, but excluding any Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage),
     special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
     for the account of, or credit extended by any Bank (or any Eurodollar
     Office of such Bank); or

          (C)  shall impose on any Bank (or its Eurodollar Office) any other
     condition affecting its Eurodollar Loans, its Note or its obligation to
     make Eurodollar Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to (or in the
case of Regulation D referred to above, to impose a cost on) such Bank (or any
Eurodollar Office of such Bank) of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its
Eurodollar Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto,
then within 10 days after written demand by such Bank (a copy of which shall be
furnished to the Agent), the Company shall pay to such Bank, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or such
reduction.

          (b)  If any Bank shall reasonably determine that, after the date
hereof, the adoption or phase-in of any applicable law,

                                     - 33 -
<PAGE>
 
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Eurodollar Office) or
any Person controlling such Bank with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Bank's or such controlling Person's capital as a consequence of
such Bank's obligations hereunder (including, without limitation, such Bank's
obligations under the Commitment) to a level below that which such Bank or such
controlling Person could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such controlling Person's
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within 10
days after written demand by such Bank (a copy of which shall be furnished to
the Agent), the Company shall pay to such Bank, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Bank or such controlling Person for such
reduction.

          (c)  Any demand under this Section 8.1 shall be accompanied by a
                                     -----------                          
certificate setting forth the calculation of any additional amount payable under
this Section 8.1, which certificate shall be conclusive for all purposes absent
     -----------                                                               
manifest error.

          8.2  Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair.  If
               --------------------------------------------------------  
with respect to any Interest Period:

          (a)  deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being
offered to one or more Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or
the Agent otherwise reasonably determines (which determination shall be binding
and conclusive on the Company) that by reason of circumstances affecting the
interbank eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate; or

          (b)  Banks having an aggregate Percentage of thirty three and one-
third percent (33 1/3%) or more advise the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate
(Reserve Adjusted) as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Banks of maintaining or funding such Loans for such
Interest Period, or that the making or funding of Eurodollar Loans has become
impracticable in the opinion of such Banks,

then the Agent shall promptly notify the other parties thereof and, so long as
such circumstances shall continue, (i) no Bank shall be under any obligation to
make, or convert Loans into, Eurodollar Loans and (ii) on the last day of the
current Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan, such Loan shall, unless then
repaid in full, automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan.

          8.3  Changes in Law Rendering Eurodollar Loans Unlawful.  In the event
               --------------------------------------------------               
that any change in (including the adoption of any new) applicable laws or
regulations, or any change in the interpretation of applicable laws or
regulations by any governmental or other regulatory body charged with the
administration thereof, should make it unlawful for any Bank (or in the good
faith judgment of any Bank cause a substantial question as to whether it is
unlawful for such Bank) to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans, then such
Bank shall promptly notify each of the other parties hereto and, so long as such
circumstances shall continue, (a) such Bank shall have no obligation to make or
convert into Eurodollar Loans (but shall make Base Rate Loans concurrently with
the making of or conversion into Eurodollar Loans by the Banks which are not so
affected in each case in an amount equal to such Bank's Percentage of all
Eurodollar Loans which would be made or converted into at such time in the
absence of such circumstances) and (b) on the last day of the current Interest
Period for each Eurodollar Loan of such Bank (or, in any event, if such Bank so
requests, on such earlier date as such Bank determines may be required by the
relevant law, regulation or interpretation), such Eurodollar Loan shall, unless
then repaid in full, automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan.  Each Base Rate
Loan made by a Bank which, but for the circumstances described in the foregoing
sentence, would be a Eurodollar Loan (an "Affected Loan") shall, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, remain outstanding for the same period as
the Group of Eurodollar Loans of which such Affected Loan would be a part absent
such circumstances.

          8.4  Funding Losses.  The Company hereby agrees that upon demand by
               -------------- 
any Bank (a copy of which shall be furnished to the Agent) the Company will
indemnify such Bank against any net loss or expense which such Bank may sustain
or incur (including, without limitation, any net loss or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such Bank to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Loan and any amounts which such
Bank would have received had such Eurodollar Loan remained outstanding to the
last day of the applicable Interest Period, net of any amounts actually received
by such Bank in connection with the redeployment of such funds for such period
as such Bank elects consistent with its business practices), as reasonably
determined by such Bank, as a result of (a) any payment or, prepayment or
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan of such Bank on a date other than the last day
of an Interest Period for such Loan (including, without limitation, any
conversion pursuant to Section 8.3) or (b) any failure of the Company to borrow
                       -----------                                             
or convert or continue any Loans on a date specified therefor in a Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation pursuant to this Agreement.  For
this purpose, all notices to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed to be irrevocable.

          8.5  Right of Banks to Fund through Other Offices.  Each Bank may, if
               --------------------------------------------                    
it so elects, fulfill its commitment as to any Eurodollar Loan by causing a
foreign branch or affiliate of such Bank to make such Loan; provided that in
                                                            --------        
such event for the purposes of this Agreement such Loan shall be deemed to have
been made by such Bank and the obligation of the Company to repay such Loan
shall nevertheless be to such Bank and shall be deemed held by it, to the extent
of such Loan, for the account of such branch or affiliate.

          8.6  Discretion of Banks as to Manner of Funding.  Notwithstanding any
               -------------------------------------------                      
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank shall be entitled to fund
and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees
fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all
determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Bank had actually funded and
maintained each Eurodollar Loan during each Interest Period for such Loan
through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to such
Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for
such Interest Period.

          8.7  Conclusiveness of Statements; Survival of Provisions.
               ----------------------------------------------------  
Determinations and statements of any Bank pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 or
                                                      -----------  ---  ---   
8.4 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The provisions of such Sections
- ---                                                                            
shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, cancellation or
expiration of the Letters of Credit and any termination of this Agreement, with
respect to all Loans and other obligations made or incurred hereunder or under
the other Loan Documents, and the Notes, Letters of Credit and the other Loan
Documents entered into in connection herewith.

          8.8  Banks' Obligation to Mitigate.  Each Bank agrees that, as
               -----------------------------  
promptly as practicable after the officer of such Bank responsible for
administering Loans under this Agreement becomes aware of the occurrence of an
event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Bank to have
Affected Loans or that would entitle such Bank to receive payments (other than
insubstantial amounts) under Section 8.1, it will, to the extent not
                             ----------- 
inconsistent with such Bank's internal policies and practices, use reasonable
efforts (i) to make, fund or maintain the Commitments of such Bank or the
Affected Loans of such Bank through another lending office of such Bank, or (ii)
take such other measures as such Bank may deem reasonable, if as a result
thereof the circumstances which would cause such Bank to have Affected Loans
would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required
to be paid to such Bank pursuant to Section 8.1 would not be required to be paid
                                    ----------- 
to such Bank or would be substantially reduced and if, as determined by such
Bank in its reasonable discretion, the making, funding,or maintaining of such
Commitments or Loans through such other

                                     - 36 -
<PAGE>
 
lending office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be,
would not adversely affect such Commitments or Loans or the interests of such
Bank.  The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Bank to the extent allocable to such Bank's Commitments
(including reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel and allocated costs
of in-house counsel) incurred in connection with this Section 8.8.
                                                      -----------

trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights), free and clear of all

          9.8  Subsidiaries. The Company has no Subsidiaries, except those

               ---------------------   ------------                             
as of the Effective Date.  Each Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) is in
compliance with ERISA and the applicable provisions of the Code in all material
respects with respect to each Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan, all reports
required under ERISA or any other applicable law or regulation to be filed by
the Company or a member of its ERISA Controlled Group with the relevant
governmental authority the failure of which to file could reasonably result in a
material liability of the Company or a member of its ERISA Controlled Group have
been duly filed and all such reports are true and correct in all material
respects as of the date given.  Neither the Company nor a member of its ERISA
Controlled Group has engaged in a "prohibited transaction," as such term is
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or in a transaction subject to the
prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA, in connection with any Plan which would
subject the Company or a member of its ERISA Controlled Group (after giving
effect to any exemption) to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, Section 502 of ERISA or any other liability
under ERISA which tax, penalty or other liability would involve more than
$100,000.  There are no claims (other than claims for benefits in the normal
course), actions or lawsuits asserted or instituted against, and neither the
Company nor a member of its ERISA Controlled Group has knowledge of any
threatened litigation or claims against, the assets of any Plan (other than a
Multiemployer Plan) or against any fiduciary of such Plan (other than a
Multiemployer Plan) with respect to the operation of such Plan (other than a
Multiemployer Plan).  The aggregate present value of all Unfunded Benefits under
the ERISA Plans, excluding any Multiemployer Plan, does not exceed $20,000,000.
The Company and the members of its ERISA Controlled Group are currently
obligated to make contributions only to the Multiemployer Plans set forth in
Schedule 9.9.  With respect to all Multiemployer Plans to which the Company and
- ------------                                                                   
the members of its ERISA Controlled Group now contribute, have ever contributed
or have ever had an obligation to contribute, all obligations of the Company and
the members of its ERISA Controlled Group have been satisfied in full.  The
aggregate potential withdrawal liability of the Company and the members of its
ERISA Controlled Group with respect to all Multiemployer Plans to which the
Company and the members of its ERISA Controlled Group currently contribute does
not exceed  $1,000,000.  The obligation of the Company and its ERISA

                                     - 40 -
<PAGE>
 
Controlled Group to provide post-retirement welfare benefits (other than as
required by Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code) is
fairly presented according to applicable financial reporting standards in the
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

of the foregoing.

they have not theretofore terminated) shall immediately terminate and the Notes
and all other obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable and
the Company shall become immediately obligated to deliver to the Agent cash
collateral in an amount equal to the outstanding Stated Amount of all Letters of
Credit, all without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind; and, in
the case of any other Event of Default, the Agent may (and upon written request
of the Required Banks shall) declare the Commitments (if they have not
theretofore terminated) to be terminated and/or declare all Notes and all other
obligations hereunder to be due and payable and/or demand that the Company
immediately deliver to the Agent cash collateral in an amount equal to the

with any drawing under a Letter of Credit.  Upon the expiration or termination
of any Letters of Credit, such cash collateral in excess of the Stated Amount of
the remaining Letters of Credit may be applied by the Agent to any remaining
obligations hereunder and any excess (as determined by the Agent or by a court
of competent jurisdiction) shall be delivered to the Company or as a court of
competent jurisdiction may direct.

          SECTION 13  THE AGENT.

          13.1  Appointment and Authorization; "Agent".  Each Bank hereby
                --------------------------------------                   
irrevocably (subject to Section 13.9) appoints, designates and authorizes the
Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement
and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent
have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against the Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with reference
to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or
express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended
to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

          13.2  Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its duties
                --------------------                                          
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

          13.3  Liability of Agent.  None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i)
                ------------------                                              
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct),
or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Company, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or
in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any other party to
any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent-
Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained
in,

                                     - 61 -
<PAGE>
 
or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or Affiliates.

          13.4  Reliance by Agent.  (a)  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, 
                -----------------                                          
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone
message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel
to the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks as it deems appropriate
and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of
the Required Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks.

          (b)  For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 11, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Bank for consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to
or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank.

          13.5   Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
                 -----------------                                        
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except
with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required
to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent shall
have received written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default".  The Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt
of any such notice.  The Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Banks in
accordance with Section 14.1; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent
                              --------  -------                                 
has received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest
of the Banks.

          13.6   Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that none of the 
                 ---------------                                                
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the
Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and credit worthiness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company hereunder. Each Bank also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-
Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition and credit worthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and
other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the
Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank
with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition or credit worthiness of the
Company which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

          13.7   Indemnification of Agent.  Whether or not the transactions
                 ------------------------                                  
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), pro rata,
from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no
                                                      --------  -------         
Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion
of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Bank shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and charges of counsel for the Agent,
including, without limitation, all allocated costs of the Agent's internal
counsel, and of local counsel, if any, who may be retained) incurred by the
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated

                                     - 63 -
<PAGE>
 
by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for
such expenses by or on behalf of the Company.  The undertaking in this Section
shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or
replacement of the Agent.

          13.8   Agent in Individual Capacity.  BofA and its Affiliates may make
                 ----------------------------                                   
loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though BofA were not the Agent hereunder and
without notice to or consent of the Banks.  The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant
to such activities, BofA or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the
Company or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such Subsidiary) and
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them.  With respect to its Loans, BofA shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" include BofA in
its individual capacity.

          13.9   Successor Agent.  The Agent may, and at the request of the
                 ---------------                                           
Required Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks.  If the
Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Banks shall appoint from among
the Banks a successor agent for the Banks which successor agent shall be
approved by the Company.  If no successor agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from among the
Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder,
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Section 13 and Sections 14.6 and 14.12 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement.  If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Required Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for
above.

          13.10  Withholding Tax.  (a)  If any Bank is a "foreign corporation,
                 ---------------                                              
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Bank claims
exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S.

                                     - 64 -
<PAGE>
 
withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code, such Bank agrees with
and in favor of the Agent, to deliver to the Agent:

               (i) if such Bank claims an exemption from, or a reduction of,
     withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, two properly completed
     and executed copies of IRS Form 1001 before the payment of any interest in
     the first calendar year and before the payment of any interest in each
     third succeeding calendar year during which interest may be paid under this
     Agreement;

               (ii) if such Bank claims that interest paid under this Agreement
     is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is effectively
     connected with a United States trade or business of such Bank, two properly
     completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224 before the payment of any
     interest is due in the first taxable year of such Bank and in each
     succeeding taxable year of such Bank during which interest may be paid
     under this Agreement; and

               (iii) such other form or forms as may be required under the Code
     or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or
     reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Bank agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

          (b)  If any Bank claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001 and such Bank
sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of
the Obligations of the Company to such Bank, such Bank agrees to notify the
Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of
Obligations of the Company to such Bank.  To the extent of such percentage
amount, the Agent will treat such Bank's IRS Form 1001 as no longer valid.

          (c)  If any Bank claiming exemption from United States withholding tax
by filing IRS Form 4224 with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a participation
in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of the Company to such
Bank, such Bank agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the
withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

          (d)  If any Bank is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Bank
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such

                                     - 65 -
<PAGE>
 
reduction.  However, if the forms or other documentation required by subsection
(a) of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to such Bank not providing such forms or other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by
Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction.

          (e)  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the
appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed, or because such
Bank failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the
exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other
reason) such Bank shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly
or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and
interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses
(including the fees and charges of counsel for the Agent, including, without
limitation, all allocated costs of the Agent's internal counsel, and of local
counsel, if any, who may be retained). The obligation of the Banks under this
subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or
replacement of the Agent.


          SECTION 14 GENERAL.

          14.1   Waiver: Amendments.  No delay on the part of the Agent, any

address for such purpose. Notices sent by facsimile transmission shall be deemed
to have been given when sent; notices sent by mail shall be deemed to have been
given three Business Days after the date when sent by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid; notices sent by overnight courier shall be deemed to have
been given one Business Day after the date when sent; and notices sent by hand
delivery shall be deemed to have been given when received. For purposes of

of the Company.  The Company shall be bound by such instructions in the same
manner as if such person were a Designated Employee and shall indemnify and hold
the Agent and each Bank harmless from any loss, cost or expense resulting from
any such reliance.

          14.4   Computations.  Where the character or amount of any asset or

liability or item of income or expense is required to be determined, or any
consolidation or other accounting computation is required to be made, for the
purpose of this Agreement, such determination or calculation shall, to the
extent applicable and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, be made
in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable at the
time of such computation (or, if "Accounting Changes" (as defined below) shall
have occurred and the affected provisions of this Agreement shall not have been
amended as contemplated by the next sentence, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable immediately prior to such Accounting
Changes) and applied on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements
certified by Arthur Andersen & Co. for Fiscal Year 1994.  In the event that any
"Accounting Changes" (as defined below) occur and such

                                     - 67 -

changes result in a change in the method of calculation of financial covenants,
standards or terms in this Agreement, then the Company and the Banks agree to
enter into negotiations in order to amend such provisions of this Agreement so
as to equitably reflect such Accounting Changes with the desired result that the
criteria for evaluating the Company's financial condition shall be the same
after such Accounting Changes as if such Accounting Changes had not been made.
"Accounting Changes" means: (a) changes in accounting principles required by the
promulgation of any rule, regulation, pronouncement or opinion by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (or successors thereto or agencies with similar functions); and (b)
changes in accounting principles recommended and implemented by the Company's
certified public accountants.

security for the extension or maintenance by it of any credit provided for in
this Agreement.

allocated costs of the Agent's internal counsel, and of local counsel, if any,
who may be retained) in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and
administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and all other
documents provided for herein or delivered or to be delivered hereunder or in
connection herewith (including, without limitation, any amendments, supplements
or waivers to any Loan Documents), and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other legal expenses and
allocated costs of staff counsel) incurred by the Agent and each Bank after an
Event of Default in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or any such other documents.  Each Bank agrees to reimburse the
Agent for such Bank's pro rata share (based on its respective Percentage) of any
such costs and expenses of the Agent not paid by the Company.  In addition, the
Company agrees to pay, and to save the Agent and the Banks harmless from all

each Issuing Bank (provided that such Issuing Bank has any Letters of Credit
                   -------- 
then outstanding at the time of such proposed assignment), the Agent and the
Company (which consents shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld), at any
time assign and delegate to one or more Eligible Assignees (any Person to whom
such an assignment and delegation is to be made being herein called an
"Assignee"), all or any fraction of such Bank's Loans, Note, direct or
participation interest in any Letter of Credit, Commitment or any other interest
of such Bank hereunder (which assignment and delegation shall be of a constant,
and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Bank's Loans, direct or
participation interest in Letters of Credit and Commitment), subject to a
minimum aggregate amount if the Assignee is not a Bank equal to the lesser of
(i) the assigning Bank's remaining Commitment and (ii) $5,000,000; provided,
                                                                   --------  
however, that the Company and the Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal

solely and directly with such Bank in connection with the interests so assigned
and delegated to an Assignee until five Business Days (or such lesser period of
time as the Agent and the assigning Bank shall agree) after the date when all of
the following conditions shall have been met:

          (x)  written notice of such assignment and delegation, together with
     payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to
     such Assignee, shall have been given to the Company and the Agent by such
     assigning Bank and the Assignee,

          (y)  the assigning Bank and the Assignee shall have executed and
     delivered to the Company and the Agent an assignment agreement
     substantially in the form of Exhibit E (an "Assignment Agreement"),

     together with any documents required to be delivered thereunder, including,
     without limitation, United States Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or

          (z)  the assigning Bank or the Assignee shall have paid the Agent a
     processing fee of $2,500.

From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met,
(x) such Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and
delegated to such Assignee pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the
rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder, and (y) the assigning Bank, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and delegated by
it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released from its obligations
hereunder.  Within ten Business Days after effectiveness of any assignment and
delegation, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent (for delivery to
the Assignee and the Assignor, as applicable) a new Note in the principal amount
of the Assignee's Percentage of the total amount of the Commitments and, if the
assigning Bank has retained a Percentage of the total amount of the Commitments
hereunder, a replacement Note in the principal amount of the Percentage of the
Loan retained by the assigning Bank (such Note to be in exchange for, but not in
payment of, the predecessor Note held by such assigning Bank).  Each such Note
shall be dated the date of the Note so assigned.  The assigning Bank shall mark
the predecessor Note "exchanged" and deliver it to the Company.  Accrued
interest on that part of the predecessor Note being assigned shall be paid as
provided in the Assignment Agreement.  Accrued interest and fees on that part of
the predecessor Note not being assigned shall be paid to the assigning Bank.
Accrued interest and accrued fees shall be paid at the same time or times
provided in the predecessor Note and in this Agreement.  Any attempted
assignment and delegation not made in accordance with this Section 14.8.1 shall
                                                           --------------      
be null and void.

          In addition to the foregoing, at the request of the Company, any Bank 
designated by the Company for replacement (a "Replaced Bank") shall, upon five
(5) Business Days' (or such lesser period of time as the Company, the Agent and
the Replaced Bank shall agree) prior notice, assign all (but not less than all)
of such Bank's Loans, Note, direct or participation interest in any Letter of
Credit, Commitment and all other interests of such Bank hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents (other than contingent rights which survive such transfer)
to an Assignee designated by the Company and approved by the Agent and each
other Bank (each in their sole discretion) at par value. Such assignment shall
be effected as set forth in this Section 14.8.1.
                                 -------------- 

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.8.1 or any
                                                           --------------       
other provision of this Agreement, any Bank may at any time assign all or any
portion of its Loans and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank (but no such
assignment shall release any Bank from any of its obligations hereunder).

               14.8.2  Participations.  Any Bank may at any time sell to one 
                       --------------

participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, the Note held by such
Bank, the Commitment of such Bank, the direct or participation interest of such
Bank in any Letter of Credit or any other interest of such Bank hereunder (any
Person purchasing any such participating interest being herein called a
"Participant").  In the event of a sale by a Bank of a participating interest to
a Participant, (x) such Bank shall remain the holder of its Note for all
purposes of this Agreement, (y) the Company and the Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations hereunder and (z) all amounts payable by the Company shall be
determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation and shall be paid
directly to such Bank.  No Bank shall grant any Participant any voting rights
with respect to amendments or modifications of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, except with respect to any of the events described in the
penultimate sentence of Section 14.1.  Each Bank agrees to incorporate the
                        ------------                                      
requirements of the preceding sentence into each participation agreement which
such Bank enters into with any Participant.  The Company agrees that if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement and the Notes are due and payable (as a result
of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the
right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under
this Agreement, any Note and with respect to any Letter of Credit to the same
extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it
as a Bank under this Agreement or such Note; provided that such right of setoff
                                             --------                          
shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant to share with the Banks,
and the Banks agree to share with each Participant, as provided in Section 7.5.
                                                                   -----------  
The Company also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Section 7.6 and Section 8 as if it were a Bank (provided that no Participant
   -----------     ---------                                                   
shall receive any greater compensation pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 8 than
                                                   -----------    ---------     
would have been paid to the participating Bank if no participation had been
sold).

          14.9   Governing Law.  This Agreement and each Note shall be a 
                 -------------                                       
contract made under and governed by the internal laws of the State of
California. Whenever possible each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All obligations of the Company
and rights of the Agent, the Banks and any other holder of a Note expressed
herein or in any other Loan Document shall be in addition to and not in
limitation of those provided by applicable law.

counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts and
each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement.  When
counterparts executed by all of the parties hereto shall have been lodged with
the Agent (or, in the case of any Bank as to which an executed counterpart shall
not have been so lodged, the Agent shall have received confirmation from such
Bank of execution of a counterpart hereof by such Bank), this Agreement shall
become effective as of the date hereof, and at such time the Agent shall notify
the Company and each Bank.

and the successors and assigns of the Banks and the Agent.  The Company may not
assign its rights or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document
without the consent of each of the Banks.

performance or enforcement of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any
of the Bank Parties, or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect hereto
or thereto, except that no Bank Party shall be entitled to such indemnification
to the extent of any such Indemnified Liabilities arising on account of such
Bank Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  If and to the extent that
the foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company
hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable
law.  Nothing set forth above shall be construed to relieve any Bank Party from
any obligation it may have under this Agreement.  All obligations provided for

                          EXCERPT FROM MARCH 22, 1990
                       BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING MINUTES



Mr. Clough then introduced a proposal for incentive compensation for the
corporate officers of Wyle, based on corporate performance against established
goals.  In particular, non-operating corporate officers would have part of their
bonus based on the return on equity ("ROE") of Wyle for fiscal 1991, i.e.,
actual ROE performance for fiscal 1991 would result in a predetermined factor
that would be multiplied by half of the prior year's bonus to determine the ROE
part of the fiscal 1991 bonus; the remaining bonus amount would be
discretionary.

For Messrs. Herring and Ozorkiewicz, the operating officers, their respective
operating group's RONA performance would each result in a predetermined factor
that would each be multiplied by 1/3 of the prior year's bonus to determine the
RONA and ROE portions of their fiscal 1991 bonus; the remaining bonus amounts
would be discretionary.

Mr. Irell indicated that a copy of the proposed plan had been sent to members of
the Executive Compensation Committee and, after consideration, the Committee
recommended the plan for adoption to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Sanders also
spoke in favor of the motion and added a few comments concerning the plan.  A
copy of the performance goals and recommended plan is attached to these minutes.

After further discussion among the directors, upon motion duly made, seconded
and unanimously carried, with Messrs. Clough, Freedman and Herring abstaining,
the incentive compensation plan for corporate officers of Wyle Laboratories was
adopted.

                   DESCRIPTION OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
                   FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF WYLE ELECTRONICS



The Company's Board of Directors has extended the plan, originally effective for
its fiscal year ended January 31, 1991, substantially on the same terms for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 1995, except that the performance targets are
based upon RONA and earnings per share, the multipliers are applied to each
officer's incentive target amount and the plan ratios have been modified.  The
current RONA and EPS multipliers range from 0.1 to 2.0.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 1995
totaled $1.077 billion and $36.2 million, respectively. In comparison to the
prior year, sales rose by 36% and income from continuing operations increased
159%. The growth in sales for 1995, compared to 1994, resulted mainly from
increased shipments of semiconductor products, particularly those offered
through the company's value-added activities such as design of application-
specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and other semiconductor design/programming
services, along with kitting, turnkey manufacturing and autoreplenishment.
Shipments of lower-margin PC microprocessors in 1995 were down from the previous
year. The company also registered significantly higher shipments of computer
systems and mass storage devices in 1995 versus 1994.

The increase in income from continuing operations for the year ended December
31, 1995, over the year ended December 31, 1994, primarily reflects the
company's growth in sales. Additionally, the company's aggregate gross margin
percentage increased in comparison to the prior year, due mainly to a change in
the mix of products sold. Earnings for 1995 also benefited from lower selling
and administrative expense as a percentage of sales, due in part to an increase
in sales for the company's new expansion branches, which began operations in
mid-1993. Operating results for 1995 reflected a higher level of interest
expense due to an increased level of credit line borrowings.

For the year ended December 31, 1994, the company reported sales of $792.3
million and income from continuing operations of $14.0 million. In 1994, the
company recorded a special charge to continuing operations of $1.9 million ($1.2
million after tax) primarily for anticipated legal expenses associated with a
certain litigation matter (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements herein). Additionally, on December 23, 1994, the company completed
the sale of its Scientific Services & Systems Group, which it accounted for as a
discontinued operation (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
herein), and recorded a loss on the sale of $15.8 million, after income taxes.
After recording the loss on sale and income from discontinued operations, the
company reported a net loss of $381,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994.

During 1993, the company changed its fiscal year-end from January 31 to December
31, resulting in an eleven-month fiscal year for the period ended December 31,
1993. Therefore, operating results for the year ended December 31, 1994, which
reflect a full twelve-month reporting period, are not directly comparable with
those of the period ended December 31, 1993.

For the eleven months ended December 31, 1993, the company posted sales of
$473.4 million and income from continuing operations of $8.3 million. Net
income, including income from discontinued operations, totaled $11.3 million,
before the effect of an accounting change.

During the first quarter ended April 30, 1993, the company recorded a one-time,
non-cash charge of $3.2 million, after income taxes, for the cumulative effect
of an accounting change to adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein).

In May 1993, the company initiated a major geographic expansion program to open
ten new facilities in key eastern and midwestern markets within the United
States. The company's earnings for the eleven months ended December 31, 1993
were negatively impacted by initial expansion-related start-up expenses
aggregating approximately $8 million. As anticipated, the expansion operations
incurred quarterly operating losses through June 30, 1994 during this initial
investment period. Sales for the new expansion divisions have increased steadily
since inception and aggregate operating losses for these divisions continued to
decline through the quarter ended June 30, 1994. During the second half of 1994,
the expansion divisions, as a whole, began providing a positive income
contribution.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

The growth in sales for the year ended December 31, 1994, in comparison to the
eleven months ended December 31, 1993, resulted mainly from increased demand for
semiconductor products, especially those offered through the company's value-
added services. The company also registered higher shipments of lower margin
commodity products, primarily microprocessors, and increased computer product
revenues. The continued ramp-up in shipments from the company's new expansion
divisions also contributed to the sales gain in 1994. In addition, revenues for
1994 included twelve months of operations versus the eleven-month period of
1993.

The increase in income from continuing operations for the year ended December
31, 1994, compared to the eleven months ended December 31, 1993, primarily
reflects the reduction in operating losses associated with the company's major
expansion program, coupled with higher profits generated by the non-expansion
divisions. During 1994, the company experienced a decline in the aggregate gross
margin percentage compared to the prior year due mainly to a change in product
mix, as a larger percentage of revenues was generated from lower margin
commodity products and high-volume customer engagements. Earnings for 1994 also
reflected increased interest expense due to higher levels of credit line
borrowings. In addition, income from continuing operations for 1994 included
twelve months of operations versus the eleven-month period for 1993.

The electronics distribution industry is highly sensitive to fluctuating market
conditions primarily caused by changes in the supply and demand for
semiconductors and computer products. Accordingly, the company's financial
results may reflect significant variations from period-to-period due to these
factors.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Operating results for the Scientific Services & Systems Group are classified as
discontinued operations on the company's consolidated statements of income.
Therefore, the company's sales and income from continuing operations for all
periods reflect only the operating results of its electronics distribution
business.

The Scientific Services & Systems Group reported income of $1.4 million, after
tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 1994. Sales and income from
discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 were
substantially below the prior year, primarily due to the continuing decline in
the aerospace and defense markets served by the group. In addition, operating
results in 1994 reflected costs and expenses totaling $1.1 million associated
with resolving a certain contract dispute.

OTHER

Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1995 of $3.3 million
increased, in comparison to the year ended December 31, 1994, due to higher
credit line borrowing levels that were incurred primarily to fund the company's
working capital requirements associated with its sales growth and to finance the
construction of a new warehouse/value-added distribution center.

Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1994 of $1.3 million was
above that for the eleven months ended December 31, 1993 mainly as a result of
increased credit line borrowings, which were incurred to fund the company's
continuing start-up costs and working capital requirements associated with its
expansion program. An interest rate swap agreement previously entered into by
the company had an immaterial effect on overall interest expense for the periods
presented.

                                      16

The company's effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 39.7%,
38.5% and 34.5% for the periods ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The rise in the effective tax rate for 1994 versus 1993 can be
attributed mainly to the reduced effect of certain credits to the income tax
provision and an increase in the aggregate effective state income tax rate, as a
larger proportion of sales are being derived from states with higher income tax
rates due, in part, to the company's national expansion.

On January 1, 1994, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The adoption of this statement did not
have a material effect on the company's net income (loss) or financial position.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The company's working capital at December 31, 1995 of $255.5 million rose by
$84.7 million from December 31, 1994. Working capital growth resulted primarily
from an increase in inventories and trade receivables due to higher sales
levels, offset partially by higher accounts payable. The current ratio was 3.0
to 1 at December 31, 1995 compared with 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 1994. The ratio
of long-term debt to total capital was 31% and 10% at December 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively. The increased debt to capital ratio resulted primarily from
higher long-term credit line borrowings, offset partly by an increase in
shareholders' equity due mainly to additional net income for the year.

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 1995 aggregated $23.6
million, which are higher than the year ended December 31, 1994 due mainly to
the construction of a new value-added distribution center. Capital outlays for
this new facility, which is on schedule to become fully operational in 1996,
aggregated approximately $13.9 million during 1995. The company expects its
total capital expenditures for 1996 to be approximately $10 million.

Many factors affect the company's cash requirements such as changes in its sales
level and inventory turnover rate. During electronics industry growth periods,
as was the case in 1995, increases in receivable and inventory balances have
typically been financed through cash on hand and cash flow from operations as
well as bank borrowings. During electronics industry recessionary periods, cash
has been generated through receivable and inventory reductions.

In December 1995, the company amended its $80 million three-year revolving
credit agreement with four banks by increasing the committed credit line to $140
million and extending its maturity through December 1998. In addition, the
company has arrangements with a number of other banks to provide short-term
financing on a non-committed basis.

On January 2, 1996, the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock (the
"Stock") of Sylvan Ginsbury, Ltd., a New Jersey corporation, and certain
affiliated entities ("Ginsbury"), an international distributor of active,
passive and interconnect electronic products with operations in the United
States and six European countries (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements herein). The negotiated purchase price of the Ginsbury
stock was approximately $38.8 million, of which $30.8 million was paid in cash.
The acquisition was financed mainly through borrowings under the company's
revolving credit agreement.

The company's cash requirements for 1996 will include funds required to finance
the $30.8 million cash portion of the acquisition of Ginsbury. The company's
near-term cash requirements are expected to be financed through a combination of
internally generated cash flow, bank borrowings and other sources of available
capital.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

The company is an international electronics distributor, specializing in
marketing semiconductors and computer products, as well as providing value-added
services, which include complex materials management systems and engineering
design services for semiconductor products (see Note 12).

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wyle Electronics
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

Discontinued Operations

On December 23, 1994, the company completed the sale of its Scientific Services
& Systems ("SS&S") business (see Note 9). Operating results for SS&S are
classified as discontinued operations in the company's consolidated statements
of income and prior periods have been restated accordingly.

Change in Fiscal Year-end

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993, the company changed its fiscal
year-end from January 31 to December 31, resulting in an eleven-month reporting
period.

Change in Accounting Principles

As of February 1, 1993, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," and Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As
of January 1, 1994, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The effects of adopting these
accounting standards are described in Notes 4 and 8. Financial statements for
the previous years have not been restated as a result of the adoption of these
standards.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are generally recognized at the time of shipment of the product.

Interest Income

Interest income earned on short-term investments is classified in the
consolidated statements of income as a reduction of interest expense. Interest
income was $209,000 and $254,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, and $897,000 for the eleven months ended December 31, 1993.

Receivables

Receivables include amounts billed to customers for products shipped or services
performed which are anticipated to be collected within one year. Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited by the large number
of customers comprising the company's customer base and their dispersion across
different industries.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in first-out or average cost)
or market.

Property, Plant & Equipment

Property, plant & equipment are stated at cost. Major improvements and
betterments are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor refurbishments are
expensed as incurred. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method
based on estimated useful lives. Useful lives range from 2 to 40 years for
buildings and improvements and from 2 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or
estimated useful life.

                                      22

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

For the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
on hand and cash invested in short-term securities with original maturities of
three months or less. The company places its temporary cash investments in high-
quality securities and, by policy, limits the amount that can be invested in any
one particular instrument.

                                                       =================
</TABLE>

The non-committed credit line borrowings at December 31, 1995 bear interest at
rates ranging from 6.09% - 6.34%, and were due on various dates through January
16, 1996. Such unsecured amounts are classified as long-term debt on the balance
sheet, since they may be refinanced at any time with borrowings under the
company's three-year revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement
borrowing at December 31, 1995 bears interest at 6.05%.

In December 1995, the company amended its $80,000,000 three-year revolving
credit agreement with four banks by increasing the committed credit line to
$140,000,000 and extending its maturity through December 1998. The credit
agreement provides for borrowings at either the agent bank's reference rate or
the Eurodollar rate plus .25% to .55%, depending on the company's leverage
ratio. An annual facility fee of .125% to .20%, also based on the company's
leverage ratio, is payable on the amount of the commitment. The company has
additional credit line arrangements with a number of banks that provide for
short-term borrowings on a non-committed basis.

Terms of certain borrowing agreements of the company provide, among other
things, for the maintenance of certain amounts or ratios relating to working
capital, debt, tangible net worth and fixed charge coverage. The agreements also
provide for restrictions on additional debt, payment of dividends, purchase of
company stock and capital expenditures. Pursuant to the most restrictive
covenants of these agreements, retained earnings of $31,111,000 were available
at December 31, 1995 for the payment of cash dividends on common stock. The
company is in full compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in the
borrowing agreements.

Aggregate maturities of long-term debt are $3,000,000 for 1996 and $87,600,000
for 1998.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Note 4. Income Taxes

On February 1, 1993, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided
on differences between financial reporting and taxable income using the enacted
tax rates. The adoption of this new statement did not have a material effect on
the company's net income or financial position.

The provision for income taxes from continuing operations was computed using
effective tax rates calculated as follows:

Net deferred tax assets at December 31, 1995 of $13,894,000 consisted of
deferred tax assets of $19,540,000 and deferred tax liabilities of $5,646,000.
Net deferred tax assets at December 31, 1994 of $13,356,000 consisted of
deferred tax assets of $19,583,000 and deferred tax liabilities of $6,227,000.
Deferred taxes are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as current or
noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability. Net
current deferred tax assets of $5,675,000 and $6,524,000 are included in prepaid
expenses at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. No valuation allowance was
required for the deferred tax assets.

Note 5. Capital Stock and Dividends

Common stock authorized is 25,000,000 shares. The company declared and paid
dividends on common stock of $.28 per share during the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994. Preference stock authorized is 500,000 shares. No preference
stock was outstanding at December 31, 1995 or 1994.

The company has a Shareholder Rights Plan (the "Plan") which provides for one
stock purchase right (the "Rights") to be traded initially in tandem with each
share of its common stock. The Plan provides that if any person becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the
company, each Right (other than Rights held by the 15% shareholder) will be
exercisable, on or after the close of business on the tenth business day
following such event, to purchase common stock having 

                                      24
<PAGE>
 
a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the Rights
(currently $85.00), or may be exchangeable for one share of common stock.

The Plan further provides that if, on or after the occurrence of such event, the
company is merged into any other corporation or if 50% or more of the company's
assets or earning power are sold, appropriate provision shall be made so that
each Right (other than Rights held by the 15% shareholder) will be exercisable
to purchase common stock of the acquiring corporation having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the Rights. The Rights expire on
February 23, 2005, and are subject to redemption by the Board of Directors at
$.01 per Right at any time prior to the first date upon which they become
exercisable.

In 1994, the company reactivated a plan to purchase from time to time up to
1,500,000 shares of the corporation's common stock in the open market or through
negotiated purchases. The company's Board of Directors has authorized the
implementation of this stock repurchase plan in phases, with the initial phase
approved at $10 million of aggregate stock purchases. Through December 31, 1995,
132,100 shares had been purchased under this program, of which 40,900 shares
were acquired during 1995. The shares purchased, which remain authorized but
unissued, were financed primarily through internally generated cash and bank
borrowings.

Note 6. Stock Options and Awards

Under the company's stock option and stock incentive plans, non-qualified and
incentive stock options, restricted stock, performance awards and stock
appreciation rights may be granted to selected key employees. Non-qualified
stock options may be granted at prices less than 100% of the fair market value
of the company's common stock on the date of grant. Through December 31, 1995,
no stock options have been granted at less than fair market value under any of
the plans. Options generally become exercisable beginning one year from the date
of grant in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Options are
exercisable on a cumulative basis and expire ten years from the date of grant.

A summary of changes in the shares under option follows:

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1995, expiration dates for options outstanding ranged from 1996
to 2005, with a weighted average purchase price of $19.57; options for 394,168
shares were exercisable and 335,387 shares were reserved for the granting of
additional options or awards. No amounts have been reflected in the company's
consolidated statements of income with respect to these stock options.

Restricted share awards of the company's common stock are subject to certain
restriction periods from the date of grant, during which they may not be sold,
assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered. Restricted stock awards of 80,997,
3,950 and 13,300 shares were granted during the periods ended December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively. The unvested portion of restricted stock is
included as an offset to common stock on the consolidated statements of
shareholders' equity, and is amortized as vesting occurs.

Under the company's stock option plan for its outside directors, non-employee
members of its Board of Directors may receive a grant of up to 5,000 non-
qualified stock options annually up to a maximum of 10,000 that are exercisable
in equal annual installments over a three-year period. Stock options under this
program cannot be granted at less than fair market value on the date of grant.
Stock options granted under this plan, included in the table above, totaled
15,000, 50,000 and 40,000 for the periods ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." The company plans to adopt this required statement for 1996 under
the disclosure method. Accordingly, there will be no impact on the reported
results of operations or financial position.

Note 7. Income (Loss) per Share

Income (loss) per share is computed based on the average number of shares of
common stock and common equivalent shares (stock options) outstanding, after
giving effect to the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options. Dual
presentation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share has not been made
on the consolidated statements of income because the differences are
insignificant.

Note 8. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits Plans

The company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its
employees. Plan benefits are generally based on employees' years of service and
average compensation during the final years of employment. Funding of retirement
costs for the plan complies with the funding requirements specified by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act. At December 31, 1995, plan assets were
invested in diversified equity portfolios (62%), pooled funds or fixed income
securities (32%) or in guaranteed income contracts (6%).

Pension expense, including discontinued operations for the year ended December
31, 1994 and for the eleven months ended December 31, 1993, consists of the
following components:

</TABLE>

In determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
under the pension plan, the discount rate used was 7.5% as of December 31, 1995
and 8.25% as of December 31, 1994, and the rate of increase in future
compensation levels was 5.0% for both periods. The expected long-term rate of
return on pension plan assets was 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 1995 and
1994.

The company's pension plan provides that, in the event the plan is terminated
following an involuntary change of control, any excess plan assets over plan
liabilities would be used to provide increased benefits under the pension plan
or other employee benefit plans.

                                      26
<PAGE>
 
The company has a supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") which provides
benefits to certain employees whose benefits under the defined benefit pension
plan are reduced as a result of limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue
Code. The present value of the accumulated benefit obligation related to this
plan totaled $3,437,000 at December 31, 1995 and $2,405,000 at December 31,
1994. Expense under the SERP was $641,000, $393,000 and $473,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and the eleven months ended December 31, 1993,
respectively.

The company maintains a capital accumulation plan, which qualifies under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, for employees meeting certain service
requirements. Eligible employees can contribute up to 15% of their annual
compensation, subject to certain Internal Revenue Code restrictions. In 1994,
the company began matching employee contributions at a rate of 25% on the first
$1,200 contributed. Company matching contributions for the years ended December
31, 1995 and 1994 aggregated $182,000 and $316,000, respectively.

The company has Rabbi trusts to fund benefit payments under its SERP and other
executive and director deferred compensation plans. Trust assets are irrevocable
to the company but are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
Assets held in the trusts at December 31, 1995 and 1994 totaled $3,724,000 and
$3,531,000, respectively.

The company also has an unfunded retirement plan for its outside directors under
which benefits are accrued over the estimated service period for each covered
director. Amounts expensed related to this plan were not significant for the
periods presented.

The company has a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust
to fund certain employee benefit payments. Trust assets, which are irrevocable
to the company, totaled $734,000 and $530,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

The company provides postretirement medical coverage to qualifying employees.
The company's employees upon retirement may become eligible for benefits if they
meet certain age and length of service requirements as specified in the plan.

In December 1990, the FASB issued Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Statement No. 106 required the
company to change its method of accounting for postretirement benefits, to
accrue for the cost of these benefits during an employee's years of service. On
February 1, 1993, the company adopted the new statement by recording a one-time
charge of $3,193,000 (which was net of income taxes of $1,796,000), representing
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (the "APBO") as of February 1,
1993. The new statement had no effect on the company's cash outlays for retiree
benefits.

The provision for postretirement benefits, including discontinued operations for
the year ended December 31, 1994 and for the eleven months ended December 31,
1993, consists of the following components:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The company's postretirement benefits provision for the year ended December 31,
1994 included a curtailment gain, which was included in the loss on sale of
discontinued operations (see Note 9). The company will continue to be
responsible for certain postretirement benefit obligations relating to the
discontinued operations.

Components of the APBO recognized in the company's consolidated balance sheets
at December 31 were as follows:

</TABLE>

In determining the actuarial present value of the APBO as of December 31, 1995,
the assumed health care cost trend rate was 10%, reducing gradually to an
ultimate rate of 5.5% in 2001, and the discount rate was 7.5%. As of December
31,1994, the assumed health care cost trend rate was 11%, reducing gradually to
an ultimate rate of 6.25% in 2000, and the discount rate was 8.25%. If the
health care cost trend rate were increased by 1% in each year, the APBO as of
December 31, 1995 would be increased by $972,000, and the service cost and
interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit expense for
the current year would be increased by $135,000.

In November 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." This statement required the company to change its
method of accounting for postemployment benefits provided to qualifying former
or inactive employees and their dependents before retirement, to accrue for the
cost of these benefits during an employee's years of service. The company's
adoption of the new statement at the beginning of 1994 had an immaterial effect
on its net income and financial position.

Note 9. Discontinued Operations

On December 23, 1994, the company completed the sale of its Scientific Services
& Systems ("SS&S") business to WESS Investment Corporation ("WESS"), a buyout
group led by William E. Simon & Sons and certain members of the SS&S management
along with a current and two former members of the company's Board of Directors.

Under the terms of the agreement, WESS acquired certain assets and liabilities
of SS&S, including receivables, inventory, property, equipment, accounts payable
and accrued expenses for a negotiated purchase price of $30 million in cash,
subject to adjustment, plus additional amounts that may be paid to the company
under a five-year earnout provision. Certain excess real properties of SS&S were
excluded from the sale to WESS. Such assets are stated at their estimated net
realizable value of $3,433,000 at December 31, 1995 and $3,695,000 at December
31, 1994, and are classified in other assets. The company intends to sell these
assets in the future.

During 1994, the company recorded a loss on sale of discontinued operations of
$15.8 million, after income tax benefits of $9.9 million. The loss on sale
included certain transaction costs and reserves associated with the disposition
such as reserves for insurance and employee related matters, various contractual
arrangements and certain contingent liabilities. The loss on sale was reduced by
certain curtailment gains as discussed in Note 8. Accrued expenses related to

                                      28
<PAGE>
 
discontinued operations totaled $77,000 at December 31, 1995 and $11,908,000 at
December 31, 1994. Long-term liabilities related to discontinued operations
totaled $14,574,000 and $16,258,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Operating results for SS&S are classified as discontinued operations on the
company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 1994
and the eleven months ended December 31, 1993. Sales applicable to discontinued
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and the eleven months
ended December 31, 1993 aggregated $61,076,000 and $84,498,000, respectively.
Income from discontinued operations is net of income taxes of $1,036,000 and
$2,030,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and the eleven months
ended December 31, 1993, respectively. Operating results for SS&S from October
1, 1994 through the closing date of the sale were netted in balance sheet
reserves established as part of the loss on sale.

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

The minimum aggregate rentals payable on long-term operating leases subsequent
to December 31, 1995 approximate $18,645,000. The amounts are payable as
follows: 1996 - $4,912,000; 1997 - $3,506,000; 1998 - $3,009,000; 1999 -
$2,167,000; 2000 - $1,658,000 and thereafter - $3,393,000. Rental expense
(including month to month rentals) approximated $7,300,000, $8,096,000 and
$6,477,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and the eleven months
ended December 31, 1993, respectively.

Contingencies

In May 1993, Avnet, Inc. ("Avnet") and Hall-Mark Electronics Corporation 
("Hall-Mark") filed a civil action against the company and a former employee of
Hall-Mark in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, seeking injunctive
and unspecified monetary damages, alleging, inter alia, that the company
tortiously interfered with the employment relations of Hall-Mark and its
employees and that the company tortiously interfered with a proposed business
combination between the plaintiffs, which combination was consummated
subsequently. Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was denied in part
by the trial court and affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court in December 1993.
The company filed a counterclaim against plaintiffs, alleging, inter alia, that
plaintiffs had tortiously interfered with the company's business and employment
relations. On October 31, 1995, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims in
Georgia without prejudice, and the Georgia court then entered summary judgment
against the company on the counterclaim and dismissed same.

In September 1995, the plaintiffs refiled the same action against the company
and certain company employees in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County,
Florida, which the company has now moved to dismiss. The Florida litigation is
still pending. While this litigation is in the pretrial stage, the company
believes that plaintiffs' complaint is without merit and will contest it
vigorously. The company recorded a special charge of $1,900,000 during the third
quarter of 1994, primarily for anticipated legal expenses associated with the
defense of this litigation. Although management cannot predict the ultimate
outcome with any certainty, management believes that a result adverse to the
company in this matter is unlikely.

The company also has other contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course
of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of such
matters will not materially affect the company's results of operations or
financial position.

Note 12. Subsequent Event

On January 2, 1996, the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock (the
"Stock") of Sylvan Ginsbury, Ltd., a New Jersey corporation, and certain
affiliated entities ("Ginsbury"), an international distributor of active,
passive and interconnect electronic products with operations in the United
States and six European countries. The assets represented by the Stock generally
include personal property, inventory, accounts receivable, intellectual
property, assigned contracts, permits and other identifiable intangible assets.
The negotiated purchase price of the Ginsbury stock was approximately $38.8
million consisting of $30.8 million in cash paid on the closing date, $3.0
million of restricted stock issued at closing and up to $5.0 million in cash for
an earnout provision, which is potentially payable based on the future financial
performance of Ginsbury over a five-year period. The acquisition was financed
mainly through borrowings under the company's revolving credit agreement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wyle Electronics:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wyle Electronics
(a California corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the eleven-month period
ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wyle Electronics and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994
and the eleven-month period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
February 1, 1993, the company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions.
