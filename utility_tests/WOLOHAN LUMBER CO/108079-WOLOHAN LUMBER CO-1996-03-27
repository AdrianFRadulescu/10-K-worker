                                    PART I


Item 1.  Business.

         Wolohan Lumber Co. (the "registrant") is engaged in the retail sale
         of a full-line of lumber and building materials and related items,
         through a chain of 62 building supply stores located in Illinois,
         Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.

         The registrant sells to contractor builders and remodelers and to the
         "do-it-yourself" market consisting principally of homeowners. Each
         segment accounted for approximately 50% of the registrant's sales for
         1995.

         The registrant sells more than 43,000 different products which are
         purchased from approximately 1,185 suppliers. No supplier accounts
         for more than 6% of total purchases. The registrant purchases lumber
         products primarily from lumber and plywood mills and more than half
         of all other merchandise from original producers or manufacturers.

         The business of the registrant is not dependent upon a single
         customer or a few customers for any significant portion of sales.

         The registrant believes that backlogs are not significant to its
         business.

         The registrant is engaged in only one line of business - retail sales
         of lumber and building materials and related items. The classes of
         products include dimension lumber; sheathing plywood; building
         materials; building hardware; lawn and garden; millwork; plumbing,
         heating and electrical; kitchen cabinets and vanities; home
         decorations; trusses and components, including storage barns; and
         other forest products, such as fencing and treated lumber.

         The business of the registrant is highly competitive, and it
         encounters competition from both nationwide and regional chains and
         from local independent merchants, as well as integrated department
         stores such as K mart, WAL-MART and Sears. Because of the variety of
         competition faced by the registrant and the wide range of products it
         sells, it is virtually impossible to determine the registrant's
         competitive position in the markets it serves.

         The registrant holds no material patents, trademarks, licenses,
         franchises or concessions.

         The registrant's business generally is subject to seasonal
         influences. The second and third quarters are generally the periods
         of highest sales volumes while the first quarter is usually the
         period of lowest sales volume.

         The registrant had approximately 1,600 full-time employees at
         December 31, 1995.



                                      -2-


<PAGE>


         To the best of the registrant's knowledge, it is complying with all
         federal, state and local environmental protection provisions.


Item 2.  Properties.

         The administrative offices of the registrant are located in a
         28,000-square-foot, two-story brick face building situated on three
         acres of land owned by the registrant in Saginaw, Michigan.

         The registrant operates 62 building supply stores in the states of
         Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.
         The showroom selling space in the stores averages 27,000 square feet.
         In addition, total warehouse and storage space (under roof) ranges in
         size from 10,000 square feet to 63,000 square feet (average of 25,000
         square feet).

         All of the building supply stores are owned in fee by the registrant
         with the exception of six leased stores (including a leased facility
         opened in March, 1996) and one store which is occupied under an
         agreement with a local municipality. This agreement provides for
         payments in amounts sufficient to retire the industrial revenue bonds
         issued to finance the acquisition and construction of the store and
         to pay interest on the bonds. This obligation has been recorded in
         the registrant's financial statements.

         The registrant believes that all of its building supply stores and
         the display, warehouse and storage facilities and equipment located
         thereon are well maintained and adequate for the purpose for which
         they are used. A fleet of approximately 400 trucks is owned by the
         registrant for the delivery of its retail merchandise.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

         There are no material legal proceedings pending against the
         registrant.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

         Not applicable.

Stark who joined the Company in 1993. Prior thereto, Mr. Stark was Director of
Human Resources for Wickes Lumber Company.

employees.

OUR PURPOSE

SHAREOWNERS'
ADDRESS

     As expected, 1995 was challenging and somewhat disappointing for our
industry and for Wolohan Lumber. The challenges included:

o 12 percent fewer housing starts in the Midwest as compared with 1994.

o Sharply lower lumber prices (1995 lumber prices on average were 20-percent
  lower than 1994).

o Intense and growing competition from large chains and
  smaller regional chains.

o A sluggish economy which resulted in very poor consumer sales for the
  home-improvement sector of retailing.

     Within this environment, Wolohan Lumber was profitable in a year when
many retailers in our industry incurred a loss and some went out of business.
For 1995, Wolohan Lumber also made significant progress in a number of areas:

o Capital improvements totaled $11.2 million and included the addition of 
  five new stores and the relocation of one store.

o Four underperforming stores were closed.

o Scanning equipment was installed in 32 more stores, completing this
  technology upgrade.

o We researched and committed to a new computer system that is much more
  marketing and sales oriented than our current system. Complete installation
  of this system is expected in late 1996.

o Our strong associate-training and communication program placing primary
  emphasis on sales, marketing and value-added services, was continued and
  enhanced.

     Sales in 1995 were $418,058,000, 7 percent below 1994. Consumer sales
were off 8 percent and contractor sales declined 6 percent. On a
comparable-store basis, 1995 sales declined 12 percent.

     Including expenses associated with four store closings, our 1995 net
income was a disappointing $3,735,000, or 53 cents per share, a 66-percent
decline from 1994 income of $11,062,000, or $1.55 per share. Excluding the
costs of store closings, our net income was $5,642,000, or 80 cents per share.

     Despite the challenges of 1995, our balance sheet remains strong. Cash
and equivalents totaled $13.9 million at year-end. Our modest debt level was
reduced by $1 million from prior year-end. During 1995, 168,000 shares of
common stock were purchased and retired at an average per-share price of
$10.15. Year-end shareowners' equity of $104.4 million was 80 percent of
invested capital.

     Because of our strong balance sheet, Wolohan Lumber was able to continue
its efforts to reposition store assets, despite significant related costs. New
stores were opened in Sault Ste. Marie and Prudenville, Mich. Three stores
were acquired in the Michigan markets of Grawn, Empire and Marne. Pre-opening
and acquisition costs related to these five stores were approximately $1.1
million. Part of our retailing discipline of managing corporate resources is
also to liquidate and redeploy assets which do not have a reasonable prospect
of earning an acceptable return. In 1995, we closed stores in New
Philadelphia, Ohio; Richmond, Ind.; and Holland and Niles, Mich. Expenses and
write-offs associated with the closing of these stores totaled $3.3 million.

     Executive management was significantly strengthened during 1995. David G.
Honaman, previously vice-president-marketing and merchandising with 18 years
of Company experience, was elected vice-president-administration and chief
financial officer. Mark Hershberger, previously director of marketing with 23
years of Company experience, was appointed director of purchasing. Curtis J.
LeMaster, with more than 25 years of industry experience, joined our Company
as director of marketing. Each of these talented executives brings new vigor
and energy to their respective areas of responsibility.

     Looking to 1996, we see many challenges and opportunities. First-quarter
sales and profits have been negatively impacted by unusually harsh weather.
However, we expect stronger demand for our products and services as spring
approaches. <PAGE>

     Over the last year, the level of competition in our retail industry has
increased greatly in the Midwest. We expect the size, strength and focus of
competition to intensify further in 1996, as numerous large retail chains
continue their Midwest expansion. There are too many stores competing for the
available business. As a direct consequence, we expect significant
consolidation in the number of retailers over the next few years. The
poor-to-average operators either have been, or will be, forced out of
business. At the same time, we also expect continued long-term growth in the
demand for home construction, repair and improvement products.

     At Wolohan Lumber, our challenge is to become more knowledgeable of the
expectations of our core customer base of homebuilders, remodeling contractors
and project-oriented consumers. We intend to build on current areas of
expertise and marketing strength and de-emphasize or eliminate products and
programs which do not give us a competitive advantage. In this manner, we
believe we can increase market share in key niche sectors where we have strong
and growing core competencies.

     We have increased our focus on basic product lines such as wood products,
building materials, millwork, kitchens and bathrooms. We have taken numerous
steps to reduce selling, general and administrative tasks. Bar-code (UPC)
scanning of products has been installed in virtually all our stores. We are
expanding the training and development of our associates to create an
associate team we can be certain is capable and highly motivated to meet and
exceed the expectations of our customers. We are working with our suppliers to
jointly eliminate unnecessary expenses in order to reduce the net landed cost
of products purchased for our stores. We will continue to price our products
to remain competitive everyday.

     During the first quarter of 1996, we opened a new store in Shelbyville,
Ind., bringing our current store count to 62. We continue to look for
attractive acquisitions of existing businesses within our Midwest markets.

     Each year brings with it the challenge for creativity and innovation,
especially as it relates to efficiently meeting the demands of the changing
marketplace. We look forward to the challenges and opportunities 1996 will
bring, knowing that with the extraordinary dedication of our Wolohan team of
associates, the counsel of our Board of Directors, and the continued support
of our shareowners, we will make great strides toward stronger growth in sales
and profitability for our Company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      The decline in net income in 1995 (66 percent) from 1994 was due to
lower sales, slightly lower margins and the effect of closing four stores,
which resulted in $3.3 million of costs (before tax) and, thereby, reduced
earnings per share by 27 cents. The improvement in net income in 1994 (30
percent) from 1993 was due to increased sales, a slight improvement in
margins, a lower operating-expense ratio and a gain (9 cents per share) from
selling a closed facility.

      Sales in 1995 declined 7 percent from 1994, the result of an 8-percent
decrease in consumer/do-it-yourself (DIY) sales and a 6-percent reduction in
contractor builder and remodeler sales. Sales in 1994 exceeded 1993's sales by
18 percent. Sales in 1995 were adversely affected by significantly lower
average selling prices of lumber (approximately 20 percent less than 1994),
which accounted for approximately one-half of the total sales decline from
1994. In addition, the consumer sales decline was due primarily to sluggish
consumer spending and additional competition in our markets. Contractor
builder and remodeler sales were negatively affected by fewer housing starts
in the Midwest. Comparable-store consumer sales declined 15 percent in 1995
versus a 3-percent rise in 1994; comparable-store contractor sales decreased 8
percent in 1995 compared with an 18-percent improvement in 1994; and total
comparable-store sales in 1995 decreased 12 percent after an 11-percent
increase in 1994.

      The gross profit margin in 1995 was 23.9 percent, compared with 24.1
percent in 1994 and 23.9 percent in 1993. Increased competition kept pressure
on margins in 1995 and was offset, in part, by deflation in the costs of
forest products which lowered the LIFO provision compared to 1994. The LIFO
provision was a credit of $1,713,000 in 1995, compared with charges of
$1,269,000 and $3,956,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      The gross margin in 1995, excluding the provision for LIFO, was 23.5
percent versus 24.4 percent in 1994 and 24.9 percent in 1993.

      The Company uses the LIFO method of inventory valuation because it
results in a more appropriate matching of current costs and current revenues.
A number of the Company's competitors use the FIFO method. The following
supplemental data is presented to illustrate the comparative effects of FIFO
and LIFO accounting on the Company's results. Under FIFO accounting, net
income would have been $1 million, or 14 cents per share lower for 1995; $.8
million, or 11 cents per share higher for 1994; and $2.5 million, or 35 cents
per share higher for 1993. These supplemental FIFO earnings reflect the tax-
effected LIFO charge for each year.

      Income from gains on sale of properties totaled $309,000 in 1995,
compared with $1.26 million in 1994 and $323,000 in 1993. The gain recognized
in 1994 was the result of the sale of a closed facility.

      Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding store-closing
costs) decreased 1 percent in 1995 from 1994, resulting in an expense factor
of 19.4 percent in 1995 compared with 18.3 percent and 18.6 percent in 1994
and 1993, respectively. The higher expense factor in 1995 was due primarily to
additional costs related to marketing efforts, higher bad-debt expense,
expenses related to the upgrading of our computer technology and higher
health-insurance expenses. Expenses related to new store openings and
remodels were approximately $1.1 million in 1995, $2.3 million in 1994 and
$1.8 million in 1993. The costs associated with the closing of four stores
during 1995 approximated $3.3 million, primarily related to expensing portions
of future lease payments on longer-term leases and the write-off of leasehold
improvements.

      The decrease in interest expense in 1995 reflects the reductions made in
long-term debt and lower average short-term borrowings compared with 1994. The
Company had no short-term borrowings at year-end 1995.

      The increase in depreciation expense from year to year reflects the
Company's capital expenditure program, which included five new stores in 1995,
six in 1994 and three in 1993.

      The effective income tax rate (federal and state combined) was 42.5
percent in 1995, compared with 39.4 percent in 1994 and 36.6 percent in 1993.
The increase in the effective tax rate in 1995 resulted primarily from an
increase in the effective state rate from 5.6 percent to 10.5 percent.

FINANCIAL CONDITION-LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

      Cash and cash equivalents totaled $13.9 million at Dec. 31, 1995,
compared with $22.1 million at Dec. 31, 1994, and $22.3 million at Dec. 31,
1993. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7 million in 1995,
resulting primarily from net income plus depreciation, offset by a reduction
in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8 million (due in part to lower
year-end inventory levels compared with Dec. 31, 1994). Major uses of cash
were: (1) additions to properties of $11.2 million, (2) a $1 million reduction
in long-term debt and (3) the purchase and retirement of 168,000 shares of
common stock ($1.7 million).

      Working capital was $60.6 million at the end of 1995, compared with
$64.8 million and $64.1 million at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The
Company expects that funds from operations and available lines of credit will
be adequate to meet working capital needs and capital expenditures for 1996
(estimated to be $3.7 million).

      The Company has $50 million available in lines of credit arrangements
for short-term debt. There were no borrowings under these arrangements at Dec.
31, 1995, 1994, and 1993.

      The total debt-to-asset ratio was lowered to .16:1 at Dec. 31, 1995 from
 .18:1 at Dec. 31, 1994 and .20:1 at Dec. 31, 1993.

      Capital expenditures totaled $11.2 million in 1995 and included: (1) the
addition of five new stores, (2) the relocation of an existing store, (3)
replacements and additions of equipment at existing stores, (4) hardware and
software related to the major technology upgrade initiated in 1995 and (5)
projects in-process at year-end, including the addition of one new store.
Capital expenditures have totaled $60 million over the last five years.

      Invested capital (long-term debt and shareowners' equity) was 81 percent
of total assets at Dec. 31, 1995 and 78 percent at Dec. 31, 1994, and 77
percent at Dec. 31, 1993.

      Shareowners' equity has been the principal financing factor over the
years, accounting for 80 percent of invested capital at Dec. 31, 1995, compared
with 78 percent at Dec. 31, 1994 and 74 percent at Dec. 31, 1993

EFFECT OF INFLATION

      The Company does not measure precisely the effect of inflation on its
operations; however, it does not believe inflation had a material effect on
sales or results of operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL

      The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment. While it is not possible to quantify with
certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters,
particularly any future remediation and other compliance effects, in the
opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental-protection
laws will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Company.

OUTLOOK

      The Company enters 1996 with a strong balance sheet and looks forward to
the challenges and opportunities of a changing marketplace. The Company is
committed to expanding market share in both consumer and contractor sales with
a strong customer-service focus, expanded marketing programs targeted at
project customers, and a stronger emphasis on buying and distribution
strategies to improve its competitive position. The Company will work
aggressively to lower its operating-expense ratios by focusing on training and
more-efficient systems. The Company will continue to build on its strengths
in 1996 as it strives to increase sales and profitability.

other financial information included in the Annual Report, were prepared by
management.

The responsibility for the integrity of the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, rests with management. The
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, of necessity,
include certain amounts which are based on our best estimates and judgments.
The other financial information included herein is consistent with that in the
financial statements.

Wolohan Lumber Co. maintains internal accounting-control systems that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safe-guarded from
loss or unauthorized or illegal use and that transactions are executed and
recorded in accordance with management authorization. There are limits
inherent in all systems of internal control, based on the recognition that
costs of such a system should not exceed the benefits to be derived. We
believe the Company's system provides an appropriate balance.

The Board of Directors, through the Audit Committee of the Board, is
responsible for assuring that management fulfills its responsibilities in the
preparation of the financial statements. The Audit Committee meets
periodically with the independent auditors and representatives of management
to ensure that each is discharging its responsibilities. To ensure complete
independence, Ernst & Young LLP has full and free access to meet with the
Audit Committee to discuss the results of their examination, the adequacy of
internal controls, the quality of financial reporting, and other matters of
mutual interest.

equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Wolohan Lumber Co. at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note D to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE A -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

ORGANIZATION. The Company is engaged in the retail sale of a full line of
lumber and building materials and related items through a chain of 61 (60 in
1994) building supply stores located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,
Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The Company sells to contractor builders and
remodelers and to the "do-it-yourself" market consisting principally of
homeowners. The volume of residential construction can be volatile and is
highly dependent on general economic conditions. A significant decrease in
residential construction could have an adverse effect on the Company's
operating results.

USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and short-term
tax-exempt securities.

INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last-in, first-out
method) or market. Current cost exceeded the LIFO value of inventories by
approximately $12,836,000 and $14,549,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

PROPERTIES. Properties are stated at cost. Depreciation, which includes
amortization of assets recorded as capital leases, is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the property for
financial reporting purposes and on different lives and methods as required
for tax purposes.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION. Periodically, the Company grants stock options for a
fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal
to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. The Company accounts
for stock options grants in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees", and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation
expense for stock option grants.

START-UP EXPENSES. Expenses associated with the opening of new stores are
charged against income as incurred.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings and profit-
sharing plan under which eligible employees may contribute up to 10 percent of 
their salaries. The Company matches 50 percent of the employee contribution 
up to a maximum of $400 per employee per year. In addition, the Company makes 
profit-sharing contributions to the plan annually at an amount based on a 
percentage of the Company's net profits or participants' annual compensation. 
Profit-sharing contributions approximated $525,000, $1,545,000, and $1,035,000 
for 1995, 1994, and 1993 respectively and contributions to the 401(k) plan were
approximately $414,000, $392,000, and $349,000 for 1995, 1994, and 1993
respectively.

  The Company maintains a defined-benefit health-care plan that provides
postretirement medical benefits to full-time employees who meet certain age
and service requirements at retirement. The plan is contributory with retiree
contributions adjusted periodically, such that retirees pay the full projected
costs of the health-care medical benefits provided by the plan.

STORE CLOSING COSTS. During 1995, the Company closed four stores. The costs
associated with these closings, primarily related to expensing portions of
future lease payments on longer term leases and the write-off of leasehold
improvements, approximated $3.3 million.

ADVERTISING EXPENSES. The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. The
Company incurred $4,277,000, $4,412,000, and $4,192,000 in advertising costs
during 1995, 1994, and 1993 respectively

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. In March 1995, the FASB issued
Statement No, 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of", which requires impairment losses to be
recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment
are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. Statement 121 also addresses
the accounting for long-lived assets that are expected to be disposed of. The
Company will adopt Statement 121 in the first quarter of 1996 and, based on
current circumstances, does not believe the effect of adoption will be
material.



NOTE B - SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND RELATED MATTERS

     The Long-Term Incentive Plan was established to enable key employees to
participate in the future growth and profitability of the Company by offering
them long-term performance-based incentive compensation through issuance of
stock options and performance share awards, which are vested based on
achievement of performance goals. Performance shares awarded are earned and
vested at the rate of 20% per year and become issuable 10 years after date of
award. During 1995, 1,800 performance shares (19,800 shares in 1994 and 2,950
in 1993) were awarded, and at December 31, 1995, there were 93,800 performance
shares awarded but unissued. Incentive stock options for 49,000 shares were
granted during 1995 at an average exercise price of $9.95 per share (87,000
shares in 1994 at $14.38 per share). Options were outstanding at December 31,
1995 for 126,000 shares at exercise prices ranging from $9.25 to $14.50. All 
options expire 10 years after the date of grant. There are 356,000 shares 
reserved for future use under the plan.

     A stock option plan for non-employee directors was adopted during 1995.
There are 50,000 shares reserved for future use under the plan.

     The assumed issuance of these performance-based incentive share awards
and the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options would have an
insignificant effect on earnings per share.

     Holders of common shares received a distribution of one right for each
common share held on February 15, 1990. The rights become exercisable ten days
after a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer that
could result in the acquisition of 25 percent of the Company's common shares 
(except pursuant to an offer for all shares determined by the non-officer 
Directors to be fair and in the best interest of the Company and its 
shareowners). The rights also become exercisable 10 days after an acquisition 
of 10 percent or more by a person or group deemed by the Board of Directors to 
have interests adverse to those of the Company and its shareholders. 
Each right would, subject to certain adjustments and alternatives, entitle 
the rightholder to purchase common shares of the Company having a market 
value of $180 at a price equal to 50 percent of the fair market value of the 
shares. The rights are nonvoting, may generally be redeemed by the Company 
at a price of 1 cent per right and expire on February 15, 2000. The 
Company has reserved 6.6 million shares for this stock rights plan.

NOTE C - DEBT AND LEASE TRANSACTIONS

     Under line of credit arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings
with several banks, the Company has available up to $50 million. The interest
rate pricing of the lines of credit is based upon a formula not to exceed the
"prime rate" or an agreed-upon basis point spread over the "Term Fed Funds
Rate" or bank's certificate of deposit rate. There are no commitment fees;
however, a compensating balance is required for a portion of the total credit
lines. These arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. At December 31,
1995 and 1994, there were no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements.
Long-term debt consisted of the following obligations:

     Properties at December 31, 1995, with a net carrying value of
approximately $4,007,000, are pledged as collateral for the revenue bonds. Net
properties also include approximately $734,000, relative to capital lease
obligations. The capital leases generally transfer ownership of property to
the Company at the end of the lease term.

     Maturities of long-term debt for each of the four years following 1996
approximate $6,790,000 in 1997; $2,740,000 in 1998; $3,680,000 in 1999; and
$4,310,000 in 2000. The Company made interest payments of $2,925,000 in 1995,
$3,060,000 in 1994 and $3,429,000 in 1993.

     The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. The
lease expense for such facilities totaled approximately $650,000 in 1995,
$651,000 in 1994 and $544,000 in 1993. Future minimum lease payments for each
of the next five years approximate $680,000 and aggregate $5,700,000
thereafter.

NOTE D - INCOME TAXES

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets as
of December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994 are as follows:

     The Company made income tax payments of $4,407,000 in 1995, $7,434,000 in
1994, and $5,435,000 in 1993. Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed
its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the
liability method required by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." As permitted under the new rules, prior years' financial statements
were not restated. The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of
Jan. 1, 1993 was to increase net income by $516,000.


NOTE E - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of cash investments and trade accounts receivable. 

     The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents including bank money
market funds and short-term tax exempt securities. Bank money market funds are
on deposit with financial institutions located primarily in Michigan and
Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one institution. The
Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those
financial institutions that are considered in the Company's investment
strategy.

     Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable
are limited because of the large number of entities comprising the Company's
customer base. As of Dec. 31, 1995, the Company's receivables are primarily 
from customers in the residential construction industry.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their
fair value.

LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT. The fair values of the Company's long-term debt are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

     The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial
instruments at Dec. 31 are as follows:

WE WON'T BE UNDERSOLD GUARANTEE

of the date you purchased the item, we will honor the lower price and gladly
refund the difference to you.

our supply, we will give you a 5-percent discount and deliver the item free to
your home or substitute a comparable item at the sale price.
