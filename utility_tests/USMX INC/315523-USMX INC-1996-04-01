PART I



Items 1 and 2.     Business and Properties.

Introduction.
     
     USMX, INC. (the "Company" or "USMX") is a Delaware
corporation which engages in the exploration for, and
development and operation of precious metal properties.  The
Company also evaluates base metal and non-metallic
opportunities.  The Company conducts its operations directly
and through various operating subsidiaries.  All references
in this Report to the Company or USMX include all
subsidiaries of USMX, INC., unless the context otherwise
requires.
     
     All of the Company's 1995 production (6,266 ounces of
gold) was from the Company's Goldstrike Mine near St.
George, Utah.  Mining was completed at the Goldstrike Mine
in October 1994.  The Company expects minimal future
production from the Goldstrike Mine.  In addition to
revenues from its operations at the Goldstrike Mine in 1995,
the Company also received the minimum annual advance royalty
of $720,000 in connection with operations of the Montana
Tunnels Mine.
     
     The Company's principal focus in 1995 was on further
exploration and preliminary development of its Illinois
Creek and Thunder Mountain properties.  In February 1996,
the Company completed its feasibility study of the Illinois
Creek property and received a commitment for project
financing.  The Company is currently proceeding with
development of this property.  It is the Company's goal to
commence mining at Illinois Creek in the fall of 1996.  See
below in these Items and Item 7 for additional discussion
regarding the Company's plans and the associated risks.
     
     The Company views exploration as an important means of
growth, and it typically actively explores several projects
annually.  In 1995, the Company's exploration efforts in the
United States were concentrated on expanding the
mineralization at Illinois Creek and Thunder Mountain.  In
addition, the Company continued its exploration efforts
outside of the United States, principally in Mexico.
     
<PAGE>
     
          The following map depicts the location of the Company's
operating property, royalty interest, principal exploration
and development properties, and offices.

The original document contains a map of the western United States
and Alaska depicting the above items.

Summary of Drill-Defined Mineralization
     
     Set forth below are the Company's estimates of the
amounts and grades of drill-defined mineralization that can
be economically recovered from the Company's principal
development projects.  These figures are based on extensive
drilling and sampling on the Company's properties and are
based on assumptions believed by the Company to be
reasonable regarding production costs, metallurgical
recoveries and mineral prices.  Although the Company
believes that it has carefully prepared these estimates,
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in this process,
including many factors beyond the control of the Company.
The accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the
quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment.  It can be expected that, as
the Company conducts additional evaluation, drilling and
testing with respect to its properties, these estimates will
be adjusted and plans for mining could be revised.
     
     Based on its analysis of the mineral deposits detailed
in the table below, it is the Company's present
determination that these properties can be mined on an
economic basis by the Company and that these estimates
constitute reserves as that term is typically used in the
mining industry.  Although permitting required to initiate
mining operations in the United States has become extremely
complex and cannot be considered a certainty, the Company
projects that, in the normal course of property development,
it should be able to obtain the necessary permits to
commence mining operations on these properties.  However,
there are strict requirements that must be satisfied in
order for the Company to be permitted to commence production
on its development properties and, therefore, no assurances
can be given in this regard.

<PAGE>
     
     In its Securities Act Industry Guide 7, the U. S.
Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term,
"reserve", as , "that part of a mineral deposit which could
be economically and legally extracted or produced at the
time of the reserve determination."  Insofar as the
necessary permits have not been obtained on the Company's
development properties, the estimates for those properties
set forth in the table below have not been classified as
"reserves".  All references to estimates of drill-defined
mineralization in this Report must be qualified with the
caveat that all legal requirements for extraction of
minerals have not yet been satisfied.
     
     The following table reflects drill-defined gold
mineralization at each of the Company's properties at
December 31, 1995.

(1)  The above estimates utilize in place grades and do not
  reflect losses that will be incurred in the recovery
  process.  They do include allowance for dilution of ore in
  the mining process.  Recovery rates for each property, to
  the extent they are known or estimated, are provided as part
  of the discussion of each property below.

History of Operations
     
     The Company's first producing mine, the Green Springs
Mine, commenced production in June 1988.  The Company
completed mining, crushing and stacking operations at Green
Springs in June 1990.  Reclamation of pits, haul roads and
waste dumps commenced in 1990 and continued through 1993.
Rinsing of the heaps was initiated during 1992 to meet final
closure requirements.  During 1993, rinsing of the heaps and
reclamation of the heaps and the plant site were completed.
During the life of the Green Springs Mine, the Company
received several environmental and safety awards for this
operation while producing a total of 69,331 ounces of gold.
The Company was particularly gratified to receive the 1992
State of Nevada Governor's Award for Excellence in Mine
Reclamation in connection with several of the Company's
Nevada mines (described below), including the Green Springs
Mine.  The award, made jointly by the State of Nevada, U.S.
Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service was given
to the Company in recognition of outstanding achievement in
innovative design, superior mine planning and commitment to
reclamation from project commencement to closure.
     
     The Company commenced open pit mining at its Casino
Mine in Nevada in June 1990 and completed mining in May
1991.  In July 1991, the Company commenced mining at the
Winrock Mine in Nevada.  Mining and crushing were completed
at the Winrock Mine in June 1992.  The Casino and Winrock
Mines shared a common heap leaching facility.  The Company
produced a total of 48,953 ounces of gold from the
Casino/Winrock project prior to its sale on August 27, 1993.
     
     In May 1990, the Company completed the purchase of the
Alligator Ridge Mine in Nevada, which included partially
leached gold ore on heaps, gold recovery facilities, a
mining fleet, a mill, and approximately 26,000 acres of
mineral interests in the Alligator Ridge trend.  During its
tenure at the Alligator Ridge Mine, the Company produced
50,188 ounces of gold.  Construction of the crushing and
gold recovery facilities at a satellite facility, designated
the Yankee Mine, was completed during the first quarter of
1992.  The Company produced 26,220 ounces of gold at the
Yankee Mine between the time of initial gold production in
June 1992 and its sale on August 27, 1993.  The Company's
Casino, Winrock, Alligator Ridge and Yankee Mines, together
with surrounding exploration prospects, were sold in two
separate transactions in 1993 for a total of $20 million
cash, plus the assumption by the buyer of all related
obligations, including reclamation liabilities.

<PAGE>
     
     Effective November 1, 1992, the Company acquired from
Tenneco Corporation (Tenneco), the stock of Tenneco Minerals
Company-Utah (TMC-Utah), owner and operator of the
Goldstrike Mine located approximately 35 miles northwest of
St. George, Utah.  Soon after the acquisition, the name of
this wholly owned subsidiary was changed to USMX of Utah,
Inc.  Gold production from the Goldstrike Mine since
November 1, 1992, has been 77,182 ounces, including 6,266
ounces of gold produced in 1995.  During 1995, the Company
was recognized for its reclamation efforts at the Goldstrike
Mine when it received the 1995 Earth Day Award from the
State of Utah Board and Division of Oil, Gas and Mining.
     
     The Goldstrike property presently consists of
approximately 2,600 acres of unpatented mining claims.
Access to the Goldstrike Mine is by State Highway 212 to a
point approximately 21 miles northwest of St. George, then
by well-maintained gravel road over a distance of
approximately 14 miles.  Mining operations at the Goldstrike
Mine were completed in October 1994.  Leaching was completed
in December 1995.  All disturbed areas at the Goldstrike
Mine were reclaimed during 1995 except for the heaps and the
plant site.  Reclamation of one of the two heaps was begun
near the end of 1995.  Rinsing of the second heap commenced
in January 1996 and is expected to continue into 1997.  Once
rinsing of the second heap is complete, the heap will be
recontoured, covered with topsoil and seeded with various
native plant species.  In addition, the process plant will
be dismantled and the plant site reclaimed.  Management
believes that adequate provision has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the cost
of completing the reclamation of the Goldstrike Mine.
     
     The Company's investment in the Goldstrike Mine as of
December 31, 1995, was approximately $891,000, including
$91,000 in undepreciated property, plant and equipment and a
$800,000 certificate of deposit provided to the State of
Utah as reclamation surety.
     
     The following table sets forth gold production at each

The Illinois Creek Project
  
  Introduction
     
     The Illinois Creek Project is a moderate grade, near
surface gold-silver deposit.  It consists of two State of
Alaska Mining Leases, totaling 62,480 acres.  The underlying
leaseholder is North Pacific Mining Corporation ("NPMC"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc. ("CIRI"),
an Alaska Native Regional Corporation.  The Illinois Creek
Project is located in the western interior of Alaska.  It
lies approximately 57 miles southwest of Galena and 320
miles northwest of Anchorage.
     
     The exploration and development phases have been
completed with the exception of permitting.  All major
permit applications have been submitted and have been
reviewed by the State of Alaska.  A 30-day public review
process is currently underway.  A final decision on all
permits is expected in April 1996.  No major federal permits
will be required.  Assuming the grant of the necessary
permits, the Company intends to commence site development
and construction in late April 1996.  Field construction is
anticipated to take approximately four months to complete.
  
  History
     
     The Illinois Creek Project is part of a large
polymetallic hydrothermal district covering 400 square miles
in the southern Kaiyuh Mountains.  The area was first
explored by Anaconda Minerals as part of a joint venture
with CIRI in 1980.  Subsequent to Anaconda Minerals'
activities, the area was explored by Goldmor Group, Ltd.,
NPMC, and Echo Bay in association with CIRI.  The Company
commenced its exploration activities in August 1994.  The
Company has drilled 61 core holes and 89 reverse circulation
holes, totaling approximately 31,000 feet.  This drilling
succeeded in increasing the drill-defined mineralization to
about 412,000 contained equivalent ounces of gold and
provided geotechnical information necessary for pit design
and engineering.
     
     The Company made initial payments to NPMC totaling
$100,000 in 1994 to evaluate the Illinois Creek property.
Pursuant to the Company's Agreement with NPMC, the Company
is required to make a $1 million, non-refundable payment to
NPMC in cash or USMX stock.  The Company has elected to make
the payment in stock, which the Company has calculated will
amount to 449,754 shares.  The Company will issue these
shares upon effectiveness of a registration statement
covering the resale of these shares.  The Company expects to
file this registration statement in April 1996.  In
addition, if the Company obtains the necessary permits and
there has been no material adverse change in the economics
of the project, the Company will be required to make an
additional payment to NPMC of $3 million in cash or USMX
stock in exchange for title to the underlying leases.  If
the Company elects to pay all or part of this amount in
stock, it will also be required to provide for the
registration of the resale of the shares issued to NPMC.
The number of shares of USMX common stock to be issued to
NPMC will be based on a 30-day average of the price of the
USMX stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market.  NPMC also has chosen
to receive a 5% net returns royalty on production from the
Project.
     
<PAGE>     
     
     If the Company delineates the existence of additional
ore reserves on the lease known as the Illinois Creek Upland
Mining Lease, which increases the total proven ore reserves
to at least one million ounces of equivalent gold ore
reserves beyond the mineralization stated in the Company's
February 1996 feasibility report, then NPMC will have the
right to elect to participate in subsequent mining
operations with respect to those additional reserves for a
25% working interest by reimbursing the Company 120% of
NPMC's 25% share of exploration, development and capital
costs incurred by the Company subsequent to February 1996
which are directly related to the delineation and/or
production of the additional reserves.
     
     Pursuant to the Company's Agreement with NPMC, the
Company has until December 16, 1997, to achieve Commercial
Production (as defined) from the property.  This period may
be extended at the option of the Company for two additional
one year periods upon payment by the Company of a $300,000
advance royalty, adjusted for inflation, for each one year
extension.  The Agreement terminates on December 16, 1999,
if the Company has not achieved Commercial Production from
the property by that date.
  
  Location, Access, Terrain and Climate
     
     The Illinois Creek Project site is located in the
southern Kaiyuh Mountains in the western interior of Alaska.
The project is located approximately 57 miles southwest of
Galena and 23 miles east of the Yukon River.  It is
equidistant from Fairbanks and Anchorage which lie
approximately 320 miles to the east and southwest of the
Project, respectively.
     
     Access to the site is by air.  Equipment and supplies
will be transported to the site by land, sea and air.
Equipment and supplies will be transported from Seattle,
Washington to Anchorage, Alaska by barge.  From Anchorage,
it will travel by truck or rail to Nenana.  From Nenana, it
will be moved down river on barge to Galena.  From Galena,
it will be lifted by air to the site.  The site will be
connected to the personnel camp and airport by a 6.5 mile
road which has been partially constructed.

     A C-133 aircraft will be required to transport the large,
oversized mining equipment.  The C-133 is a retired military
plane which has not been certified for commercial use by the
FAA.  The Company has been assisted by the Alaska Industrial
Development and Export Authority ("AIDEA"), a political
subdivision of the State of Alaska, in obtaining a waiver
from the FAA for use of the C-133.  The Company has entered
into a Cost Reimbursement Agreement with AIDEA pursuant to
which AIDEA will undertake a feasibility analysis and
negotiate with the Company a proposed use and
indemnification agreement with respect to the lease of
aircraft equipment.  Finalization of these arrangements in
the near future is essential to the Company's construction
plans for the summer of 1996.  In addition, there is only
one such airworthy aircraft currently available for use by
the Company.  There is also one additional C-133 available
to supply spare parts, if needed.  If the Company is unable
to transport all of the components it currently plans to
transport using the C-133 aircraft, substantial delays and
additional costs could be incurred as the components would
have to be cut into smaller pieces, transported to the site
using smaller aircraft and reassembled at the site.
     
     The local area consists of moderate hills (elevations
ranging from 200 to 1,000 feet), the flood plains of the
Little Mud and Innoko Rivers, Illinois Creek, local warm
springs and California Creek south of the site, and the
wetlands to the west of the Project site along the Yukon
River.  These wetlands are not expected to be affected by
the Project facilities.
     
     The climate is sub-arctic and characterized by large,
seasonal extremes in temperature and daylight.  Average
winter temperatures are -7 F to 20 F; mean summer
temperatures range from 35 F to 67 F.  Regional extremes
are -63 F to 93 F.  Precipitation averages 15 to 18 inches
annually, including 81 inches of snow.  Snow depth at the
site ranges from 24 to 36 inches during a typical winter.
Historically, September is the heaviest rainfall month with
an average of 8.3 inches.
     
<PAGE>     
     
     Freeze-up on the Yukon River normally occurs in late
October to early November; breakup normally occurs in early
to mid May.  Accordingly, the shipping schedule on the Yukon
River will typically be limited to a period between
approximately May 25 and September 25.
  
   Drill-defined Mineralization
     
     In February 1996, the Company completed a comprehensive
feasibility study pertaining to the Illinois Creek deposit.
Based on this study, the Company believes that the deposit
contains 5.54 million tons of mineable drill-defined
mineralization at a gold grade of 0.069 ounces of gold per
ton and 1.467 ounces of silver per ton, yielding a gold
equivalent grade of 0.074 ounces of gold per ton.  The
calculation was based on a gold price of $400 per ounce and
a 0.025 ounce gold equivalent per operating ton cut off
grade.  The average stripping ratio over the planned life of
the project is 2.79:1.  An additional 479,000 tons of low
grade material exists within the limits of the ultimate pit
design.  This material has an average equivalent grade of
0.024 ounces per ton.  This indicates the presence of an
additional 11,369 equivalent ounces of gold that will be
leachable under present economic parameters.
  
  Metallurgy
     
     Metallurgical recovery from the run-of-mine ore is
projected to be approximately 85% of contained gold and 25%
of contained silver.  Year round leaching will be conducted
if it proves to be economic.  Gold production for 1996
should be approximately 20,000 ounces, assuming timely
receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals and
assuming a startup date of September 1.  See Item 7.
  
  Geology
     
     The deposit occurs as a large gossan zone striking east-
northeast and dipping 40 to 70 degrees to the southeast, hosted
within a thick sequence of quartzites which are carbonate
rich.  The gossan has been intersected by drilling over
strike length of 12,000 feet and to a depth of greater than
1,500 feet.  Oxidation of the mineralization is complete to
a depth of at least 1,100 feet below the present surface.
Economic gold-silver mineralization is  present in portions
of the gossan, and is associated with elevated levels of
copper and/or lead, hydrothermal or remobilized silica,
earthy hematite, and poorly defined structural features.
Supergene enrichment of both gold and silver in near surface
locations is also apparent.
  
  Plan of Operations
     
     The Company has retained Lyntek, Inc. to provide
detailed engineering, procurement and construction
management services.  D. H. Blattner and Sons, Inc. has been
selected to complete all construction earthworks,  and to
serve as the mining contractor.
     
     Previous activities by other mining companies have
resulted in some infrastructure on the property including a
25 person camp, a 4,500 foot air strip suitable for DC-6 and
C-133 aircraft, a vehicle maintenance/sample preparation
building, and miscellaneous other buildings and pieces of
equipment.  The existing airstrip is 6.5 miles by road from
the mine site and will be utilized by the Company for
transportation purposes.  The vehicle maintenance/sample
preparation building is usable in its present condition.
Also, the existing personnel camp will be used by the
Company's exploration staff.
     
     The Company plans to construct a 90-person camp north
of the airstrip.  A well will provide potable water for the
camp.  Water for process mining will come from a source
located near the mid-point of the main access road from the
airfield to the mine site.  Electrical power will be
generated using diesel powered generator sets.  Waste heat
from the generators will be used to heat the process
building.  In addition to the process building, also to be
constructed are a modular assay laboratory, a truck
maintenance shop and a modular administration building.
Communications will be by satellite.
 
<PAGE>
      
     The deposit will be developed as a conventional open-
pit mine.  It will be operated on a seasonal basis.  Mining
will be conducted during the warmest six months of the year,
normally May through October.  Trucks and front-end loaders
will be used to mine, haul and stack the ore in a valley
fill lined impoundment.  Heap leaching followed by carbon
adsorption/desorption/electrowinning will be used to extract
the gold.  The process system is designed to recover the
annual scheduled amount of gold production in eight months.
Due to excessive costs of transporting burnt lime to the
site, lime will be produced on-site utilizing a local source
of dolomitic limestone.  The Company has contracted for the
refurbishing and transport to the site of a diesel-fired
rotary kiln.
     
     The mine operating schedule will be ten hours per
shift, two shifts per day, six days per week.  Three crews
will rotate on a four-week on, two-week off schedule.  The
Company currently expects to employ approximately 54 people
at Illinois Creek, with a like number of personnel to be
employed by the mine contractor.
     
     Total pre-production capital costs, including
approximately $4.7 million in working capital, are currently
estimated at about $26.6 million, exclusive of property
acquisition costs of $4 million to be paid to NPMC as
outlined above.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company's
investment in Illinois Creek was approximately $4 million.
See Item 7.

The Thunder Mountain Project

  Introduction
     
     The Company proposes to conduct gold and silver mining
activities at the Dewey Mine in the Thunder Mountain Mining
District in eastern Valley County, Idaho, approximately 100
miles northeast of Boise, Idaho.  The proposed Dewey mining
operations are part of the Thunder Mountain Project and
consist of the development of a gold and silver ore deposit
located on patented mining claims administered by the Idaho
Department of Lands.  The Company proposes to initiate
construction of the Dewey Mine facilities in the summer of
1997.  In January 1996, the Company submitted a Notice of
Intent to Operate ("NOI") with the Idaho Department of
Lands, which is currently being reviewed.  A feasibility
study will be ongoing throughout 1996 to refine the project
design and economics.

  History
     
     Gold was discovered in the Thunder Mountain area in
1894 at the site of what is now known as the Dewey Mine.
During the period from the initial discovery until 1942,
various operators reportedly produced approximately 31,000
ounces of gold and 16,000 ounces of silver from both
underground and surface placer workings.  Renewed interest
in the district began in earnest during the early 1970s due
to rising gold prices.  After exploration by several major
mining companies, a portion of the property, the Sunnyside
Mine area, was placed into production by Coeur d'Alene Mines
Corporation ("Coeur d'Alene") as an open pit, heap leach
operation in 1986.  Between 1986 and 1990,  Coeur d'Alene
reportedly produced 120,000 ounces of gold and 240,000
ounces of silver from the combined Sunnyside, Goldbug and
Lightning Peak pits.  After reclaiming the property, Coeur
d'Alene terminated its leases with Thunder Mountain Gold,
Inc. in December 1990.  At the adjacent Dewey Mine, the
Dewey Mining Company constructed a 450 ton per day mill and
the property was operated as an open pit mine (Golden Reef
Joint Venture) during 1981.  In the mid 1980s, the Dewey
Mine became the subject of litigation which was resolved in
favor of the Dewey Mining Company late in 1991.
     
     Effective July 9, 1993, the Company entered into an
Exploration and Option to Purchase Agreement ("Agreement")
with Dewey Mining Company, Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. and
two individuals (the foregoing companies and individuals
described below collectively as "Owners").  The Owners
control approximately 5,500 acres in the Thunder Mountain
Mining District consisting of both patented and unpatented
mining claims.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the
Company was granted the sole and exclusive right to explore
for and develop minerals on the property in exchange for
advance royalty payments totaling $100,000.  In addition,
the Company committed to spend, and did spend, a minimum of
$500,000 evaluating the property prior to April 1, 1995.
     
<PAGE>
     
     The Agreement requires that, before the Company can put
the property into commercial production, it must prepare and
deliver to the Owners a feasibility study regarding the
project.  In 1995, the Company extended the term of the
agreement through April 30, 1996, by making an additional
advance royalty payment in the amount of $150,000.  The
Company has the option to further extend the Agreement
through April 30, 1997, by paying an additional advance
royalty payment of $200,000.  The Company intends to so
extend the Agreement.  The Agreement further provides the
Company with the option for a final extension until April
30, 1998, in exchange for an additional advance royalty
payment of $250,000.  The advance royalty payments may
be recovered by the Company for seven years after payment
should the Owners elect to receive royalties under options
(a) or (c) below.  The Agreement terminates if the Company
fails to deliver a feasibility study to the Owners by the
end of the last year's extension under the Agreement or if
the Company exercises its right to terminate the Agreement
at any time.
     
     Within 90 days after the Company provides the Owners
with a feasibility study, the Owners may elect to (a)
participate in subsequent efforts to the extent of a 30%
working interest, plus receive a 1.5% royalty, or (b)
receive a 30% net profits interest, or (c) receive a 5% net
returns royalty from production.  If the Owners elect to
receive a 5% net returns royalty, the Company will be
obligated to make advance royalty payments of $200,000
within thirty days after commencement of Commercial
Production (as defined in the Agreement), and $250,000 each
year thereafter.  If the Owners fail to notify the Company
of their election prior to the end of the 90 day election
period they will be deemed to have made an election to
receive a 5% net returns royalty.
     
     The Agreement provides that, once the Owners have made
their election, the Company shall have one year within which
to achieve Commercial Production.  If the Company fails to
achieve Commercial Production within one year, the Company
must either reconvey the property to the Owners or extend by
one year the time period within which Commercial Production
must commence by paying an advance royalty of $200,000 to
the Owners.  If Commercial Production has not begun by the
end of the extension period, the Company may obtain one
final extension of one year within which to achieve
Commercial Production by paying the Owners an additional
advance royalty of $250,000.
     
     In addition to the advance royalty payments and the
work commitments outlined above, the Company is obligated to
pay all fees necessary to maintain the unpatented mining
claims through August 31 of the calendar year in which the
extension year expires.
     
     The area of the Company's primary activity lies
approximately 4,000 feet west of the Sunnyside deposit
previously mined by Coeur d'Alene. The results of the
Company's drilling during 1993 were favorable, including a
number of intersections that exceed 100 feet in thickness
and average in excess of 0.10 ounces of gold per ton.  The
Company was also successful in extending the deposit along
strike into an area that was not previously drilled.  During
1994, the Company drilled a total of 104 exploration and
development holes on the property, helping to define the
margins and high grade core of the Dewey deposit.  As of
December 31, 1995, the Company has expended a total of $2.3
million on the property.
  
  Location, Access, Terrain and Climate
     
     The Dewey Mine lies within the Thunder Mountain
District in eastern Valley County, Idaho.  Access to the
District is obtained via U.S. Highway 95 to Cascade, Idaho,
then east 42 miles to Landmark, Idaho on Forest Highway 22,
then north and east approximately 57 miles on U.S. Forest
Service roads to the property.  The Thunder Mountain Mining
District is currently accessible by vehicle about seven
months out of the year from late May to late November.
     
     Local elevations range from approximately 7,300 to
9,000 feet.  The District forms a 5,980-acre enclave of
patented and unpatented land within the Frank Church
Wilderness Area administered by the Krassel District of the
Payette National Forest.
     
     Due to the location of the property, and based on the
experience of operations previously conducted at the Dewey
Mine and at nearby existing operations, future mining
operations of the Company would be seasonal, but processing
may be conducted year around.

<PAGE>

  Drill-defined Mineralization
     
     The Company's internal engineering staff updated the
mine model in 1995.  This work indicated the presence of
preliminary floating cone mineable open pit drill-defined
mineralization of 5,290,000 tons with an average grade of
0.047 ounces of gold per ton containing approximately
248,630 ounces of gold.  The calculation was based  on a
gold price of $400 per ounce and a 0.031 gold ounce per ton
operating cutoff grade.  The estimated stripping ratio of
waste to ore for this mineralization is approximately
1.02:1.  Further, metallurgical test work completed in 1995
indicated the material is amenable to heap leaching, and an
85% gold recovery factor was used in the mine model.
     
     Additional potential is known to exist within the
Thunder Mountain property.  The presence of other drill-
indicated gold mineralization has been identified by the
earlier exploration programs conducted by the Company as
well as other mining companies.  During 1996, limited
exploration is planned at Thunder Mountain in conjunction
with the ongoing geotechnical and environmental work needed
to generate data for mine design and permitting.  Geological
mapping and geochemical surveys will be completed on several
outlying targets to be tested in the future after issuance
of permits.
 
  Plan of Operations
     
     The Dewey Mine deposit is a bulk tonnage, heap-
leachable ore body and is located on several patented lode
mining claims in the central portion of the Thunder Mountain
Mining District.  The Company is currently conducting a
feasibility study to determine the optimum design by which
to profitably exploit this deposit.  It is presently
anticipated that conventional open pit/heap leach techniques
will be used.  The fluid management system will be designed
as a zero discharge system.  Due to the remote location of
the deposit, the Company will be required to generate its
own electrical power.
     
     The Company plans to use a contract miner to develop
and operate the open pit mine.  The preliminary production
schedule is for a six to eight month per year mining system,
two shifts per day, seven days per week.  The number of mine
operating days is estimated at 210 to 240, depending on
weather.  Processing would occur at least 250 days per year,
and perhaps would run throughout the year.  The Company
would expect to employ approximately 75 to 100 people at the
Dewey Mine.
  
  Geology
     
     The Thunder Mountain Mining District is localized in
the central portion of a caldera complex underlain by
Challis Volcanics as well as graben-fill, pyroclastic-
derived sediments.  The Dewey Dome ore deposit is hosted by
the pyroclastic sediments, and the Sunnyside, Goldbug and
Lightning Peak deposits mined by Coeur d'Alene were hosted
by the volcanics.  Known concentrations of economic gold
mineralization are controlled by a combination of structure
and stratigraphy.
  
  Permitting
     
     During 1995, limited geotechnical and baseline
environmental work was conducted while the Company was re-
evaluating the project based on heap leaching of the ore for
recovering gold.  On January 31, 1996, based on favorable
preliminary findings, the Company submitted a Notice of
Intent to Operate ("NOI") with the Idaho Department of Lands
and Payette National Forest.  A feasibility study will be
ongoing throughout 1996 to refine the project design and
economics.  Since permitting has only recently commenced, it
is difficult to predict when necessary permits might be
received.  However, it seems reasonable to expect that
permit approvals are attainable in 1997, which may allow for
development of the project that same year.

Montana Tunnels
     
     The Montana Tunnels property is located in the Colorado
Mining District, Jefferson County, Montana, 22 miles south
of Helena.  Montana Tunnels consists of approximately 9,300
acres of patented ground plus about 1,000 acres of other
mineral rights.  This property was developed and is operated
by Pegasus Gold Inc. ("Pegasus") pursuant to an agreement
with the Company.  Mine and mill construction commenced in
March 1986, milling operations began in March 1987, and full
operating status was achieved by Pegasus in October 1987.
     
     The Montana Tunnels Mine involves open pit mining
operations and conventional milling technology.  The Montana
Tunnels ore is processed through a circuit which
incorporates crushing, grinding, and selective flotation to
produce lead and zinc concentrates, and a gravity circuit
for recovery of free gold.  The majority of gold and silver
value is associated with the base metal concentrates.
     
     Pegasus has supplied to the Company the operating
statistics for Montana Tunnels set forth in the following
table:
 
                        Year Ended December 31,
                       ________________________
                          1995        1994

Tons of zinc              21,611      19,814
Ounces of gold            89,231      80,179
Ounces of silver       1,073,173   1,085,257

     As of December 31, 1995, Pegasus estimates that the
Montana Tunnels Mine has proven and probable ore reserves of
approximately 24,000,000 tons.
     
     The Company owns a net profits royalty interest in the
Montana Tunnels Mine.  The Company is entitled to the
greater of a five percent net profits royalty interest or
minimum advance royalties of $60,000 per month until certain
construction, land acquisition and associated financing and
other costs have been recovered by Pegasus ("Payback"), and
a 50 percent net profits royalty interest thereafter.
Payback is defined in the agreement with Pegasus to occur
when 90 percent of net profits equals the sum of $250,000,
plus the project costs incurred subsequent to January 1,
1986, plus interest costs imputed on these costs until
September 30, 1987, the date of full operation status.  Net
profits, as defined, include deduction from revenues of such
costs as direct operating and administration expenses,
allowable new capital expenditures, property payments,
management fees, interest on debt and equity financing,
repayment of gold loans, repayment of certain debt
obligations, and taxes other than income taxes.  Based on
information provided by Pegasus, the Company estimates that,
as of December 31, 1995, the remaining net profit
recoverable costs were $26,539,000.
     
     Depending on metal prices and production rates, Payback
could be achieved which would result in increased revenue to
the Company at some future date.  However, even if Payback
is not achieved, the Company seems reasonably assured of
continued payments of $720,000 per year during the life of
the Montana Tunnels Mine, now estimated by Pegasus to
continue into the year 2000.  During 1995, the Company
received minimum annual royalties of $720,000.

Exploration
     
     Due to continued threat of adverse amendment to or
replacement of the U.S. mining laws as well as to other
existing regulations, the Company continued in 1995 to
direct its exploration activity to the evaluation of private
lands in the United States, and opportunities in Latin
America.  Exploration for minerals, particularly for gold,
is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and
frequently is nonproductive.  There can be no assurance that
the Company's mineral exploration efforts will be
successful.  Once mineralization is discovered, it usually
takes a number of years from the initial phases of
exploration until production is possible, during which time
the economic feasibility of production may change.
Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore
reserves through drilling, to determine metallurgical
processes to extract the metal from the ore and, in the case
of new properties, to construct mining and processing
facilities.  As a result of these uncertainties, no
assurance can be given that the Company's exploration
programs will result in the expansion or replacement of
existing reserves.

  Cala Abajo, Puerto Rico
     
     During 1992, 1993, and 1994, the Company acquired an
equity interest currently totaling approximately 80% of the
outstanding common stock of Southern Gold Resources (USA),
Inc., a Colorado corporation.  On October 5, 1992, Southern
Gold was granted an exclusive exploration permit by the
Puerto Rican government covering 2,170 acres that include
the Cala Abajo copper/gold deposit in west-central Puerto
Rico. The prospecting permit may be extended year to year
for a maximum 10 year period and gives the Company the
exclusive right to conduct exploration and environmental
studies and to negotiate a mining lease covering the permit
area.  Through June 1995, the Company incurred approximately
$1.0 million in drilling, metallurgical test work,
engineering and base line environmental studies and had
determined the existence of mineable drill-defined
mineralization of 52,649,000 tons of ore averaging 0.799%
copper and 0.013 ounces of gold per ton, resulting in an
equivalent copper grade of 1.134% copper.  The estimate
contains approximately 847,000,000 pounds of copper and
685,000 ounces of gold.  The overall stripping ratio is
approximately 1.13:1, including waste to be removed before
mining could begin.
     
     In 1995, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico amended its
mining law to prohibit open pit mining of metal deposits on
the island.  The effect of the mining law, as currently
amended, was to render the Company's plan for development of
the Cala Abajo deposit uneconomic.  Accordingly, the
Company's investment was written off during the year.  The
Company is considering various strategies and responses to
the action by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
  
  Other United States Mineral Properties
     
     The Company has additional mineral properties, located
in Utah, Montana, and Wyoming in the United States.  These
additional properties are currently being explored solely by
the Company.

  Mexico
     
     The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, MXUS
S.A. de C.V. ("MXUS"), is currently investigating a number
of opportunities located primarily in the northern Mexican
states of Sonora, Chihuahua and Coahuila.  The more
significant projects the Company is currently evaluating are
described below.
  
  Amargosa
     
     This property is located approximately 95 kilometers
southeast of Juarez in the state of Chihuahua.  The property
is accessible from Juarez on Highway 2, southeast for 90
kilometers to El Porvenir, then via poorly maintained dirt
roads to the project.  The Company controls by denouncement
approximately 15,100 acres.  The Company must meet certain
minimum work requirements arising from Mexican mining law to

<PAGE>

maintain its rights to the properties.  In addition, if the
properties are placed into production, the Company will be
obligated to pay net smelter return royalties varying from
2.75% to 3.25% on production from most of the properties.
     
     A significant amount of exploration was conducted on
the Amargosa polymetallic massive sulfide targets in 1994.
Results of this drilling at Amargosa were geologically
interesting, but no significant economic widths were
encountered, or continuity between holes demonstrated by the
three holes drilled.
     
     A strong magnetic anomaly was partially defined at the
edge of a ground geophysical survey.  The anomaly, which is
as yet untested, occurs on the down-dropped side of a major
fault which may be the feeder fault for the massive sulfide
mineralization.  This geologic setting is very similar to
that of several other major massive sulfide deposits around
the world, such as the Sullivan Mine in British Columbia.
     
     Although this property continues to hold a great deal
of geologic interest, no economic mineralization has yet
been identified.  Accordingly, management recorded an
impairment loss of $1.0 million in 1995.  As of December 31,
1995, the Company's remaining investment in this property
was approximately $315,000.
  
  Boludo Goldfields
     
     Early in 1994, MXUS acquired by lease and purchase
option approximately 5,400 acres in the Boludo Goldfields
placer district located approximately 121 kilometers
southwest of Nogales in northwest Sonora.  Access to the
property is via paved highway and well maintained dirt road.
During 1994, 328 backhoe pits were dug at Boludo by the
Company to test for placer gold.  In addition, several drill
holes were put down in the hard rock targets.  This drilling
failed to identify significant mineralization; however the
placer sampling identified a resource estimated to contain
about 10.5 million cubic yards with an average grade of
0.011 ounces gold per cubic yard or about 116,000 ounces of
contained gold.  The original land package was trimmed back
to this resource area to reduce holding costs.  In 1995, the
Company entered into an agreement with Resource Trend Pty
Ltd, an Australian mining company, which intends to place it
into production during 1996.  The Company retained a royalty
interest on future production from the property.  The
Company's investment in this project was approximately
$450,000 as of December 31, 1995.
  
  Noche Buena
     
     Noche Buena is a disseminated gold prospect located
approximately 45 kilometers northwest of the city of Caborca
in the state of Sonora.  Access from Caborca is via Highway
2 north for 60 kilometers then west via dirt road for
approximately 10 kilometers.  MXUS controls by denouncement
approximately 18,800 acres at Noche Buena that are subject
only to Mexican mineral property fees and taxes.
     
     The Company has drilled 51 reverse circulation holes on
the property.  Low grade gold mineralization was detected in
nearly every hole over a surface area of approximately 100
acres.   This property was joint ventured to Kennecott
Exploration Company in 1995.  As of December 31, 1995, the
Company's investment in Noche Buena was approximately
$366,000.
  
  Samalayuca
     
     Samalayuca is located approximately 40 kilometers south
of Juarez in the state of Chihuahua, and is accessed via
Highway 45 to the town of Samalayuca then via dirt roads
west a few kilometers to the property.  The Company controls
by lease agreement and denouncement approximately 19,000
acres.  The lease, executed on August 12, 1992, provides for
a twenty year term.  If the exploration work is successful,
the owners will be paid a three percent net smelter return
royalty on base metals and a four percent net smelter return
royalty on precious metals produced and sold from the
property.  The Company makes annual advance royalties of
$25,000 and must meet certain minimum work requirements.
     
<PAGE>

     The property is a sediment hosted, stratabound
copper/silver property with primary chalcocite
mineralization.  In the past (pre 1975), local miners
shipped copper bearing quartzite to the El Paso smelter as
flux.  These miners were paid for the copper content of this
material which ranged from one to three percent.  Mining
ceased when copper prices fell in the mid 1970s.
     
     The Company has conducted short hole air track drilling
as well as limited rotary and core drilling since
acquisition of the property.  Results of this work have been
inconclusive due to structural complexity and associated
oxidation and to depletion of copper values near the
surface.
     
     During 1995, the property was leased to Phelps Dodge.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company had invested a total of
$523,000 in the property.
  
  Sierra Mojada
     
     This property is located approximately 200 kilometers
north of Torreon in the state of Coahuila.  Access is via
improved dirt road north from Torreon or by railroad from
Monclova.  The Company controls by denouncement
approximately 11,800 acres in the district.
     
     Production from the district in the past has been
significant, consisting of copper, zinc, lead and silver.
The district was discovered in 1878 with most of the past
production occurring between 1890 and 1945.  Currently,
oxide zinc is being mined by others in the district and
shipped to a smelter in Monterey, Mexico.
     
     The exploration objective consists of defining new
polymetallic deposits similar to those previously exploited,
as well as evaluating the remaining resource in the current
mines.
     
     The Company entered into an agreement with Kennecott
Exploration Company in 1994 to jointly explore and develop
their extensive concessions in the old Sierra Mojada mining
district.  Kennecott conducted geophysics and drilling on
the properties in 1994 and 1995.  Based on the work
performed, Kennecott elected not to continue with the
project.  The Company plans to review the data generated by
Kennecott, reduce the size of the land package and seek to
interest other mining companies in the property.  The
Company's investment in this project was approximately
$33,000 as of December 31, 1995.
  
  Other Mexican Mineral Properties
     
     The Company has additional mineral properties in Mexico
as follows.

  Ecuador
     
     In 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of Mega Minerals S.A., an Ecuadorian company.
The assets of the company at the time of acquisition
consisted of title to eight exploration concessions
comprising approximately 80,600 acres and the right to
acquire title to four additional exploration concessions
comprising approximately 5,900 acres.  The twelve

<PAGE>

concessions are located in the Nambija-Zamora gold belt of
southern Ecuador.  Initial exploration on these concessions
has yielded encouraging results.  Follow-up geological
mapping and geochemical sampling of stream sediments
anomalous in base and precious metals have identified a two
kilometer by three kilometer zone of skarn type alteration
with associated base metals and gold mineralization.  An
exploration program is being planned to further evaluate the
discovery.  The Company's investment in Ecuador as of
December 31, 1995 totaled $222,000.
  
  Chile
     
     In 1995, USMX acquired its first exploration project in
Chile through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Compania Minera
USMX de Chile.  The Putu property is located approximately
160 miles southwest of Santiago, Chile near the coastal city
of Constitution.  Ten concessions totaling 7,410 acres were
staked by USMX to cover the Putu Gold Mine, as well as
several other small prospects.  A magnetite rich, felsic
volcanic, exhalite horizon was previously mined for gold at
Putu by underground methods.
     
     The Company is currently running a ground magnetic
geophysical program and soil geochemical survey over the
immediate mine area.  Regional exploration has identified
other showings of the mineralized exhalite that upon
weathering have generated placer gold deposits which have
been mined by the local inhabitants.
     
     The Putu project is located in a forested area near sea
level with very limited outcrop exposures, similar to the
Pacific Northwest of the United States.  Following
completion of the survey work to be performed during the
first quarter of 1996, the data will be compiled and
reviewed to identify profitable drilling targets.  The
Company's investment in Chile as of December 31, 1995, was
approximately $18,000.

Competition
     
     The Company has been engaged primarily in the
exploration for, development, and operation of precious
metal properties.  The Company's current objective is to
locate and acquire prospects that can be profitably mined by
open pit or underground methods.  The search for this type
of deposit involves high risk, and development requires
relatively large capital outlays and a high degree of
operational expertise.  The Company must compete for mineral
properties with many companies, including those which are
substantially larger and possess greater financial resources
than the Company.
     
     The availability of mining prospects in the United
States is dependent on the Company's ability to negotiate
leases with property owners or locate claims pursuant to the
general mining laws of the United States  Increased
governmental regulation of the location, exploration and
development of mineral prospects, coupled with the increased
withdrawal of public lands from mineral entry, as well as
potential federal legislation to revise or replace the
general mining laws of the U.S., could limit the
availability of mineral prospects and increase the cost of
those which are available.  Due to the potential for adverse
changes to the general mining laws of the U.S., more onerous
reclamation standards and new mining claim fees, the Company
continues to focus much of its exploration efforts on
private lands in the United States and in Latin America.

Markets
     
     If minerals are discovered under claims or leases in
which the Company owns an interest, the availability of a
ready market may depend on numerous factors not within the
Company's control, including the extent of production by
others, proximity and capacity of mills, and the effect of
state and federal regulations.  To date, the Company has
made precious metal sales from its mines and has not been
dependent on any single customer for its products.
Typically, gold can be readily sold in several markets with
a multitude of buyers.  The Company also uses forward sales
and option contracts in connection with its marketing
program.

<PAGE>

Government Contracts
     
     No portion of the Company's business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or
subcontracts at the election of the Government.

Governmental Regulation
     
     The mining operations of the Company are subject to
inspection and regulation by the Mine Safety and Health
Administration of the Department of Labor ("MSHA") under
provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of
1977.  The Occupation and Safety Health Administration
("OSHA") also has jurisdiction over safety and health
standards not covered by MSHA.
     
     All of the Company's exploration, development and
production activities are subject to regulation under one or
more of the various environmental laws.  These laws address
emissions to the air, discharges to water, management of
wastes, management of hazardous substances, protection of
natural resources, protection of antiquities and reclamation
of lands which are disturbed.  Many of the regulations also
require permits to be obtained for the Company's activities;
these permits normally are subject to public review
processes resulting in public approval of the activity.  It
is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations
could have a significant impact on some portion of the
Company's business, causing those activities to be
economically reevaluated at that time.
     
     During the past three years, the United States Congress
considered a number of proposed amendments to the General
Mining Law of 1872, as amended (the "General Mining Law"),
which governs mining claims and related activities on
federal lands.  In 1992, a holding fee of $100 per claim was
imposed on unpatented mining claims located on federal
lands.  In October 1994, a one-year moratorium on the
processing of new patent applications was approved.  That
moratorium has been extended pending reform of the General
Mining Law.  In addition, a variety of legislation is now
pending before the United States Congress to amend further
the General Mining Law.  The proposed legislation would,
among other things, change the current patenting procedures,
impose royalties, and enact new reclamation, environmental
controls and restoration requirements.   The royalty
proposals range from a 2% royalty on "net profits" from
mining claims to an 8% royalty on modified gross income/net
smelter returns.  The extent of any such changes is not
presently known and the potential impact on the Company as a
result of future congressional action is difficult to
predict.  Although a majority of the Company's existing and
planned operations are on other than federal lands, the
proposed changes to the General Mining Law could adversely
affect the Company's ability to economically develop mineral
resources on federal lands.

  Environmental Regulations
     
     Mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities
associated with pollution of the environment and the
disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral
exploration and production.  Environmental liability may
result from mining activities conducted by others prior to
the Company's ownership of a property.  Insurance for
environmental risks (including potential liability for
pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of
waste products occurring from exploration and production) is
not generally available at a reasonable price to the Company
or other companies within the industry.  To the extent the
Company is subject to environmental liabilities, the payment
of such liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available
to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on
the Company.
     
     In the context of environmental permitting, including
the approval of reclamation plans, the Company must comply
with standards, laws and regulations which may entail
greater or lesser costs and delays depending on the nature
of the activity to be permitted and how stringently the
regulations are implemented by the permitting authority.  It
is possible that the costs and delays associated with
compliance with such laws, regulations and permits could
become such that the Company would not proceed with the
development of a project or the operation or further
development of a mine.  Laws and regulations involving the
protection and remediation of the environment are constantly
changing and are generally becoming more restrictive.  The
Company has made, and expects to make in the future,
significant expenditures to comply with such laws and
regulations.

<PAGE>
     
     Pending bills which affect environmental laws
applicable to mining include versions which may
substantially alter the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water
Act, Endangered Species Act and a bill which will introduce
additional protection of wetlands (Wetlands Protection and
Management Act).  Adverse developments and operating
requirements in these acts could impair the ability of the
Company as well as others to develop mineral resources.
Revisions to current versions of these bills could occur
prior to passage.
     
     The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") continues
the development of a solid waste regulatory program specific
to mining operations under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act ("RCRA").  Of particular concern to the mining
industry is a proposal by the EPA titled "Recommendation for
a Regulatory Program for Mining Waste and Materials Under
Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act"
("Strawman II") which, if implemented, would create a system
of comprehensive federal regulation of the entire mine site.
Many of these requirements would be duplicative of existing
state regulations.  Strawman II as currently proposed would
regulate not only mine and mill wastes but also numerous
production facilities and processes which could limit
internal flexibility in operating a mine.  To implement
Strawman II as proposed, the EPA must seek additional
statutory authority, which is expected to be requested in
connection with Congress' reauthorization of RCRA.
     
     The Company is also subject to regulations under (i)
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") which
regulates and establishes liability for the release of
hazardous substances and (ii) the Endangered Species Act
("ESA") which identifies endangered species of plants and
animals and regulates activities to protect these species
and their habitats.  Revisions to CERCLA and ESA are being
considered by Congress; the impact on the Company of these
revisions is not clear at this time.

Employees
     
     The number of persons employed by the Company at March
8, 1996 was thirty-three.

Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations
     and Export Sales.
     
     The Company had no production from foreign mining
operations and did not make export sales during 1995.
     
     During 1991, the Company incorporated USMX Mining, Inc.
under the British Columbia Company Act in anticipation of a
potential acquisition in the Province of British Columbia
that was not consummated.  USMX Mining, Inc. had no material
assets or obligations as of December 31, 1995.
     
     During 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, MXUS S. A. de C. V.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired the
exploration rights to several properties in Mexico located
in the states of Chihuahua, Sonora, Coahuila and Jalisco.
The Company expended approximately $987,000,000 in Mexico in
1995 on these properties and on general reconnaissance.  As
of December 31, 1995, the Company's investment in Mexican
properties amounted to approximately $2.1 million.
     
     In 1992, the Company caused the incorporation of a
Costa Rican subsidiary, USMX de Costa Rica S. A., to
facilitate potential acquisitions in Costa Rica.  To date,
no material expenditures or obligations have been incurred
by this subsidiary.
     
     In 1994, the Company caused the formation of a Chilean
subsidiary, Compania Minera USMX de Chile Limitada, to
facilitate exploration in Chile.  To date, no material
expenditures or obligations have been incurred by this
subsidiary.

<PAGE>
     
     In 1995, the Company purchased the outstanding capital
stock of Mega Minerals, S.A., an Ecuadorian company.  As of
December 31, 1995, the Company had invested approximately
$222,000 in mining concessions and exploration thereof.

Glossary of Terms
     
     The following terms are described to aid in
understanding this report.

Air Track Drilling
See Drilling.

Anomaly
An anomaly is a geochemical, geophysical or other observed
condition, indicated by differing empirical physical data,
that may indicate the presence of mineralization in
underlying bedrock.

Base Metals
A family of metallic elements, including copper, lead and
zinc.

Caldera Complex
A large, basin-shaped volcanic depression created by
subsidence, representative of a volcanic vent, which is
characterized by a diverse assemblage of volcanic intrusive
and extrusive rocks.

Carbon Adsorption
A process in which soluble complexes of gold and silver
physically adhere without chemical reaction to the molecular
surfaces of activated carbon particles.  The process is used
to collect gold and silver from a leach solution.  The
Company uses activated carbon made from coconut shells.
This carbon contains five to six million square feet of
molecular surface area per pound.

Cash Costs
Include all site costs incurred for mining, crushing, pad
loading, leaching, processing and mine site general and
administrative functions.  Such costs exclude royalties and
mining taxes which costs are triggered not by the production
of gold but by its sale.  Also excluded are depreciation of
equipment, amortization of previously capitalized costs and
accrual of reclamation costs.  Revenues from the sale of by-
products (principally silver) are deducted from cash costs.

Contained Ounces
The estimated number of ounces of precious metals contained
in an orebody which is a gross measurement of ounces in the
ground.  The ounces ultimately recovered from the ore
(recoverable ounces) will be less than contained ounces due
to inherent inefficiencies in recovery methods.

Cutoff Grade
The lowest grade of mineralized material that can be mined
and processed economically.

Denouncement
A process under Mexican mining law by which an exploration
concession may be obtained from the Mexican government.  The
exploration concession is granted for a period of six years.
If a mineable resource is delineated, then an exploitation
concession with a term of fifty years can be obtained.

Dilution
An estimate of the amount of waste or low grade mineralized
rock that is unintentionally mined as part of normal mining
practices in extracting ore.

Dore
Unrefined bullion that is an alloy of gold and silver and
various impurities which will be further refined to almost
pure metals.

Drill-Defined Mineralization
Ore reserves, except that all legal requirements for
extraction of minerals have not yet been satisfied.

Drilling

Air Track Drilling
Small diameter, short hole, percussion drilling using
compressed air.

Core Drilling
Drilling using a hollow diamond-studded bit that cuts out a
rock core. This core is extracted from inside the drill rod
for geological examination and assay.

Infill Drilling
Drilling between existing holes to better define the geology
or to improve the reliability of the ore reserve
calculation.

<PAGE>

Rotary Drilling
Drilling with a bit that breaks the rock into chips.  The
chips are continually flushed from the hole (outside the
drill pipe) and are collected in sequence for geological
examination and assay.

Reverse Circulation Drilling
A type of rotary drilling that uses a double walled drill
pipe.  Compressed air, water or other drilling medium is
forced down the space between the two pipes to the drill
bit, and the drilled chips are flushed back up to the
surface through the center tube of the drill pipe.

Flotation
A milling process for mineral concentration based on the
selective adhesion of minerals to air bubbles in a water and
ground-ore mixture.  Air and specific chemicals are
introduced into the mixture.  The finely ground minerals
float to the surface forming a metal rich concentrate that
is skimmed off the surface.  The resulting concentrates are
shipped to a smelter where the final products are produced.

Graben
A block, generally long compared to its width, that has been
downthrown along faults relative to the rocks on either
side.

Grade
The metal or mineral content of rock, ore or drill samples.
With respect to precious metals, grade is generally
expressed as troy ounces per ton of rock.
Gravity Concentration
A method of recovering precious metals and other heavy
constituents from ore in which the ore may be physically
reduced in size, combined with water and then processed
utilizing gravity to separate the heavier precious metals
from the waste material.

Heap Leaching
A low cost leaching process in which ore is placed in a heap
on an impermeable pad.  The solvent, which in the case of
gold is a weak cyanide solution, is sprinkled over the heap
and is later collected after percolating through the ore and
dissolving the metals, allowing subsequent gold recovery.

Hydrothermal Alteration
Changes in rocks or minerals caused by heated solutions.

Joint Venture
An arrangement whereunder two or more parties agree to
jointly participate in the evaluation of a mineral property.

Leaching
The extraction of a soluble metallic element from ore by
dissolving the metal in a solvent.

Leach Pad
An impermeable foundation or pad used as a base for ore
during heap leaching.  The pad prevents the leach solution
from escaping from the circuit.

Massive Sulfide Mineralization
A sulfide deposit characterized by a concentration of
interconnected sulfides totaling in excess of 30% of the
total rock, as opposed to a disseminated or veinlike
deposit.

Mill
A plant where ore is ground, often to fine powder, and the
minerals and metals are concentrated and extracted by
physical or chemical processes.

Mineable
That portion of a mineral deposit from which it is
economically feasible to extract ore.

Mineral
A naturally occurring, usually inorganic and crystalline
substance with characteristic physical and chemical
properties that are due to its atomic arrangement.

Mineralization
Mineral bearing rock.  Mineralization generally refers to
the presence of gold, silver, or other minerals and metals
which may not qualify as a commercially mineable orebody
without completion of additional evaluation.

<PAGE>

Net Profits Royalty (Net Profits Interest)
A royalty based on the pretax profit (proceeds) remaining
after recapture of certain operating, capital and other
costs.  The type and manner of computation of such capital
and other costs may vary considerably.

Net Smelter Return Royalty (Net Returns Royalty)
A royalty based on the actual sale price received for the
subject metal less the cost of smelting and/or refining the
material at an off-site refinery or smelter along with off-
site transportation costs.

Orebody
A mineral deposit that can be mined at a profit under
existing economic conditions.

Ore Reserves
That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically
and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
determination.

Proven Ore Reserves
Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions
revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes;
grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling and
(b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are
spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well
defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of
reserves are well-established.

Probable Ore Reserves
Reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from
information similar to that used for proven reserves, but
the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are
farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.  The
degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven
reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points
of observation.

Ounce
Troy ounce which is equivalent to 31.103 grams.  A troy
ounce is approximately 9.7% heavier than an avoirdupois
ounce.  Accordingly, there are 14.58 troy ounces in an
avoirdupois pound as opposed to 16 avoirdupois ounces.

Oxide Ore
Mineralized rock in which some of the original minerals have
been oxidized.  Significant for heap leach operations since
oxidation often changes the original minerals to a more
soluble form, and may also permit a more complete permeation
of cyanide solutions throughout the mineralized rock so that
particles of gold in the ore may be more readily dissolved
in the leaching process.

Patented Mining Claim
A mining claim, usually comprising about 20 acres in area,
to which the U.S. Government has conveyed title to the
owner.

Placer Deposit
A surficial mineral deposit formed by mechanical
concentration of mineral particles from weathered debris,
and which contains heavy minerals and metals such as gold.

Polymetallic
A type of deposit that contains a suite of minerals or
metals that may be valuable.  Often copper, lead, zinc,
silver and gold may occur together.

Pyroclastic Rock
A rock consisting of unreworked solid material explosively
or aerially ejected from a volcanic vent.

Recoverable Ounces
Those ounces contained in ore which can be ultimately
produced and shipped from the mine.

Recovery Rate
The percentage of a metal recovered in a mineral separation
process.  Recovery rates vary considerably depending on
physical, metallurgical and economic circumstances.

Refining
A process for removing impurities from metals by introducing
air and fluxes into the molten metal.  The impurities are
removed as gas or slag.

Reserve
See Ore Reserves

Reverse Circulation Drilling
See Drilling.

Run of Mine Ore
Ore that is loaded onto heaps directly from the mine without
having been crushed.

Stratabound
A situation in which mineralization is essentially contained
in or confined to a particular sedimentary or volcanic unit.

Strike
The compass direction that the long axis of a geological
feature takes as it intersects the horizontal.

Stripping Ratio
The tonnage ratio between waste and ore in an open pit mine.

Sulfide
A mineral compound characterized by the linkage of sulfur
with a metal.  Gold mineralization characterized by the
presence of sulfides is often more difficult to leach, and
therefor less economic.

Supergene Enriched Deposit
A deposit in which the mineralization has been concentrated
due to oxidation and movement by groundwater with subsequent
reprecipitation in a reducing environment at or near the
water table.

Unpatented Mining Claim
That portion of public mineral lands which a party has
staked or marked out in accordance with federal and state
mining laws to acquire the exclusive right to explore for
and exploit the minerals which may occur on such lands.

Working Interest
The interest in a mineral property which entitles the owner
of such interest to participate in the exploration,
development, and operation of a mineral property, and to
share in the revenues generated and related costs incurred.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
        Condition and Results of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
     
     Working capital at December 31, 1995, was $5.1 million.
Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $5.2 million.  Cash
and cash equivalents decreased during 1995 by $6.8 million
primarily as a result of investment in property and
equipment of approximately $5.7 million, including deferred
exploration costs of $1.5 million and development costs of
$4.2 million ($3.1 million at Illinois Creek, Alaska, $0.7
million at Thunder Mountain, Idaho, and $0.4 at Cala Abajo,
Puerto Rico), and cash used in operations of $1.3 million.
These were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of
property and equipment of $449,000, principally proceeds
from the sale of the Company's interest in the Kinsley
Mountain project in Nevada.
     
     The Company completed its feasibility study of the
Illinois Creek Project in February 1996.  It is the
Company's goal to commence mining in the summer of 1996.
The Company estimates that the costs necessary to develop
the Illinois Creek Mine and place it into production will be
approximately $26.6 million including approximately $4.7
million in working capital and $4.0 milllion in property
acquisition costs which may be paid by the issuance of USMX
common stock.  The Company intends to use its internal cash
resources and the proceeds of a $22 million facility to
finance the development and construction costs.  The
commitment for this facility is subject to several
conditions, including a satisfactory due diligence report
from an independent engineering firm, receipt of necessary
permit approvals and completion of documentation
satisfactory to the lender.
     
     In order for the Company to commence mining at the
Illinois Creek Mine in the summer of 1996, the facility must
be obtained in the spring of 1996 and the Company must
continue to make substantial development expenditures.  The
Company's working capital is expected to decrease
substantially as the Company expends funds on the Illinois
Creek Project.
     
     The Company is considering the use of internal sources
of capital other than its cash resources, including its
Montana Tunnels net profits interest and its holdings in
Alta Gold Co. common stock.  The Company has also retained a
Canadian investment banking firm as its financial advisor
for the purpose of formulating and implementing a plan to
assist the Company in raising additional funds to partially
fund the Illinois Creek and Thunder Mountain Projects and
for strategic acquisitions.  The Company has no firm
commitment for additional financing.
     
     The Company has filed a Notice of Intent to Operate
with the Idaho Department of Lands describing the Company's
proposed gold and silver mining activities in the Thunder
Mountain Project.  Management estimates that the project
would require substantial capital to place it into
production, including working capital.  If the project is
sufficiently attractive to warrant continued development and
the necessary permits are obtained, construction could begin
in 1996 with the earliest completion date in 1997.
Management believes that the Company will probably need to
obtain additional capital to place Thunder Mountain into
production.
     
     The Company's balance sheet at December 31, 1995,
reflects a total of $1.2 million in accrued reclamation
liabilities associated with its acquisition and operation of
the Goldstrike Mine.  Reclamation activities in 1996 will
focus primarily on recontouring, topsoiling and planting
heap number one and the completion of rinsing and
commencement of recontouring and topsoiling of heap number
two as well as the dismantling of the process plant and
reclamation of the plant site.  The goal is to gain
acceptance of the Company's final closure plan by midyear
and to achieve final closure by mid 1997.  This reclamation
is expected to be financed with internally available cash
balances, cash generated from the sale of gold produced as a
by product of heap rinsing and cash previously provided to
the State of Utah as reclamation surety.

Results of Operations
     
     The Company realized a net loss for the year ended
December 31, 1995, of $6,906,000 compared with net income of
$204,000 for 1994 and $2,602,000 for 1993.  The loss for
1995 includes mineral property abandonments and impairments
of $4,431,000.  The 1994 results include a $497,000 income
tax credit.  This credit is primarily the result of the
difference between the estimated 1993 federal income tax
provision and the actual liability reflected on the income
tax returns which were prepared and filed after the 1993
financial statements had been issued.  The 1993 results
include a gain of approximately $5,000,000 from the sale of
the Company's Alligator Ridge assets in two separate
transactions during the year, additional 1992 federal income
taxes of $396,000 and property abandonments totaling
$938,000.
     
     Fluctuations in the Company's results of operations
from year to year arise primarily from four factors: (1)
changes in the volume of gold sold and the selling price of
gold, (2) changes in the cost of gold sold, (3) the cost of
mineral properties abandoned during any given period, and
(4) asset dispositions.

  Change in Costs Applicable to Sales

  Cost of gold sold
     
     Cost of gold sold was $2,890,000 or approximately $419
per ounce in 1995 compared to $11,203,000 or approximately
$315 per ounce in 1994 and $16,226,000 or approximately $322
per ounce in 1993.  The fluctuation in the cost of gold sold
is a result of the change from period to period in the mix
of production from the Company's mines and the change in the
cost of production throughout the life of each mine as
illustrated in the table below.

</TABLE>
     
     Cash production costs per ounce of gold produced at the
Company's Goldstrike Mine increased to $233 for 1995 from
$229 for 1994 despite the fact that no mining, crushing or
pad loading costs were incurred after October 1994 because a
significant portion of processing costs are fixed and,
therefore, do not decrease as production decreases.  As the
result of a reduction of the estimated remaining recoverable
ounces of gold at the Goldstrike Mine, change in inventories
and deferred production costs increased to $207 per ounce
sold for 1995 from $46 in 1994.
 
  Mining Taxes and Royalties
     
     During 1995, the Company incurred $14,000 in mining
taxes compared to $106,000 in 1994 and $149,000 in 1993.
The decrease in mining taxes in 1995 and 1994 is
attributable to the decrease in ounces sold compared to the
previous year as a result of declining production at the
Goldstrike Mine. Also, the Company incurred $379,000 in
royalty expense for 1995 compared to $665,000 in 1994 and
$882,000 in 1993. The increase in production royalties per
ounce of gold sold is attributable to the monthly minimum
royalty paid at Goldstrike through January of 1996.
 
  Cost of Mineral Properties Abandoned and Provisions for
  Impairments of Investments in Mineral Properties
     
     The Company periodically reviews the carrying values of
its properties.  In 1995, management determined that
properties with an aggregate historical cost of $758,000 no
longer held sufficient promise to justify the cost of
maintenance.  The properties abandoned in 1995 were Tule
Canyon ($65,000), Divide ($63,000) and three other
properties ($202,000) in the United States and La Cienega
($111,000), Jalisco Copper ($164,000) and four other
properties ($153,000) in Mexico.  Property abandonments were
$261,000 and $938,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
properties abandoned in 1994 were the Ancho Canyon, New
Mexico ($221,000) and the South Pass, Wyoming ($40,000)
placer properties, both of which were acquired during the
year.  The properties abandoned in 1993 were the Tombstone,
Arizona project ($509,000), Green Springs ($183,000), Cedar
Mountain ($113,000), Emigrant Springs ($89,000) and three
other properties ($44,000).

<PAGE>
     
     In 1995, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico adopted
legislation which amended the mining law to prohibit future
mining of metallic deposits by open pit methods.  Although
the Company is considering various strategies and responses,
the effect of the mining law, as currently amended, is to
render the Company's plan for development of the Cala Abajo
deposit uneconomic.  As a result, in 1995 the Company
reduced the carrying value of this property to zero and
recorded an impairment loss of $1.0million.
     
     Gold production at the Company's Goldstrike Mine in
Utah declined sharply in August and September of 1995.  This
decline in gold recovery triggered a reevaluation of the
estimated remaining recoverable gold ounces in the heaps.
As a result, the carrying value of Deferred mining and
processing costs was reduced to the fair market value of the
remaining gold bullion and dore at the refinery and the
Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.6 million.
     
     Because exploration efforts to date have not yet
yielded an economic deposit at the Amargosa polymetallic
prospect in Chihuahua, Mexico, management determined in the
fourth quarter of 1995 to reduce the carrying value of this
property by $1.0 million.

  Asset Dispositions
     
     In April 1994, the Company sold its interest in the
Kinsley Mountain Project in Elko County, Nevada to Alta Gold
Co. ("Alta").  In addition to the $20,000 previously
received, the Company received $380,000 in cash and Alta
restricted common stock with a then market value of
$200,000.  In April 1995, the Company received a final cash
payment of $400,000 and additional Alta restricted common
stock with a then market value of $200,000.  The Company
received, and retained at December 31, 1995, a total of
352,711 shares of Alta restricted common stock.  The cash
proceeds and discounted value of the stock received were
recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the
property on the Company's books.  In 1995, the Company
recorded a loss on this transaction of $1,000.
     
     During 1993, the Company sold its mining assets located
at Alligator Ridge in White Pine County, Nevada in two
separate transactions for a total of $20 million cash, plus
the assumption by the buyer of all related obligations,
including reclamation liabilities.  After deducting the net
book value of the assets sold of approximately $15 million,
the Company recorded gains from these sales totaling
approximately $5.0 million during 1993.  The net book value
of the assets sold comprised $8.3 million in deferred
mining, crushing, pad loading and processing costs
associated with ounces of gold in various stages of
production, plus $8.9 million remaining investment in
property, plant and equipment, less recorded reclamation
liabilities of $2.2 million.

  Other Factors
     
     General and administrative expenses were higher in 1995
than 1994 principally due to legal and other professional
fees paid relative to the Cala Abajo project and to salaries
and related expenses of additional corporate staff.  General
and administrative expenses in 1994 were comparable to those
incurred in 1993.
     
     Prospecting costs in 1995 were lower than 1994 as a
result of the concentrated effort by the Company's
exploration staff to complete development drilling at the
Illinois Creek, Alaska property.  Prospecting costs in 1994
were slightly higher than in 1993 due to expanded
investigation of various Latin American properties in 1994.
     
     Higher interest rates in 1995 compensated for
decreasing cash balances during the year.  As a result,
interest income for 1995 was comparable to 1994.  Interest
income was higher in 1994 than 1993 due to higher interest
rates in 1994.
     
     Income tax expense primarily represents current and
deferred federal regular and alternative minimum taxes.  The
entire income tax benefit of $118,000 for 1995 is the result
of an adjustment to federal income taxes receivable related
to 1993 net operating losses carried back to prior years.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for 1995,
1994 and 1993 to the statutory federal income tax rate.

Trends Which May Affect Future Results of Operations
     
     As previously stated, fluctuations in the Company's
results of operations arise primarily from four factors: (1)
changes in the volume and selling price of gold, (2) changes
in the cost of gold sold, (3) the cost of mineral properties
abandoned during any given period and (4) asset
dispositions.  The following is management's view of trends
in these factors.
  
  Change in the Volume of Gold Sold and Selling Price of Gold
  
  Volume
     
     The Company expects minimal production from its
Goldstrike Mine in 1996.  The Company's principal focus is
on the development of its Illinois Creek and Thunder
Mountain Projects.  The Company is also actively involved in
exploration activities and periodically considers
acquisition opportunities.  It is the Company's goal to
commence mining at the Illinois Creek Mine in the summer of
1996.  If this can be achieved by the target date of
September 1, the Company forecasts production at the
Illinois Creek Mine of approximately 20,000 ounces of gold
in 1996.  Based on the Company's feasibility study (which is
currently being reviewed by an independent engineering firm,
and subject to revision) the Company projects that
approximately 60,000 ounces of gold could be produced in
1997.  The Company projects that the drill-defined
mineralization consists of 5.54 million tons grading 0.074
ounces per ton gold equivalent or approximately 412,000
contained equivalent ounces of gold.  Metallurgical recovery
from the run-of-mine ore is projected to be approximately
85% of contained gold and 25% of the contained silver.
     
     The Company's ability to achieve the forecasted gold
production will be dependent upon many factors, some of
which, such as the price of gold and climate conditions, are
beyond the control of the Company.  No assurance can be
given that the indicated amount of gold will be recovered.
     
     As with any development project, there is no operating
history upon which to base estimates of future cash
operating costs and capital requirements.  Estimates of
mineralization, metallurgical recovery, and cash operating
costs are to a large extent based on the interpretation of
geologic data obtained from drill holes and other sampling
techniques and feasibility reviews which derive estimates of
cash operating costs based on anticipated tonnage and grades
of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the
ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore,
comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate
conditions and other factors.  Accordingly, actual cash
operating costs and economic returns of the Illinois Creek
Project and other projects that may be undertaken by the
Company may materially differ from the costs and returns
initially estimated.
     
     The Company has obtained a commitment for a $22 million
facility to finance development and construction costs on
the Illinois Creek Project.  The Company will need to
promptly finalize, and commence use of funds, from this
facility, in order for the Company to commence mining in the
summer of 1996.  Closing is subject to several conditions,
including completion of a satisfactory due diligence report
from an independent engineering firm, the Company's receipt
of necessary permit approvals, and completion of
documentation satisfactory to the lender.
     
     The Illinois Creek Project has required extensive
planning by the Company, due in particular to the special
logistical aspects of gaining access to the site.
Transportation of equipment, construction materials,
supplies and personnel to the site will involve various
modes of transportation.  Most goods are to be staged in
Seattle, Washington, loaded into containers, and shipped by
barge to Anchorage, Alaska.  Materials will then be
transported from Anchorage to Galena using trucks, barges
and railroads.  From Galena, the goods will be flown to the
site using various aircraft.

<PAGE>
     
     Major components of some of the larger mining equipment
will be flown to the site using C-133 aircraft.  There is
only one such airworthy aircraft currently available for use
by the Company.  In addition, there is one additional C-133
available to supply spare parts if needed.  The Company is
in the process of finalizing arrangements for use of these
aircraft, which requires special permission.  If the Company
is unable to transport all of the components it currently
plans to transport using the C-133 aircraft, substantial
delays and additional costs could be incurred as the
components would have to be cut into smaller pieces,
transported to the site using smaller aircraft and
reassembled at the site.  If substantial delays occur, the
Company would not be able to commence mining in the summer
of 1996.  Due to weather conditions, mining operations
cannot be conducted year-round.  Therefore, if mining
operations are not started in 1996 the earliest operations
could commerce would be late spring of 1997.
     
     It is the Company's goal to initiate construction of
the Dewey Mine facilities in the Thunder Mountain Mining
District, Idaho, in the summer of 1997.  In January 1996 the
Company submitted a Notice of Intent to Operate with the
Idaho Department of Lands, which is currently being reviewed
by that agency and other state and federal agencies,
including the U.S. Forest Service.  The Company is presently
conducting a data sufficiency review of prior studies
pertaining to the Project area and previous operations
conducted near the Project area.  The Company intends to
thereafter retain an independent environmental consulting
firm to coordinate the submission of an environmental impact
statement.  The views of several governmental agencies, as
well as any public comments received, are expected to be
considered in connection with the review of the
environmental impact statement.  Although the Company
forecasts that it has a realistic prospect of obtaining the
necessary permits in 1997, there can be no assurance that
this will be achieved.
     
     A feasibility study by the Company will be ongoing
throughout 1996 to refine the Project design and economics.
It is presently anticipated that conventional open pit/heap
leaching techniques will be used.  The Company will also be
conducting additional metallurgical work, finalizing the
acquisition of adjacent land, and making preliminary
arrangements for facility construction and mining
operations.
     
     The Company's operations will be subject to all of the
operating hazards and risks normally incident to operation
of mineral properties, such as unusual or unexpected
geological formations, environmental hazards, industrial
accidents, labor disputes, equipment incapability or
failures, and inclement weather conditions.  Such
occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of,
mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury
or death, environmental damage, delays in mining, monetary
losses and possible legal liability.  Moreover, the
Company's mining operations will be subject to extensive
federal, state and local laws and regulations governing
production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health,
waste disposal, protection and remediation of the
environment, reclamation, mine safety, toxic substances and
other matters.
     
     Compliance with such laws and regulations has increased
the cost of planning, designing, drilling, developing,
constructing, operating and closing other mines and
facilities previously operated by the Company.  In addition,
the Company has expended significant resources, both
financial and managerial, to comply with environmental
protection regulations and permitting requirements and
anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future.
Although the Company believes that it has made adequate
provision to comply with such regulations, there can be no
assurance that additional significant costs and liabilities
will not be incurred to comply with current and future
environmental protection regulations.  Moreover, it is
possible that future developments, such as increasingly
strict environmental protection laws, regulations and
enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property and
persons resulting from the Company's operations, could
result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future.

  Price of Gold
     
     Another significant uncertainty facing the Company
which could potentially impact its financial position,
profitability and liquidity in the short term is the price
of gold.  The gold price is a function of a number of
factors including investors' expectations with respect to
inflation, the strength of world currencies, decisions by
central banks regarding their gold reserves, and supply and
demand factors, none of which is under the control of
Company management.  After trending downward over the past
several years, making a six year low during the fourth
quarter of 1992, the price of gold rebounded in 1993
reaching a high of $403 on August 3, 1993.  The average
market price of gold was $384 an ounce during 1995 and 1994
compared to $360 an ounce during 1993.

  Change in the Cost of Gold Sold
     
     The cost of gold sold which is planned to be produced
at the Company's Illinois Creek Mine is estimated on the
basis of the projected life of mine average cost of
approximately $320 per ounce of gold including $80 per ounce
of gold representing amortization of the Company's planned
total capital investment in the mine and $240 per ounce of
gold cash cost.

  Cost of Mineral Properties Abandoned
     
     The cost of mineral properties abandoned in any period
is a function of the results of the Company's exploration
efforts and economic considerations.  The Company currently
expects to invest approximately $1.5 million during 1996 for
property acquisition and exploration.  The Company makes
every effort to maximize the results of its exploration
efforts.  However, exploration for economically recoverable
metals involves significant risk.  Accordingly, while it is
probable there will be abandonment losses in the future, it
is not possible to predict either the timing or amount.

USMX, INC. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. - The Company
     
     USMX, INC. (the "Company") is a Delaware corporation
which engages in the exploration for, and development and
operation of precious metal properties.  The Company also
evaluates base metal and non-metallic situations.  The
Company conducts its operations directly and through various
operating subsidiaries.  All references herein to the
Company include all subsidiaries of USMX, INC.

Note 2. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and basis of presentation
     
     The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority
owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.  Management makes various estimates and
assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities revenues and expenses, and in the disclosure of
commitments and contingencies.  These estimates and
assumptions will change with the passage of time and the
occurrence of future events, and actual results will differ
from the estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
     
     The Company considers cash in banks and all highly
liquid investments, purchased with a maturity of three
months or less, to be cash equivalents.

Production Costs
     
     Production costs incurred are charged to Deferred
mining and processing costs as incurred.  Cost of gold sold
is based on the currently estimated life of mine average
cost.  The amount carried in the Company's balance sheet for
Deferred mining and processing costs is the lower of the
difference between production costs incurred to date and the
amount charged to Cost of gold sold to date or net
realizable value.

Mineral Properties
     
     The Company's policy is to charge to operations, costs
associated with identifying prospective mineral properties
and to capitalize the costs of acquiring, exploring and
developing unproven mineral properties.  For properties
subsequently placed into production, the applicable
capitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-
production method, based on the ratio of tons of ore mined
or processed during the year to the estimated total proven
and probable ore reserves of the project.
     
     Capitalized costs related to sold or abandoned
properties are charged against operations at the time the
property is sold or abandoned.  Proceeds from rentals and
option fees relating to undeveloped mineral properties in
which the Company has an economic interest are credited
against capitalized property costs and no gain is recognized
until all costs have been fully recovered.
     
     The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of
its properties by comparing the net book value of each
property to the estimated undiscounted future cash flow from
the property.  If the net book value exceeds the
undiscounted future cash flow, an impairment is recorded.
Changes in estimates and assumptions that underly
management's estimate of future cash flow from the Company's
mineral properties can materially impact future carrying
values and operating results.

Note 2. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)

Depreciation and Amortization
     
     Mine buildings and equipment are depreciated using the
units-of-production method based on the ratio of tons of ore
mined or ounces of gold produced during the period to the
estimated total proven and probable reserves of the related
property.  Vehicles, furniture and office equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line and the declining
balance methods over estimated useful lives of two to five
years.  The cost of normal repairs and maintenance is
charged to operations as incurred.  Significant expenditures
which increase the life of an asset are capitalized and
depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the
asset.  Upon retirement or disposition of property and
equipment, related gains or losses are recorded in
operations.

Reclamation Costs
     
     The Company records a liability for the estimated cost
to reclaim mined land by recording charges to production
costs for each ton of ore mined.  The amount charged is
based on management's estimate of reclamation costs to be
incurred.  The estimate is based on the work which is to be
performed as set forth in the reclamation plan approved by
the agencies responsible for granting the related mining
permits.  The accrued reclamation liability is reduced as
reclamation expenditures are made.  Certain reclamation work
is performed concurrently with mining.  However, the
majority of reclamation expenditures is made after mining
operations cease.

Revenue Recognition and Hedging Transactions
     
     The Company recognizes revenue as precious metals are
sold.  In order to protect against the impact of falling
gold prices, the Company enters into hedging transactions,
the goal of which is to provide a minimum price for future
production, and allow the Company to take advantage of short
term increases in the gold price.  Hedging transactions
include spot deferred and forward sales contracts and option
contracts.  Contracted prices on spot deferred and forward
sales and options are recognized in gold sales as production
is delivered to meet the commitment.

Income Taxes
     
     The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, ("SFAS 109").  Under the asset
and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date.

By-product Revenues
     
     Revenues from sales of by-products (principally silver)
are treated as a reduction of the cost of sales.

Net Income (loss) per Common Share
     
     Net income (loss) per common share is based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding during the year, unless they
are anti-dilutive.

     During 1995 the Company recorded an impairment related
to Deferred mining and processing costs of  $1,620,000 (see
Note 7.)

Note 4. - Undeveloped Mineral Properties
     
     The Company views exploration as an important means of
growth, and it typically actively explores several projects
annually.  Deferred costs at December 31, 1995 and 1994
associated with undeveloped mineral properties in various
countries were as follows:

                                        =============================

Illinois Creek, Alaska
     
     The Illinois Creek Project is a moderate grade, near
surface gold-silver deposit.  It consists of two State of
Alaska Mining Leases, covering 62,480 acres.  The project is
located in the western interior of Alaska approximately 57
miles southwest of Galena and 320 miles northwest of
Anchorage.  The exploration and development phases have been
completed with the exception of permitting.  A final
decision from the State of Alaska on all permits is expected
in April 1996.  No major federal permits will be required.
Assuming the grant of the necessary permits, the Company
intends to commence site development and construction in
late April 1996.  Field construction is anticipated to take
approximately four months to complete.
     
     Pursuant to an agreement with the current owner of the
underlying leases (the "Agreement"), the Company made
initial payments to the owner of $100,000 in 1994 to
evaluate the Illinois Creek property.  The Company is
required to make a $1 million, non-refundable payment to the
owner in cash or common stock of the Company.  The Company
has elected to make the payment in stock, which the Company
and the owner have agreed will amount to 449,754 shares.
The Company will issue these shares upon effectiveness of a
registration statement covering the resale of these shares.
The Company expects to file this registration statement in
April 1996.  In addition, if the Company obtains the
necessary permits and there has been no material adverse
change in project economics, the Company will be required to
make an additional payment to the owner of $3 million in
cash or common stock in exchange for title to the underlying
leases.  If the Company elects to pay all or part of this
amount in stock, it will also be required to provide for the
registration of the resale of the shares issued to the
owner.  The number of shares of common stock to be issued to
the owner will be based on a 30-day average of the price of
the Company's stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market.  In addition
to these payments, the owner will receive a 5% net returns
royalty.
     
     Also, if the Company delineates the existence of
additional ore reserves on the lease known as the Illinois
Creek Upland Mining Lease, which increases the total proven
ore reserves to at least one million ounces of equivalent
gold ore reserves beyond the mineralization stated in the
Company's February 1996 feasibility report, then the owner
will have the right to elect to participate in subsequent
mining operations with respect to those additional reserves
for a 25% working interest by reimbursing the Company 120%
of the owner's 25% share of exploration, development and
capital costs incurred by the Company subsequent to February
1996 which are directly related to the delineation and/or
production of the additional reserves.
     
     Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has until
December 16, 1997, to achieve Commercial Production (as
defined) from the property.  This period may be extended at
the option of the Company for two additional one year
periods upon payment by the Company of substantial advance
royalties for each one year extension.  The Agreement
terminates on December 16, 1999, if the Company has not
achieved Commercial Production from the property by that
date.  See Note  17.

Note 5. - Mineral Properties Under Development (Concluded)

Thunder Mountain, Idaho
     
     The Company proposes to conduct gold and silver mining
activities at the Dewey Mine in the Thunder Mountain Mining
District in eastern Valley County, Idaho, approximately 100
miles northeast of Boise, Idaho.  The proposed Dewey mining
operations are part of the Thunder Mountain Project and
consist of the development of a gold and silver ore deposit
located on patented mining claims administered by the Idaho
Department of Lands.
     
     Effective July 9, 1993, the Company entered into an
Exploration and Option to Purchase Agreement ("Agreement")
with Dewey Mining Company, Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. and
two individuals (the foregoing companies and individuals
described below collectively as "Owners").  The Owners
control approximately 5,500 acres in the Thunder Mountain
Mining District consisting of both patented and unpatented
mining claims.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the
Company was granted the sole and exclusive right to explore
for and develop minerals on the property in exchange for
advance royalty payments totaling $100,000.  In addition,
the Company committed to spend, and did spend, a minimum of
$500,000 evaluating the property prior to April 1, 1995.
     
     The Agreement requires that, before the Company can put
the property into commercial production, it must prepare and
deliver to the Owners a feasibility study regarding the
project.  In 1995, the Company extended the term of the
agreement through April 30, 1996, by making an additional
advance royalty payment in the amount of $150,000.  The
Company has the option to further extend the Agreement
through April 30, 1997, by paying an additional advance
royalty payment of $200,000.  The Company intends to so
extend the Agreement.  The Agreement further provides the
Company with the option for a final extension until April
30, 1998, in exchange for an additional advance royalty
payment of $250,000. The advance royalty payments made may
be recovered by the Company for seven years after payment
should the Owners elect to receive royalties under options
(a) or (c) below.  The Agreement terminates if the Company
fails to deliver a feasibility study to the Owners by the
end of the last year's extension under the Agreement or if
the Company exercises its right to terminate the Agreement
at any time.
     
     Within 90 days after the Company provides the Owners
with a feasibility study, the Owners may elect to (a)
participate in subsequent efforts to the extent of a 30%
working interest, plus receive a 1.5% royalty, or (b)
receive a 30% net profits interest, or (c) receive a 5% net
returns royalty from production.  If the Owners elect to
receive a 5% net returns royalty, the Company will be
obligated to make advance royalty payments of: (I) $200,000
within thirty days after commencement of Commercial
Production (as defined in the Agreement), and $250,000 each
year thereafter.  If the Owners fail to notify the Company
of their election prior to the end of the 90 day election
period they will be deemed to have made an election to
receive a 5% net returns royalty.
     
     The Agreement Provides that, once the Owners have made
their election, the Company shall have one year within which
to achieve Commercial Production.  If the Company fails to
achieve Commercial Production within one year, the Company
must either re-convey the property to the Owners or extend
by one year the time period within which Commercial
Production must commence by paying an advance royalty of
$200,000 to the Owners.  If Commercial Production has not
begun by the end of the extension period, the Company may
obtain one final extension of one year within which to
achieve Commercial Production by paying the Owners an
additional advance royalty of $250,000.
     
     
     
     In addition to the advance royalty payments and the
work commitments outlined above, the Company is obligated to
pay all fees necessary to maintain the unpatented mining
claims through August 31 of the calendar year in which the
extension year expires.

Note 6. - Developed Mineral Properties
     
     The Company's investment in developed mining properties
at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is as follows:

                                       ==============================

Goldstrike Mine
     
     Effective November 1, 1992, the Company acquired from
Tenneco Corporation (Tenneco), the stock of Tenneco Minerals
Company-Utah (TMC-Utah), owner and operator of the
Goldstrike Mine located approximately 35 miles northwest of
St. George, Utah.  Soon after the acquisition, the name of
this wholly owned subsidiary was changed to USMX of Utah,
Inc.  Gold production from the Goldstrike Mine since
November 1, 1992, has been 77,182 ounces, including 6,266
ounces of gold produced in 1995.
     
     Mining operations at the Goldstrike Mine were completed
in October 1994.  Leaching was completed in December 1995.
All disturbed areas at the Goldstrike Mine were reclaimed
during 1995 except for the heaps and the plant site.
Reclamation of one of the two heaps was begun near the end
of 1995.  Rinsing of the second heap commenced in January
1996 and is expected to continue into 1997.  Once rinsing of
the second heap is complete, the heap will be re-contoured,
covered with topsoil and seeded with various native plant
species.  In addition, the process plant will be dismantled
and the plant site reclaimed.

Montana Tunnels
     
     The Company owns a net profits interest in this
property (see Note 13.) and, accordingly, the carrying value
has been classified as a producing mineral property in the
Company's consolidated statements of financial position.
The Company's investment is amortized using the units of
production method, based on the ratio of tons of ore mined
to the estimated total proven and probable ore reserves as
reported to the Company by the operator, Pegasus Gold Inc.
("Pegasus").

Sale of Alligator Ridge Area Assets
     
     In 1993, the Company sold all of its unpatented mining
claims, mill sites, fee lands, mineral leases, easements and
other interests in real property owned by it in the area
known as Alligator Ridge in White Pine County, Nevada, along
with all related equipment, machinery, goods, supplies and
other personal property used by the Company.  The assets
were sold to the same buyer in two separate transactions for
a total of $20 million in cash plus assumption by the buyer
of all obligations and liabilities associated with or
arising out of the operation of the assets, including all
reclamation liabilities.  The Company recorded gains from
these sales of approximately $5.0 which is included in other
net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

Note 7. - Asset abandonments, write downs and impairments

Goldstrike Mine
     
     Gold production at the Company's Goldstrike Mine in
Utah declined sharply in August and September of 1995.  This
decline in gold recovery triggered a reevaluation of the
estimated remaining recoverable gold ounces in the heaps.
It was determined that it was no longer economically
feasible to add cyanide to the system and the rinsing of the
heaps commenced in October.  As a result, the carrying value
of Deferred mining and processing costs was reduced to the
fair market value of the remaining gold bullion and dore at
the refinery and the Company recorded an impairment loss of
$1,620,000.

Note 7. - Asset abandonments, write downs and impairments
(Concluded)

Cala Abajo
     
     In October 1992, the government of Puerto Rico granted
an Exclusive Exploration Permit covering the Cala Abajo
copper-gold deposit to the Company's majority owned
subsidiary, Southern Gold Resources (USA), Inc. (Southern
Gold). In June 1995, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico adopted
legislation which amended the island's mining law to
prohibit future mining of metallic deposits by open pit
methods.  Although the Company is considering various
strategies and responses, the effect of the mining law, as
currently amended, is to render the Company's plan for
development of the Cala Abajo deposit uneconomic.  As a
result, the Company reduced the carrying value of the
property to zero and recorded an impairment loss of
$1,039,000 during 1995.

Amargosa
     
     During 1995 the Company wrote down the carrying value
of the Amargosa property by $1,000,000 to  $315,000.
Although the property remains geologically promising, to
date, no significant economic mineralization has been
encountered.  The Company anticipates further exploration of
the Amargosa property, possibly in joint venture with
another mining company.

Note 8. - Revolving Bank Credit Agreement
     
     In order to provide a source of short-term financing,
the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement
("Agreement") with The Colorado National Bank of Denver
("Bank") effective as of June 24, 1992.  Under the terms of
the Agreement, the Company may borrow up to $3 million at
the Bank's prime rate plus three quarters of a percent.
     
     The amount which the Company may borrow under the
Agreement is limited to the lesser of $3 million or the
borrowing base amount, as defined in the Agreement.  The
borrowing base amount is the sum of a calculated present
value of the Company's interest in the Montana Tunnels
royalty, gold bullion and dore in the hands of outside
refiners and U. S. Treasury Bills and U. S. Treasury Notes
which the Company may elect to include in the borrowing base
less any amounts outstanding under the Agreement.  At
December 31, 1995, the borrowing base was $1,379,000.
Interest on any borrowings is payable monthly with principal
due upon expiration of the annual agreement.
     
     The Agreement contains certain financial covenants
including the maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net
worth and cash flow, and limitations on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness.  In addition, the Company must
first obtain the prior written consent of the Bank before
paying dividends or refunding any capital or making any
distributions of assets to the Company's stockholders.  At
December 31, 1995, $1,051,000 of this facility was being
used to secure letters of credit provided by the Company as
reclamation surety in connection with the Goldstrike Mine in
Washington County, Utah.  The balance of the facility was
unused at that date.  The Agreement has been extended to
December 1997.

Note 9. - Sales of Property and Equipment
     
     In April 1994, the Company sold its interest in the
Kinsley Mountain Project in Elko County Nevada to Alta Gold
Co. ("Alta").  In April 1995, the Company received a final
cash payment of $400,000 and Alta restricted common stock
with a market value of $200,000 based on the average closing
price of the stock over the 30 trading days prior to
issuance.  The payment was in addition to cash of  $400,000
and Alta restricted common stock with a market value of
$200,000 previously received.  The cash proceeds and
discounted value of the stock received were recorded as a
reduction to the carrying value of the property on the
Company's books.  During 1995, the carrying value of the
property was reduced to zero and a $1,000 loss was recorded.

Note 10. - Stock Options
     
     The Company has two stock option plans, the ("1987
Plan") and the Non-discretionary Plan for Non-Employee
Directors ("Directors' Plan"), which cover a total of
1,700,000 shares of common stock available for grant to
employees and directors of the Company.
     
     Under the 1987 Plan, the Company may grant incentive
stock options as well as non-incentive stock options.
Incentive stock options granted under the 1987 Plan are
exercisable at prices equal to the market value of the
common stock at the date of grant.  The option prices of non-
incentive stock options granted under the 1987 Plan may be
less than the market value of the common shares as of the
grant date.  Options expire at such time as the Option
Committee of the Board of Directors determines, but no later
than ten years from the grant date.

     The Directors' Plan was established in 1992 to afford
non-employee directors an opportunity for investment in the
Company and the incentive advantages inherent in stock
ownership of the Company.  Options granted under the
Directors' Plan are exercisable at prices equal to the
market value of the common stock at the date of grant and
are exercisable in full on the date of grant.
     
     Shares acquired pursuant to the Directors' Plan may not
be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of for a period
of at least six months following the date of grant.  Under
the terms of the Directors' Plan, the directors who elected
to participate were each issued options to purchase 10,000
shares of the Company's common stock upon adoption of the
plan.  Thereafter, each non-employee director who elects to
participate is automatically granted an option to purchase
10,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon joining the
Board.  In addition, on October 1 of each year each
participant is automatically granted an option to purchase
an additional 5,000 shares.  Options granted under the
Directors' Plan expire ten years from the date of grant
except that an option will expire, if not exercised, ninety
days after the optionee ceases to be a director of the
Company.

    (1) During 1995, option terms to acquire 724,750 shares were
    extended to ten years from the original date of grant.  For
    accounting purposes the extension was treated as the cancellation of
    the existing options and the granting of new options.
    (2) Of the options outstanding at December 31, 1995, options to
    acquire 826,250 shares were exercisable on that date at an average
    option price of  $2.90 per share.  The remaining options are
    exercisable on various dates between March 1996 and October 1998.


Note 11. - Employees' Benefit Plans and Incentive Bonus
Arrangements
     
     Effective July 1, 1987, the Company adopted an Employee
Savings and Investment Plan under section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code, which covers all full-time employees.
The plan is a defined contribution plan and allows employee
contributions of up to ten percent of pre-tax compensation,
limited to the maximum deferral allowed by the Internal
Revenue Service.
     
     The Company may contribute at least ten percent and not
more than one hundred percent of the amount contributed by
the employees, up to a maximum of six percent of pre-tax
compensation.  For 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Board of
Directors has set the Company's contribution at fifty
percent of the first six percent of employee contributions.
For 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company's contributions were
approximately $57,000, $59,000, and $111,000, respectively.
Participants vest in the Company's contributions based upon
years of service, and are fully vested after four years of
service.

Note 11. - Employees' Benefit Plans and Incentive Bonus
Arrangements(Concluded)
     
     Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted an
incentive stock bonus plan for substantially all employees
involved in its Nevada operations.  Under the terms of the
plan, a stock bonus was payable on the earlier of December
31, 1994, or the last day of the calendar quarter in which a
covered employee's employment with the Company was
terminated.  For each calendar quarter worked by a covered
employee, the employee accrued a bonus of the number of
shares of the Company's stock determined by dividing five
percent of the employees' gross base salary for the quarter
by the average closing price per share for the last ten
trading days of the quarter.  The cost associated with each
quarterly-determined bonus was treated as a non-cash cost of
production.  For the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993,
approximately $11,000 and $61,000, respectively, was accrued
under the plan.  As a result of the sale of the Company's
Alligator Ridge area assets in August 1993, all but three of
the covered employees were terminated. The Company issued a
total of 27,810 shares of its common stock to the terminated
employees and 5,434 shares of its common stock to the three
remaining employees as final payments due under the
incentive stock bonus plan.
     
     The Company has an Exploration Discovery Bonus Plan
under which bonuses are paid in cash or in shares of the
Company's stock to certain employees for discoveries of ore
deposits that the Company's Board of Directors determines
can be operated at a profit.  The bonus is based on the net
present value of the deposit and is calculated using a
sliding scale ranging from 2% for deposits with a net
present value of up to $10 million, to 0.85% of the first
$100 million of net present value plus 0.25% of that portion
of the net present value of the deposit that exceeds $100
million.  Under the terms of the plan, 70% of each discovery
bonus is divided equally among the Company's explorationists
and the remainder is to be shared among those individuals
designated by the Company's President as playing an
especially important role in the discovery.  No bonuses were
paid in 1995 or 1994 under the plan.  The Company paid
Exploration Discovery Bonuses totaling approximately $71,000
in 1993.

Note 12. - Commitments and Contingencies

Reclamation Surety
     
     Pursuant to the mining reclamation and bonding
regulations of the State of Utah, Department of Natural
Resources and the Bureau of Land Management, in 1993 the
Company provided reclamation surety for the Goldstrike Mine
in the amount of $2,251,000. In October 1995, the Company
was advised that, as a result of the reclamation work
accomplished by the Company at the Goldstrike Mine, the
required surety had been reduced by approximately $400,000
to $1,851,000.  The required surety is in the form of a
certificate of deposit in the amount of $800,000 and letters
of credit in the amount of $1,051,000.  The certificate of
deposit is reflected in Other assets in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Operating Leases
     
     The Company leases office space and vehicles under
operating leases which expire through 1998.

     Effective as of June 15, 1992, the Company entered into
a new lease for its corporate offices in Lakewood, Colorado.
The initial term of the lease expires September 30, 1998,
with an option to renew for an additional five year period
at the market rate in effect at the time of renewal.  The
lease provides for base rent of $7,690 per month with an
annual $780 per month increase effective July 1 of each year
beginning in 1997.  In addition, the Company is obligated to
reimburse the landlord for the Company's proportionate share
of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses.

Note 12. - Commitments and Contingencies (Concluded)
     
     The following table sets forth the future minimum lease
payment obligations as of December 31, 1995:

                2000       $0                 

     
     Rent expense was $113,000, $139,000 and $303,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Note 13. - Transactions With Affiliates
     
     As of December 31, 1995, Pegasus owned 4,826,000 shares
(33.0%) of the Company's outstanding common stock.  In
January 1986, the Company entered into a revised agreement
with Centennial Minerals Ltd., a subsidiary of Pegasus for
the development of the Montana Tunnels property.  Pursuant
to the agreement, Pegasus developed the property, acquired a
100 percent working interest in the project, and commenced
mine and mill operations in March 1987.  The operations at
Montana Tunnels achieved defined operating status on October
1, 1987.  Under the agreement, the Company will receive the
greater of a minimum advance royalty of $60,000 per month or
a five percent net profits interest until Pegasus recovers
payout of capital and other defined costs estimated by the
Company, based on information provided by Pegasus, to
approximate $26.5 million as of December 31, 1995.
     
     After certain construction, land acquisition,
associated financing and other costs are recovered by
Pegasus ('Payback'), the Company is entitled to fifty
percent of the profits.  Depending upon metal prices and
production rates, the mine could achieve payback which would
result in increased income to the Company at some future
date. However, even if payback is not achieved, the Company
seems reasonably assured of continued income of $720,000 per
year during the life of the mine, now estimated by Pegasus
to continue into the year 2000.  For each of the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company received
$720,000 in royalty income from the Montana Tunnels
property.
     
     In March 1995, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock of Mega Minerals S.A., an
Ecuadorian company.  The Company assumed obligations of
approximately $120,000, and agreed to pay the seller a 10%
net proceeds royalty on any production from the concessions
after recovery of all capital expenditures.  A director and
principal shareholder of the seller is also a director of
the Company.  The assets of Mega Minerals S.A. consist of
eight exploration concessions and the rights to acquire four
additional exploration concessions, all located in the
Nambija-Zamora gold belt of southern Ecuador.

     Total income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, was  $(118,000),
$(497,000), and $1,472,000 respectively.  The entire income
tax benefit of $118,000 for the year ended December 31,
1995, is the result of an adjustment to federal income taxes
receivable related to 1993 net operating losses carried back
to prior years. Income tax expense (benefit) consists of the
following:

of property abandonments of $40,000 and $221,000, respectively.

provision  for the third and fourth quarters include a benefit  of  $321,000
and  $176,000, respectively. The benefit arises from the difference  between
the  tax  calculated on the 1993 tax return and the estimated tax  liability
recorded  in the financial statements in 1993.  There were certain elections
and  estimates used to prepare the tax return that were not anticipated when
the 1993 tax provision was originally prepared.

Note 16. - New Accounting Standards
     
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of" (SFAS 121) was issued in March, 1995, by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board.  It requires that long-
lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held
and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  SFAS
121 is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995.  Adopting this statement by the
Company is not expected to have a significant effect on the
financial statements.
     
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123), was
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
October 1995.  SFAS 123 establishes financial accounting and
reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation
plans as well as transactions in which an entity issues its
equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non-
employees.  This statement defines a fair value based method
of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity
instruments, and encourages all entities to adopt that
method of accounting for all of their employee stock
compensation plans.  However, it also allows an entity to
continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using
the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25).  Entities electing to
continue to follow APB 25 must make pro forma disclosures of
net income and earnings per share, as if the fair value
based method of accounting defined by SFAS 123 had been
applied.  SFAS 123 is applicable to fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995.  The Company currently accounts for
its equity instruments using the accounting prescribed by
APB 25.  The Company does not currently expect to adopt the
accounting prescribed by SFAS 123; however, the Company will
include the disclosures required by SFAS 123 in future
financial statements.

Note 17. - Subsequent Event
     
     In February 1996, the Company received a commitment
from N. M. Rothschild & Sons Limited, London ("Rothschild"),
to underwrite a $22 million facility to finance development
and construction costs of the Company's Illinois Creek
Project (the "Project", See Note 6.) and to provide the
related initial working capital requirements.  The
commitment is subject to several conditions, including a
satisfactory due diligence report from an independent
engineering firm, receipt of necessary permit approvals and
completion of documentation.  The facility includes a $19.5
million project loan facility, a $2.5 million convertible
debenture and a 100,000 ounce margined gold hedging facility
to provide for project hedging requirements.  The Company
currently estimates initial total capital costs of the
Project to be approximately $26.6 million, including
costs of property acquisition, construction, initial working
capital, financing and initial reclamation bonding, but
excluding costs incurred through December 31, 1995, of
approximately $4.0 million.
     
     The project loan facility will be an amortizing term
loan facility available in gold ounces and/or US Dollars and
is to be repaid in thirteen equal quarterly installments
commencing June 30, 1997.  The project loan may, at the
Company's option, be converted from a gold loan to a dollar
loan and vice versa, with the prior approval of Rothschild.
The project loan facility bears interest at the base rate
plus a margin.  The base rate is LIBOR, in the case of
drawings in US Dollars, and LIBOR less the London Gold
Lending Rate, in the case of drawings in gold ounces.  The
margin is 2.25% per annum until the Project has reached
Completion and 1.875% thereafter.  Until the Project has
achieved Completion through the passing of a Completion Test
(and satisfaction of other conditions), the Company will
unconditionally guarantee all obligations under the project
loan.  After Completion, the project facility will become
non-recourse to the Company, except for ongoing
environmental warranties.
     
     The convertible debenture bears interest at the rate of
LIBOR plus 2% and, if not converted,  matures June 30, 2000.
The debenture is convertible at the discretion of Rothschild
any time prior to the maturity date into shares of the
Company's common stock at the rate of $3.40 per share.  The
Company will have the right to require conversion of the
debenture if the share price of the Company's common stock
trades above $4.75 for more than 30 consecutive days.

Item 9.     Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
                Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
     
     There were no disagreements with the Company's
principal independent accountants on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosures, or auditing scope or procedure.

       the Properties for the purpose of performing the reclamation
       described in paragraph 2 above and for purposes of
       ;processing and removing gold as described in paragraph 4
       below.

     4.   USMX/Utah shall have the right, but not the obligation
       to remove any gold remaining in the heaps situated on the
       Properties, as may be recovered as a result of USMX/Utah's
       reclamation activities, provided and on the condition that
       it pays BVLLC 50% of the proceeds received from the sale of
       any such gold removed from the Properties after January 31,
       1996, after deducting from such proceeds the following
       costs:  rentals and royalties that may be payable (directly
       by USMX/Utah or indirectly by USMX/Utah pursuant to
       paragraph 1 above) to underlying landowners by USMX/Utah,
       regardless of whether paid directly by USMX/Utah or through
       PEA; transportation costs from the Properties to the place
       or places of refining and sale processing and transportation
       costs incurred as a result of shipping loaded carbon after
       recovery of the gold and carbon on the Properties; and other
       costs related to the transportation, disposition or sale of
       that gold, including but not limited to umpiring fees, taxes
       (other than income taxes) and sales commissions.

     5.   USMX/Utah and BVLLC acknowledge that USMX/Utah has no
       rights or obligations of any nature whatsoever with respect
       to the Properties other than as described in paragraphs 1,
       2, 3 and 4 above, and that BVLLC has full freedom and
       discretion to negotiate with third parties with respect to
       the Properties in any manner it deems appropriate.

     If the above correctly represents your understanding of
our agreement, please so indicate by signing on the space
provided below.

<TEXT>


        EXPLORATION DISCOVERY BONUS PLAN OF USMX, INC.


Article 1: Purpose.

    This Exploration Discovery Bonus Plan ("Plan") of USMX, Inc.

("USMX") is adopted by the Board of Directors ("Board") of USMX.

The purpose of this Plan is to provide a financial incentive for

Explorationists to discover commercially exploitable mineral

deposits by rewarding those Explorationists who contributed to

the discovery of an Economic Mineral Deposit by paying them a

discovery bonus ("Bonus") as hereinafter provided.


Article 2: Definitions.


    2.1 "Common Stock" shall mean common stock in USMX.

    2.2 "Continuous Commercial Production" shall mean the

systematic and uninterrupted process of mining, processing,

milling and marketing mineral products from an Economic Mineral

Deposit. Continuous Commercial Production shall not include mine

and mill construction, pilot plant testing, bulk sampling or

similar activities, but shall include operation of a seasonal

heap leach mine.

    2.3 "Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial

Production" shall mean the date when mineral treatment facilities

have operated for ninety (90) consecutive days at a rate of at

least eighty-five percent (85%) of the daily rate projected in

the feasibility study which was used to design the mine.

    2.4 "Date of Initiation of Formal Feasibility Studies"

shall mean the date of a written memorandum from USMX's Vice

President of Exploration to its Vice President of Operations

which transfers a property possibly containing an Economic

Mineral Deposit from the corporation's Exploration Division to

its Mining Division.

    2.5 "Discretionary Recipient" shall mean any individual(s)

designated by the President of USMX as a person who played an

especially important role in the discovery of an Economic Mineral

Deposit. In his sole discretion, the President may designate any

person whomsoever to receive a Bonus as a Discretionary

Recipient, regardless of whether or not the same individual is an

Eligible Participant and will also receive a Bonus as an Eligible

Participant.

    2.6 "Economic Mineral Deposit" shall mean an ore deposit

which formal feasibility studies prepared or commissioned by USMX

determine can be placed into Continuous Commercial Production and

that Continuous Commercial Production will result in a profit

acceptable to USMX.

    2.7 "Eligible Participant" shall mean an Explorationist who

is an Eligible Participant within the meaning of Section 4.2 of

this Plan.

    2.8 "Explorationist" shall mean a person with exploration

expertise who is employed by USMX for the purpose of using such

expertise in the search for and development of Economic Mineral

Deposits and who is identified as an Explorationist as required

by Section 4.1 hereof.

    2.9 "Net Present Value" (NPV) shall mean the net present

value to USMX of an Economic Mineral Deposit on the date when NPV

is calculated or recalculated by the Board (adjusted to reflect

economic ore reserves existing at the Date of Commencement of

Continuous Commercial Production as may be modified by subsequent

events, and utilizing economic factors current at the time of

such NPV calculation) using, in the Board's sole discretion, any

method which is generally accepted in the mining industry.

Revenues shall be based on spot or estimated spot metal prices.

The calculation or recalculation shall allow for the recapture of

all exploration and other costs, such as feasibility study, pilot


                             -2-

<PAGE>
plant work, etc. expended by USMX on or in connection with the

Economic Mineral Deposit prior to the Date of Commencement of

Continuous Commercial Production (and, for purposes of the

calculation or recalculation, shall be deemed to have been spent

on the Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial Production)

and the application of a provision for income taxes and financing

costs, and the Board shall have complete discretion in selecting

a reasonable discount factor to be used in connection with its

calculation or recalculation of Net Present Value. Any Eligible

Participant or Discretionary Recipient shall be entitled to

review relevant documents concerning the Board's calculations or

recalculation of NPV. Any Net Present Value calculated or

recalculated by the Board pursuant to this Plan shall be for the

sole purpose of establishing a Total Bonus Amount as provided in

Article 5 of this Plan.

    2.10 "Period of Discovery" with respect to an Economic

Mineral Deposit included within a particular property shall mean

the period of time commencing with the date of acquisition by

USMX of the legal right to explore and develop the property and

ending with the Date of Initiation of Formal Feasibility Studies.

    2.11 "Total Bonus Amount" with respect to a particular

Economic Mineral Deposit shall mean an amount established as

specified in Section 5.3 hereof.


Article 3: Administration.


    3.1 General: The Plan shall be administered by the Board,

or a committee designated by the Board, which shall be empowered

to establish rules and regulations consistent herewith and to

make such other determinations as are necessary or advisable for

its administration. Acts of a majority of the Board (or a

committee designated by the Board) at a meeting, or acts approved

in writing by a majority of the Board (or a committee designated

by the Board), shall be valid acts of the Board.


                             -3-
<PAGE>

    3.2 Arbitration: Any controversy or claim arising out of

or relating to this Plan shall be settled by arbitration in

accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American

Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by

the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction

thereof. With regard to each arbitrated claim or dispute, each

party shall be responsible for his, her or its own costs and

expenses paid or incurred for or in connection therewith,

including expert witness fees and travel and lodging expenses to,

from and at the place of the arbitration hearing, and attorneys'

members of the Board shall be indemnified by USMX against the

reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and

necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any

action, suit, or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal

therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of

any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with

this Plan or any payment hereunder, and against all amounts paid

in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by

legal counsel selected by USMX), or paid in satisfaction of a

judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding, except in

relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such

action, suit, or proceeding that such member of the Board is

liable for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of

his duties; provided that within ten (10) days after institution

of any such action, suit, or proceeding, a member of the Board

shall offer USMX in writing the opportunity, at its own expense,

to handle and defend the same.


Article 4: Eligible Participants/Subject Deposits.

                             -4-
<PAGE>

    4.1 Explorationists: Each and every individual employed by

USMX as its Vice President for Exploration shall constitute an

Explorationist for purposes of this Plan. USMX shall maintain a

roster containing the names of other employees that USMX

identifies, in its sole discretion, as Explorationists. Such

roster shall be maintained and periodically revised by the Vice

President - Exploration of USMX, subject to review by the Board.

    4.2 Eligible Participants: To qualify as an Eligible

Participant with respect to an Economic Mineral Deposit included

within a particular property, an Explorationist must be employed

by USMX on a full-time basis for a minimum period of six (6)

consecutive months prior to the Date of Initiation of Formal

Feasibility Studies. In the event that the Period of Discovery

is less than six months, the Explorationist must be employed by

USMX on a full-time basis at the time when USMX acquires the

legal right to explore and develop the property and must remain

so employed for the entire Period of Discovery. Termination of

an Explorationist's employment for any reason other than cause

shall not preclude him or her from receiving a Bonus if he or she

is otherwise an Eligible Participant within the meaning of this

Section 4.2.

    4.3 Application to Deposit: Unless otherwise determined by

the Board as specified in this Section 4.3, this Plan shall apply

only to the discovery by Explorationists of an Economic Mineral

Deposit included within a property which, at the time of acquisi-

tion by USMX of the legal right to explore and develop, did not

contain known economic mineralization as determined by USMX. In

the event that a particular property contained known economic

mineralization at the time of such acquisition as determined by

USMX, the Board shall have complete discretion to designate all

or any part of an Economic Mineral Deposit thereon or thereunder

as an Economic Mineral Deposit which is subject to this Plan.

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the operation or


                             -5-
<PAGE>

 
disposition by USMX of any property or of any interest therein

shall be entirely at the discretion of USMX.


Article 5: Payment of Bonus.


    5.1 General: Subject to the provisions of Section 6.4

hereof, at the sole discretion of the Board, a Bonus may be paid

in cash or in Common Stock or in any combination thereof. Except

as otherwise provided in Sections 5.4 or 5.5 below, payment of a

Bonus shall be made in installments as provided in Section 5.2

hereof. In connection with payment of all or any part of a

Bonus, USMX shall withhold amounts equal to the withholding tax

which an Eligible Participant is obligated to pay to state and

federal governments.

    5.2 Installment Payments: Except as otherwise provided in

Sections 5.4 or 5.5 below, a Bonus shall be paid in three (3)

installments and the amount of each installment shall be estab-

lished on an anniversary of the Date of Commencement of

Continuous Commercial Production as hereinafter provided.

Eligible Participants shall collectively receive seventy percent

(70%) of the Total Bonus Amount for a particular anniversary of

the Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial Production, and

the remaining thirty percent (30%) shall be received by the

Discretionary Recipients. Each installment payment required by

this Section 5.2 shall be made by USNX within thirty (30) days

after the amount thereof is established. In the event that

interruption occurs with respect to Continuous Commercial

Production, the anniversary dates shall be delayed for an

equivalent period of time.

         5.2.1 First Bonus Installment: On  the  first

anniversary of the Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial

Production, the Board shall calculate the NPV of an Economic

Mineral Deposit, and the Total Bonus Amount for the first

anniversary shall then be established by the table contained in


                             -6-
<PAGE>

Section 5.3 hereof. As his or her first installment of Bonus,

each of the Eligible participants shall receive twenty-five

percent (25%) of the value obtained by dividing seventy percent

(70%) of the Total Bonus Amount for the first anniversary by the

total number of Eligible Participants. As his or her first

installment of Bonus, each Discretionary Recipient shall receive

twenty-five percent (25%) of the value obtained by dividing

thirty percent (30%) of the Total Bonus Amount for the first

anniversary by the total number of Discretionary Recipients.

         5.2.2 Second Bonus Installment: On  the  second

anniversary of the Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial

Production, the Board shall recalculate the NPV of the Economic

Mineral Deposit and the Total Bonus Amount for the second

anniversary shall then be established by the table contained in

Section 5.3 hereof. As his or her second installment of Bonus,

each of the Eligible Participants shall receive thirty-five

percent (35%) of the value obtained by dividing seventy percent

(70%) of the Total Bonus Amount for the second anniversary by the

total number of Eligible Participants. As his or her second

installment of Bonus, each Discretionary Recipient shall receive

thirty five percent (35%) of the value obtained by dividing

thirty percent (30%) of the Total Bonus Amount for the second

anniversary by the total number of Discretionary Recipients.

         5.2.3 Third and Final Bonus Installment: On the third

anniversary of the Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial

Production, the Board shall again recalculate the NPV of the

Economic Mineral Deposit and the Total Bonus Amount for the third

anniversary shall then be established by the table contained in

Section 5.3 hereof. As his or her third and final installment of

Bonus, each of the Eligible Participants shall receive an amount

calculated by first dividing seventy percent (70%) of the Total

Bonus Amount for the third anniversary by the total number of

Eligible Participants, and then subtracting from the result any

and all payments previously made to such Eligible Participant


                             -7-
<PAGE>


pursuant to Subsections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 hereof. As his or her

third and final installment of Bonus, each Discretionary

Recipient shall receive an amount calculated by first dividing

thirty percent (30%) of the Total Bonus Amount for the third

anniversary by the total number of Discretionary Recipients, and

then subtracting from the result any and all payments previously

made to such Discretionary Recipient pursuant to Subsections

5.2.l and 5.2.2 hereof.

    5.3 Total Bonus Amount: The Total Bonus Amount on any

anniversary of the Date of Commencement of Continuous Commercial

Production or on a date referred to in Section 5.4 or 5.5 hereof

shall be established by the following table:


NPV OF ECONOMIC MINERAL

DEPOSIT                       TOTAL BONUS AMOUNT

    5.4 Payment Upon Sale or Exhaustion After Commencement of

Continuous Commercial Production: After the Date Of Commencement

of Continuous Commercial Production but before completion of any

or all of the installments of Bonus provided for in Section 5.2

hereof, in the event that USMX sells all or any part of its

ownership interest in a property which includes an Economic

Mineral Deposit or in the event that an Economic Mineral Deposit

is mined out, then the remaining Bonus payable to an Eligible

Participant or a Discretionary Recipient shall be calculated

pursuant to this Section 5.4. Upon sale of the interest in real

property or upon depletion of the Economic Mineral Deposit, as


                             -8-

<PAGE>

the case may be, the Board shall determine the NPV of the

Economic Mineral Deposit (taking into consideration any interest

retained and/or value received or to be received from such

disposition) and the Total Bonus Amount shall then be established

by the table contained in Section 5.3 hereof. As his or her

final installment of Bonus, each Eligible Participant shall

receive an amount calculated by first dividing seventy percent

(70%) of such Total Bonus Amount by the total number of Eligible

Participants, and then subtracting from the result any and all

payments previously made to such Eligible Participant pursuant to

Subsections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 hereof. As his or her final install-

ment of Bonus, each Discretionary Recipient shall receive an

amount calculated by first dividing thirty percent (30%) of such

Total Bonus Amount by the total number of Discretionary

Recipients, and then subtracting from the result any and all

payments previously made to such Discretionary Recipient pursuant

to Subsections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 hereof. All such final install-

ments shall be paid within twelve (12) months after sale of the

interest in real property by USMX or depletion of the Economic

Ore Deposit as the case may be.

    5.5 Payment Upon Sale Before Commencement of Continuous

Commercial Production: In the event that USMX sells all or any

part of its ownership in a property which includes an Economic

Mineral Deposit that is subject to this Plan after the Period of

Discovery but before the Date of Commencement of Continuous

Commercial Production, the entire Bonus payable to an Eligible

Participant or a Discretionary Recipient shall be calculated

pursuant to this Section 5.5. Upon sale of the interest in real

property, the Board shall determine the NPV of the Economic

Mineral Deposit (taking into consideration any interest retained

and/or value received or to be received from such disposition)

and the Total Bonus Amount shall then be established by the table

contained in Section 5.3 hereof. As his or her single payment of

Bonus, each Eligible Participant shall receive the value obtained

by dividing seventy percent (70%) of such Total Bonus Amount by


                             -9-

<PAGE>

the total number of Eligible Participants. As his or her single

payment of Bonus, each Discretionary Recipient shall receive the

value obtained by dividing thirty percent (30%) of such Total

Bonus Amount by the total number of Discretionary Recipients.

The single payment of Bonus required by this Section 5.5 shall be

made within 12 months after sale of the interest in real property

by USMX.


Article 6: Stock Payments

    6.1 Stock Subject to Plan: No Common Stock shall be issued

in payment of Bonuses pursuant to this Plan without approval of

the Board. Any shares so paid shall be shares of authorized but

unissued or reacquired Common Stock.

    6.2 Price: The Board shall have the discretion to deter-

mine the price at which the Common Stock issued to Eligible

Participants under this Plan shall be valued, but in no event

shall the price be greater than the market price of freely

tradeable Common Stock on the date when the Common Stock is so

issued.

    6.3 Stock Held for Investment: If shares of Common Stock

issued hereunder are not, at the time of such issuance, covered

by an effective registration statement under the Securities Act

of 1933, as amended, such shares shall be acquired by an

individual for his or her own account for investment and with no

view, at the time of such issuance, toward the distribution

thereof, and each such individual shall at the time of issuance

give a letter to such effect to USMX. In that event, each stock

certificate representing such unregistered shares issued pursuant

to this Plan shall have a legend imprinted thereon indicating any

restrictions on the transfer of such stock, which legend shall be

in such form as deemed desirable by counsel for USMX, and such

individual shall also agree that he or she will make no sale or

other disposition of such shares unless and until USMX shall have


                          -10-
<PAGE>

received a satisfactory opinion of counsel that such sale or

other disposition may be made under the applicable provisions of

the Securities Act of 1933 and the applicable state securities

laws. USMX shall use its best efforts to register Common Stock

issued pursuant to this Plan within twelve (12) months after its

issuance.

    6.4 Stock Issued to Officers or Directors: USMX shall not

issue Common Stock as payment of a Bonus to an individual if that

person is an officer or director of USMX and such payment in

Common Stock would subject him or her to liability under federal

or state securities law.


Article 7: Amendment; Termination

         The Board may review, amend or discontinue this Plan at

any time, provided that such action shall not affect any Bonus

previously earned or paid hereunder.


Article 8: Governing Law

         This Plan shall be construed and shall take effect in

accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado.


    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, USMX has adopted this Plan this

day of August, 1990, effective as of September 1, 1989.


                              USMX, INC.

6.0  BIDDERS QUALIFICATION

     6.1  Owner  reserves the right to request from Bidder at any time prior to
          award of the Contract, any information considered necessary to further
          ensure that the Bidder is adequately prepared and able to fulfill the
          Contract.  Such information may include past performance records,
          lists of available key personnel, inventory of construction equipment,
          descriptions of completed contracts, contracts to be performed
          simultaneously with the contract, financial statements or any other
          data pertinent to the selection and approval of a contractor to
          perform the Work.

     6.2  The successful Bidder must, prior to award of the Contract, be duly
          qualified as required by government authorities to do business in the

<PAGE>

     7.0  SELECTION OF THE CONTRACTOR

     7.1  As soon as possible after the closing date set to receive bids, Owner
          will select a contractor on the basis of price, organization,
          availability of construction equipment, financial resources,
          qualifications, construction capabilities, completion dependability,
          experience, and such other factors as the Owner in its judgment
          considers are to the best interest of the Project.

     7.2  Commercial terms will always be a major consideration in the
          evaluation of bids received.  However, the lowest bid price will not
          necessarily be the deciding factor in selection of a contractor to
          perform the Work.

8.0  PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE

     Owner may at any time prior to award of the Contract request a performance
     and material payment bond, in which case award of the Contract will be

          7.1  Failure by the Owner to, at any time, enforce or

          of the Contract will not constitute a waiver of, or
          affect, or impair such terms or conditions in any way;

          mentioned in the specifications and not shown on the
          drawings or shown on the drawings and not mentioned in
          the specifications shall be of like effect as if shown

          information or other clarifications are necessary, the

          unless clearly unreasonable shall govern.

          9.2  Contractor agrees to assume responsibility for

          as necessary to accomplish the Work.

          9.3  With the exception of those items and services, if
          any, which this Contract expressly states will be
          furnished by others, the supply of any item or service

          its suitability for use in relation to Contractor's
          Work and shall immediately advise Owner of any
          deficiencies therein and Owner shall have a reasonable
          time to have such deficiencies corrected, if such
          correction is not the Contractor's responsibility.
          Contractor is responsible for making such measurements
          and adjustments to the Work as is required to insure
          proper fit between the Work and any adjacent or
          contiguous work.

          11.1 Except as may be otherwise specifically stated in
          this Contract, Contractor shall be deemed to have
          inspected, and to have assumed the risk of loss and
          expense which may arise as a result of conditions at
          Site including subsurface conditions, which, are or
          could have been reasonably expected to occur during the
          course of the Work, and including without limitation,
          labor conditions at Site and the need to coordinate the
          Work with that of others.  OWNER MAKES NO

          employees, officers, directors, shareholders, agents,
          representatives, successors and assigns harmless from
          and against all demands, claims, cost, damage,
          attorneys fees, settlements and expenses resulting from
          any actual or claimed violation of any and all laws and
          any and all rules, regulations and orders of public

          Federal, State or Local including, but not limited to,
          safety, building and wiring codes, wages, unemployment
          compensation, workmen's compensation and social
          security laws; and Contractor shall file all reports,
          pay all taxes, fees and charges required by such laws,
          rules, regulations or orders and shall without
          reimbursement indemnify Owner and any affiliates,
          lessors, partners, joint venturers of Owner and their
          respective employees, officers, directors,
          shareholders, agents, representatives, successors and
          assigns against all liabilities and penalties by reason
          of any failure on the part of Contractor to comply with
          any such laws, orders, rules and regulations, to the
          maximum extent permitted by law.  Contractor certifies
          compliance with the "Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938"

          secure and pay for all permits, licenses and easements
          for permanent structures and all necessary authorities,
          permits, licenses, priorities and clearances required
          to be produced by or in the name of the Owner for
          prosecution of the Work, provided, however, Contractor
          shall obtain all necessary contractor's licenses and
          other permits normally obtained by a contractor in the
          ordinary course of its business.

13.0 INSPECTION AND REJECTION OF MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP

          13.1 The Work, including materials and workmanship,
          performed is subject to inspection and tests by Owner
          at any reasonable times, at any and all places where
          such manufacture or performance is carried out.
          Advance notice of readiness for inspection shall be
          given as specified in the Contract within the time
          specified or otherwise not less than two (2) nor more
          than four (4) working days.  Failure to make any
          inspection or test or to discover any defects or to
          object thereto shall not prejudice or operate as a
          release or waiver of the rights of Owner including the
          right to inspect or reject such Work at a later time,
          nor shall it release Contractor.  Unless otherwise
          specified herein, Contractor shall furnish, at its
          expense such facilities as may be necessary for the
          making of such inspection and tests.  Contractor shall
          bear the expense of uncovering and recovering Work
          specifically or customarily subject to prior inspection
          hereunder if such Work is covered without Owner's
          consent before an inspection is made.

          13.2 If Owner orders the uncovering of Work not
          specifically subject to prior inspection hereunder or
          not customarily subject to inspection, Owner shall bear
          the reasonable direct cost of uncovering and redoing
          the affected Work unless any defects or non-compliance
          with the Contract is found, in which case all costs
          shall be borne by Contractor.

          13.3 Owner reserves the right to expedite at
          Contractor's expense, Contractor-furnished materials as
          required to assist Contractor in meeting the specified
          Contract completion date.  Contractor's obligation
          includes the furnishing of such information and such
          access to Contractor's or its suppliers facilities as
          Owner or its designees may require.


14.0 CLAIMS, ASSIGNMENTS, GARNISHMENT AND ATTACHMENTS

          14.1 Contractor shall not assign this Contract or any
          of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
          prior written consent of Owner, which consent may be
          withheld in Owner's sole discretion, and any assignment
          attempted without such consent shall be void to the
          extent it can be made so by contract.  No assignment
          shall be attempted without seven (7) days prior actual
          notice to Owner (and any assignment without such notice
          is void to the extent it can be made so by contract),
          as a condition to the effectiveness of any assignment,
          except as otherwise permitted by law notwithstanding
          this provision, and in any case, as a condition to the
          satisfaction of any claim including without limitation
          any claim with respect to an assignment permitted by
          law notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition.  Owner
          may require a hold harmless agreement, a full release
          and indemnity and a bond satisfactory to Owner from
          Contractor.

          14.2 In any case, including an assignment effective
          notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition, or in the
          event of any claim, attachment or garnishment, Owner
          shall have, in addition to any other rights under this
          Contract, the right to take one or more of the
          following actions:

                    a)   with such notice, if any, as Owner deems
               reasonable to make payment to Contractor as
               exclusive agent of any garnishor, assignee or
               claimant notwithstanding any such assignment,
               garnishment or claim;

                    b)   to set off a counterclaim against
               Contractor or its assignee or any garnishor,
               claimant or entity with respect to the amount
               involved, notwithstanding the fact that such set
               off or counterclaim may arise out of the
               transaction or occurrence unrelated to this
               Contract, whether it occurs or arises before or
               after the date of such assignment or notice
               thereof;

                    c)   to recover in whole or part as Owner may
               elect from Contractor or out of any amount
               claimed, assigned, attached or garnished or out of
               any amount theretofore or thereafter owed to
               Contractor all damages, costs, and expenses
               incurred in relation to such claim, assignment,
               garnishment or attachment, including court costs
               and attorneys' fees;

                    d)   to withhold any and all amounts until it
               is certain in its sole judgment to whom such funds
               should be paid without liability on the part of
               Owner, in any event, to pay such sum more than
               once;

                    e)   to exercise each and every right
               stipulated in this Contract including the right to
               withhold;

                    f)   to require as a condition to payment a
               full and complete release in favor of Owner, in
               form and substance satisfactory to Owner from each
               and every person or entity which in its sole
               judgment may be a claimant to such payment or any
               other payment paid or due or thereafter paid or
               due to Contractor.

15.0 SUBCONTRACTS

          15.1 Contractor shall not subcontract any part of the
          Work (including the provisions of principal items of
          materials or equipment) without the prior written
          approval of the Owner, and in each individual instance,
          the scope of the Work to be subcontracted will be
          subject to the prior written approval of Owner.
          Approval by Owner of a subcontract shall not relieve
          Contractor of any of its obligations under the
          Contract.  Contractor shall furnish information
          regarding its subcontractors as Owner may reasonably
          request.  No subcontract shall bind or purport to bind
          Owner, but each subcontract shall contain a provision
          permitting assignment to Owner upon Owner's written
          request.


16.0 DRAWINGS PREPARED BY THE OWNER

          16.1 Drawings issued by the Owner may be furnished in
          various stages of development.  For example:  Rev. A,
          B, C, etc. for preliminary drawings...or, Rev. 0, 1, 2,
          etc. for drawings "Approved for Construction".  All
          drawings are subject to revision at any time.  In all
          instances the drawing which is assigned the highest
          revision designation will be considered the Contract
          drawing and the Work shall be performed by Contractor
          in accordance with that drawing.  Preliminary drawings
          shall not be used to perform fabrication or
          construction.

          16.2 Contractor, on receipt of a revised drawing, is
          responsible to immediately note what revisions have
          occurred and to decide if those revisions will have any
          impact on the cost or time required to perform the
          Work.  If Owner has not been notified as hereinafter
          provided for changed and extra Work, it will be
          understood by the parties that no adjustment is
          required either to the Contract Price or to the
          schedule established for performance of the Work.

17.0 CHANGED AND EXTRA WORK

          17.1 Owner may order changes in the Work from time to
          time.  If Contractor anticipates such changes will
          involve extra cost to Contractor or will adversely
          affect the Work, Contractor shall so advise Owner in
          writing not later than two (2) working days after the
          change is ordered.  Promptly thereafter, but in any
          event within two weeks after the change is ordered,
          Contractor shall notify Owner in such detail as is
          reasonable of the effect of the change on time,
          performance and/or cost of the Work.  If such notices
          are not so given it shall be deemed that no additional
          compensation or other adjustment in favor of Contractor
          is due Contractor.  If such notices are given or if, in
          the opinion of Owner, such change involves a reduction
          in the amount of expense of Contractor, Owner and
          Contractor shall endeavor to agree upon an adjustment
          to the affected terms of the Contract, including the
          Contract Price.  Increases in the Contract Price or
          reductions in Contractor's obligations agreed to by
          Owner will only be effective if made by a Contract
          Amendment signed by Owner and Contractor.  The
          adjustment to the Contract Price will be made on the
          following basis:

                     (a) To the extent applicable, such
               adjustment shall be made upon the basis of cost
               provisions and unit prices set out in this
               Contract.

                     (b) Other adjustments to the extent of any
               not covered by the preceding subparagraph (a)
               shall be limited to adjustments to take into
               account only Contractor's direct costs plus a
               reasonable amount to cover overhead and profit.

          17.2 If so directed by Owner in writing, Contractor
          shall proceed with the change prior to the time the
          amount of any price or other required adjustment is
          determined and the parties shall thereafter use
          diligent, good faith efforts to reach mutual agreement
          of the points on which they have not agreed.  If the
          point involves compensation, Owner may pay Contractor,
          without prejudice to any claim by either party, the
          amount of adjustment which, in Owner's judgment is
          appropriate, based on the facts then known to it.  This
          provision shall not be construed to reduce or limit
          Owner's rights or remedies under this or any other
          provision including the right to recover overpayments.

          17.3 Increases in the Contract Price to the extent they
          are on cost reimbursable or unit price basis shall be
          reimbursed as specifically provided in this Contract,
          and in the absence of such a provision, promptly after
          submission of an invoice satisfactory to Owner with
          support satisfactory to Owner in the month following
          that in which the costs are paid or units furnished, as
          the case may be.  Increases in the Contract Price to
          the extent done on a fixed amount basis, including fee,
          shall be paid in monthly installments which, in the
          judgment of Owner are proportionate to the progress of
          the changed part of the Work during the calendar month
          preceding that in which each payment is made, and shall
          be subject to a retention proportionate to the
          retention otherwise specified in this contract.


18.0 CONTRACT TIME AND COMPLETION OF WORK

          18.1 The Contract is effective (the AContract Time@)
          from the Effective Date as set forth in the Contract
          Agreement for the period set forth in the Contract
          Agreement or until the completion of the Work specified
          in the Contract Agreement, whichever is sooner, subject
          to the Owner=s and Contractor=s rights to terminate
          this Contract in accordance with Section 21, Section
          22, and/or Section 23 or to their respective rights to
          extend the Contract Time in accordance with Section 28.

               The Work shall be completed by the time or times,
          and in the sequence, specified in the Contract
          Agreement or in Contractor's schedule approved in
          writing by the Owner.  To the extent there are no such
          schedules, the times and sequences may be fixed by the
          Owner whose judgment, if reasonable in relation to the
          performance of the Contract Price, shall prevail.

               The Contract Price shall be deemed to include all
          sums required to meet such completion date.  If so
          directed by Owner, Contractor shall without additional
          charge, work such overtime and shall take such other
          action as is practically possible to avoid, or,
          otherwise, to minimize the effects of delays.

          18.2 No promise, representation or warranty shall be
          deemed to be made to Contractor by reason of Owner's
          specification of the time or times for completion.


19.0 CORRECTION OF DEFECTIVE WORK

          19.1 Any Work not performed in accordance with the
          drawings and specifications or with the intent thereof,
          or of this Contract, and not approved in writing by a
          representative of Owner, shall be corrected immediately
          without delay in the progress of the Work at no
          additional cost to Owner.  Corrections to defective
          Work must be done within the terms and conditions of
          the Contract.


20.0 DELAYS

          20.1 Contractor shall, in writing, promptly and in no
          event later than three (3) working days after
          Contractor should have foreseen the delay, advise, and
          thereafter keep advised, Owner of the nature of,
          reasons for, expected duration and other material
          information concerning any delay or additional delay in
          the Work.  Without limitation, Contractor shall not be
          excused from delay from any causes (a) foreseen or
          foreseeable at the time the Contract Agreement is
          signed or, (b) normal incident to the Work or (c) due
          to any act or omission of the Contractor.  Contractor
          shall make diligent efforts to remove any preventing or
          delaying cause and to fulfill all other obligations,
          including any obligations which are hindered but not
          prevented thereby, and shall resume performance as soon
          as reasonably practical.

          20.2 Except for delays falling within the categories
          above mentioned, if the delay results from Force
          Majeure as hereinafter defined or, from other reasons
          including acts of Owner which as a matter of law
          excuses Contractor from performance within the time
          specified and if the Contractor complies with the
          notice provisions of this Section, Contractor's time
          for completion shall be extended to the extent of such
          delay, but this shall be its sole remedy for such delay
          except for delay caused by the direct default of Owner
          in which event Contractor shall be entitled, to the
          extent the costs are so caused, and provided that the
          Contractor thereafter handles the matter as a change
          under the provision of Section 17.0, Changed and Extra
          Work, to recover its provable additional direct field
          costs, but this shall be the limit of the Contractor's
          remedy in such case.

21.0 FORCE MAJEURE

          21.1 Neither party shall be considered in default in
          the performance of its obligations hereunder to the
          extent that performance of such obligations are
          delayed, hindered, or prevented by Force Majeure.
          Force Majeure shall be any cause beyond the control of
          the parties hereto which they could not reasonably have
          foreseen and guarded against.  Force Majeure includes,
          but not limited to, acts of God, strikes, lockouts,
          fires, riots, civil commotion or civil unrest,
          incendiarism, interference by civil or military
          authorities, compliance with the regulations or orders
          of any governmental authorities, and acts of war
          (declared or undeclared).


22.0 SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE

          22.1 Owner reserves the right to suspend or terminate
          the Contract at any time for its convenience.  Such
          suspension or termination will be made in writing and
          may include the whole or any specified part of the
          Contract.

          22.2 If the Contract, or a specified part thereof, is
          suspended for convenience of the Owner and such
          suspension unreasonably delays the progress of the Work
          and causes additional expense or loss to Contractor in
          performance of the Work, not due to the fault or
          negligence of the Contractor, the Contract Price will
          be subject to adjustment in an amount equal to the
          actual cost incurred plus field overhead (excluding
          profit) by Contractor resulting from the suspension.
          Such costs must be substantiated by written records or
          otherwise proven to the satisfaction of the Owner.
          Further, the time of performance of the Contract will
          be subject to extension by the actual duration of the
          suspension (if applicable) plus a reasonable additional
          period for remobilization.  The Contract will,
          accordingly, be amended by Contract Amendment,
          provided, however, that any claim by Contractor for any
          adjustment hereunder must be asserted within thirty
          (30) calendar days after receipt of written notice to
          resume the Work.

          22.3 If the Contract, or any specified part hereof, is
          terminated for the convenience of the Owner, payment to
          Contractor will be made promptly for that part of the
          Work actually completed including:  (a) engineering;
          plus (b) material or equipment under fabrication in
          Contractor's own plant; plus (c) materials or equipment
          under fabrication in subcontractors' plants; plus (d)
          materials or equipment which have already been shipped;
          plus, (e) construction, if any, completed to date on
          Site; less any payments previously made to the
          Contractor.  The reasonable value of each of the
          foregoing categories against which the Contractor has
          incurred costs prior to the effective termination date
          will be established by:  (i) the Contract Price(s);
          (ii) any Contract Unit Prices or breakdown of the
          Contract Price previously submitted by the Contractor;
          (iii) written cost records submitted by Contractor and
          accepted by Owner; or, a combination of the foregoing
          data.

               Contractor shall include in each subcontract the
          right of unilateral written cancellation with or
          without cause, by Contractor of all or any portion of
          such subcontract.  A reasonable cancellation charge to
          Contractor by any subcontractor or vendor, and properly
          due as a contractual obligation of Contractor to the
          subcontractor or vendor for items fabricated but not
          shipped, will be reimbursed to Contractor at actual
          cost as part of the costs of termination, or, in lieu
          thereof, Owner may elect to pay the fair market value
          and take delivery on such completed or incompleted
          fabricated items.

               In addition thereto, the Contractor will be paid a
          reasonable cancellation charge to cover costs, if any,
          to terminate engineering and fabrication commenced by
          its own forces prior to the effective termination date.

               Material and equipment completely or partially
          fabricated but not shipped may, at the option of the
          Owner, be accepted by the Owner at fair market value
          and deducted from the cancellation charges established
          with Contractor.


23.0 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE

          23.1 Should Contractor, in the opinion of Owner, at any
          time refuse or neglect to supply or maintain a
          sufficiency of properly skilled labor, or fail in any
          respect to prosecute the Work or any separable portion
          thereof with promptness and diligence, or fail in the
          performance of any of the agreements on its part
          contained herein, or should the Contractor become
          insolvent or be placed in liquidation or under judicial
          management or have a judgment or order entered against
          it affecting a substantial part of its assets, Owner
          may, after forty-eight (48) hours written notice to the
          Contractor employ another Contractor and deduct the
          cost thereof from any money due or thereafter to become
          due Contractor under this Contract, and/or Owner may
          terminate Contractor's right to proceed with the Work
          or such part of the Work as to which such defaults have
          occurred.

               In the event of termination for cause, the
          Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further
          payment until the Work is finished.  If the expense of
          finishing the Work plus compensation for additional
          managerial and administrative services and such other
          costs and damages with regard to completion of the Work
          as the Owner may suffer exceeds the unpaid balance,
          Contractor and its sureties, if any, shall promptly pay
          the difference to Owner.  Failure of Owner to exercise
          any of the rights given under this clause shall not
          excuse Contractor from compliance with the provisions
          of the Contract nor prejudice in any way the right to
          exercise any such rights in respect of any subsequent
          failure by Contractor.

     23.2 Upon termination of the Contract for cause it is
     agreed:

                    23.2.1    That the obligations of Contractor
               shall continue as to work already performed and to
               materials furnished, and as to bona fide
               obligations assumed by Contractor prior to the
               date of termination.

                    23.2.2    That the Contractor shall be
               entitled only to a pro rata compensation for the
               Work already performed, including material for
               which it has made firm contracts, it being
               understood that the Owner shall be entitled to
               that material.  It is understood, however, that
               Contractor's aforesaid pro-rata compensation shall
               in no event exceed the reasonable costs of Work
               done and materials supplied by Contractor to the
               time of termination plus an equitable profit on
               Work done prior to the date of termination, less
               any amounts deducted in accordance with this
               Section.

                         The following items will not be
               considered in arriving at said equitable
               allowance:

                         a.   Anticipated profits applicable to
               incomplete portions of the Work

                         b.   Consequential damages.

                         c.   Expenses of Contractor due to
                    failure of the Contractor or its vendors and
                    subcontractors to discontinue the Work with
                    reasonable promptness after written notice of
                    termination has been given to the Contractor.

                         d.   Losses on other contracts or from
                              sales or exchange of capital assets.

     23.3 No settlement payment will be made to Contractor
     hereunder, until Contractor has submitted:

              a final statement supported by vouchers; and

              a signed form of release or other evidence
            satisfactory to Owner that Contractor has paid in
            full for all labor, materials, equipment, services,
            subcontracts, applicable taxes, and other costs and
            assessments due under this Contract.

          23.4 Owner shall be entitled to deduct from any and all
          monies owing to Contractor hereunder, any and all
          damages or additional expenses caused by or arising out
          of breach by the Contractor of any of its agreements,
          covenants, warranties, and guarantees hereunder, or, of
          any default by the Contractor.

          23.5 In the event of termination for cause, written
          notice will be given to Contractor in accordance with
          the provisions set forth in the Contract Agreement
          under NOTICES.  Subject to the directions set forth in
          the termination notice, Contractor shall immediately
          discontinue the Work and the placing of orders for
          further services, material and equipment and shall, as
          directed, effect cancellation of all existing orders
          and subcontracts and thereafter perform only such Work
          as may be necessary to preserve and protect the Work
          already in progress.

          23.6 The termination provision set forth in this
          Article shall be concurrent with and in addition to,
          without prejudice to, and not in lieu of, or in
          substitution for, any other rights or remedies at law
          or in equity which the Owner may have for the
          enforcement of its rights under the Contract and its
          remedies for any default of the Contractor under the
          conditions hereof.

          23.7 If Owner should incorrectly and in good faith
          terminate this Contract for default as herein provided
          or for breach, this shall be deemed to be a termination
          by Owner for reasons other than cause, and payment
          shall be made as in the case of termination for
          convenience.  In no event shall the Owner's liability
          or Contractor's recovery under this Article exceed the
          total amount determined by application of Section 22.3
          hereof.


24.0 PATENTS AND SIMILAR RIGHTS

          24.1 Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Owner
          and any applicable lessors, partners or joint venturers
          of Owner, and their respective employees, officers,
          directors, shareholders, agents, representatives,
          attorneys, successors and assigns from all cost,
          damage, loss and expense as a result of any
          infringement or claim of infringement of any patent or
          proprietary right (including costs of litigation) and
          for changes or replacement and related costs for
          changes or replacement and related costs to avoid
          infringements arising from performance of the Work.  At
          Owner's request, Contractor shall defend any suit or
          action arising out of any such infringement or claim
          but the Owner shall be entitled to be fully advised and
          to participate in any such suit or action.  No such
          suit or action shall be settled, discontinued, nor
          shall judgment be permitted to be entered if, in
          Owner's sole opinion, its interest would be adversely
          affected.  Contractor's indemnification does not extend
          to items manufactured to the Owner's design unless
          originally submitted or suggested by the Contractor.

25.0 WARRANTY

          25.1 In addition to any other Contractor warranties,
          expressed or implied by law, Contractor warrants that
          all items and services will be in accordance with this
          Contract and conform to the Specifications, Drawings
          and data which are part of it or with which it
          obligates Contractor to comply; that, except with
          respect only to any items, services or other Work
          performed in accordance with specifications provided by
          Owner, they will be fit for the use specified or
          intended; and that all materials and workmanship shall
          be of first quality and the best of their kinds.
          Without limitation of Owner's other rights and
          remedies, in cases where this warranty is breached, or
          where defects or deficiencies appear prior to twelve
          (12) months after date of letter of Final Acceptance
          and Contractor does not within the time limits set by
          Owner promptly begin and diligently complete the repair
          of the defect in accordance with Owner's required
          schedule, Owner at its option may either reject the
          items in whole or in part in which case to the extent
          of rejection the risk of loss, cost of repair, cost of
          return and storage and other damages including costs of
          replacement from such sources as Owner may elect will
          be for the Contractor's account; or the Owner at its
          option may repair all or part of the items not rejected
          and charge to the Contractor damages including the
          costs incurred for or in relation to repairs plus an
          amount equal to the diminished value of the items as
          repaired.

          25.2 Contractor shall include in all subcontracts
          entered into under this Contract an identical warranty
          extending to Contractor and Owner, and as part of its
          responsibilities hereunder shall enforce such
          warranties to their fullest extent, however, Contractor
          shall remain responsible for and not be excused from
          its obligations pursuant to this Contract, including
          its warranty obligations, in the event any
          subcontractor fails to perform its obligations.


26.0 CONTRACT PAYMENTS

          26.1 Contractor agrees to accept the Contract Price as
          full compensation for all Work embraced in the Contract
          and for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of
          the Work, the action of the elements, or from any
          unforeseen or unknown difficulties or obstructions
          which may arise or be encountered in the prosecution of
          the Work until its acceptance, and for all risks of
          every description connected with the Work.

          26.2 Owner will make partial payments as the Work
          progresses.  Payments will only be made on receipt of
          invoices accurately prepared and properly supported in
          accordance with procedures established by the Owner and
          exhibits attached hereto.

          26.3 Ten percent (10%) retention will be withheld from
          each progress payment.  The retention will be released
          by Owner upon full completion of the Work by Contractor
          and issue of Final Acceptance by Owner.  Contractor,
          shall, prior to release of retention by Owner, furnish
          a release of claims form certifying that Contractor has
          paid in full for all wages, materials, services, taxes,
          social benefit laws and other like costs.

          26.4 Payments may be withheld on account of suspected
          or defective work not remedied, claims filed (or
          reasonable evidence indicating the probability of
          filing of claims) or, failure of Contractor to make
          payments properly to his suppliers or for material or
          labor.   If the foregoing causes are removed, the
          withheld payments will promptly be made.  If the said
          causes are not removed on written notice, Owner may
          cause the same to be rectified at Contractor's expense.
          Should any valid indebtedness arise after final payment
          is made, the Contractor shall reimburse Owner for any
          amount the Owner has paid or may pay to discharge any
          such indebtedness or any claim affecting the title to
          the Work or the Owner's property plus Owner's
          attorneys' fees, costs and expenses.

          26.5 Failure or lack of cooperation by the Contractor
          to prepare or submit reports, progress schedules, or
          plans for changes contemplated in his operations, or to
          assist in preparation of same, promptly as required,
          shall be cause for the Owner to withhold all or part of
          the progress payment then pending until such time as
          Contractor has met the requirement to the satisfaction
          of the Owner.

          26.6 Monies due Owner under the terms of the Contract
          to compensate Owner for backcharges as provided in
          Section 29.0 or other expenses incurred on behalf of
          the Contractor will be recorded in writing, and
          whenever possible, deducted as they occur from each
          periodic progress payment to Contractor.

          26.7 No payment except the final payment, shall be
          evidence of performance of the Contract either wholly
          or in part and no payment, including the final payment,
          shall be construed to be an acceptance of defective
          Work or improper material.  The final payment shall not
          relieve the Contractor from responsibility for the
          discharge of claims or from making available to Owner
          for examination and audit all records pertaining to
          work performed on a cost-reimbursable or chargeable
          basis.


27.0 WORK AUTHORIZATION

          27.1 Owner will utilize a written Work Authorization to
          direct Contractor to proceed in instances where the
          processing of a formal Contract Amendment may delay
          progress of the Work.

               A Work Authorization will be used on occasions
               where:

              Work, minor in scope, must be immediately
              authorized at the Site; or,

              Construction must proceed concurrent with the
            preparation of an estimate of cost to perform the
            Work.

               In some instances, the Work Authorization may be
          utilized to direct Contractor to proceed pending
          resolution of a dispute over whether or not the work
          actually comprises a contract change or involves extra
          work.


28.0 CONTRACT AMENDMENTS

          28.1 The Contract Price established in the Contract
          Agreement is not subject to change except as expressly
          provided in the Contract or by amendment to the
          Contract in the form of a Contract Amendment signed by
          Contractor and Owner.  Unit price and cost-plus type
          contracts containing an estimated Contract Price will
          in all cases prior to presentation of a final invoice
          by Contractor, be summarized by Contract Amendment to
          confirm the final Contract Price.

          28.2 Amendments to the Contract shall bind Owner only
          if made by a written document which both states that it
          amends the Contract and is signed by a designated
          representative of Owner.

          28.3 The Contract Time can be extended or shortened by
          mutual agreement, in writing by Owner and Contractor.


29.0 BACKCHARGES BY OWNER

          29.1 Owner reserves the right in event of inability or
          refusal on the part of a Contractor or subcontractor to
          correct defective or incomplete work, or to perform any
          part of the work in a timely manner, to perform such
          work with its own forces or those of another contractor
          and charge the resultant costs as a backcharge against
          the Contract Price pursuant to the following
          procedures:

                    a.   Notification:  Contractor will be
               promptly notified by telephone, cable or other
               form of direct communication, and, whenever
               possible, through its appointed representative.

                    b.   Opportunity:  Whenever time will permit,
               Contractor will be afforded a reasonable
               opportunity to perform the work with its own
               forces.  However, Owner reserves for itself the
               decision of how and when to proceed.

                    c.   Written Notice:  Contractor will be
               notified in writing by a Notice of Backcharge.

                    d.   Labor and Equipment:  Labor and
               construction equipment will be backcharged at
               actual cost to Owner plus 25% administrative and
               handling costs.

                    e.   Owner Equipment:  Equipment owned by
               Owner and used for the backcharged work will be
               charged at the full AED (Associated Equipment
               Distributors) equipment rental rate for same or
               equal equipment.  Operators and other Owner-
               employed labor will be charged at prevailing
               project hourly rates plus 25% administrative and
               handling costs.

                    f.   Material and Subcontracts:  Material and
               subcontracts will be backcharged on the basis of
               actual invoiced cost plus 20% administrative and
               handling costs.

                    g.   Other Costs:  Except in the case of an
               emergency or other unanticipated event which
               causes a change in costs, Owner shall use
               reasonable efforts to notify Contractor in advance
               of other costs, if any, to be incurred by Owner.
               If no agreement is concluded from such
               notification, Owner will backcharge the Contract
               Price as specified above for material and
               subcontracts.

                    h.   Records:  All work performed as a
               backcharge against the Contract will be recorded
               by Owner on a daily basis.  In instances where the
               Contractor's representative is at the site, the
               representative's signature will be requested.  In
               no event shall the absence of Contractor's
               representative or his refusal to sign the
               Backcharge Notice or any daily records delay
               performance of work which Owner considers
               necessary to continuation and completion of the
               Project.

                    i.   Payment:  The sum total of the amounts
               backcharged will be the total of all of the above
               charges. Owner may deduct the backcharged amounts
               periodically as they are incurred or in one final
               sum when the work is complete and all costs have
               been accounted for.


30.0 FINAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE WORK

          30.1 Final Acceptance of the Work will be confirmed by
          a formal letter of Final Acceptance issued by the Owner
          and affirmed by signature of the Owner promptly after
          Owner is satisfied that all requirements of the
          Contract have been met with regard to performance of
          the Work which shall include issuance of all government
          approvals, permits or certifications; mechanical
          acceptance, performance of equipment in accordance with
          warranties; delivery of material, equipment and spare
          parts; submittal of special guarantees and operating
          procedures; submittal of final records for cost-plus
          work (if any); and, presentation of a final release of
          claims forms and any other items reasonably required by
          Owner.

          30.2 Contractor agrees that the Owner may retain the
          final payment and/or the retained percentage provided
          for in the Contract Agreement, to the full total or a
          partial amount thereof as considered by Owner to be
          reasonable to assure full compliance by the Contractor
          with the Contract.

          30.3 The Work performed hereunder may be accepted as a
          whole or in separately defined parts, in which case any
          funds retained will be reduced in accordance with the
          pro rata value of those accepted parts.  In the event
          the letter of Final Acceptance covers all of the Work
          the letter will state... "All work under the Contract
          is accepted," and the letter will be marked "FINAL
          ACCEPTANCE".

          30.4 Contractor's warranties after Final Acceptance
          will extend for twelve (12) months from date of Final
          Acceptance.


31.0 RELEASE AND WAIVER OF CLAIMS

          31.1 Owner will require as a prior condition to final
          payment a full release and waiver of claims form and
          reserves the right, at its discretion prior to any
          interim progress payment(s) to Contractor, to require a
          release and waiver of claims forms for (partial)
          payment for monies earned under the Contract through a
          specified date.

          31.2 If at any time there is evidence of the existence
          of any claim arising out of or in connection with the
          performance, or default in performance, of this
          Contract for which Owner might be or become liable, the
          Owner shall have the right to discharge such claims and
          assess all costs thereof against the balance due
          Contractor.


32.0 COST-REIMBURSABLE WORK - ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

          32.1 If any part of the Work is performed on a cost-
          reimbursable or chargeable basis, the Contractor shall
          keep and require each of its subcontractors or vendors
          to keep full and detailed accounts of all such costs in
          a form acceptable to the Owner.

          32.2 In the event that work is to be performed on a
          reimbursable or chargeable basis, Owner will include as
          part of the Contract, special terms and conditions
          setting forth all chargeable and nonchargeable cost
          items and procedures for the payment of costs and
          Contractor's fees related thereto.

          32.3 Contractor shall at all times cooperate with the
          Owner to amend or change any accounting procedure for
          cost-plus work found to be unsatisfactory, and
          Contractor, after agreement on accounting procedures
          with the Owner, shall not institute any new accounting
          procedure without prior written approval of the Owner.

          32.4 Contractor shall retain all reimbursable or
          chargeable accounting records for a period of two (2)
          years after Final Acceptance of the Work and during
          execution of the Work shall, at any time, afford such
          persons as Owner authorizes full access to audit and
          books of account and supporting documents.  On
          completion of the Work, Contractor agrees that copies
          of books or records for cost-reimbursable work will, on
          request, be turned over to the Owner.


33.0 LOSS OR DAMAGE BY ACTIONS OF OTHERS

          33.1 If the Contractor sustains damage or loss through
          any delay, default, act or omission of any other
          contractors, subcontractors, or their agents or
          employees, Owner shall not be liable therefor; but
          nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit
          the Contractor from pursuing its legal remedies against
          such other contractor or subcontractors, or their
          agents or employees.

          33.2 Contractor shall have no claim against the Owner
          for damage or loss by reasons of delay, default, act or
          omission of other contractors, subcontractors or their
          agents or employees, but nothing herein contained shall
          limit any rights of Contractor to recover therefor
          against such other contractors, subcontractors or their
          agents or employees.  If the Contractor by any default,
          negligence or misconduct on its part, damages any other
          subcontractor or contractor, it hereby agrees to be
          directly responsible to such other subcontractor or
          contractor for any such damage and to save, defend,
          indemnify and hold harmless Owner and any affiliates,
          lessors, partners or joint venturers of Owner and their
          respective employees, officers, directors,
          shareholders, agents, representatives, attorneys,
          successors and assigns for all such claims and damages.

34.0 DISPUTES

          34.1 It is the general intention of the parties that
          any dispute relating to this Contract shall be settled,
          to the extent feasible, before a single forum selected
          by Owner, and a decision by such forum with respect to
          any such question or matter shall be binding on
          Contractor, provided that it has been granted a
          reasonable opportunity to be represented and heard.  To
          this end:

                    a.   At Owner's written election, all
               disputes and controversies of whatever nature
               arising under this Contract that cannot be
               resolved by mutual agreement, may be submitted to
               arbitration in accordance with rules of the
               American Arbitration Association to a panel of
               three (3) arbitrators.  The place of arbitration
               shall be the municipality which, in the opinion of
               Owner, is most reasonably convenient to the Site.

                    b.   If Owner does not elect arbitration, or
               if any dispute involves third parties, the dispute
               shall at the option of the Owner be submitted to
               the forum which in Owner's opinion can best
               determine and settle most aspects of such dispute
               and the decision of that forum shall be binding on
               the parties, provided that they have been given
               notice and the opportunity for adequate
               representation.

                    c.   In the event of any proceeding pursuant
               to this Section, the parties shall take action to
               see that proceedings before any other forum shall
               be stayed pending completion of these proceedings.
               The decision with respect to proceedings pursuant
               to this Section shall be binding upon the parties.
               The parties shall thereafter dismiss from the
               other forum any claims to the extent such claims
               are resolved by such decision.

                    d.   Contractor hereby consents to such
               service and to submit itself to such jurisdiction
               as is necessary to effect the purposes of this
               Section, and further hereby agrees to and consents
               to such stays and other actions necessary to
               effect the purposes hereof.

                    e.   For the purposes of this Section, a
               "forum" includes arbitration or administrative
               proceeding.

                    f.   In the event of any dispute or claim by
               Contractor, Contractor shall continue the Work in
               accordance with the Contract and its sole remedy
               shall be to pursue the remedies hereinabove set
               forth.

          34.2 EACH OF CONTRACTOR AND OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES AND
          AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER ANY OF
          THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS OR WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK WILL
          BE BASED UPON DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ISSUES AND THAT IF
          AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
          SUCH CONTROVERSY IS NOT SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION AS
          PROVIDED HEREIN, SUCH MATTER SHALL BE TRIED BY A JUDGE
          AND WITHOUT A JURY.

          35.1 Contractor shall not discriminate against any
          employee or applicant for employment because of race,
          religion, color, sex, or national origin.  Contractor
          shall take affirmative action to insure that all
          applicants are employed, and that employees are treated
          during employment without regard to their race, color,
          religion, sex, disability or national origin.  Such
          action shall include, but not be limited to the

          transfer; recruitment advertising; layoff or
          termination; rates of pay or other forms of
          compensation; and selection for training, including
          apprenticeship.  Contractor agrees to post in
          conspicuous places, available to employees and
          applicants for employment, notices setting forth the
          provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.
          Contractor shall, in all solicitations or
          advertisements for employees placed by Contractor or on
          Contractor's behalf, state that all employment is
          without regard to race, religion, color, sex,
          disability or national origin.

          35.2 Contractor shall comply with all provisions of
          Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965
          (including amendments thereto), and of the rules,
          regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of
          Labor.  Contractor shall furnish all information and
          reports required by Executive Order No. 11246 of
          September 24, 1965 (including any amendments thereto),
          and by the rules, regulations, and orders of the
          Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to
          ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and
          orders.  In the event of Contractor's noncompliance
          with the nondiscrimination clauses of this Contract,
          this Contract may be cancelled, terminated, or
          suspended, in whole or in part and Contractor may be
          declared ineligible for further contracts in accordance
          with procedures authorized in Executive Order No. 11246
          of September 24, 1965 (including any amendments
          thereto), and such other sanctions may be imposed and
          remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order No.
          11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulations,
          or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise
          provided by law.  Contractor shall include the
          provision of this Article in every subcontract or
          purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations,
          orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to
          Section 204 of Executive Order No. 11246 of September
          24, 1965 (including any amendments thereto), so that
          such provisions will be binding upon each subcontract
          or purchase order as the Owner may direct as a means of
          enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for
          noncompliance; provided, however, that in the event
          Contractor becomes involved in, or threatened with,
          litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result
          of such direction by the Owner, Contractor may request
          the United States to enter into such litigation to
          protect the interests of the United States.  The
          foregoing obligations of Contractor shall include its
          obligation to comply with all amendments or additional
          rules, regulations and orders relating to Executive
          Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, adopted or

          and to cause strict compliance therewith by its
          subcontractors.

          36.2 Contractor shall obtain written authorization from
          the Owner to enter the Site with trucks and other
          vehicles and shall use only the entrances designated by

          Project.

          36.3 Contractor shall require its employees and the
          employees of its subcontractors to, at all times while

          Owner.

          36.4 Contractor agrees that it shall treat all designs,
          data and other information acquired under this Contract
          as confidential and shall not use the name of Owner or
          of any officer, director, employee or affiliated entity
          of Owner or of the Site in any press release,
          announcement, advertisement or publication, either
          verbal or in writing, or disclose any information
          whatsoever that it may obtain under or pursuant to this
          Contract to third parties or to the public without
          having first obtained the written approval of Owner as
          to the form and content of any such disclosure, release
          or publication.  Contractor further agrees not to use,
          sell, give, disclose or otherwise make available to
          third parties or to the public at any time any
          knowledge or information relating to internal

          mining, processing of minerals or any other proprietary
          information of Owner that Contractor may acquire and/or
          develop during the course of the Work.  The obligations
          of confidentiality of Contractor under this Section
          shall apply to each of the officers, employees, agents
          and subcontractors of the Contractor and shall survive
          the termination or expiration of this Contract and
          shall be fully effective and binding for a period of
          five  years thereafter.  Contractor on request of Owner
          shall execute any agreements relating to
          confidentiality or proprietary rights which Owner
          requires.


37.0 HYGIENE, FIRST AID AND SAFETY

          37.1 Contractor agrees to comply with all federal,
          state and local laws, regulations, rules and orders as
          amended from time to time and Contractor shall comply
          with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules,
          regulations, and orders of any public body having
          jurisdiction over the safety of persons or property and
          shall establish, erect and maintain all necessary
          safeguards for such safety.  Contractor shall train,
          furnish, require, and assure that all employees follow
          safe work procedures and wear appropriate and required
          safety equipment.  Contractor shall notify all persons,
          whether on or off the Site, when prosecution of the
          Work may affect them.

          37.2 The Contractor has been provided a copy of the
          Owner's safety manual.  The Owner's safety manual
          describes safety practices and procedures which Owner
          believes assist in the creation of a safe working
          environment.  Owner and Contractor recognize that other
          policies and procedures can also provide a safe working
          environment and further recognize the possibility of a
          need for additional policies and procedures specific to
          this operation.  For this reason, Contractor's
          principal safety office shall familiarize him/herself
          with, and shall thereafter be solely responsible for
          determining which , if any, provisions thereof are
          relevant, applicable or pertinent to the Work.  The
          Contractor's safety officer shall be responsible for
          the development and implementation of all safety
          procedures.

          37.3 Contractor shall designate a responsible member of
          its organization at the Site whose duty shall be the
          prevention of accidents and compliance with all safety
          requirements.  This person shall be competent and
          experienced in such matters and shall be the principal
          safety officer unless otherwise designated in writing
          by  Contractor to Owner.

          37.4 In the event of occurrence of a situation wherein
          life or valuable property are in apparent imminent
          danger, Contractor is hereby authorized without further
          special instructions from the Owner, to act at its own
          discretion to prevent injury to persons or damage to
          property.

          37.5 Contractor shall be responsible to provide its own
          first aid facilities and safety equipment.

          37.6 Contractor shall furnish to the Owner a detailed
          written report of all injuries other than those
          requiring only first aid treatment.

          37.7 Contractor bears sole responsibility under the law
          for the safety of its own personnel employed in the
          Work and for persons entering the Site as agents or
          visitors of the Contractor.

          37.8 Contractor shall comply with the Federal Mine
          Safety and Health Act of 1977 as now or hereafter
          amended and with all regulations and health and safety
          standards promulgated pursuant thereto (all of which
          are described hereinafter as "the Act").  Any citation,
          fine withdrawal order, abatement notice or other action
          by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
          arising in connection with the Contractor's performance
          under this Contract, which may affect the Owner's
          operations, shall constitute a breach of this Contract
          and shall be sufficient cause for termination of this
          Contract by the Owner at its sole option and without
          limiting any other rights or remedies the Owner may
          have.

               Contractor agrees that its operations are subject
          to the terms of the Act and that it will abide by all
          provisions of said Act.  It is recognized that
          substantial penalties can be levied for violations of
          the health and safety standards contained, or to be
          promulgated in the future, in the Act.  Contractor
          agrees that it is fully and completely responsible for
          payment of any and all fines which may be levied by
          MSHA as a result of such violations and will provide
          Owner proof of payment thereof.  The Contractor shall
          carry out the Work under the Contractor's individual
          MSHA identification number.

               Neither Contractor's compliance with the Act nor
          any supervision by the Owner which may be required as
          provided above shall derogate Contractor's status as an
          independent contractor otherwise created in this
          Contract.

          37.9 Contractor shall defend, indemnify and hold
          harmless Owner, and any of its affiliates, lessors,
          partners or joint venturers of Owner and their
          respective employees, officers, directors,
          shareholders, agents, representatives, attorneys,
          successors and assigns from all claims, damages, costs
          and expenses, including attorneys' fees in any
          proceeding brought against any of them, and from any
          liability imposed or attempted to be imposed on any of
          them by reason of any violation or alleged violation of
          any law, rule or regulation in connection with or
          arising out of any operation or activity over which
          Contractor has management, supervision or control.
          Owner shall cooperate with Contractor in the event that
          Contractor chooses to contest any citation under the
          Act or any other law, rules, orders, regulations,
          order, penalty or other enforcement action or liability
          in connection therewith in which Contractor is
          obligated to Owner under the terms of this Section
          37.0, it being further understood and agreed that any
          expenses incurred by Owner in so cooperating will be
          the obligation of Contractor.

          37.10     Contractor shall advise Owner as promptly as
          possible after receipt of any citation or order of
          withdrawal, or amendment, modification, determination
          or vacation thereof, issued as a result of any activity
          conducted by Contractor pursuant to this Contract, but
          in all cases, such notification to Owner shall be
          within twenty-four (24) hours of issuance.  Contractor
          shall furnish Owner a copy of each such citation or
          order of withdrawal or amendment, modification,
          termination or vacation thereof at the time Contractor
          notified Owner as required by this paragraph or as soon
          as reasonably possible thereafter.  Contractor shall
          promptly furnish Owner with copies of all documents
          filed with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review
          Commission ("Commission"), relating to the Work, as
          well as with any Commission order or decisions which
          may be issued, in connection with any such citation or
          order.

          37.11     Nothing in the terms of this Contract shall
          be interpreted to impose civil or criminal liability of
          any kind or nature whatsoever vicariously from
          Contractor to Owner.  Without limiting the
          aforementioned provision, Contractor shall assist and
          cooperate fully with Owner in defending or preparing to
          defend any federal or state civil or criminal
          enforcement action brought or which Owner believes may
          be brought, against Owner, Owner's officers, directors
          or agents, under the covenants of any federal or state
          or local law, regulation or ordinance, resulting from
          or connected with Contractor's performance or non-
          performance under this Contract.

38.0 TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTROL ACT

          38.1 Contractor shall comply with all requirements of
          applicable federal, state and local Health, Safety,
          Environmental Protection Regulations and the Toxic and
          Hazardous Material Control Acts and Regulations of
          federal, state and local government agencies (such as
          EPA, OSHA, MSHA, NRC and DOT).

          38.2 Labels and Safety Data Sheets for all toxic or
          hazardous material must be attached to or provided with
          this Contract.  Contractor's failure to conform to any
          of the above requirements in any respect shall be
          corrected promptly by the Contractor upon notice
          thereof, and the cost of such correction(s) as well as
          any related costs arising out of any action brought by
          a governmental agency in connection with such failure
          shall be for the account of Contractor.


39.0 TAXES

          39.1 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract
          Documents, all taxes which Contractor may be required
          to pay or collect are for the account of Contractor and
          shall be deemed to be included in the fixed Contract
          Price(s) or Contract Unit Price(s) set out in the
          Contract, whether or not they are required to be
          separately stated.


40.0 TITLE, ADVANCE PAYMENTS

          40.1 Title to all labor, material and plant equipment
          furnished by Contractor shall pass to the Owner upon
          delivery to the Site, the risk of loss shall not shift
          to the Owner until Final Acceptance.

          40.2 If payments are made by Owner prior to delivery or
          installation, or if Owner supplies items to be included
          in the Work, Owner may require that the goods in
          process be marked or otherwise identified, and
          Contractor shall execute such documents and take such
          action as in Owner's opinion are necessary to give
          Owner the exclusive right to take possession and title
          thereto at any time, as well as a security interest
          therein.

          40.3 No advance payment shall operate to relieve
          Contractor of risk of loss or any other obligations
          under this Contract.


41.0 OWNER'S REMEDIES FOR DEFAULT OR DEFECTIVE WORK

          41.1 In the event of any default or defective Work
          which Contractor does not, in the sole judgment of
          Owner, immediately begin, and thereafter proceed with
          diligence to remedy upon notice from Owner, or in the
          event of any defaults or defect which Owner in its sole
          judgment determines to be a material default or defect,
          or if Contractor for any reason (other than one for
          which it is entitled to an extension of time provided
          under "Delays") fails to proceed with the Work as
          scheduled in accordance with this Contract, Owner may
          take such action as in its sole judgment is advisable
          to remedy or to avoid such default to defect including
          proceeding with its own forces or those of others and
          taking possession and use of all equipment and material
          at the Site (all of which Contractor hereby agrees to
          leave for such purpose), and Contractor shall reimburse
          Owner for all additional costs which it may incur in
          connection with or as a result of such action.

          41.2 Alternatively, or in addition as Owner may from
          time to time elect, upon such defaults or defects or
          delay, or if the Contractor shall become bankrupt or
          insolvent or have an order or judgment entered against
          it which affects a substantial part of its assets, or
          if Owner shall have reasonable grounds to believe that
          Contractor is bankrupt or insolvent or unable to pay
          its debts as they become due, Owner may also terminate
          all or part of Contractor's further performance and/or
          further rights hereunder, as Owner may elect, and, at
          Owner's discretion proceed as provided in the preceding
          paragraph.

          41.3 In the event of any such default, defect, delay,
          order or judgment, bankruptcy or insolvency, Contractor
          shall not be entitled to any further payment until the
          matter is remedied to the satisfaction of Owner and
          shall then be paid only such amount as is reasonably
          due for work properly done by Contractor less all
          damages, loss and additional expense suffered by Owner
          as a result of such default.  If such damage, loss and
          expense shall exceed the amount due the Contractor,
          such amount shall be paid immediately to Owner by
          Contractor.  No remedy afforded to Owner either under
          this Contract or as a matter of law shall be deemed to
          be exclusive.


42.0 INSURANCE

          42.1 Contractor shall comply with all state and federal
          social security and unemployment insurance laws.
          Before commencing the Work, Contractor and its
          subcontractors shall be qualified under the Workmen's
          Compensation Law of the state where the Project will be
          constructed and shall at all times comply therewith.

          42.2 Contractor shall procure and maintain, during the
          period that this Contract remains in force, insurance
          coverage with limits of not less than those set forth
          in this clause.  Owner shall have the right to review
          the adequacy of such coverage on annual basis and
          require Contractor to obtain such additional types and
          amounts of coverage as it determines to be necessary or
          advisable.  Any increase in the cost of insurance due
          to such determination of Owner shall be a reimbursable
          expense of Contractor hereunder.  Contractor will
          require all insurance companies, issuing policies of
          insurance of Contractor, to certify to Owner, prior to
          commencement of any Work, that such policies have been
          issued and are currently in effect.  In the event any
          Work to be performed under this Contract is further
          sublet, the Contractor will require the same insurance
          coverage, from subcontractors.  Contractors will submit
          the Insurance Certificate of their subcontractors for
          approval of the Owner.

               Policies issued for Contractor shall be endorsed
          to include, for the benefit of the Owner, the
          following:

                    (a)  A ten (10) day advance written notice in
               the event of cancellation, non-renewal or material
               change of any policy.

                    (b)  Except as to Worker's Compensation
               insurance, the Owner shall be named as an
               additional insured.

                    (c)  Contractor's insurance shall be primary
               and any insurance maintained by Owner shall be
               considered excess and noncontributory.

               The minimum coverages and policy limits shall be:

               Insurance Coverage              Policy Limits
                                               
            Worker's Compensation              Statutory

               Owner, by requiring the foregoing minimum
          insurance coverages, will not be deemed to limit any of
          the other obligations or liabilities of Contractor.
          Deductibles, if any, will be for the account of
          Contractor.

          42.3 The Comprehensive General Liability Policy shall
          include Contractor coverage for Completed Operations,
          Blanket Contractual and Independent Contractors with

          Liability Policy naming Owner and any affiliates,
          lessors, partners or joint venturers of Owner and their
          respective employers, officers, directors,

          successors and assigns, as additional insureds.

          42.4 Contractor will procure and maintain until
          acceptance of the Work, all risk and Installation

          thereunder.  Such insurance will cover physical loss or
          damage to Contractor's Work, materials and equipment,
          including consumable supplies that are part of, result
          from, or are used in the Work.  Such insurance will not
          cover construction equipment, tools and facilities
          owned, leased or rented by Contractor which do not
          become a permanent part of the Work.

          42.5 Neither Contractor nor Owner, shall be liable one
          to another nor to the insurance carriers of such
          parties for any loss or damage to property resulting
          from or occurring in the course of the Work to the
          extent that reimbursement shall be made for any such
          loss or damage through or by reason of insurance
          provided for the purpose and, for this purpose, hereby
          waive any claim by or right of subrogation by insurers,

          42.6 A copy of any insurance company report made by
          Contractor to its insurance company relative to bodily
          injury or illness of its employees or property damage
          incurred in the field, must be furnished without delay
          to the Owner.


43.0 INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

          43.1 State laws regarding indemnification vary
          considerably, particularly with regard to
          indemnification against the indemnitee's negligence.
          This Section 43 shall be so read and applied as to
          conform in all respects to applicable local law.

          43.2 Contractor hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and
          save harmless Owner, and any affiliates, lessors,
          partners or joint venturers of Owner and their
          respective employees, officers, directors,
          shareholders, agents, representatives, attorneys,
          successors and assigns, and anyone to whom any of them
          may be liable and at their behalf, against all costs,
          liability and expenses for personal injuries, including
          death resulting therefrom, and against all costs,
          liability and expenses for property damage, and
          including attorneys' fees and other costs of defense
          caused or alleged to have been caused by any act or
          omission, negligent or otherwise, on the part of
          Contractor, or its subcontractors, or persons directly
          or indirectly employed by them and arising out of, or
          in any way connected with the performance of this
          Contract.

          43.3 In those jurisdictions where permitted by local
          law, Contractor also agrees to defend, indemnify and
          save harmless Owner and any affiliates, lessors,
          partners or joint venturers, and their respective
          employees, officers, directors, shareholders, agents,
          representatives, attorneys, successors and assigns,
          anyone to whom Owner may be liable and at Owner's and
          Owner's request to defend on and on their behalf,
          against all costs, liability and expenses for personal
          injuries, including death resulting therefrom, and
          against all costs, liability and expenses for property
          damage, and including attorney's fees and other costs
          of defense, caused or alleged to have been caused by
          the concurrent negligence of Contractor or its
          subcontractors or persons directly or indirectly
          employed by them and arising out of, or in any way
          connected with the performance of this Contract.

          43.4 In those jurisdictions where paragraph three above
          is unenforceable under local law, the parties agree
          that paragraph three is separable and severable from
          paragraphs one and two and from all other provisions of
          this Contract, and the paragraph three does not
          constitute the main or essential feature of this
          Contract and that the obligations of indemnification
          assumed by the Contractor under paragraph two thereof
          shall remain in full force and effect.  If any claims
          are made or any suit or other proceeding is brought
          against Owner or any of its officers, directors or
          employees, or any other indemnified person based on a
          claim for which Contractor's indemnity is applicable,
          Contractor at the election of Owner, or any other
          indemnified person as the case may be, shall either
          defend the persons against whom such claims, suit or
          proceedings have been brought or assume the expense,
          but not the direction, of the defense thereof and pay
          or otherwise satisfy and discharge any and all
          judgments which may be entered against Owner or any
          other indemnified person.

          43.5 The representations, warranties and
          indemnification obligations of Contractor shall survive
          the expiration or other termination of this Contract,
          subject to any applicable laws regarding statutes of
          limitation.

     44.0 GOVERNING LAW

          44.1 This Contract shall be construed and enforced, and
          all rights and liabilities hereunder shall be
          determined in accordance with the laws of the State of
          Colorado.  Whenever possible, each provision of this
          Contract shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be
          effective and valid under applicable law, and if any
          provision of this Contract shall be or becomes
          prohibited or invalid in whole or in part for any
          reason whatsoever, that provision shall be ineffective
          only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity
          without invalidating the remaining portion of that
          provision or the remaining provisions of this Contract.
          The parties specifically charge the trier of fact to
          give effect to the intent of the parties, even if in
          doing so, reformation of a specific provision of the
          Contract is required consistent with the foregoing
          stated intent.

          45.0 GENERAL

          45.1 The headings used in this Contract are for
          convenience and shall not be used in any manner to
          construe, limit, define or interpret any term or
          provision of this Contract.  This Contract has been
          fully reviewed and negotiated between the parties and
          no uncertainty or ambiguity in any term or provision
          shall be construed strictly against Owner or Contractor
          under any rule of construction or otherwise.

          45.2 All rights and remedies of a party pursuant to
          this Contract shall be cumulative and non-exclusive and
          may be exercised singularly or concurrently.

          Department of Labor, "Alaska Economic Trends" Table 2,
          Average Hourly Earnings for the Mining Industry.
          Adjustments will be made effective as of January 1 of

          the receipt by Owner of the Indices.

               The following components will be subject to price
          adjustments.  The average percent of each Contract Unit
          Price dollar components is established below.  The sum
          of the averages during the base period is 100%.

               This adjusted total would then be multiplied
          against the mining unit prices for the following 12
          month period.  For example, 1996 loading unit price for
          ore is $0.17/ton.  Using the above adjustment, 1997
          loading price would be $0.17 X 1.024=$0.174/ton.

          27.2 Payments to Contractor will not be made against a
          Work Authorization during the construction/development
          phase of this Project.  Such costs will be accrued
          until the added work and the cost of same is
          incorporated into the Contract by Contract Amendment
          which Owner and Contractor shall finalize and execute
          whenever the aggregate of the costs accrued equal or
          exceed $50,000 or, whenever the aggregate costs are
          less than $50,000, not less frequently than once per
          month.

          27.3 Payments to Contractor will be made against a duly
          processed Work Authorization signed by Owner or Other
          Work@ done during operations phase of this Project as
          defined in Section III - Contract Specifications,

          Superior Court for the State of Alaska, Third Judicial
          District, sitting at Anchorage; or the United States
          District Court for Alaska at Anchorage.  Contractor
          hereby expressly submits and consents in advance to
          such jurisdiction and hereby waives any claim that
          either of such courts is an inconvenient or improper
          forum based on venue.  Contractor shall require that
          any of its subcontractors also consent to the
          jurisdiction and appropriateness of any proceedings in
          any of the foregoing courts.

          35.3 Contractor shall comply with Owner=s agreement
          with NPMC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of CIRI
          regarding its hiring practices.  Contractor shall

          of 100 pounds or 100 gallons (and the estimated
          quantities thereof) shall be disclosed by Contractor by
          written notice to Owner prior to their being brought on
          the Site.  At the end of each calendar year, Contractor
          shall notify Owner of all hazardous substances and
          hazardous wastes, and the quantities thereof brought
          to, stored on, used on, or transported from the Site by
          it.

          40.4 In the event either Contractor or Owner proposes
          to use equipment of the other, the parties shall enter
          into a written equipment lease agreement, which shall
          include among other things usual and customary

          representations for twenty four (24) months and in the
          case of warranties for 12 months following Final
          Acceptance.

          43.6 Anything in this Contract to the contrary
          notwithstanding, the indemnification obligations of
          Contractor set forth in this Contract shall not apply
          with respect to any person or entity to be indemnified
          to the extent such person or entity is determined by a
          decision binding on such person or entity to have been
          guilty of (a) gross negligence or intentional

          grades, elevations, lines, and pertinent cross sections
          as shown on the attached construction drawings,
          specifications and other documents.

               2.3.1     On-Site Infrastructure (AOA-2000).

               Plant Site Access/Transportation (AOA-
               2100).  Work shall include completing the
               construction of the main access road from the
               existing airstrip to the mine plant area.  This
               Work includes the installation of any drainage
               ditches, culverts, geotextile and base course
               material required to develop an all weather road
               capable of handling Contractor's and Owner's

                         General Plant Site Work (AOA-2200).
               Work includes site preparation at the plant site
               which contains the process plant, assay
               laboratory, maintenance shop, warehouse,
               administration office, ready line, fresh water
               pond and laydown yard.  Site preparation includes
               work necessary to clear, grub, remove and
               stockpile the existing organic mat and topsoil,
               cut underlying silt layer down to the competent
               gravel zone which lies about one foot below the
               silt layer and rough grade the area.

               2.3.2     Crusher Site (AOA-4000).

                         ROM Stockpile and Retaining Wall (AOA-
               4100).  Work includes all earthwork necessary by
               Contractor to construct a suitable run-of-mine
               (ROM) stockpile area capable of storing up to
               15,000 tons of dolomitic limestone and 25,000 tons
               of ore.  Work will also include the construction
               of an appropriate retaining wall if necessary to
               feed material to contractor's portable crushing
               and screening plant.

                         Portable Crushing, Screening and Wash
               Plant (AOA-4700).  Work includes providing a
               portable plant capable of handling 15,000 tons of
               dolomitic limestone per year (90% passing 3" x
               1.5") and 83,800 tons and 71,100 tons of ore grade
               overliner material for the leach pad (80% passing
               1") in Years 1 and 3, respectively.  It is
               expected that overliner material will require very
               little crushing as it can be obtained from the
               very friable, high grade gossan zone.  The
               overliner will need to be processed during a three
               month period.  Work will include all earthwork
               necessary to prepare an appropriate crusher site
               near the Owner's lime kiln complete with
               appropriate product stockpile area.

               2.3.3     Process Site (AOA-5000).

               Modified Valley Fill Leach Pad (AOA-
               5410).  Work shall include all earthwork
               construction required to construct the modified
               valley fill leach pad as summarized below and
               further defined in the SRK Report titled,
               AIllinois Creek Heap Leach Design Report",
               November 1995.  The leach pad will be construction
               on a hillside.  Downstream containment of the ore
               and process solution will be accomplished through
               the construction of an earthen embankment.  A
               trough will be excavated behind the upstream toe
               of the embankment to serve as a barrow source for
               initial construction and to increase the storage
               capacity behind the embankment.  The leach pad
               will be built in three stages.  The first stage
               will be constructed in Year 1.  It will consist of
               excavating a trough approximately 80 feet wide by
               1500 feet long to a nominal base elevation of 500
               feed (msl), constructing a berm to the 530 foot
               elevation and constructing a leach pad up slope of
               the trough to the 570 foot elevation contour.
               Stage two will be built in Year 3.  It will
               consist of increasing the crest of the berm to 550
               foot elevation and extending the leach pad up
               slope to the 635 foot elevation contour.  Stage
               three is optional and will be constructed only if
               needed around Year 4.  It will consist of
               increasing the crest of the berm to the 570 foot
               elevation.

<PAGE>
                         Lime Kiln Site (AOA-5630).  Contractor
               shall construct the lime kiln site earthworks so
               that the completed site work shall conform to the
               grades, elevations, lines and pertinent cross-
               sections on the attached drawings or as specified

8.0  MATERIAL CONTROL

          8.1  Contractor shall be responsible for purchasing,
          expediting, receiving, handling, transporting,
          warehousing, and protecting all materials required to
          complete the Work furnished by Contractor.

          8.2  Contractor shall be responsible for unloading,
          receiving, handling, transporting, warehousing, and
          protecting all materials furnished by Owner.

          8.3  No material, including material furnished by
          Contractor, shall be removed from the jobsite without
          written authorization from the Owner.


9.0  MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT

     9.1  Measurement of Work Performed:

         Progress payments to be made to the Contractor shall be
         for Work actually performed based upon actual
         measurements.

     9.2  Quantity Measurement:

          The measurement to be used to calculate the quantity of
          Work completed will correspond to the unit of
          measurement stated in Section 2.0 of the Contractor's
          Form of Proposal.  For example, measurement of the
          volume of ore and waste for purposes of establishing
          Work performed by Contractor shall be by Abank cubic
          yard" determined by field surveys of pit excavations.
          "Bank cubic yards", as used herein, means earth, rock
          and/or overburden in place before drilling, blasting or
          ripping.  To compute tonnage, a factor of 12.9 cubic
          feet per dry ton, in place, will be used for the ore
          zone.  A factor of 12.2 cubic feet per dry ton, in
          place, will be used for the waste zone.  A tonnage
          factor of 18 cubic feet per dry ton, in place, will be
          used for topsoil.

               The Owner shall survey the excavation and backfill
          progress on a weekly basis or more often if necessary
          for the purpose of calculating volumes.  The planned
          elevations will be used as a basis for determining the
          volume removed in bank cubic yards.  Copies of survey
          notes, plots and calculations will be furnished upon
          request for verification purposes.  If the parties fail
          to agree on the volume removed as shown by the surveys
          and calculations, an independent party shall be paid
          for by the party whose contention regarding the
          aggregate volume removed was furthest from the amount
          determined by the independent party.

               No additional allowance will be made for rock
          removal, dewatering, site clearing and grading,
          filling, compaction, disposal or removal of any
          unclassified materials.

               the geomembrane liner material shall be free of
               angular gravel, gravel over 2 inches in diameter
               and hard objects within 4 inches of the surface.
               These areas shall be graded to a continuous smooth
               surface.  Areas that require a thin lift of soil
               to fill irregularities shall be compacted with at
               least 4 passes of a 5 ton minimum weight smooth
               drum or pneumatic roller.  The top surface of the
               completed pond shall be inspected to ensure that
               it shall be free from depressions, cracks, sharp
               or oversized rocks, and other foreign material
               which might puncture the synthetic liner.  This
               surface treatment includes side slopes as well as
               the bottom of the pond.

               provided by a heavy, smooth steel drum vibratory
               roller.  The clay liner shall be constructed of
               material from a borrow area approved by the Owner.
               These areas shall be graded to a continuous smooth
               surface.

                         The top surface of the completed leach
               pad shall be inspected to ensure that it shall be
               free from depressions, cracks, sharp or oversized
               rocks, and other foreign material which might
               puncture the synthetic liner.

                         Areas that require fill shall be placed
               in lifts no thicker than 10 inches when compacted,
               moisture conditioned and compacted as previously
               described.

               11.7.5    Controlled Fill

                         Contractor shall not do this type of
               Work when the atmospheric temperature is below 35
               degrees.  It shall be the responsibility of the
               Contractor to protect all areas of completed work
               by methods approved by the Owner.  Any areas that
               are damaged by freezing shall be reconditioned,
               reshaped and compacted by the Contractor in
               conformance with the requirements of this
               specification without additional cost to the
               Owner.

     11.8 Standards

               Without limiting the generality of other
          requirements of the Specifications, all work specified
          herein shall conform to or exceed the applicable
          requirements of the following ASTM documents to the
          extent that the provisions of such documents are not in
          conflict with the requirements of this Section:

<PAGE>

      .   ASTM D 1557      Test Method for Determining Compaction by
                           Standard Proctor

                           and 12 in. (304.8 mm) Drop.

     11.9 Quality Assurance

               All soils testing will be done by a testing
          laboratory of the Owner's choice at the Owner's
          expense.  Compaction and soil testing will be carried
          out by an independent soils contractor who shall be
          under the direction of the Owner, and, whenever
          applicable any engineers retained by Owner to assure
          compliance with any standards or requirements of this
          Contract or law.  Final acceptance of any earthworks
          must be approved by both the soils contractor and
          Owner.

     11.10     Pipeline Trench Excavation

               Unless otherwise shown or ordered by the Owner,
          excavation for pipelines and utilities shall be open-
          cut trenches.  Trench widths shall be kept as narrow as
          is practical for the method of pipe zone densification
          selected by the Contractor, but shall have a minimum
          width at the bottom of the trench equal to the outside
          diameter of the pipe plus 36 inches.  The minimum width
          at the bottom of a trench to be used to install HDPE
          pipe will be equal to the outside diameter of the pipe
          plus 12 inches unless otherwise shown or ordered by the
          Owner.

               Except when pipe bedding is required, the bottom
          of the trench shall be excavated uniformly to the grade
          of the bottom of the pipe.  The trench bottom shall be
          given a final trim, using a string line for
          establishing grade, such that each pipe section when
          first laid will be continually in contact with the
          ground along the extreme bottom of the pipe.  Rounding
          out the trench to form a cradle for the pipe will not
          be required.

               The maximum amount of open trench permitted in any
          one location shall be 500 feet, or the length necessary
          to accommodate the amount of pipe installed in the
          single day, whichever is greater.  All trenches shall
          be fully backfilled at the end of each day or, in lieu
          thereof, shall be covered by heavy steel plated
          adequately braced and capable of supporting vehicular
          traffic in those locations where it is impractical to
          backfill at the end of each day.  The above
          requirements for backfilling or use of steel plate will
          be waived in cases where the trench is located further
          than 100 feet from any travelled roadway or occupied
          structure.  In such cases, however, barricades and
          warning lights meeting OSHA requirements shall be
          provided and maintained.

               Where the Drawings indicate that trenches shall be
          over-excavated, they shall be excavated to the depth
          shown, and then backfilled to the grade of the bottom
          of the pipe.  Work specified in this Section, shall be
          performed by the Contractor at its own expense.

<PAGE>
          When ordered by the Owner, whether indicated
          on the Drawings or not, trenches shall be over-
          excavated beyond the depth shown.  Such over-excavation
          shall be to the depth ordered.  The trench shall then
          be backfilled to the grade of the bottom of the pipe.
          All work specified in this Section shall be performed
          by the Contractor at its own expense when the over-
          excavation ordered by the Owner is less than 6 inches
          below the limits shown.  When the over-excavation
          ordered by the Owner is 6 inches or greater below the
          limits shown, additional payment will be made to the
          Contractor for that portion of the work which is
          located below said 6-inch distance.  Said additional
          payment will be made under separate unit price bid
          items for over-excavation and bedding if such bid items
          have been established; otherwise payment will be made
          in accordance with a negotiated price.

               Where pipelines are to be installed in embankment
          or structure fills, the fill shall be constructed to a
          level at least one foot above the top of the pipe
          before the trench is excavated except as noted below.

     11.11     Over-Excavation Not Ordered, Specified, or Shown

               Any over-excavation carried below the grade
          ordered, specified, or shown, shall be backfilled to
          the required grade with the specified material and
          compaction.  Such work shall be performed by the
          Contractor at its own expense.

     11.12     Disposal of Excess Excavated Material

               The Contractor shall remove and dispose of all
          excess excavated material at its own expense.

               All excess material, including rock and boulders
          that cannot be used in embankments shall be disposed of
          as directed by the Owner.  APPROXIMATE LOCATION TO BE
          DETERMINED AT THE JOBSITE MEETING.  It is the
          Contractor's responsibility to determine if sufficient
          material is available for the completion of the
          embankments before disposing of any materials.  Any
          shortage of suitable materials for completion of the
          work caused by premature disposal of materials by the
          Contractor shall be replaced by the Contractor at no
          cost to the Owner.

     11.13     Backfill - General

               Backfill shall not be dropped directly upon any
          structure or pipe.  Backfill shall not be placed around
          or upon any structure until the concrete has attained
          sufficient strength to withstand the loads imposed.

               Except for drainrock materials being placed in
          over-excavation areas or trenches, backfill shall be
          placed after all water is removed from the excavation.

     11.14     Placing and Spreading of Backfill Materials

               Backfill materials shall be placed and spread
          evenly in layers.  When compaction is achieved using
          mechanical equipment the layers shall be evenly spread
          so that when compacted each layer shall not exceed 10
          inches in thickness.

<PAGE>

               During spreading each layer shall be thoroughly
          mixed as necessary to promote uniformity of material in
          each layer.  Pipe zone backfill materials shall be
          manually spread around the pipe so that when compacted
          the pipe zone backfill will provide uniform bearing and
          side support.

     11.15     Compaction of Fill, Backfill, and Embankment
               Materials

               Backfill materials shall be mechanically compacted
          to the specified percentage of maximum density.
          Equipment that is consistently capable of achieving the
          required degree of compaction shall be used and each
          layer shall be compacted over its entire area while the
          material is at the required moisture content.

               The Contractor shall submit a list of its proposed
          compaction equipment and methods for approval by the
          Owner 15 days prior to commencing its compaction
          operations.  If the Contractor's compaction equipment
          and/or the methods are found by the Owner to be
          insufficient to produce the specified compaction
          results, the Contractor shall make adjustments of its
          equipment at no cost to the Owner.

               Materials shall be compacted by means of at least
          2 passes from a flat plate vibratory compactor, except
          when such materials are used for pipe zone.  Backfill
          vibratory compaction shall be used at the top of the
          pipe zone or at vertical intervals of 24 inches,
          whichever is least.

               Flooding, ponding, or jetting shall not be used
          for compaction.

     11.16     Pipe and Utility Trench Backfill

               The pipe zone is defined as the trench cross
          sectional area between a line 6 inches below the bottom
          of the pipe, i.e., the subgrade, to a level line 6
          inches above the top of the pipe.  The bedding for
          flexible pipe is defined as that portion of pipe zone
          backfill material between the subgrade and the bottom
          of the pipe.  The bedding for rigid pipe is defined as
          that portion of the pipe zone backfill material between
          the subgrade and a level line which varies from the
          bottom of the pipe to the spring line as shown on the
          Drawings.

               Bedding shall be provided for all sewers, drainage
          pipelines, and other gravity flow pipelines.  For other
          pipelines the bedding may be omitted if all the
          following conditions exist:

              .The pipe bears on firm, undisturbed native soil
            which contains only particles that will pass a one-
            inch sieve.

              .The trench excavation is not through rock or
            stones.

              .The trench conditions match those specified by
            the pipe manufacturer for installation of pipe
            directly on the subgrade.

              .The subgrade soils have, as a maximum, a
            moisture content that allows compaction.
<PAGE>

               Where bedding is required after compacting the
          bedding the Contractor shall perform a final trim using
          a string line for establishing grade, such that each
          pipe section when first laid will be continually in
          contact with the bedding along the extreme bottom of
          pipe.

               The pipe zone shall be backfilled with the
          specified backfill material.  the Contractor shall
          exercise care to prevent damage to the pipeline
          coating, cathodic bonds, or the pipe itself during the
          installation and backfill operations.

     11.17     Riprap Materials

               The Contractor shall provide riprap material to
          comply with the specifications as outlined herein.
          Riprap shall consist of dense, natural rock fragments,
          varying uniformly between 8 inches and 14 inches
          maximum dimension unless otherwise specified.  Stone
          used for riprap shall be hard, durable, angular in
          shape; resistant to weathering and to water action;
          free from overburden, spoil, shale and organic
          material; and shall meet the gradation requirements
          specified.  Neither breadth nor thickness of a single
          stone should be less than one-third its length.  Shale
          and stone with shale seams are not acceptable.

               The acceptability of the stone will be determined
          by Owner prior to construction.

               11.17.1   Surface Preparation

                         Where riprap is to be placed as
               embankment protection, all receiving slopes shall
               be graded to a uniform surface.  At banks and
               embankment, riprap shall be placed within the
               limits shown on the Construction Drawings.

                         After surface preparations are completed
               for the placement of either embankment or channel
               protection riprap, the Owner's inspections and
               approval of the lines and grades shall be secured
               prior to placement of any riprap.

               11.17.2   Placement

                         Riprap shall be placed progressively
               from the bottom upward and in a manner approved by
               the Owner.  The finished rock mass shall be
               homogeneous, well-graded and dense without voids.
               Care shall be taken to prevent damage to the
               geotextile fabric underlayment.  Local surface
               irregularities of the finished slopes shall not
               vary from the planned slopes by more than 8 inches
               measured at right angles to the slope.  Care shall
               be taken during excavation and riprap placement to
               minimize sediment production in all stream
               channels.

     11.18     Corrugated Metal Pipe

               All CMP pipe located all or partially above the
               existing ground profile shall be anchored as shown on
               the Drawings and directed by the Owner in the field.
<PAGE>
               11.18.1   Pipe

                         Corrugated metal pipe shall conform to
               the requirements of the "Standard  Specifications
               for  Corrugated  Metal  Culvert  Pipe" (AASHTO M-
               36) and shall have a minimum plate thickness of 14
               gage pipe shall be galvanized steel.

               11.18.2   Fittings

                         All CMP shall be joined using standard
               or two-piece corrugated bands which mesh with the
               corrugations of the pipe ends.  Bands shall be
               tightened to manufacturer's recommendations.
               Bolts shall be galvanized steel.

               11.18.3   Laving Pipe

                         The pipe shall be installed as specified
               herein and shown and the sections shall be closely
               jointed to form a smooth flow line.  Immediately
               before placing each section of pipe in final
               position for jointing, the bedding for the pipe
               shall be checked for firmness and uniformity of
               surface.

                         Proper implements, tools, and facilities
               as recommended by the pipe manufacturer's standard
               printed installation instructions shall be
               provided and used by the contractor for safe and
               efficient execution of the work.  All pipe,
               fittings, and accessories shall be carefully
               lowered into the trench by means of derrick,
               ropes, or other suitable equipment in such a
               manner as to prevent damage to pipe and fittings.
               Under no circumstances shall pipe or accessories
               be dropped or dumped into the trench.

                         Cutting of the pipe shall be
               accomplished in accordance with the pipe
               manufacturer's standard procedures for this
               operation.  Pipe shall not be cut by any method
               that may damage the pipe or will produce ragged,
               uneven edges.

                         The pipe and accessories shall be
               inspected for defects prior to lowering into the
               trench.  Any defective, damaged or unsound pipe
               shall be repaired or replaced.  All foreign matter
               or dirt shall be removed from the interior of the
               pipe before lowering into position in the trench.
               Pipe shall be kept clean during and after laying.

     11.19     Contract Mining Specifications

               All mining operations are to be carried out in
          accordance with good mining practice and in a
          workmanlike manner.  The mine is to be developed in
          accordance with the Owner's mine design as indicated in
          the Contract, as summarized below and as described in
          more detail in the attached mine plans, drawings,
          specifications, documents and yearly production
          schedule.

<PAGE>
                    11.19.1   Efficiency Objective.

                         Contractor acknowledges that the primary
               objective of mining is to minimize dilution of ore
               with waste and to deliver material to the proper
               location, in an orderly fashion, as directed by
               Owner. Contractor will work with Owner to
               accomplish this objective.  Should any employee(s)
               not cooperate to obtain Owner's objective, Owner
               retain the right to remove such employee(s) from
               any positions affecting Owner's objectives or for
               safety related reasons.

                    11.19.2   Commencement Condition.

                         Owner's commitment to commence or
               continue Work under this Contract is expressly
               conditioned upon Owner obtaining all necessary
               Federal and State permits required to commence
               and/or continue Work on terms and conditions
               satisfactory to Owner as determined in Owner's
               sole discretion.  Owner agrees to use all
               reasonable efforts to obtain such approvals and in
               the event of any significant delays, to keep
               Contractor reasonably apprised of material
               developments during, and upon termination of, such
               efforts.

                    11.19.3   Schedule Determination and
                              Flexibility.

                         Owner will provide to Contractor its
               proposed mining schedule for the Contract Time.
               Contractor shall, as requested by Owner, follow
               and maintain such schedule and any modifications
               to schedule that may be specified by Owner within
               ten (10) percent greater or lesser than the agreed
               upon production rates on a monthly basis and
               within five (5) percent on a yearly basis.  Owner
               shall give Contractor reasonable notice of the
               mining rates to be followed, and/or any change to
               aforementioned rate, to afford Contractor a
               reasonable time period to make any adjustments in
               its ability to perform the Work.

                    11.19.4   Mine Plan.

                         Owner and Contractor acknowledge that
               the contract unit price(s) quoted in the
               Contractor's Proposal apply specifically to the
               Work proposed in the mine plan presented by Owner
               at the time of the Contractor's Proposal.  Changes
               to the mine plan will not result in rate
               escalations or reductions unless it is
               demonstrated to both parties that such changes
               have increased or decreased the haul lengths or
               required Work per unit of production by at least
               10% from the original mine plan.  Such additional
               or decreased haulage increments or unit work
               requirements will be computed by a method
               acceptable to both parties -- e.g., an acceptable
               equipment vehicle simulation analysis.  Contractor
               acknowledges that the Owner plans to update the
               mine plan at least once a year or more often as
               necessary.

               11.19.5   Changes in Scope.

                         The schedule and production rate
               parameters referred to in Section 11.19.3 above
               are not intended by the parties to define a
               minimum or maximum Scope of Work under this
               Contract.

               11.19.6   Clear and Grub

                         This Work shall consist of clearing,
               grubbing, chipping, and/or burning as necessary to
               remove and/or dispose of vegetation and debris
               within the limits of the mine site.

               11.19.7   Remove and Stockpile Topsoil

                         This Work shall consist of removing and
               stockpiling the equivalent of one foot of peaty
               surface mat, topsoil and/or plant growth medium.

               11.19.8   Drill

                         Drill patterns shall be designed in a
               manner to minimize dilution of ore grade material
               and achieve sufficient fragmentation to facilitate
               subsequent leaching.  Owner reserves the authority
               to approve all drill patterns to be used.

                         Contractor's drillers shall take samples
               of drill cuttings, fill out sample tags, fill out
               daily drill reports, and prepare the samples for
               shipment to the assay lab.  Samples retrieved by
               the drillers or drill helpers will not include the
               subdrill.  Subdrill depths will be sufficient to
               ensure that bench elevations are mined to + 1
               foot.  All ramps will be drilled to ramp grade.
               Contractor's drills shall be of suitable design
               and capability to perform the drilling work at the
               operation.  Drill hole diameter will be compatible
               to pattern spacing and bench height.  Contractor
               acknowledges that minimizing material movement as
               a result of drilling and blasting achieves the
               primary efficiency objective.  Unless stated
               otherwise in the Contractor's Form of Proposal the
               specified drill pattern for the base case against
               which the Contractor's required Work per unit of
               production will be calculated is a 15-foot by 15-
               foot pattern, a 6 :-inch diameter hole and a 20-
               foot bench.

                         No subdrilling will be allowed to
               penetrate the limits of safety bench crests on the
               bench below.

                         All drill patterns will be approved by
               Owner.  Should any area drilled not meet the
               specified hole spacing, Owner will require the
               Contractor, at its expense, to fill in gaps to
               obtain samples and to assure bench grades will be
               obtainable without the use of dozers.
<PAGE>

               All pit benches which daylight will be drilled such that sampling
               and blasting meet Owner's requirements for pattern
               spacing and bench grade control.  The Contractor
               should be prepared to add additional blastholes
               necessary to mine off benches.

                         All of the foregoing shall be subject to
               Owner's request for control alternatives.  Due to
               the varied rock fabric, it may be necessary to
               implement controlled blasting or other techniques
               along the pit walls to prevent excessive breakage
               beyond the final pit slope limit, but enable
               cleaning to the final design toe to ensure that
               catch bench widths are the maximum size possible
               within the limits of pit slope and bench face
               angles.  When pre-splitting is required the hole
               spacing is not to exceed in number of feet the
               holes diameter in inches B e.g., the pre-split
               hole spacing shall not exceed 7 feet given a 6 :-
               inch diameter hole.

                         Contractor shall provide each drill with
               a sample collecting device that is approved by
               Owner.  Owner shall have the right to require a
               substitute sampling method if it can be shown that
               the Contractor's sampling method does not give a
               true indication of the metal values for the total
               drill cuttings removed from the hole.  Samples
               will be taken for all holes drilled at drill
               intervals requested by Owner.  Contractor will
               cooperate with Owner so as to promote Owner's
               objective of having assay results within forty-
               eight (48) hours after the samples are delivered
               to the lab.

               11.19.9   Blast

                    Blasting will be conducted in a safe and
               workmanlike manner.  The blast round shall be
               designed in such a manner as to minimize dilution
               of ore grade material and to maintain the
               integrity of the pit walls and safety benches.  It
               will be Contractor's sole responsibility to clear
               the area of all personnel and equipment.  Blasting
               times will be clearly posted at the entrance to
               the pit and Owner's personnel will be notified the
               morning of the blast as to the location and time.
               Blasts will be scheduled whenever possible to
               coincide with the end of the day shift.
               Contractor will be required to sound an audible 5
               minute and 1 minute warning prior to all shots.

                         Blasting will be controlled; excessive
               material displacement will not be tolerated.  FLY
               ROCK WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  Contractor will use
               whatever means necessary to confine shot
               displacement and achieve desired breakage.

                         Explosive purchase, storage, handling
               and permitting will be the Contractor's sole
               responsibility.  An area will be provided by Owner
               for the placement of explosive storage facilities.

                         Contractor shall clearly state the
               average powder factor to be used in calculating
               its base price in the Contractor's Form of
               Proposal.
<PAGE>
               11.19.10  Load Ore and/or Waste

                         Contractor shall load ore and waste with
               front end loaders unless otherwise specified.
               Contractor will adhere strictly to Owner's
               specification for Ore and Waste Control (see
               Section 11.19.13) to ensure that ore dilution is
               minimized. Work shall include loading ore and/or
               waste from 10-foot and/or 20-foot benches as
               directed by the Owner.

               11.19.11  Haul

                         Ore and waste from the mine shall be
               hauled to areas specified in the mine plan
               drawings or as reasonably dictated by the Owner
               after consultation with Contractor.  Work shall
               include hauling ore to the crusher or the leach
               pad and end dumping it on 10-foot to 20-foot lifts
               as dictated by the Owner.  Work shall include
               hauling waste to the appropriate waste dumps as
               shown on the drawings.

               11.19.12  Pits, Roads and Dumps

                         Mining will be done in such a manner as
               to operate and maintain the various mine
               works/areas of activity including highwalls,
               safety benches, ramps, roads, pit working areas,
               waste dumps and topsoil stockpiles in a safe and
               workman like manner.

                         The pit design is summarized below and
               described in more detail in the "Illinois Creek
               Project, Preliminary 1995 Mine Plan" by USMX which
               is dated November 1995, and in the letter to the
               Contractor from the Owner's representative, James
               A. Sittner, which is titled, "Illinois Creek
               Project, September 20, 1995 Site Visit," which is
               dated September 15, 1995.

                         There are four main pits at Illinois
               Creek B namely, West Pit, Central Pit, Central Pit
               Extension, and East Pit.  Each pit will be
               developed on 20-foot benches unless directed
               otherwise by Owner.  Owner may elect to require
               Contractor to load ore from 10-foot benches in
               order to minimize dilution.  Contractor shall be
               responsible for maintaining the pit floors free of
               rock and other debris.  Contractor shall clear all
               bench toes and ensure that the bench is excavated
               to the design limits.  Over digging benches is
               prohibited unless ordered by Owner.  Safety
               benches will be developed on 40-foot to 60-foot
               intervals as determined by Owner.  Bench face
               angles will be kept as steep as practicable in
               order to increase the width of the safety benches.
               Safety benches will vary in width from 20-feet to
               30-feet when double benching and from 30-feet to
               50-feet when triple benching.  The overall pit
               slopes will vary from 45 degrees to 55 degrees depending on
               ground conditions.  Contractor is responsible for
               inspecting all working areas at the mine site at
               the start of each shift and more often if
               necessary.  Pit walls shall be scaled to MSHA
               standards.  Rocks, earth and any other loose
               debris shall be pulled back from the pit edges to
               prevent loose material from falling into the pit.
               Contractor shall be responsible for all surface
               water dewatering necessary to keep pit working
               areas dry and free from snow and ice.  The Owner
               shall be responsible for any ground water
               dewatering necessary to keep the ground water
               table below the pit limits.
<PAGE>
                         Contractor shall be responsible for
               developing and maintaining all haul roads and mine
               access/service roads in the mine area which are
               necessary to develop the mine and maintain the
               proper production schedule.  Roads will be
               constructed using normal cut and fill techniques.
               In the event that fill material is required to
               surface a road, the Contractor shall use clean,
               inert quartzite or dolomitic limestone borrowed
               specifically for this purpose from areas approved
               by Owner.  All roads shall be developed as shown
               in the attached "Illinois Creek Project,
               Preliminary 1995 Mine Plan," or in conjunction
               with Owner.  Normal access/service road width will
               be 18 feet.  Two lane haul road width will be 65
               feet, and one lane haul road width will be 42
               feet.  All mine roads shall be constructed with
               appropriate safety berms and turn outs as approved
               by Owner.  Pit ramps grades shall not exceed 10
               percent unless approved by Owner.  Haulage road
               grades shall not exceed 8 percent unless approved
               by Owner.  Contractor shall water roads as
               necessary to minimize dust hazards and to adhere
               to strict compliance with Owner's Air Quality
               Permit Application a copy of which is attached.
               Contractor acknowledges that adequate dust control
               during hot, dry days may require watering roads at
               rates over 90 gallons per minute.

                         Waste dump and topsoil stockpiles will
               be located near the mine pits and other areas of
               construction to minimize haulage and other Work.
               The locations of topsoil stockpiles will be spread
               over the top of the waste dumps in order to
               minimize reclamation costs.  Waste dumps will be
               built in benches so that they blend into the
               natural topography and so that their overall slope
               does not exceed 3:1.  Waste dumps will be graded
               so that rain and snow melt run off will be
               directed into the surface drainage system.  Waste
               dumps will be reclaimed as soon as practicable.

               11.19.13  Ore and Waste Control

                         Ore control is critical to minimize
               dilution.  Mining of ore and material adjacent to
               ore zones shall be performed during the day shift.
               The following ore control procedures will be
               observed in all pit mining:

                    1.   Each blasthole on a level will
                    be numbered consecutively by blast round and
                    staked by the Contractor.

                    2.   The drill operator will
                    collect, bag and identify a continuous sample
                    of drill cuttings from each blasthole with no
                    subdrilling material.  Stakes, bags and tags
                    will be supplied by Contractor.  Stakes shall
                    be 3/8" x 12" lathe; bags shall be 10" x 17"
                    olefin type; tags shall be of waterproof
                    material.

                    3.   Owner will collect and assay all
                         samples.

                    4.   The blasthole pattern will be
                    surveyed by Owner to record each blasthole
                    identification  number, location and mining
                    level.
<PAGE>
                    5.   Owner will merge the blasthole
                    assay information with the survey data and
                    prepare a detailed blasthole map.

                    6.   Owner will determine the
                    outline of the ore and waste areas for each
                    blast round.  Owner will prepare bench level
                    plans showing all ore and waste areas to be
                    excavated.  Owner in consultation with the
                    Contractor shall determine whether an area is
                    to be ripped, blasted or smooth-wall blasted.

                    7.   Owner will resurvey the area
                    after blasting and flag the material.
                    Flagging will consist of 4' wood lathe with
                    colored ribbon marking the boundary corners
                    and wire pin flags (with colored flags) as
                    delineating markers.  The following colors
                    will denote material types:

                              a.   Red & White - Ore,
                              b.   Yellow - Open to Ripping,
                              c.   Blue - Waste, and
                              d.   Orange - No-Dig Area.

                              Other colors may be used to
                    designate special handling of material to be
                    mined.

                    8.   Audible signals shall be
                    employed by the Contractor to ensure the
                    proper material destination is identified to
                    Contractors operators and Owner's
                    Representatives.

                    9.   Weekly planning meetings will
                    be conducted with Owner's personnel and
                    Contractor's superintendent and pit operating
                    supervisors to discuss mining rates,
                    schedules, and plans of operations.

                    10.  Ore zone mining will be under the
                    direct control of Owner at all times.

                    11.  Some ore-waste fringe areas
                    will have a 4 hour delay for fringe sample
                    turn around.  Other working areas will be
                    provided during these delays.

                    12.  Owner's representative and

                    will be established once per week.

                    2.   The corners and design toes of
                    each bench will be located as mining clears
                    the previous bench.

                    3.   Weekly crests of active mining
                    benches will be located for Owner records.
                    Month-end crests of active mining benches
                    will be located for volumes calculations and
                    payments.

                    4.   Drill holes will be surveyed
                    prior to shooting the blasthole pattern.

                    5.   Dig plans will be established
                    after blasting and prior to mining the
                    blasted material.

                    Contractor will provide and maintain the
                    following bench elevation control in the pit:

                    control will be the responsibility of the
                    Contractor.

                    2.   Elevation control in the
                    active mining areas will be + 1 foot.  (See
                    penalty clauses.)

                    3.   Strict adherence to Owner's ore
                    control plan and markings.  No dig areas are
                    to be observed at all times. (See penalty
                    clauses.)

                    4.   Survey monuments will be
                    preserved in all working areas. (See penalty
                    clauses.)

Mega Metals, Inc.
Mega Minerals S.A.
Mr. Gregory Pusey
Mr. John Drejer
Mr. Gary McAdam
1111 Washington Street
Golden, CO 80401

Gentlemen:

    This letter is to set forth the terms of our binding agreement
("Letter Agreement") concerning certain mining concessions in
Ecuador.

    1.  Representations and warranties.   You jointly and
severally (collectively, as "Sellers") represent and warrant to
USMX, Inc. ("USMX") as follows:

         A.  Gregory Pusey, John Dreier and Gary McAdam
("Individuals") collectively own the majority of all of the issued
and outstanding shares of stock of Mega Metals, Inc., a Colorado
corporation ("Mega Metals (U.S.)")

         B.  To the best of their knowledge, the Individuals own,
for the benefit of Mega Metals (U.S.), all of the issued and
outstanding shares of stock of Mega Minerals S.A., an Ecuadorian
company ("Mega Minerals (Ecuador)")

         C.  To the best of Sellers' knowledge, Mega Minerals
(Ecuador) has been validly formed and organized and is in good
standing, and none of its shares of stock are subject to any liens
or encumbrances or restrictions on transfer. Mega Minerals
(Ecuador) has no current or contingent liabilities, and its only
assets are a bank account, the balance of which is less than
$5,000, and the right to acquire certain mineral concessions
pursuant to the Jeffcock Agreement described in paragraph l.D
below.

         D.  Mega Metals (U.S.) is a party to a certain letter
agreement dated october 3, 1994 and subsequently amended
(collectively, the "Jeffcock Agreement"), copies of which letter
agreement and amendments are attached hereto as Exhibit A, with an
individual named Pippa Jeffcock, plus additional parties, and
Minera Revenge S.A., an Ecuadorian company partially owned by Ms.
Jeffoock. Ms. Jeffcock, Minera Revenge S.A. and associates shall
be described collectively herein as "Jeffcock". To the best of


<PAGE>


Sellers' knowledge, Jeffcock owns three concessions and may be able
to acquire up to an additional nine concessions from the Government
of Ecuador if those concessions are made available by the
Government. The twelve concessions described in this paragraph l.D
are described more specifically on Exhibit a hereto.

         E.  To the best of Sellers' knowledge, other than as
described in paragraph 1.11 below, each of the three concessions now
owned by Jeffcock is valid, in good standing, current in payments,
and free of all liens, encumbrances or claims thereto by third
parties, other than a possible claim by Black Swan Gold Mines Ltd.
Each of these concessions and the Jeffcock Agreement are fully
assignable to Mega Minerals (Ecuador) or to an Ecuadorian
subsidiary of USMX. The Jeffcock Agreement is in full force and
effect, and none of Sellers are subject to a declaration of default
thereunder.

         F.  To the best of Sellers' knowledge, none of the
properties or lands within the boundaries of the concessions
described in Exhibit B are subject to any environmental liabilities
or obligations. To the best of Sellers' knowledge, none of those
properties or lands are subject to any restrictions or impediments
to the exploration, development and mining thereof, other than as
specified in the documents granting the concessions.

         G.  To the best of Sellers' knowledge, Mega Minerals
(Ecuador) is at present not subject to Ecuadorian or United States
tax liabilities, contingent or otherwise, and to the best of
Sellers' knowledge, consummation of the terms contained by this
Letter Agreement will not give rise to any present tax liabilities
on the part of Mega Minerals (Ecuador) or USMX.

         H.  To the best of Sellers' knowledge, costs that are
currently pending and that are related to the concessions now owned
by Jeffcock or that have been made available to Jeffcock for
acquisition are as follows and collectively do not exceed $120,000:

              (I) Approximately $45,000 for governmental fees
                  and taxes on the concessions;


                                                     

<PAGE>


            (ii) approximately $30,000 to be paid to Jeffcook
                 to effectuate the transfer of the Jeffcock
                 concessions described in this paragraph 1.1+ to
                 Mega Minerals (Ecuador); and

            (iii) approximately $20,000 owing to Sellers'
                  Ecuadorian counsel.

    2.  USMX Right to Assignment of Stock or Assets. Sellers
hereby agree to assign to USMX or to its designee either:

         A.  All of the shares of stock of Mega Minerals
(Ecuador) (the "Stock"); or

         B.  all of Mega Minerals (Ecuador)`s right, title and
interest in and to the concessions owned by it and in and to the
Jeffoock Agreement (collectively, the "Assets")

         At any time within 30 days after the date of this better
Agreement, USMX shall instruct Sellers in writing of whether it
elects to have the Stock or the Assets assigned. That notice also
shall specify whether the assignment, if of the Stock, is to be
made to USMX or to a separate United States USMY subsidiary, or, if
of the Assets, an Ecuadorian subsidiary of USMX. Sellers promptly
shall execute whatever instruments of transfer are reasonably
requested by USMX and its counsel in order to effectuate and
document the transfer of the Stock or the Assets, as the case may
be. Sellers also shall be solely responsible for satisfying all
requirements under the Jeffcock Agreement for delivery of shares of
stock of Mega Metals (U.S.) to Jeffoock. Sellers also shall be
solely responsible for satisfaction of the existing Suber bill for
consulting services.

    3.  Payments and Work Commitments by USMX. In consideration
of the assignment described in paragraph 2 above, and in reliance
upon Sellers' representations and warranties in paragraph 1 above,
usxx or its assigns agree to do the following:

reasonable best efforts to pay the costs described in paragraph l.H
above, subject to the following conditions:

              (i) USMX reasonably satisfying itself that the
                  representations and warranties in paragraph I
                  above are true, complete and accurate;

             (ii) The total of those costs shall not exceed
                   $120,000; and

            (iii) the payment or partial payment to Jeffcock
                  described in paragraph l.H(ii) shall not be
                  made unless and until all rights, titles and
                  interests in and to the concessions currently
                  owned by Jeffcock or currently available for
                  acquisition by Jeffcock have been transferred
                  to Mega Minerals (Ecuador) and Sellers'
                  Ecuadorian counsel has confirmed and
                  represented to USMX that such transfer has
                  been completed.

         B.  If USMX has not terminated this better Agreement
pursuant to paragraph 5 below before October 1, 1995, it shall be
obligated to expend before September 30, 1996 at least $100,000 in
exploring, prospecting and evaluating some or all of the lands
subject to the concessions. USMX shall be entitled to include in
such expenditures all out-of-pocket costs paid to third parties as
well as expenses and reasonable allocations of salaries and
benefits of USMX employees who devote time directly to those
concessions. USMX also shall be entitled to include in such
expenditures its costs of legal and environmental services related
directly to those concessions.

         c.  If USMX has not terminated this Letter Agreement
pursuant to paragraph 5 below before October 1, 1996, it shall be
obligated to expend by September 30, 1997 at least an additional
$100,000 in the manner described in paragraph 3.8 above. Any
amounts in excess of $100,000 expended by USMX during the period


                                                      
<PAGE>


described in paragraph 3.5 above shall be credited against the
$100,000 requirement under this paragraph 3.C.

         D.  on a calendar quarter basis, USMX shall provide Mega
Metals (U.S.) with copies of all data produced by its operations on
the concessions during the previous quarter. Such data shall be
provided subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below
in paragraph 4.

         E.  If USMX has not terminated this better Agreement by
more than 30 days prior to the respective due dates of the $50,000
payments (or as such payments may be renegotiated) to be made as
provided in the Jeffcock Agreement, USMX shall pay same when due.
While this better Agreement is in effect, if other concessions are
made available to Jeffoock by the Government of Ecuador, USMX shall
pay for and acquire those concessions (but not including the Raloga
concession, unless USMX elects in writing to receive that
concession) at the price and on the terms provided for in the
Jeffoock Agreement.

         F.  If USMX places any of the properties subject to the
concessions into production, it shall pay Mega Metals (U.S.) ten
percent (10%) of Net Proceeds, as calculated in zxhibit C hereto
("NPI Royalty"), after USMX has recouped all monies it has expended
in performing this better Agreement, as well as all other monies it
has expended in exploring, developing those properties and in
conducting activities reasonably related to exploring, developing
and mining those properties. It is understood and agreed by
Sellers that at any time within three years after the date of this
Letter Agreement, USMX shall have the right to purchase the Ilpi
Royalty for $2,000,000. That purchase may be made in the form of
cash or in stock of USMX and/or its assigns, or a combination
thereof, with a total fair market value of $2,000,000 at the time
of USMX's notice of election to the owner of the NPI Royalty. If
USMX so elects and pays the purchase price, the NPI Royalty shall
be conveyed to USMYC free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
USMX shall be entitled to release any of the concessions at any
time it so elects, subject to the reconveyance rights of Mega
Metals (U.S.), as provided in paragraph 4 below.


<PAGE>


         0.  USMX may utilize the bank accounts of Mega Minerals
(Ecuador) for the transfer of funds required under paragraphs 3.A
and 3.E above, provided that Sellers guarantee to USMX's
satisfaction that funds so provided by USMX shall remain secure and
shall be used solely for USMX's purposes under this Letter
Agreement.

    4.  USMX's Right of Termination. USMX shall have the right
at any time to terminate this Letter Agreement by delivering
written notice of same to Mega Metals (U.S.), in the manner
provided in paragraph 6.B below. Upon such notice being effective,
USMX shall have no further obligations or liabilities under this
Letter Agreement, other than those accrued as of the effective date
of that notice. Mega Metals (U.S.) shall have 20 business days
after USMX's notice in which to notify USMX in writing of whether
Mega Metals (U.S.) wishes to receive from USMX a reconveyance of
the Stock or the Assets, as the case may be. Within 10 business
days after receipt of notice of such election, USMX shall reconvey
to Mega Metals (U.S.) or its designee all of USMX's right, title
and interest in and to either the Stock or the Assets, as
appropriate, received by USMX pursuant to paragraph 2 above. USMX
shall warrant title to the same against all parties claiming by,
through or under USMX but not otherwise. Within 30 days after
termination, USMX also shall provide Mega Metals (U.S.) with copies
of all information regarding the concessions obtained by USMX
during the term of this better Agreement to the extent, if any,
that such information had not previously been provided pursuant to
paragraph 3.D above; provided, however, that USMX shall make no
express or implied representations or warranties of any nature
regarding that information, and any use of or reliance upon that
information by Mega Metals (U.S.), its successors or assigns, shall
be at their sole risk and expense.

    5.  Assignment. The parties shall have the right to assign
their respective interests in and under this better Agreement
without the approval or consent of the other parties. The
assigning party shall provide the other parties with a written
notice of the assignment and the name and address of the assignee
within five days after the assignment. If any of Sellers assign

Dear Pippa:

    This letter sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to

the State of Colorado, U.S.A. ("Mega") shall purchase the
properties of CIA. MINERA REVENGE S.A., a corporation organized
under the laws of Ecuador ("Revenge"). The properties are Listed
on the attached Exhibit "A". It is intended that the terms
included herein will be included in a fornal agreement between the
two corporate entities. It is our mutual desire and objective that
the format agreement be executed and consummated as promptly as
feasible to permit a closing cf the purchase on or about December
31, 1994 (the -Closing"). Both Mega and Revenge will use their
best efforts to finalize the formal agreement and effect the
closing on or before December 31, 1394. Our understandings are as
follows:

    1.  Upon your execution cf this letter, Mega will pay to
         Revenge U.S. $15,000, to be utilized by Revenge for its
         corporate operations prior to Closing. This sum will be
         nonrefundable to Mega in the event Mega determines not to
         proceed with the property purchase at Closing due solely
         to Mega's inability or unwillingness (based on reasons
         unrelated to Revenge's performance) to effect the
         Closing.

    2.  At Closing, Mega will pay to Revenge (or to the persons
         designated by Revenge listed in Exhibit "8", as directed
         by Revenqe), U.S. $60,000. Additional installment
         payments of U.S. $50,000 each shall be :Iad? six months
         from the date of closing and twelve nonthe from the date
         of closing.

<PAGE>


    3.  At Closing, Mega shall issue to Revenge shares of a new
         series of Mega Pref erred Stock to be created specifically
         for this transaction, which shares of Preferred Stock
         shall rovide for a reference to common shareholders
         upon liquidation of $400,000. The Preferred Stock will
         also provide for a mandatory conversion into Mega's
         common stock if and when Mega conducts an initial public
         offerizig or other public financing of its common stock.
         The conversion rate shall be calculated utilizing the
         saute price per share paid by the public for the Mega
         common stock.

    4.  Mega shall also have the option to purchase the stock of
         Revenge and/or the use ot Revenge's name by paying to
         Rovenge (or to the persons designated by Revenge listed
         on Exhibit "C, as directed by Revenge), U.S. $5,625 at
         Closing, U.S. $4,667.50 six months from the date of
         Closing and U.S. $4,687.50 twelve months from the date of
         Closing. Mega shall also issue shares of Mega Preferred
         Stock with a liquidation preference of $35,000.

    5   For each of the three months prior to Closing, commencing
         October 3, 1994, Mega shall pay to Revenge the amount of
         U.S. $2,000 for geological consulting work concerning
         Rcvenge `s properties.

    6.  At the Closing, Mega and Revenge will cooperate in making
         the necessary arrangements in order to enable Mega to
         utilize the office space in Quito presently used by
         Revenge, and to enter into arrangements to use the
         services of the current secretary, administrative
         assistant and Revenge's consultant, Wilson Larrea.

    7.  It is understood that Mega's desire to consummate the
         purchase of the properties at Closing is, based upon your
         representation (which will be confirmed in the final
         agreement) that Revenge has clear title to the properties
         to be conveyed to Mega (or that Mega is satisfied that
         title can be issued to it), that the properties are in
         good standing and that Revenge is in material compliance
         with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
         including, but not limited to, the Mining Law of Ecuador.
         None of the properties to be conveyed by Revenge to Mega
         shall be subject to any lien, claim or encumbrance.
         Revenge shall provide such assurances and indemnification
         regarding these properties as may be requested by Mega.

<PAGE>


   8.  Pending the Closing, Mega and its representatives shall
         have, at all reasonable times, access to the premises and
         to the books, records and properties of Revenge, and
         Revenge shall furnish to Mega and its representatives
         such information with respect to the properties and
         business of Revenge, as Mega shall, from time to time,
         reasonably request. In connection therewith, Mega and
         its representatives shall be privileged to contact and
         communicate with persons having business dealings with
         Revenge or involvement with its properties. In addition,
         Meqa may (but is under no obligation) conduct work on
         Revenge 5 properties to assist in maintaining such
         properties in good standing, and may assist Revenge in
         filing reports required under applicabie laws. Revenge
         shall cooperate with Mega in filing any reports which may
         be due in order to preserve the title to, and good
         standing of, the properties.

   9.  In the event Mega determines not to proceed with the
         purchase of all of the properties listed on Exhibit "A",
         any funds spent to maintain the properties (as set forth
         in the preceding paragraph) or for consulting fees to
         Revenge (as set forth in paraguaph 5), :nay be repaid to
         Mega, at Revenge's option, during the 30 day period after
         Mega notifies Revenge of its; decision. If Revenge does
         not choose to repay Mega, then the funds shall be applied
         to the purchase of one or more of the properties listed
         on Exhibit "A", the purchase price to be apportioned
         equally among such properties. The properties will be
         selected at random.

   10.  Upon execution of this letter by Revenge, Mega will
         commence its due diligence investigation and retain
         counsel to prepare a formal agreement. In consideration
         for the substantial expenditures of time, effort and
         expense to be undertaken by Mega in connection with the
         preparation and execution 0 the agreement, and the
         various investigations and reviews referred to above, you
         and Revenge will undertake and agree that

         (a) Neither Revenge or you shall, between the date of
             execution by you of this letter of intent and the Closing, 
             enter into or conduct any discussions with any prospective 
             purchaser of the stock, properties or other assets of 
             other assets of Revenge; and 

<PAGE>


         (b) You and Revenge shall use your best efforts to
             preserve intact the properties, including title and
             good standing thereof, as well as the good will of
             persons having business relations with Revenge.

    In the event the formal agreement is not executed by December
31, 1994 due to no fault of Revenge, then these obligations will
terminate.

   If this letter meets with your approval, kindly so signify by
signing the enclosed duplicate copy of this letter, whereupon this
letter shall constitute an agreement between us.

                                 Very truly yours,


                               MEGA METALS, INC.

consistently applied as employed by the manager of the properties,

including without limitation:

         (a) All costs and expenses of replacing, expanding,

modifyinq, altering or changing from time to time the mining

facilities. Costs and expenses of improvements (such as haulage

ways or mill facilities) that are also used in connection with

workings other than the properties shall be charged to the

properties only in the proportion that their use in connection with

the properties bears to their total use.

         (b) Ad valorem real property and unsecured personal

property taxes, and all taxes other than income taxes, applicable

to mining of the properties, including without limitation all state

mining taxes, sales taxes, severance taxes, royalties, license fees

incurred, the amount thereof shall be considered as and be included

with outstanding costs and expenses and carried forward

processed by USMX, or are sold to an affiliate of USMX, then, for

purposes of calculating Net Proceeds, such products shall be deemed

conclusively to have been sold at a price equal to fair market

value to arm's length purchaser FOB the concentrator for the

properties, and Net Proceeds relative thereto shall be calculated

without reference to any profits or losses attributable to smelting

or refining.

    2.  Payment of Net Proceeds. Payments of Net Proceeds shall
