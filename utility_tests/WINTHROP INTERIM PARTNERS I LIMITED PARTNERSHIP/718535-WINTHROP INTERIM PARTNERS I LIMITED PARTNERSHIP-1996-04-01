                                     PART I

Item 1.           Business.

Development

         Winthrop Interim Partners I, A Limited  Partnership (the "Registrant"),
was organized under the Revised Uniform Limited  Partnership Act of the State of
Maryland  on  April  14,   1983,   for  the  purpose  of  investing  in  general
partnerships,   limited   partnerships  and  joint  ventures  (the  "Syndicating
Partnerships") which own real estate and other property.

         The General  Partners of the  Registrant  are Two Winthrop  Properties,
Inc., a  Massachusetts  corporation  ("Two  Winthrop" or the  "Managing  General
Partner"), and Linnaeus-Phoenix  Associates Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts
limited partnership  ("Linnaeus-Phoenix").  Two Winthrop is the managing general
partner of the Registrant.

         The Registrant was initially  capitalized with  contributions  totaling
$2,000 from its two General  Partners and with a contribution of $5,000 from the
Registrant's   initial  limited  partner,   WFC  Realty  Co.,  Inc.  ("WFC"),  a
wholly-owned subsidiary of First Winthrop Corporation.

         On April 22, 1983,  the Registrant  filed a  Registration  Statement on
Form  S-11 (the  "Registration  Statement")  with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  in  connection  with a public  offering of 100,000  units of limited
partnership  interest  (the "Units") at a purchase  price of $500 per Unit.  The
Registration Statement was declared effective on June 23, 1983, and the offering
commenced shortly thereafter.  The offering terminated in January 1984, at which
time  subscriptions had been received for all 100,000 Units,  representing gross
capital contributions of $50,000,000.

Description of Business

     The  only  business  of  the   Registrant   is  investing  in   Syndicating
Partnerships (as defined below).  The investment  objectives and policies of the
Registrant  are  described  at pages 17-21 of the  Prospectus  under the caption
"Investment  Objectives and Policies," which description is incorporated  herein
by this  reference.  The  Prospectus  was  previously  filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b).

         During  1983 and  1984,  the  Registrant  invested  in six  Syndicating
Partnerships  by making capital  contributions  of $2,904,000.  Also during this
period, the Registrant pledged approximately $46,000,000 as collateral to secure
loans and letters of credit  obtained by the Syndicating  Partnerships  totaling
approximately $130,000,000. As of September 24, 1984, all such loans, letters of
credit  and  guarantees  had  been  repaid  or  released  and  the  Registrant's
collateral  had been  returned.  On  September  24,  1984,  the  Registrant,  in
accordance  with its original  business  plan,  distributed  $50,000,000  to its
limited partners ("Limited Partners"), an amount equal to their original capital
contributions.  In order to accomplish this  distribution,  and to distribute to
the General  Partners their allocable  share of Cash Available for  Distribution
(as  defined in the  partnership  agreement  for the  Registrant),  the  General
Partners contributed approximately $3,000,000 to the capital of the Registrant.

         As of December  31, 1995,  the  Registrant  retained  interests in four
Syndicating Partnerships. Two of the Syndicating Partnerships, RC Commercial and
RC  Apartments,  own  interests in a single  mixed-use  building  referred to as
"River City".  The other two  Syndicating  Partnerships  own interests in office
buildings   referred  to  as  "One  Financial  Place"  and  "Nineteen  New  York
Properties", respectively.

         In  1992,  one  Syndicating  Partnership,  Cherokee  Center  Associates
Limited  Partnership  ("Cherokee  Center"),  was  terminated  after its right to
redeem  ownership of Cherokee  Village  Apartments  expired on June 6, 1992. The
redemption  right arose from a foreclosure  sale which occurred on June 6, 1991,
in which Cherokee Village  Apartments was acquired by the first mortgage lender.
In 1993, another Syndicating Partnership, Parsippany Commerce Associates Limited
Partnership ("Parsippany  Commerce"),  was terminated after it lost ownership of
its office building located in Parsippany, New Jersey through a foreclosure sale
held on January 11, 1993.

currently retains an ownership interest.

(1)   Represents the Registrant's interest in operating profits, losses and cash
      distributions of the Syndicating  Partnerships.  The Registrant's interest
      in profits,  losses,  and cash  distributions in connection with a sale or
      refinancing  of  all  or  part  of  a  property  owned  by  a  Syndicating
      Partnership may differ from the percentages set forth in the table above.

         One Financial Place. Registrant owns an interest in One Financial Place
Limited Partnership,  a Syndicating Partnership which holds an indirect interest
in One Financial Place Partnership  ("OFPP").  OFPP owns and operates a 39-story
office  building  in  Chicago,  Illinois.  Due to  declining  market  conditions
resulting in lease renewals at rates  insufficient  to satisfy its debt service,
OFPP  filed a  "pre-packaged"  bankruptcy  plan  under  Chapter  11 of the  U.S.
Bankruptcy Code on November 28, 1994. The Plan was approved on January 31, 1995,
and provides for, among other  matters,  an extension of the first mortgage loan
until October 1998. The restructuring  should permit OFPP to retain ownership of
its  property  through  1998 to possibly  benefit from any recovery of the local
real  estate  market,  if one  should  occur.  However,  given the level of debt
encumbering  the property,  it is likely that OFPP will not realize any proceeds
from the disposition of its property,  whether by sale or mortgage  foreclosure.
Therefore,  the  Registrant  presently  carries the interest at a net realizable
value of zero. See "Item 8, Financial Statements - Note 4."

         River  City.  The  River  City  property  is owned  by two  Syndicating
Partnerships in which the Registrant has invested. The Registrant has retained a
1.4% and .5% interest in RC Commercial and RC Apartments, respectively.



<PAGE>




         The River City  property has conducted  operations  under a provisional
workout arrangement with The Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD")
since 1987 when the  property  first became in default  under its mortgage  loan
obligations  with HUD. The agreement  generally  provides for a minimum  monthly
mortgage  payment as well as any excess cash  generated by the  property  (minus
certain HUD preapproved property  expenditures such as commercial leasing costs)
be paid to HUD. The Syndicating  Partnerships are presently attempting to extend
the  agreement  through  the year  2001,  subject  to HUD's  right to cancel the
agreement  upon sixty days notice prior to any  anniversary  of the agreement if
the loan is sold to a third party.  The extension of the agreement  would permit
the Syndicating  Partnerships to retain  ownership of its properties to possibly
benefit from any recovery of the local market, should one occur. However,  given
the level of debt  encumbering  the  properties,  it is likely  the  Syndicating
Partnerships  will  not  realize  any  proceeds  from  the  disposition  of  its
properties,  whether by sale or through  mortgage  foreclosure.  Therefore,  the
Registrant presently carries the interest at a net realizable value of zero. See
"Item 8, Financial Statements" - Note 4."

         19NY.  The  Registrant  owns an  interest  in 1626 New York  Associates
Limited Partnership ("1626"), a Syndicating  Partnership which holds an interest
in Nineteen New York Properties ("19NY"). 19NY originally acquired 19 commercial
properties in 1984. Since acquisition, 19NY has refinanced ten of its properties
and  sold or  traded  twelve  properties  (including  four of  those  previously
refinanced).  In 1986, 19NY acquired the land beneath one of its properties, the
Gulf & Western  Building,  by trading two of its properties.  In connection with
the refinancing of one of the mortgages on the Gulf + Western  Building in 1988,
the Gulf +  Western  Building  and its  underlying  land were  contributed  to a
general  partnership  owned  by  1626  and  19NY  known  as 15  Columbus  Circle
Associates ("15CC").  15CC filed for bankruptcy protection in November 1991 and,
pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization,  the Gulf + Western Building was
sold in February 1993 to its principal  mortgage lender.  19NY also sold another
property in 1993. As of December 31, 1995, 19NY owned seven properties.

         In  February  1996,  19NY  restructured  the  mortgage  loans  on  four
commercial properties, and conveyed one other property to its mortgage lender in
consideration for the release of a



<PAGE>



mortgage loan held by that lender on another property. The mortgage loans on the
four commercial  properties now mature in February 1998, with the mortgage loans
on the remaining two properties  maturing in December 1997, with a possible four
year  extension  provided  certain  conditions  are met. The  restructing of the
mortgage  loans  should  permit 19NY to retain  ownership of its  properties  to
possibly  benefit  from any  recovery  of the New York office  building  market,
should one occur.  However,  given the level of debt encumbering the properties,
it is likely 19NY will not  realize any  proceeds  from the  disposition  of its
properties,  whether by sale or through  mortgage  foreclosure.  Therefore,  the
Registrant presently carries the interest at a net realizable value of zero. See
"Item 8, Financial Statements" Note 4."

         More  complete  descriptions  of One  Financial  Place,  River City and
Nineteen New York Properties and the terms of the Registrant's investment in the
related  Syndicating  Partnerships are set forth at pages 2-41 of the Supplement
to the Prospectus dated December 27, 1983,  which  descriptions are incorporated
by  reference  herein.  The  Supplement  to the  Prospectus  was filed  with the
Commission  as  part  of  Post-Effective  Amendment  No.  2 to the  Registrant's
Registration Statement on Form S-11 (Registration No. 2-83272). The descriptions
contained in the Supplement are incorporated by this reference herein.

Employees

         The Registrant does not have any employees.  Services are performed for
the Registrant by the General Partners and agents retained by it.

Change in Control.

         Two Winthrop is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Winthrop Corporation
("First  Winthrop"),  a Delaware  corporation,  which in turn is wholly-owned by
Winthrop Financial Associates, A Limited Partnership,  a Maryland public limited
partnership ("WFA").

     Until December 22, 1994,  Mr. Arthur J. Halleran,  Jr. was the sole general
partner of Linnaeus  Associates  Limited  Partnership  ("Linnaeus") which is the
sole general  partner of WFA. On December 22,  1994,  pursuant to an  Investment
Agreement  entered into among Nomura Asset  Capital  Corporation  ("NACC"),  Mr.
Halleran and certain other  individuals  who comprised the senior  management of
WFA,  the  general  partnership  interest in Linnaeus  was  transferred  to W.L.
Realty, L.P. ("W.L. Realty"). W.L. Realty is a Delaware limited partnership, the
general  partner of which was, until July 18, 1995,  A.I.  Realty  Company,  LLC
("Realtyco").  The equity  securities of Realtyco were held by certain employees
of NACC.

         On July 18, 1995  Londonderry  Acquisition  II Limited  Partnership,  a
Delaware  limited  partnership  ("Londonderry  II"), an affiliate of Apollo Real
Estate  Advisors,  L.P.  ("Apollo"),  acquired,  among other things,  Realtyco's
general  partner  interest in W.L. Realty and a sixty four percent (64%) limited
partnership  interest in W.L. Realty. WFA owns the remaining thirty five percent
(35%) limited partnership interest in W.L. Realty.

         As a result of the foregoing  acquisitions,  Londonderry II is the sole
general  partner of W.L.  Realty which is the sole general  partner of Linnaeus,
which in turn is the sole general  partner of WFA. As a result of the foregoing,
effective  July 18, 1995,  Londonderry II became the  controlling  entity of the
General Partners.  In connection with the transfer of control,  the officers and
directors  of WFA  resigned  and  Londonderry  II  appointed  new  officers  and
directors. See "Item 10, Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant."

         Until July 18, 1995, the general partners of Linnaeus- Phoenix were Mr.
Halleran and Jonathan W. Wexler,  former  directors,  officers and  employees of
WFA.  Former  employees of First  Winthrop  and WFA are the limited  partners of
Linnaeus-  Phoenix.  On July 18,  1995,  the general  partnership  interest  was
transferred to WFA.


Item 2.           Properties.

         Other than the  investments  in Syndicating  Partnerships  set forth in
Item 1 above, the Registrant does not own any property.

Item 3.           Legal Proceedings.

         Except  as  described  below,  there  are  no  material  pending  legal
proceedings  to which the  Registrant is a party or of which any of its property
is subject.

         Nussbaum, et al v. Winthrop Interim Partners I, et al, Index
No. 7186/92, filed on March 12, 1992 in the Supreme Court of New
York County, New York.

         This  is  an  action  brought  by  six  investor  limited  partners  in
Parsippany  Commerce  against WFA and certain of its  affiliates,  including the
Registrant. The plaintiffs alleged fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach
of  fiduciary  duty in  connection  with the  offering of  investment  units and
subsequent operation of Parsippany Commerce. The plaintiffs sought rescission of
their  investments  of  $77,500  per unit of  limited  partnership  interest  in
Parsippany  Commerce,  for total claimed damages of approximately  $500,000.  In
April 1995, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the
majority of  plaintiffs'  claims.  The plaintiffs  appealed the court's  ruling.
While the appeal was pending, the case was settled in or about July 1995 for the
payment of approximately  $68,000 by Winthrop Financial  Associates and releases
were exchanged.


Item 4.           Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

          No matter  was  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the
period covered by this report.

                                                      PART II

Item 5.           Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related
                  Stockholder Matters.


         The Registrant is a partnership and thus has no common stock.  There is
no  established  public  trading  market for the Units.  Trading in the Units is
sporadic and occurs solely through private transactions.

         As of March 15, 1996, there were 1,743 holders of Units of record.

         Quarterly  distributions of Cash Available for Distribution (as defined
in the  partnership  agreement for the  Registrant)  are payable  within 60 days
after the end of each  quarter.  Ninety- nine percent of any Cash  Available for
Distribution  is  distributed  to Limited  Partners and 1% is distributed to the
General Partners.  There are no restrictions on the present or future ability of
the Registrant to make distributions of Cash Available for Distribution. For the
year ended  December  31,  1984,  $50,000,000  was  distributed  to the  Limited
Partners; an amount equal to their original capital contributions. There were no
cash distributions paid or accrued for the years ended December 31, 1985 through
1995. See "Item 7, Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations," for information relating to the Registrant's ability
to make future distributions.

Item 7.           Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                  Condition and Results of Operations.

         The  Registrant's   business  is  currently   limited  to  holding  and
monitoring its investments in the Syndicating Partnerships.  The Registrant will
not make any further investments.

         The Registrant  requires cash to pay operating expenses associated with
reporting to its Limited Partners,  including audit, printing and mailing costs.
The General Partners have been making loans to the Registrant  sufficient to pay
these  expenses and are expected to do so in future years to the extent that the
Registrant  does  not  receive  cash  flow  from  the  Syndicating  Partnerships
sufficient  to meet such cash  requirements.  However,  there is no  requirement
under  the  Registrant's  partnership  agreement  for the  General  Partners  to
continue to fund operating deficits. To date, the General Partners have advanced
$182,975 to the Registrant,  of which $15,143 was advanced in 1995.  These loans
are non-interest bearing and are to be repaid out of cash distributions, if any,
which the Registrant receives from the Syndicating Partnership. The loans are to
be repaid prior to the Registrant  making any cash  distributions to its Limited
Partners.

         The results of  operations  in 1995 did not differ  significantly  from
those  in  1994 or  1993.  It is  expected  that  the  Registrant's  results  of
operations  in future  years will be similar to those in 1995.  Due to continued
operating deficits and the general market conditions affecting the assets of the
Syndicating  Partnerships,  the Registrant  determined it was necessary to write
down to zero its  investment  in RC  Commercial  and RC  Apartments  in 1989, in
Cherokee Center,  Parsippany  Commerce and 1626 in 1990, and One Financial Place
in 1991.

         It  is  not   anticipated   that  the  Registrant   will  receive  cash
distributions from any of the Syndicating Partnerships in the future. All six of
the Syndicating  Partnerships in which the Registrant  originally  invested have
incurred  severe  financial  problems  due to the  deterioration  of real estate
markets across the United States.

         In 1992,  Cherokee  Center, a Syndicating  Partnership,  was terminated
after it let  lapse  its right to redeem  ownership  of its  property,  Cherokee
Village  Apartments.  The redemption right,  which had a term of one year, arose
from the foreclosure sale of



<PAGE>



Cherokee  Village  Apartment  which  occurred on June 6, 1991.  Cherokee  Center
treated the lapsing of the redemption  right (and not the  foreclosure  sale) as
what  triggered a loss of  ownership  for tax  purposes.  The loss of  ownership
caused Cherokee Center to allocate taxable income to the Registrant in 1992.

         In 1993, Parsippany Commerce, a Syndicating Partnership, was terminated
after it lost  ownership  of its office  building on January 11, 1993  through a
foreclosure sale. Parsippany Commerce originally defaulted on its first mortgage
loan in February 1991 in anticipation of its single tenant vacating the building
in May 1991. The foreclosure caused the allocation of $287,354 in taxable income
to the Registrant in 1993.

         In September  1991, the  Syndicating  Partnership  owning One Financial
Place  defaulted on its mortgage debt and unsecured  loans.  Since that date the
Syndicating  Partnership  attempted to negotiate a restructuring  agreement with
its various lenders. In January,  1995, a restructuring  became effective which,
among other changes, cured the defaults on the Syndicating Partnership's various
secured and unsecured loans, extended the maturity date of its mortgage loans by
three years to October 1, 1998 and reduced its required  debt service  payments.
Thus,  the  restructuring  should permit the  Syndicating  Partnership to retain
ownership  of One  Financial  Place  through  1998 to possibly  benefit from any
recovery of the downtown Chicago office market, if one should occur.

         The two Syndicating Partnerships owning River City have been in default
on their mortgage debt since June 1987. Since then the Syndicating  Partnerships
had attempted to negotiate a restructuring agreement with their lender, the U.S.
Department  of  Housing  and Urban  Development  ("HUD").  In  August,  1994 the
Syndicating  Partnerships  executed  a  restructuring  agreement  which,  for  a
one-year  period,  guaranteed  that HUD would not foreclose on River City if the
Syndicating  Partnerships  make  certain  minimum  debt  service  payments.  The
Syndicating  Partnerships are presently attempting to extend this agreement.  If
HUD does not agree to extend the  agreement,  the  property  may be lost through
foreclosure.

         The  Syndicating   Partnership  owning  Nineteen  New  York  Properties
("19NY")   successfully   stabilized  its  ownership  situation  in  1992  after
defaulting   on  various  debt   obligations.   In  1992,   19NY  executed  debt
restructurings with its two major



<PAGE>



lenders which cured mortgage  defaults  associated with six  properties.  One of
these properties, 1697 Broadway, was subsequently sold to a third party on March
15, 1993.  In January  1993,  19NY  executed a debt  restructuring  with another
lender which cured the mortgage default on an additional  property.  In February
of 1993, a plan of reorganization  was confirmed by the Federal Bankruptcy Court
in the proceeding  affecting 15CC and the Gulf + Western  Building.  Pursuant to
the plan, the Gulf + Western Building was sold to its principal mortgage lender.
The sales of 1697 Broadway and the Gulf + Western Building caused $11,434,817 of
taxable income to be allocated to the Registrant in 1993. In February 1996, 19NY
executed a debt  restructuring  with its lender on four  properties and conveyed
its interest in 227 East 4th to its mortgage lender.

         As a result of these transactions, 19NY owns six properties as of March
31,  1996.  The  principal  goal of  19NY  is to  maintain  ownership  of  these
properties  so  that  it can  control  the  timing  and  terms  of  sale  of its
properties, and possibly recover lost value when and if the New York City office
market experiences a recovery.  However, given the level of debt encumbering all
of 19NY's properties,  it is likely that 19NY will not realize any proceeds from
the  disposition  of  its  properties,  whether  by  sale  or  through  mortgage
foreclosure. The ultimate sale of 19NY's properties will cause taxable income to
be allocated to the Registrant,  but will not produce a cash distribution to the
Registrant.

         On a tax basis,  the  Registrant  has retained a reduced  investment in
each Syndicating  Partnership.  In 1995, the Registrant had sufficient tax basis
in all of the Syndicating  Partnerships to recognize all the losses allocated to
the Registrant.  The Registrant's Limited Partners also had sufficient tax basis
in 1995 to recognize all losses  allocated them. In 1996, it is anticipated that
the Registrant and its Limited  Partners will again have sufficient tax basis to
recognize all of their allocable losses.

                        AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994

<PAGE>


                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Partners of
Winthrop Interim Partners I,
   A Limited Partnership:

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Winthrop Interim Partners I,
A Limited  Partnership (a Maryland limited  partnership) as of December 31, 1995
and 1994, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners' deficit
and cash flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,
1995. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the  Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of Winthrop Interim Partners I, A
Limited  Partnership  as of December  31,1995  and 1994,  and the results of its
operations  and its cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                          WINTHROP INTERIM PARTNERS I,
                              A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                DECEMBER 31, 1995




(1)    ORGANIZATION

       Winthrop  Interim  Partners  I, A  Limited  Partnership  (the  Fund)  was
       organized on April 14, 1983 under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership
       Act of the State of  Maryland.  The Fund will  terminate  on December 31,
       2033 or sooner,  in accordance  with the terms of the Fund's  partnership
       agreement.

(2)    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Basis of Accounting

       The accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared on the accrual
basis of accounting.

       Income Taxes

       No provision  has been made for  federal,  state or local income taxes in
       the  accompanying  financial  statements.  The  partners  are required to
       report on their  individual tax returns their  allocable share of income,
       gains, losses, deductions and credits of the Fund. The Fund files its tax
       returns on the accrual basis.

       Investments in Syndicating Partnerships

       The Fund  invested,  as a  general  or  limited  partner,  and  initially
       maintained   substantial   equity   interests   in   general  or  limited
       partnerships and joint ventures (the Syndicating Partnerships), which own
       real estate or other property. The Syndicating  Partnerships entered into
       credit   arrangements   with  lending   institutions   to  finance  their
       organization  and  acquisition  of  properties  prior to the admission of
       additional  partners (the Additional  Partners).  The Fund guaranteed the
       Syndicating  Partnerships'  credit obligations and pledged certain of its
       assets to the lending institutions.  Upon the admission of the Additional
       Partners,  the obligations under the credit arrangements were repaid, and
       the Fund's pledged collateral was released.  The Fund continues to act as
       a partner of the Syndicating Partnerships with a reduced equity interest.

       The Fund  accounts  for these  investments,  both  prior to and after the
       admission of  Additional  Partners,  on the cost basis.  This  accounting
       policy is being followed since the Fund's period of substantial ownership
       was  expected  to  be  temporary   and  the  Fund  does  not  control  or
       significantly  influence the  day-to-day  operations  of the  Syndicating
       Partnerships.

                          WINTHROP INTERIM PARTNERS I,

                              A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                DECEMBER 31, 1995

                                   (Continued)


(2)    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

       Investments in Syndicating Partnerships (Continued)

       In general,  under the cost method of  accounting  for  investments,  the
       investment is recorded at cost, unless a permanent impairment in value to
       less than cost has  occurred,  in which  case the  carrying  value of the
       investment is reduced.  Any  distributions are recorded as income, to the
       extent that they are a distribution of earnings.

       Distributions to Partners

       As  provided  for  in  the  Fund's   Partnership   Agreement,   quarterly
       distributions are payable to the Partners within 60 days after the end of
       the quarter.  The Fund's cash available for  distribution  is computed as
       cash available from operations less amounts set aside as reserves.  As of
       December 31, 1995, there was no cash available for distribution.

(3)    TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

       Two Winthrop  Properties,  Inc.  (Two  Winthrop),  the  Managing  General
       Partner,  is a wholly owned  subsidiary  of First  Winthrop  Corporation,
       which in turn is wholly owned by Winthrop Financial Associates, A Limited
       Partnership.

       The general  partners are entitled to 1% of any profits or losses for tax
       purposes and 1% of cash available for distribution.  The general partners
       currently  satisfy  all the Fund's  cash  requirements  for  general  and
       administrative  expenses through  noninterest-bearing  loans to be repaid
       out of future  cash flows from the  Syndicating  Partnerships.  It is not
       practicable  to estimate the fair value of these loans  because it cannot
       be determined  whether  financing with similar terms and conditions would
       be available to the Partnership.

       Affiliates of the general partners earned various fees in connection with
       the formation and operations of the Syndicating Partnerships.  During the
       liquidation  stage of the Fund, the general partners and their affiliates
       are entitled to receive certain distributions, as described in the Fund's
       partnership agreement.

(4)    INVESTMENTS IN SYNDICATING PARTNERSHIPS

       The Fund  invested a total of  $2,904,000  and acquired  initial  general
       partner  equity  interests  ranging  from  75% to 99% in six  Syndicating
       Partnerships.  All of the Syndicating  Partnerships  admitted  Additional
       Partners, and the Fund's equity interest was subsequently reduced in each
       case to less than 6%. The Fund  currently  accounts  for all  investments
       under the cost method of accounting. Due to continued operating deficits,
       debt defaults and the general market conditions affecting the assets, the
       Fund  determined it was necessary to write down the investment in all the
       partnerships to their net realizable value of zero.

       During  1993,   the  investment  in  another   Syndicating   Partnership,
       Parsippany Commerce Associates Limited Partnership,  was terminated after
       it lost ownership of its office building  through a foreclosure sale held
       in January 1993.

       The  Fund no  longer  guarantees  any of the four  remaining  Syndicating
       Partnerships' credit obligations to the lending institutions.

(5)    TAX LOSS

       The Fund's  tax loss for 1995 differs from the net loss for financial
       reporting  purposes due to accounting  differences in the  recognition of
       the Fund's share of the Syndicating Partnerships' results of operations.
       The tax loss for 1995 is as follows:

        Net loss for financial reporting purposes              $     15,147

        Add--Equity in Syndicating Partnerships' tax loss           318,001

                 Tax loss                                      $    333,148

Item 11.  Executive Compensation.

Partner  does not  presently  pay any  compensation  to any of its  officers and
directors (See "Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions").


Item 12.          Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and

<PAGE>







         (c)      Changes in Control.

                  There  exists  no  arrangement  known  to the  Registrant  the
operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the
Registrant, except as follows:

                  In  connection  with its  acquisition  of control of Linnaeus,
Londonderry  II issued NACC a $22 million  non-recourse  purchase money note due
1998 (the "Purchase Money Note"), as set forth in a loan agreement,  dated as of
July 14, 1995, by and between NACC and Londonderry II. Initial  security for the
Purchase Money Note includes,  among other things, the partnership  interests in
W.L. Realty acquired by Londonderry II and the W.L. Realty partnership  interest
in Linnaeus.  Accordingly,  if Londonderry  II does not satisfy its  obligations
under the Purchase Money Note,  NACC would have the right to foreclose upon this
security and, as a result, would gain control of the Registrant.


Item 13.          Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

         (a)      Transactions with Management and Others.

                  As of March 15, 1996,  the  Registrant  has borrowed  $182,975
from the General Partners to fund its operating expenses. No interest accrues on
this loan and no  imputed  interest  is  calculated  for tax or other  reporting
purposes. Since the Registrant is a limited partnership,  it has no directors or
officers.  In addition,  the Registrant has had no transactions  with individual
officers or directors of the Managing  General  Partner  other than any indirect
interest such officers and  directors may have in the  compensation  paid to the
Managing  General  Partner,  or its  affiliates by virtue of (i) their  indirect
ownership in WFA, the indirect parent of the Managing General  Partner,  or (ii)
their partnership interests in Linnaeus-Phoenix

         The  General  Partners  and their  affiliates  are  entitled to receive
certain  cash  distributions  and  allocations  of  taxable  income or loss.  In
addition,  affiliates  of the  general  partners  have  earned  various  fees in
connection  with the formation and operations of the  Syndicating  Partnerships.
The amounts of these items and the times at which they are payable are described
at pages 14-15 and 21-22 of the Prospectus under the captions
