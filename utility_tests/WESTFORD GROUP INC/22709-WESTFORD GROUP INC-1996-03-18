                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business

The Registrant (which term unless otherwise indicated, includes the Registrant
and its subsidiary) was incorporated in Ohio in 1972 and was a bank holding
company prior to August 15, 1978. Effective as of that date, the Registrant sold
all of its controlling interest in the Community National Bank of Mt. Gilead,
Ohio ("Mt. Gilead Bank").

Following the disposition of the Mt. Gilead Bank, the intention of the
Registrant was to utilize a portion of the sale proceeds to commence operations
as a reinsurer in the credit life and disability reinsurance business. These
operations, however, were frustrated as a result of shareholder litigation which
was eventually settled and dismissed.

On January 12, 1988, American Legal Publishing Corporation ("ALP Corporation"),
a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Westford Group, Inc., purchased
substantially all of the assets of AM Comp, Inc., formerly American Legal
Publishing Company. The acquired assets consisted generally of inventory,
equipment, supplies, computer software, contracts, leasehold interest and
various other intangibles. See note 1(f) to the consolidated financial
statements.

ALP Corporation's primary business consists of the codification of municipal and
county Codes of Ordinances and the supplementing thereof. The services provided
by ALP Corporation to a customer in providing codification services include:

       (1)    A review of the municipal ordinances of the customer to detect
              possible conflicts with state and federal law, state and federal
              constitutions, and state and federal court decisions. This review
              is done at the specific direction of the customer's attorney.

       (2)    A review of the ordinances of the customer to make sure that they
              do not conflict with other ordinances or the charter, if one
              exists.

       (3)    Suggestions to the customer for changes, additions and deletions
              to their ordinances. After editorial and indexing work is
              concluded, the code is enacted into law and published in a
              loose-leaf form to facilitate regular supplementing to reflect
              changes in state and local law.

ALP Corporation believes that the additional services it provides in codifying a
customer's ordinances distinguish it from competitors.

Most of ALP Corporation's codification contracts include a provision to
supplement the customer's code, not less than annually, for a period of five (5)
years. Although the agreement may usually be terminated by the customer by
written notice prior to ninety (90) days before the anticipated delivery date of
the supplement, ALP Corporation has generally been successful in retaining
municipalities on supplemental contracts, and in having these contracts renewed
prior to expiration.

Some states now require that municipalities and/or counties each have a Code of
Ordinances. For this reason, ALP Corporation has prepared and marketed a "Basic
Code of Ordinances" to smaller municipalities in these states who do not need or
cannot afford a custom Code of Ordinances but who, by adoption of a basic code,
can meet state law requirements or receive the economic benefits of having a
local code. ALP Corporation has developed this basic or model Code of Ordinances
for the states of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and North Carolina. It has
also developed, and is marketing with a Texas firm, a model Code of Ordinances
for Texas. In North Carolina and Kentucky, ALP Corporation serves as the
official code consultant to the state municipal leagues. Furthermore, in 1985,
the State of Kentucky enacted legislation providing grants to municipalities to
fund a Code of Ordinances as mandated by state law.

ALP Corporation presently has twenty-seven (27) full-time and one (1) part-time
employees. The staff consists of marketing, production, general administrative
and editorial personnel, seven (7) of whom have law degrees.

Item 1.  Business (continued)

There are approximately twenty-five (25) companies involved in the codification
of local government ordinances. Five (5) companies operate on either a national
or regional basis, with the rest serving clients only within a relatively small
geographic area. ALP Corporation currently represents approximately 825 local
governmental units in twenty-five (25) states.

In the past few years, ALP Corporation has worked to develop a strong
telemarketing program. The result has been more comprehensive coverage of market
areas, an increase in the number of proposals generated, and higher projected
sales volume. ALP Corporation intends to establish a consistent direct mail
program and to develop a print media advertising campaign.

The success of ALP Corporation's basic code programs has induced the Registrant
to continue to search for similar opportunities in other states. Basic code
products fill a need at the low end of the price market. They are attractive low
cost options for small municipalities who would otherwise forego any code
service.

Rapid growth in the codification industry is most easily attainable through
acquisition of competitors. In recent years, ALP Corporation held serious
discussions with competitors regarding the purchase of such operations by ALP
Corporation. However, no agreements have been reached to date.

A logical opportunity for diversification lies in the school textbook market.
Nearly all states require the teaching of the rudiments of civics and government
in elementary and secondary schools. Educators, however, have noted the lack of
suitable texts concerning the basics of state and local government. National
publishers, seeking to produce a single book which can be sold nationwide, have
produced texts which focus almost entirely on the federal system and which give
almost no attention to the extensive differences in the operations of the
various states and their local governments.

ALP Corporation, by the nature of its business, enjoys a unique position through
which it can provide educational institutions with pertinent social studies
topics and other textbook update materials. Presently, the company publishes an
educational newsletter which aids teachers in presenting current state and local
government issues to students.

Item 2.  Properties

The executive offices of the Registrant are located in an office building at 20
East Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio. The office facilities are shared with other
affiliated entities and rental and bookkeeping expenses are allocated among
them. The Registrant does not own any materially important property used in its
operations.

In August 1991, ALP Corporation relocated to occupy 3,520 square feet of
rentable area on the 12th floor of the building located at 432 Walnut Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio and effective March 1, 1994, expanded into an additional 2,038
square feet for a total square footage of 5,558 under an operating lease which
will expire July 31, 1998. The lease provides for a monthly rental of $4,809,
net of reimbursements payable to the lessor for cost of maintenance and
operation of the building.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

None.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters To a Vote of Security Holders

None.

Item 5.  Market for the Registrant's Common Stock and Related Security Holders 
         Matters

(a)    Market information

       There is no established public trading market for the Registrant's
       shares.

       The Registrant does not have reliable information with respect to high
       and low bid prices for each quarter.

(b)    Holders

       The number of holders of record of the Registrant's Common Stock as of
       February 16, 1996 was 2,090.

(c)    Dividends

       There has been no cash dividend declared or paid on the Registrant's
       outstanding common stock for the two most recent fiscal years. The
       Registrant's intent is to reinvest earnings to finance its growth for the
       purpose of improving and increasing both earnings per share and net
       worth, and therefore it is not anticipated that the Registrant will pay
       dividends in the foreseeable future.

Results of Operations

The Company's business is principally carried on through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, ALP Corporation. ALP Corporation's sales increased 12.5% during 1995
as compared to 1994. Codification revenue increased 5.2% due to the addition of
several significant customers primarily resulting from an accelerated marketing
effort and the recognition of additional revenues earned on contract escalator
charges. Subscription services on existing codes of ordinance increased 17.7%
due to production reorganization which resulted in accelerated completion of
codification production and commencement of supplementation production. Gross
margin increased in 1995 as compared with 1994. However, as sales increased,
cost of sales increased 11.5% primarily due to increases in production salaries
and related costs, insurance and maintenance expense. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased 2.1% in 1995 as compared to 1994 due to
increases in administrative salaries and related costs, legal and professional,
advertising and travel.

ALP Corporation's sales increased 15.7% during 1994 as compared to 1993.
Codification revenue increased 16.2% during 1994 as compared to 1993 due to the
addition of a significant new customer. Subscription services on existing codes
of ordinance increased 15.4%. Cost of sales increased 23.2% during 1994 as
compared to 1993 due to increases in production supply expense, salaries and
rent. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.7% during 1994
as compared to 1993 due to increases in advertising, consulting, rent, sales
commissions and travel.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations (continued)

ALP Corporation's sales for 1993 remained relatively constant compared with
1992. While codification revenue decreased 1.0%, there was a 19.3% increase in
supplemental services on existing codes of ordinance. The decrease in
codification revenue was primarily due to a reduction in 1992 codification sales
which created a shortfall in work-in-process inventory and the transfer of
several editorial personnel from codification to supplemental services
production during 1993. The increase in supplemental services on existing codes
of ordinance resulted from increased production of codes prepared during 1992
and the resulting increased supplemental services thereafter during 1993. Cost
of sales decreased 5.5% due to reductions in equipment rental and production
supply expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 19.5%
due to an increase in travel, commissions, advertising and insurance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Although it is impossible to estimate accurately the future cash flow from the
operations of the Registrant's codification business, management believes
Registrant's effective capital costs may increase. Management is actively
exploring further avenues for preserving capital and improving liquidity. As of
December 31, 1995, the Company had a revolving credit agreement with a bank to
provide a $250,000 note. The credit facility has a maturity date of July 15,
1996, and bears interest at the banks prime rate (8.5% per annum at December 31,
1995). Management does not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that will
have or that are reasonably likely to have material effect on the Registrant's
liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.

Factors to Consider Forward Looking

Management has undertaken several initiatives in 1995 which should favorably
impact operating performance in 1996, although there can be no assurance that a
favorable impact will result. Significant cost-cutting measures have been
implemented in an effort to reduce overhead and production-related expenses.
Increased market penetration should position the Company to take advantage of a
number of growth opportunities in the future.

Management has restructured a number of production functions intended to improve
the Company's productivity going forward. Reassignment of experienced production
staff to selected line positions should provide increased efficiencies.
Additional efficiencies should result from the introduction of new production
equipment and production flows utilizing optical scanners, a computer
communications network and a high capacity printer.

The Company expects to continue expanding its direct sale force, which should
allow the Company to increase its market penetration. These activities will be
directed toward selected market niches where management believes the Company
will be able to provide customers with additional services which distinguish it
from competitors.

Deferred Taxes

The Company has substantial tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences
which give rise to deferred tax assets. Based on an analysis of the likelihood
of realizing the Company's gross deferred tax asset, the Company has determined
that the recognition criteria set forth in SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", are not met for the entire gross deferred tax asset and, accordingly,
the gross deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance.

Management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax
asset at December 31, 1994 will be realized primarily through the generation of
taxable income during the loss carryforward period. This belief derives from an
analysis of estimated future taxable income that incorporates an increase in
sales during the loss carryforward period generated by increases in new
contracts and code supplements related to the prior years new contracts. The
Company will need to generate taxable income of approximately $95,000 a year
over the next two years in order to realize a significant portion of the net
deferred tax assets. After 1996, the amount of taxable income required to
realize the remaining net deferred tax assets is approximately

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations (continued)

$50,000 a year. Historically, there has been an insignificant difference between
pre-tax earnings for financial reporting purposes and taxable income for income
tax purposes. As is the case with any estimate of future results, there will be
differences between assumed and actual economic and business conditions of
future periods. Moreover, the estimate may also be affected by unpredictable
future events, including, but not necessarily limited to, changes in the
Company's capital structure and future acquisitions and dispositions. Therefore,
the analysis of estimated future taxable income will be reviewed and updated
periodically and any required adjustments, which may increase or decrease the
net deferred tax asset, will be made in the period in which the developments on
which they are based become known. During 1993, the Company reduced the
valuation allowance to reflect management's revised projection of future taxable
income resulting in a $133,837 increase to income in the fourth quarter of 1993.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company has available unused operating loss
carryovers for Federal tax and financial statement purposes of approximately
$436,000 which expire as follows:

                1996       $104,000               2001        $ 17,000
                1997       $ 53,000               2002        $ 19,000
                1998       $ 24,000               2003        $ 23,000
                1999       $ 22,000               2005        $ 34,000
                2000       $ 30,000               2009        $110,000



Intangible Asset

The excess of AM Comp, Inc.'s net assets acquired over the purchase price of
approximately $160,000 was allocated to the database. The database is comprised
of the municipal code data and related files and has been developed internally.
Provision for amortization of the database is based on an estimated useful life
of forty years reflecting the long lived nature of municipal codes.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") periodically issues Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS"), some of which require implementation
by a date falling after the close of the Company's fiscal year.

FASB has issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. This accounting
standard encourages, but does not require, companies to recognize compensation
expense for grants of stock, stock options and other equity instruments to
employees based on the new fair value accounting rules. Companies that choose
not to adopt the new rules will continue to apply the existing accounting rules
contained in Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees." The Company does not offer stock-based compensation to its
employees and therefore is not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Inflation

Management does not consider the impact of changing prices to be material in the
analysis of the Company's overall operations.

Trends

The Company's results of operations have varied from quarter to quarter
principally because of fluctuations in production results. The Company's
experience indicates that sales increase during second and third quarters as a
result of sales to basic code subscribers. The Company expects that such
quarterly fluctuations may lessen as the percentage of the Company's new sales
are made to clients with fiscal years other than December 31, although there can
be no assurance that this will occur.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993

(1)     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the following
           significant accounting policies:

        (a)   Consolidation Policy

                The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of
                   Westford Group, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly-owned
                   subsidiary, American Legal Publishing Corporation (ALP
                   Corporation). ALP Corporation is engaged in the codification
                   of municipal and county codes of ordinances and the
                   supplementing thereof. All significant intercompany
                   transactions and balances have been eliminated in this
                   consolidation.

                The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
                   generally accepted accounting principles requires management
                   to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
                   amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
                   contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
                   financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
                   expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
                   differ from those estimates. Note 1(b)).

        (b)   Revenue and Cost Recognition

                Revenue from municipal code contracts is recognized on the
                   percentage-of-completion method; completion is measured
                   based on the percentage of direct labor costs incurred to
                   date to estimated direct labor costs for each contract. While
                   management uses available information to estimate total
                   direct labor costs on each contract, actual experience may
                   vary from estimated amounts. Under this method, the costs
                   incurred and the related revenues are included in the
                   statement of operations as work progresses. Adjustments to
                   contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the
                   facts which require such revisions become known. If a revised
                   estimate indicates a loss, such loss is provided for in its
                   entirety. The amount by which revenues are earned in advance
                   of contractual collection dates is an unbilled receivable and
                   the amount by which contractual billings exceed earned
                   revenues is unrealized revenue which is carried as a
                   liability.

                Revenue from code supplements is recognized on the
                   completed-contract method because the typical supplement is
                   completed in approximately two months. No progress payments
                   are billed due to the short production time and the low
                   average supplement contract price. Supplement contracts in
                   process are valued at the lower of cost or contract price
                   less estimated cost of completion. The asset, "Costs of
                   uncompleted code supplements," represents all supplement
                   costs incurred to date. Provisions for estimated losses on
                   uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses
                   are determined.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued

        (c)   Property and Equipment

                Property and equipment are recorded on a cost basis.
                   Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method in
                   amounts adequate to amortize costs over the estimated useful
                   life of the applicable asset. Equipment under capital leases
                   is stated at the present value of the net minimum lease
                   payments and is amortized over the lease term. When assets
                   are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
                   accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
                   any resulting gain or loss is recognized as income for the
                   period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to
                   income as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are
                   capitalized.

        (d)   Federal Income Taxes

                Westford Group, Inc. files a consolidated Federal income tax
                   return with its subsidiary. Deferred tax liabilities and
                   assets have been recognized for the expected future tax
                   consequences of events that have been included in the
                   financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes
                   for temporary differences between financial statement and
                   income tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating
                   loss carryforwards are recognized at the average graduated
                   tax rate for the estimated amount of taxable income in future
                   years.

        (e)   Net Income Per Common Share

                Net income per common share is computed on the basis of the
                   weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
                   the year, including the outstanding convertible debenture,
                   which is included as a common stock equivalent.

        (f)   Intangible Asset

                During 1988, the Company acquired substantially all the assets
                   of AM Comp, Inc., in an acquisition accounted for as a
                   purchase. The excess of AM Comp, Inc.'s net assets acquired
                   over the purchase price of $165,654 was allocated to the
                   database. The database is comprised of the municipal code
                   data and related files. Provision for amortization of the
                   database is based on an estimated useful life of forty years
                   and is computed on the straight-line method.

                In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No.121, "Accounting for the
                   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
                   Be Disposed" which requires that long-lived assets be
                   evaluated for impairment and establishes guidance for
                   recognizing and measuring impairment losses. This statement
                   applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning
                   after December 15, 1995. Management does not believe that the
                   adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on
                   the financial statements.

(6)     Debenture Payable

        On August 7, 1992, a resolution was adopted by the Company to authorize
           a $50,000 convertible subordinated debenture, due December 31, 1995,
           issued to Bancinsurance Corporation, an affiliate of the Company
           through a common officer and principal shareholder. Each $1,000 of
           principal is convertible into 6,900 shares of common stock at the
           holder's option. The debenture may be prepaid, in whole or in part,
           by the Company upon thirty days prior written notice without penalty.
           Interest accrues at the rate of ten percent per annum and is payable
           quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September, and
           December until the principal sum has been paid. In the event of
           default, all obligations shall become immediately due and payable at
           the option of the holder. On December 1, 1995, a resolution was
           adopted by the Company to renew the debenture. The maturity was
           extended to December 31, 2000.

(7)     Federal Income Taxes

        Deferred income taxes for 1995 and 1994 reflect the impact of "temporary
           differences" between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
           reporting purposes and such amounts as measured on an income tax
           basis. Temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to the
           net deferred tax asset at December 31, are as follows:

</TABLE>

        As of December 31, 1995, the Company has net operating loss ("NOL")
         carryforwards of approximately $435,640 which expire at various dates
         through 2009. The valuation allowance represents the portion of these
         net operating loss carryforwards at enacted tax rates not expected to
         be utilized through future taxable income. Net deferred tax assets and
         federal income tax expense in future years can be significantly
         affected by changes in enacted tax rates or by unexpected adverse
         events that would impact management's conclusions as to the ultimate
         realizability of deferred tax assets.

        The provision for Federal income taxes at December 31, consists of the

        During 1995, the Company issued 5,000 shares of treasury stock to an
           officer as a performance bonus. An amount equal to the fair value of
           the shares issued ($250) has been charged to expense.

        On March 1, 1996, the Company implemented the American Legal Publishing
           Corporation Employee 401(K) Plan (the "401(K) Plan"). The 401(K) Plan
           is available to full-time employees who meet the 401(K) Plan's
           eligibility requirements. Under the 401(K) Plan, the Company matches
           50% of the qualified employee's contribution up to 6%.
