                                     PART I

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Unitel Video, Inc. (the "COMPANY") provides a full range of services to the
video communications industry for the recording, editing and duplication of
television programs, commercials and corporate and other communications on
videotape.  The Company's services are provided primarily in the following
areas: studio videotape recording, mobile videotape recording and live
telecasting, film to videotape transfer, editing, computer graphics and
videotape duplication.  The Company also designs and produces custom CD-ROM, CD-
I, videodisc and networked multimedia presentations.

     The Company's services are provided at facilities located in New York City,
Los Angeles and Chicago and through the Company's Mobile division based in
Pittsburgh.  The Company's Mobile division provides "on-location" services,
including technical personnel, for videotape recording and live telecasting of
sports, cultural and other events throughout North America.

     As the Company is in a service industry, it does not use raw materials.  It
does, however, use videotape.  Videotape is readily available from numerous
sources and the Company has not experienced, nor does it anticipate
experiencing, difficulty in obtaining videotape for its operations.  In
addition, the Company has service contracts with its customers, generally for
facilities and personnel at specific times or on a project or job-by-job basis
(as more fully described below under the caption "Marketing") and, accordingly,
does not have backlog as such.

     The Company's cost structure is such that depreciation, selling expenses
and general and administrative expenses do not generally fluctuate from quarter
to quarter during a fiscal year based on sales volume.  Furthermore, a majority
of production costs are fixed.  Accordingly, relatively small variations in
quarterly sales historically have resulted in disproportionately greater
variations in net earnings.  In part due to the foregoing, during fiscal years
1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company recognized a significantly greater proportion
of net earnings in the first quarter as compared to the other quarters of the
fiscal year.  See Note L to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

SERVICES

     STUDIO VIDEOTAPE RECORDING.  The Company provides the studios, equipment
and skilled technical personnel needed to record television programs,
commercials and corporate and other videotape communications.  The equipment
includes color television cameras, videotape recorders, sound monitoring and
mixing equipment and lighting equipment.  The Company does not generally provide
program direction or other artistic or non-technical production services, such
as the preparation of scripts, the hiring of performers or the supplying of
special props or scenery.  The Company operates nine studios in New York City.

  Among the programs produced at the Company's studio facilities are "The Sally
Jessy Raphael Show", "Inside Edition", "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "The Rolonda
Watts Show", "American Journal", "The Gordon Elliot Show", "The Mark Walberg
Show" and "The Carnie Wilson Show".  Studio recording accounted for
approximately 16%, 15% and 16% of the Company's revenues during the fiscal years
ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


                                        3

<PAGE>

     MOBILE VIDEOTAPE RECORDING AND LIVE TELECASTING.  The Company's Mobile
division provides videotape recording and live telecasting services "on-
location" by transporting videotape and other related equipment in its mobile
vehicles.  These vehicles have been designed to serve as the production control
center for events in sports arenas, concert halls, theaters and other locations.
The Company also arranges for the skilled technical personnel required to
perform these services.  The Company's ten mobile vehicles are equipped to
travel on a continuous basis throughout North America and can be maintained in
the field.  The Company's Mobile division accounted for approximately 21%, 19%
and 18% of the Company's revenues during the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  In February 1995, the Company acquired the assets
of Burbank, California based GC & Co. which added three mobile units to the
Company's fleet of seven.  Some of the events handled by the Company's mobile
production units include "Live from the Met", "Live from Lincoln Center", "The
Grammy Awards", "The Emmy Awards", "The Academy Awards", major golf and tennis
tournaments, broadcast of Pittsburgh Pirates, Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue
Jays major league baseball games, Major League Baseball's Allstar, Playoff and
World Series games and the international broadcast of the "Super Bowl".

     FILM TO VIDEOTAPE TRANSFER.  The Company provides the facilities and
technical personnel for transferring 16mm and 35mm motion picture positive and
negative film and slides to videotape.  Through the use of computers, the color
of the picture may be corrected, altered or enhanced frame by frame to meet
client needs.  Film to videotape transfer accounted for approximately 9%, 9% and
10% of the Company's revenues during the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company has performed this service for major
theatrical motion pictures such as "Waterworld",
"Batman Forever" and "Congo", and television programs such as "Murder, She
Wrote" and "Homicide".

     EDITING.  The Company provides editing equipment and skilled personnel
required to perform the editing, special optical and audio effects, titling and
other technical work necessary to produce a master videotape suitable for
broadcast, cablecast, duplication or other distribution.  Using computer-
controlled electronic editing equipment, video and audio tape recorders and
special effects and titling equipment, videotape recorded by the Company or
others is processed into a finished product.  Additionally, the Company provides
creative editorial and editorial supervision through the post production process
and consultative storyboard services directly to advertising agencies.  Editing
accounted for approximately 35%, 37% and 40% of the Company's revenues during
the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Among the
programs edited at the Company's facilities are " Star Trek:Voyager", "Star
Trek: Deep Space Nine", "Grace Under Fire", "Cybill", "The Simpsons" and
"Homicide".

     COMPUTER GRAPHICS.  The Company offers creative consultation, technical
assistance and full-service facilities for the creation of computer-generated
graphics, special effects and animation in the digital format in both 2-D and 3-
D.  These services accounted for approximately 9% of the Company's revenues in
fiscal 1995 and 10% during each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 1994 and
1993.  The Company's projects in this area include various commercials for
Blockbuster Video, Sharp Electronics, Subway, McDonalds, Procter Gamble, General
Mills and Oldsmobile.


                                        4

<PAGE>

     VIDEOTAPE DUPLICATION.  The Company furnishes videotape duplication
services in all formats, including formats available for broadcast and cablecast
in the United States as well as the multiple formats used abroad.  Duplication
services accounted for approximately 4%, 5% and 6% of the Company's revenues
during the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA PRODUCTION.  The Company designs and produces custom
CD-ROM, CD-I, videodisc and networked multimedia presentations for clients in
the publishing, financial services, pharmaceutical, entertainment, advertising,
retail, telecommunications and utility industries.  Extensive use of other
Company resources are integrated into the productions, including video
compression, digital to video transfers, 3-D computer graphic creation and
studio and location recording.  Interactive multimedia production accounted for
approximately 1% of the Company's revenues during each of the fiscal years ended
August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

MARKETING

     The Company markets its services principally to cable television program
suppliers, independent producers, national television networks, local television
stations, motion picture studios, advertising agencies, program syndicators and
distributors through the direct efforts of its internal sales personnel and
through advertising in certain trade publications.  The Company has no material
patents.  The Company markets its services through the use of the Unitel, Editel
and Windsor names.

     Customers for editing services, film-to-tape transfer, computer graphics
and videotape recording of television commercials generally make arrangements
for the Company's services without significant advance notice, on a project or
job-by-job basis.  Customers for studio and "on-location" videotape recording or
live telecasting of programs generally make arrangements longer in advance of
the time when the facilities and services are required.  The Company has entered
into arrangements with several customers for periods ranging up to three years
to provide editing, mobile videotape recording and/or studio videotape recording
services.  No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total sales
for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1995.

COMPETITION

     The video services industry is highly competitive.  Certain videotape
service businesses (both independent companies and divisions of diversified
companies) provide most of the same services provided by the Company, while
others specialize in one or several of these services.  Editing and videotape
recording services are also subject to competition from the film industry.
While the Company provides the facilities for the transfer of film to videotape,
it does not perform any services directly on film.

     Many competitors of the Company, some with greater financial resources, are
located in the New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago areas, the principal
markets for the Company's services other than "on-location" video services.
"On-location" video services provided by the Company compete on a nationwide
basis with companies located throughout North America.



                                        5

<PAGE>

     The Company competes on the basis of the overall quality of the services it
provides, state-of-the-art equipment, breadth of services, reputation in the
industry and location.  The Company also competes on the basis of its ability to
attract and retain qualified, highly skilled personnel.  The Company believes
that prices for its services are competitive within its industry, although some
competitors may offer certain of their services at lower rates than the Company.
The video services industry has been and is likely to continue to be subject to
technological change to which the Company must respond in order to remain
competitive.

EMPLOYEES

     At August 31, 1995, the Company had 474 full-time employees.  The Company's
Unitel-New York division post-production personnel (22 employees) are members of
the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, AFL-CIO, under
a contract with the Company which expires in April 1997.

     The technical personnel of the Company's Editel-Los Angeles division
(44 employees) are represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees ("IATSE"), under a contract which expires in November 1997.  A portion
of the Company's Editel-New York technical personnel (44 employees) are
represented by IATSE under a three year contract which expired in May 1994.
Negotiations for a new contract, which are currently underway, have historically
been completed after the expiration of the previous contract.  A portion of the
Company's Editel-New York administrative staff (8 employees) are also
represented by IATSE under a three year contract which expired in December 1994.
Negotiations for a new contract, which are currently underway have historically
been completed after the expiration of the previous contract.

     The Company believes that its employee relations are generally
satisfactory.

DEVELOPMENTS

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" which provides
guidance on when to assess and how to measure impairment of long-lived assets,
certain intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used,
and for long-lived assets and certain indentifiable intangibles to be disposed
of.  The Company adopted this statement as of August 31, 1995.

The Company has decided to focus its resources toward providing services to
the entertainment and corporate communications areas, which represents the
Company's strength.  As part of the strategy, the Company has decided to sell
its Editel New York, Editel Chicago and Editel Los Angeles divisions, which
specialize in the highly competitive commercial advertising portion of the
video facilities industry.  During the 1995 fiscal year, the three Editel
divisions incurred a pretax loss of $3,682,000.  As a result the Company
identified property, plant and equipment associated with these divisions with
a carrying value of approximately $24,000,000 that it no longer needed for
its current and future operations, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal
1995 committed to a plan to dispose of them.  Accordingly, the Company began
marketing these divisions to potential buyers and plans to sell them.
Although the Company intends to sell these assets within one year there is no
assurance that it will be able to do so, accordingly these assets are
classified in the balance sheet as long-term.  The Company estimated the
revised value to be approximately $19,300,000.  Accordingly, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $4,700,000 in 1995 on these
assets, which was included in

                                        6

<PAGE>

impairment charges.  The Company intends to operate these divisions until a sale
is consummated.

     The Company reevaluated its investment in its Windsor division in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 and determined that based upon it's operating
results, the goodwill associated with the purchase of this division and certain
property, plant and equipment that will not provide any future benefits to the
Company were impaired.  The Company recognized an impairment charge of
approximately $3,000,000 included in impairment charges during the fourth
quarter which represents the remaining balance of these assets.

     In May of 1995, the Company adopted a plan to downsize the operations of
its Editel Chicago division and reorganize and reduce its corporate management
which resulted in recording a restructuring charge of $400,000 which is
comprised of severance and early retirement expense. In fiscal 1995 the
restructuring liability was reduced by approximately $127,000 as a result of
severance and retirement payments made during fiscal 1995.  As of August 31,
1995, the balance of the restructuring liability was approximately $273,000 and
is included in accrued payroll.

     In February 1995 the Company acquired the business and assets of GC & Co.,
a Burbank, California based provider of mobile videotape production services.
The purchase price of $6,750,000 was financed with $6,000,000 of cash from the
proceeds of a $6,500,000 equipment financing from an insurance company lender
and a $750,000 subordinated convertible note from the sellers.  The subordinated
note is convertible into 75,000 of the Company's common shares at a stated
conversion price of ten dollars per share.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

     The Company is committed to keeping pace with technological developments as
well as taking advantage of new business opportunities in the video
communications industry.  Capital expenditures were $9,738,000 during fiscal
1995 (exclusive of the acquisition of GC & Co. described below) as compared to
$15,002,000 and $13,246,000 during fiscal years 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Expenditures made during fiscal 1995 were for equipment used in the studio
production, post production and computer graphics service areas throughout the
Company.

     The net change in cash in the fiscal years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993 was $(1,132,000), $285,000 and $469,000, respectively.  The decrease in
fiscal 1995 was the result of cash provided by operating activities of
$8,044,000 and financing activities of $1,510,000 less cash used in investing
activities of $10,686,000.  The net cash decrease in fiscal 1995 is primarily
due to the Company's fixed asset expenditures for the year exceeding the cash
generated by operations.  The increase in fiscal 1994 was the result of cash
provided by operating activities of $10,994,000 and financing activities of
$2,602,000 in excess of cash used in investing activities of $13,311,000.  The
net cash increase in fiscal 1994 is primarily due to the cash generated by the
Company's operations and net loan proceeds exceeding the net cash used to
purchase capital assets.

     In December 1995, subsequent to year end, the Company entered into a $26
million revolving credit and term loan agreement with a financial institution,
consisting of a $15 million term loan facility and an $11 million revolving
credit facility.

The $15 million dollar term loan portion of the facility is payable in 59
monthly principal payments of $89,000 through November 2000 and in payments of
$3,750,000 at August 31, 1996, $3,750,000 at December 31, 1996 and $2,249,000 at
December 2000.  The revolving credit portion of the facility is due in full in
December 2000.

Additionally, in December 1995, the Company obtained a $4,000,000 mortgage on
its property located on West 57th Street in New York City, from a bank.  The
mortgage is payable in equal monthly installments of $22,000 through November
2002, with a final payment of $2,152,000 due in December 2002.


The proceeds of the $15 million term loan, the $4 million mortgage and
$860,000 from the new revolving credit facility, were used to refinance the
term loan ($9,571,000) and revolving credit facility ($9,975,000) and to
repay the City of New York Industrial Revenue Bond obligation ($314,000), all
then outstanding to the Company's bank lenders.  As such, the $9,975,000
outstanding on the revolving credit at August 31, 1995 has been reclassified
as long term debt on the accompanying balance sheet to reflect the
refinancing of this obligation.  The terms of the agreement provide that the
lender receive a first lien on all property, equipment and accounts
receivable that are not encumbered by another lender.

     In May of 1995, the Company adopted a plan to downsize the operations of
its Editel Chicago division and reorganize and reduce its corporate management
which resulted in recording a restructuring charge of $400,000 which is
comprised of severance and early retirement expense.  The Company


                                       14

<PAGE>


anticipates annual cash savings of approximately $1,000,000 in fiscal 1996
related to the downsizing.  In fiscal 1995 the restructuring liability was
reduced by approximately $127,000 as a result of severance and retirement
payments made during fiscal 1995.

     In February 1995, the Company purchased the business and assets of GC & Co.
(formerly known as Greene, Crowe & Company), a Burbank, California based
supplier of "on-location" services for the videotaping and live telecasting of
concerts, cultural and other events, including the "Academy Awards", the "Grammy
Awards" and "The American Music Awards".  The purchase price was $6,750,000,
consisting of $6,000,000 in cash and $750,000 of convertible subordinated
promissory notes.  The notes bear interest at 1% over prime and are due in full
in August 1997 and are also convertible into the Company's common stock at
$10.00 per share.  The cash portion of the purchase price was financed by a
$4,700,000 five year capital lease with a fixed rate of interest of 8.2%,
payable in sixty equal monthly payments of principal and interest of $82,000 and
a balloon payment at the end of the lease period of $940,000.  Additionally, the
Company obtained a $1,800,000 loan with a fixed interest rate of 9.3% payable in
sixty equal monthly payments of principal and interest of $33,000 and a balloon
payment at the end of the five year period of $360,000.  The $500,000 available
to the Company from these two financings after the payment of the cash portion
of the GC & Co. acquisition price was used to repay a $500,000 note payable to
Banta Corporation from the purchase of the Editel Los Angeles building.

     In October 1993, the Company purchased a building located on West 53rd
Street in New York City for a purchase price of $2,800,000.  The Company is
utilizing the building, which contains approximately 14,000 square feet, as a
videotape recording studio.  The Company also entered into a $2,700,000
equipment financing agreement with a leasing company in October 1993.  The
proceeds of this financing were used towards payment of the purchase price of
the 53rd Street property.  The equipment financing is repayable in 60 monthly
installments of $53,000, including principal and interest, at a fixed rate of
7%.  The Company obtained a $1,875,000 mortgage financing on this property in
June 1994 with a fixed rate of interest of 8.6%.  The mortgage principal is
payable in equal monthly payments through June, 2004 with options to extend the
maturity date through June, 2019.

     In February 1993, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase from
Scanline the building that its Editel-Los Angeles division occupies.  The
Company therefore has treated the building as owned since February 1993,
recording the purchase at the present value of the $3,500,000 purchase price
less accrued rent.  The Company purchased the building in June 1994 for
$3,500,000 with the proceeds of a long term mortgage in the amount of
$2,175,000, a $500,000 note due to Scanline and the balance from working
capital.  The note payable to Scanline was paid in full in February 1995.  The
mortgage financing is payable monthly over a 15 year period with interest at a
rate of 8.9%.

     On April 8, 1993, the Company sold in an underwritten public offering,
777,273 shares of its Common Stock at a price, net of underwriting commissions,
of $13.025 per share.  The net proceeds to the Company after underwriting
discounts and offering expenses was $9,389,000.  In addition to the 777,273
shares sold by the Company were 272,727 shares owned by Scanline which were
issued through the conversion of Scanline's 100,000 shares of Series $1.80
Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.  The conversion of the preferred shares
into common shares was done immediately prior to the closing of the public
offering.


                                       15

     In connection with certain of its financings, the Company must adhere to
particular financial ratios and restrictions including restrictions on future
payment of dividends. The Company anticipates that the restrictions will not
impair its ability to keep pace with technological developments.

     The enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has limited the Company's
ability to defer the payment of taxes due to the imposition of an alternative
minimum tax which effectively results in the treatment of certain timing
differences as tax preference items.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Sales were $83,285,000, $80,498,000 and $79,390,000 for the fiscal years
ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The fiscal year 1995 sales
increase of $2,787,000 was primarily due to revenues generated by the Company's
studio production and mobile facilities as a result of the addition of a studio
in New York City and the acquisition of the GC & Co. mobile units, which was
offset by declines in sales at the company's Editel divisions.  In fiscal year
1994, sales increased $1,108,000 which was mostly due to a higher demand for the
Company's mobile services.  Sales remained flat for the Company's Editel-Chicago
and both Los Angeles divisions due to severe price competition in these markets.
In 1993, sales increased $16,390,000, of which $14,409,000 was due to the Editel
divisions which were included in the Company's operating results for a full year
in fiscal 1993.

     The Company recorded a net loss of $6,547,000 in the fiscal year ended
August 31, 1995 and net income of $859,000 and $711,000 in the fiscal years
ended August 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, including pre-tax income of
$229,000 in 1994 as royalty income or earnings from the Company's interest in
Time Logic Systems.  The net loss of $6,547,000 for the current fiscal year is
due primarily to the pretax charge of $7,681,000 taken for the impairment of
assets of the Editel New York, Editel Chicago, Editel Los Angeles and Windsor
Video divisions and the pretax charge of $400,000 for the restructuring of the
Editel Chicago division.  In August 1994, the Company received a piece of
equipment with a value of $189,000 in lieu of all future income from its
interest in Time Logic Systems.

     The fiscal 1993 results include a $252,000 increase to income due to the
cumulative effect of adopting FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" as of September 1, 1992.

     Production costs, the main component of cost of sales, consist primarily of
direct labor, equipment maintenance expenses and occupancy costs.  The Company's
production costs, as a percentage of sales, were 71.1%, 68.4% and 67.6%, for the
fiscal years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The increase
in production costs for fiscal 1995 as compared with the prior years, is due
primarily to an increase in studio and mobile production revenues which incur
variable expense at a higher rate than the Company's other services.  Production
costs increased as a percentage of sales in fiscal 1994 because production costs
increased during that year while sales remained flat with the prior year.  The
increase in production costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal 1993 is
similarly due to sales in fiscal 1993 remaining flat with sales in fiscal 1992,
on a proforma basis. Since most of the Company's costs are fixed and a large
portion of the costs are subject to price increases, flat sales from year to
year result in production costs which are an increased percentage of sales.
This same dynamic applies for both selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses.

     Depreciation, as a percentage of sales, was 12.1%, 11.5% and 11.0% in
fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Depreciation expense increased in
1995 as a result of the $4,750,000 equipment portion of the GC & Co. acquisition
and capital expenditures made during the year totaling $9,738,000.  Depreciation
expense increased as a percentage of sales in 1994 due to the purchase of
$15,002,000 in fixed assets during the year.  Depreciation expense, during
fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 was offset by gain on disposal of assets of $352,000,
$817,000 and $274,000, respectively.  Had the gain on disposal of assets been
excluded from depreciation expense, depreciation as a percentage of sales for
1995 and 1994 would have been 12.5%, and for 1993 would have been 11.3%.  The
issue of reclassification is fully addressed in Note I to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, during fiscal years 1995, 1994
and 1993 were 3.4%, 3.5% and 3.9%, respectively.  In 1995 and 1994, selling
expenses as a percentage of sales decreased due to significant cost reductions
which became effective in 1993.

     General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during fiscal
years 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 10.6%, 11.8% and 12.8%, respectively.  Cost
reductions put into effect in 1994, including the addition of in-house counsel
and a resulting reduction in professional fee expense, were reflected in fiscal
years 1995 and 1994 by a decrease of approximately 1% from each of the prior
years.

     Interest expense, as a percentage of sales, during fiscal years 1995, 1994,
and 1993 was 4.4%, 3.0% and 3.5%, respectively.  The increase in interest
expense in fiscal 1995 was due to additional interest incurred relating to the
mortgage financings for the Editel-Los Angeles building purchased by the Company
in June 1994 and financing obtained for the acquisition of GC & Co. in February
1995.  During fiscal 1995 the Company wrote off $214,000 of deferred financing
costs related to its bank debt which was refinanced in December 1995.
Additionally, interest rates were significantly higher in 1995 as compared with
the prior year resulting in higher interest payments on the floating rate
portion of the Company's debt.  The decrease in interest expense in 1994 is due
to the renegotiation of the rate payable on the Company's indebtedness to its
primary bank lenders, a reduction in the amortization of deferred financing
costs charged to interest expense and the capitalization of approximately
$300,000 of interest relating to construction on the Editel-Los Angeles and 53rd
Street, New York City locations.

     In September 1993 the Company entered into a partnership arrangement with a
computer graphics design firm.  During fiscal years 1995 and 1994 the Company's
50% share of losses were $29,000 and $65,000, respectively.  Additionally, the
Company had an outstanding loan to the partnership of $118,000 at August 31,
1995.

     The Company's effective tax rates were (30%), 43.4% and 50.3% in fiscal
years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The effective tax rate in 1995 differs
from prior years primarily due to the impact of the nondeductible goodwill write
off and the impairment of assets charge. (See Note F to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.) During those years, the effective rate exceeded the
Federal statutory rate of 34.0% due to state and local income taxes, and the
effect of certain non-deductible expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
CERTIFIED PUBLIC AUDITORS



Board of Directors and Shareholders
Unitel Video, Inc.



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unitel Video,
Inc. (a Delaware corporation) at August 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 1995.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Unitel Video, Inc. as of August
31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cashflows for each
of the three years in the period ended August 31, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."

We have also audited Schedule II of Unitel Video, Inc. for each of the three
years in the period ended August 31, 1995.  In our opinion, the schedule
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be set
forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                   YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993

A.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

(1) Business -- The Company provides facilities for studio production, videotape
editing, mobile production, computer graphics, film-to-tape transfer and
duplication of videotape in all formats, to the entire video communications
industry.  The Company's facilities are used to produce television programs,
corporate communications and commercials on videotape. The Company's mobile
division provides "on-location" services for the videotape recording and live
telecasting of sports, cultural and other events throughout the United States.
The Company also designs and produces custom CD-ROM, CD-I, videodisc and
networked multimedia presentations.  Customers for the Company's services
include cable television program suppliers, independent producers, national
television networks, local television stations and advertising agencies.

(2) Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary.

(3) Depreciation -- Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of assets which are: 30-40 years for buildings; 15-30
years for building improvements; length of lease for leasehold improvements; 5-7
years for video equipment; 5-7 years for furniture and fixtures; and 3 years for
automobiles.  Gain on disposal of assets was reclassified to depreciation and
amortization expense in 1993.  Also, amortization of goodwill was reclassified
to depreciation and amortization expense from general and administrative
expenses for the same periods.  (See Note I to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).

(4) Goodwill -- Goodwill relating to acquisitions represents the excess of cost
over the fair value of net assets acquired and is amortized over 15 years.
Accumulated amortization at August 31, 1995 totaled $69,000.  (See Note K to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

(5) Deferred Financing Costs -- Costs incurred in obtaining long-term debt
financing are included in other assets.  These costs are being amortized using
the interest method over the term of the related obligations.

(6) Investment in Affiliate -- Investment in an affiliation in which there is a
50% ownership interest is recorded at cost plus equity in its undistributed
earnings.

(7)  Interest Cost -- The Company had capitalized construction period interest
costs of $303,000 in 1994.

(8)  Income Taxes -- Deferred income taxes arise primarily from the use of
different depreciation methods and lives for tax and financial statement
purposes, differences in the timing of the deduction for the impairment
charge and net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards.

(9) Receivables -- The Company grants credit to customers, substantially all of
whom are in the entertainment, advertising or corporate communications
industries.


                                       28

<PAGE>

(10) Reclassification -- In 1993 gain on disposal of assets and amortization of
goodwill were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  (See
Note I in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

(11) Earnings per common share were determined by dividing net earnings, by
weighted average of common and common equivalent shares outstanding.  For the
year ended August 31, 1993, the effect of assumed conversion of preferred stock
was antidilutive, thus the primary earnings per share are also the fully diluted
earnings per share.

     In December 1995, subsequent to year end, the Company entered into a $26
million revolving credit and term loan agreement with a financial
institution, consisting of a $15 million term loan facility and an $11
million revolving credit facility.  The term loan portion of the facility is
payable in 59 monthly principal payments of $89,000 through November 2000 and
in payments of $3,750,000 at August 31, 1996, $3,750,000 at December 31, 1996
and $2,249,000 at December 2000.  The revolving credit portion of the
facility is due in full in December 2000.  If certain assets which
collateralize the debt are sold, a portion of the debt must be repaid from
the proceeds.

Additionally, in November 1995, the Company obtained a $4,000,000 mortgage on
its property located on West 57th Street in New York City, from the Company's
bank lender.  The mortgage is payable in equal monthly installments of $22,000
through November 2002, with a final payment of $2,152,000 due in December 2002.

The proceeds of the $15 million term loan, the $4 million mortgage and
$860,000 from the new revolving credit facility, were used to refinance the
term loan ($9,571,000) and revolving credit facility ($9,975,000) and to repay
the City of New York Industrial Revenue Bond obligation ($314,000), all then
outstanding to the Company's bank lenders.  As such, the $9,975,000
outstanding on the revolving credit at August 31, 1995 has been reclassified
as long term debt on the accompanying balance sheet to reflect the
refinancing of this obligation.  The terms of the agreement provide that the
lender receive a first lien on all property, equipment and accounts
receivable that are not encumbered by another lender.

     In June 1994, the Company purchased for $3,500,000 from Scanline the
building occupied by the Editel-Los Angeles division.  Financing for the
purchase consisted of a $2,175,000, 25-year mortgage payable to an insurance
company lender, a $500,000 note payable to the seller, Scanline Communications,
and the balance from working capital.  The note was paid in full in February
1995.

     In October 1993, the Company purchased for $2,800,000 land and a building
located on West 53rd Street, New York City, which has been converted into a
videotape recording studio.  Financing for the purchase was obtained from a
capital lease obligation to an equipment leasing company for $2,700,000.  In
June 1994, the Company also obtained a mortgage on the West 53rd Street property
in the amount of $1,875,000 from a bank.  The mortgage loan is payable in equal
monthly principal payments through June, 2004 with options to extend the
maturity date through June, 2019.  Proceeds from this mortgage were used for
working capital purposes.

     Property, equipment and accounts receivable with a carrying value of
$66,461,000 at August 31, 1995 are pledged as collateral for all long-term debt
outstanding.

     The agreements relating to certain of these long-term obligations include
covenants which, among other terms, place restrictions on the Company as to
capital expenditures and the maintenance of certain financial ratios (including
minimum levels of net worth and debt-to-equity restrictions, all as defined in
the agreements).

Stock Option Plan (the "1992 Plan") to grant as many as 350,000 shares primarily
to key employees and non-employee directors.  Prior to July 1992, the Company
granted options under the plans described above.  All future grants will be
granted under the 1992 Plan.  Options to purchase 187,000 shares were
outstanding to key employees and non-employee directors under the 1992 Plan at
August 31, 1995.

     Under all plans, options have generally been granted to purchase stock at
the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant as determined by the
Board of Directors.  Under the Non-Qualified Plan, the options expire five years
after the date of grant and under the Incentive Plan and Non-Statutory Plan,
options expire ten years after the date of grant.

     The status of stock options under the Company's stock option plans is
summarized below:

E.   EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

     In June 1987, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") obtained
financing from a bank amounting to $1,250,000, which was used in acquiring
115,849 shares of newly issued Company stock.  The bank loan bears interest at a
fixed rate of 10% and is guaranteed by the Company.  The ESOP is funded by
Company contributions as required to provide the ESOP with the funds necessary
to meet its debt service requirements.

     The loan obligation of the ESOP is considered unearned employee benefit
expense and is recorded as a separate reduction of the Company's
shareholders' equity.  Both the loan obligation and the unearned benefit expense
are reduced by the amount of any loan repayments made by the ESOP. The loan
requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $17,600 through June 1997
at a fixed rate of 10%.  The aggregate principal maturities of the ESOP
obligation subsequent to August 31, 1995 are as follows:

     1996..............................   $186,000
     1997..............................   $152,000

     In fiscal 1991, the ESOP purchased 25,810 shares of the Company's Common
Stock.  These purchases have been financed by a ten-year loan from the Company
for $229,193.  The loan requires monthly payments of principal and interest at
10%.  The Company's related receivable from the ESOP has been classified as a
reduction of shareholders' equity.

     401(k) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

     Effective July 1, 1992, the ESOP merged into the Unitel Video, Inc.
Retirement Investment Plan (a 401(k) Plan), which became the Unitel Video, Inc.
401(k) Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan
requires the Company to match employee contributions to the 401(k) portion of
the Plan in shares of the Company's Common Stock up to the maximum amount set
forth in the Plan.  The minimum contribution required to be made each year by
the Company is the amount necessary to meet its debt service requirements.  The
Plan combines a 401(k) plan with certain features of an employee stock ownership
plan.

     Total contributions to the ESOP and the Plan for each of the years ended
August 31 are as follows:

     1995 ............................. $336,000
     1994 ............................. $253,000
     1993 ............................. $271,000

     The Company adopted Statement of Position 93-6 (SOP 93-6), "Employers'
Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans" during 1995. In accordance with
SOP 93-6, compensation cost and liabilities associated with providing the
employer's 401(k) match are recognized the way they would be if an ESOP had not
been used to fund the benefit.


                                       34

<PAGE>

The Plan's compensation expense was $191,000 for the year ended August 31, 1995.
A summary of the Plan's shares as of August 31, 1995 is as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
          <S>                                  <C>
          Allocated shares                     75,095
          Shares released for allocation       19,234
          Unreleased shares                    42,939
                                              -------
                                              137,268

          Fair value of unreleased shares
               at August 31, 1995            $274,000
                                              -------
                                              -------
</TABLE>


Prior to adoption of SOP 93-6, the unreleased shares were considered outstanding
for the earnings per share computation.  Accordingly, for the year ended August
31, 1995, shares were no longer considered outstanding.  The effect of adopting
SOP 93-6 was not material on the net loss, and resulted in a decrease of
approximately 1% on the net loss per share for the twelve months ended August
31, 1995.


F.   INCOME TAXES:

     Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Significant components of the
Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows:

<PAGE>

     The Company's total alternative minimum tax credit carryforward is
approximately $2,570,000, which can be used against the Company's future regular
tax liability.

     At August 31, 1995, the Company had available for tax purposes in excess of
$2,000,000 of State of New York tax credits that will expire from August 31,
1996 through August 31, 2002.  The State of New York limits the use of these
credits on an annual basis.  For financial reporting purposes, a valuation
allowance of $1,900,000 has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets
related to those carryforwards for fiscal year ended August 31, 1995.

     The deferred tax asset relating to the net operating loss carryforward is
attributable to the unused portion of a federal net operating loss generated in
fiscal 1993 of $515,000 which is scheduled to expire in 2008, as well as state
net operating losses generated in fiscal 1995 of various amounts scheduled to
expire at various times through 2008.

     Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the utilization of
Federal net operating loss and other credit carryforwards when an ownership
change, as defined by the tax law, occurs.  Generally, this occurs when a
greater than 50 percentage point change in ownership occurs.  Accordingly, the
actual utilization of the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other
deferred tax assets for tax purposes may be limited annually to the percentage
(about 6%) of the fair market value of the Company at the time of any such
ownership changes.


G.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

     Operating Leases -- The following is a schedule by years of future minimum
rental payments under operating leases that have an initial non-cancelable lease
term in excess of one year:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
          <S>                 <C>
          1996                $ 4,807,000

          1998                  4,489,000
          1999                  3,310,000
          2000                  2,317,000
          2001 and thereafter   5,626,000
                              -----------
                              $25,080,000

                              -----------
</TABLE>

     The aggregate rental expense for the years ended August 31, 1995, 1994,
and 1993 was $3,867,000, $3,381,000 and $3,627,000, respectively.

     The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions located in
New York, New York, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles, California.
These balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to
$100,000.  At August 31, 1995, uninsured amounts held at these financial
institutions were approximately $674,000.


     There are various lawsuits claiming amounts against the Company.  It is the
opinion of the Company's management that the ultimate liabilities, if any, in
these cases will not have a material effect on the Company's financial
statements.

H.   INVESTMENT IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES:

     TIME LOGIC SYSTEMS

     The Company had a 50% interest in a partnership known as Time Logic Systems
which marketed a device which serves as an editing and synchronization system
during the film-to-tape transfer process.  In August 1994, the Company received
a piece of equipment with a value of $189,000 in lieu of all future income from
Time Logic Systems.

     COMPUTER GRAPHICS DESIGN

     In September 1993, the Company entered into a partnership arrangement with
a computer graphics design firm.  During fiscal years 1995 and 1994
respectively, the Company's 50% share of losses were $29,000 and $65,000.
Additionally, the Company had an outstanding loan to the partnership of
$118,000 at August 31, 1995.

I.   NET GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF FIXED ASSETS

     In June 1990, the Company sold to CBS Inc. a building it owned at 508-510
West 57th Street, New York, New York. The sale price of the property was
$4,650,000 payable in cash at the closing.  As part of the transaction, the
Company entered into an Indenture of Lease with CBS, pursuant to which the
Company, as tenant, leased back the premises.  The Company recognized a net gain
on the disposition of $2,277,000.  In addition, under the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 98, the Company deferred $922,000 of
additional gain from the sale, representing the present value of the future
minimum rental payment under the portion of the lease which was not subject to
early termination.  The balance of the deferred gain of $117,000 was recognized
in the year ended August 31, 1995 as a reduction of rent expense.

     The Company has accelerated its efforts to sell equipment which is not
fully utilized.  In order to properly reflect the sale of equipment as part of
the Company's operations, in 1995 and 1994, $352,000 and $817,000 of gain on
disposal of assets were included in depreciation expense.  Gain on disposal of
assets of $274,000 was reclassified to depreciation expense during August 31,
1993 to conform with the current year presentation.

J.   ACCRUED RETIREMENT

     Under the terms of employment agreements with two former officers of the
Company, retirement payments are due commencing September 1, 1996.  At August
31, 1995, a liability of approximately $1,141,000 has been recorded, based upon
the present value of these payments.  Approximately $172,000, $206,000 and
$190,000 has been charged to operations for the years ended August 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

K.   IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" which provides
guidance on when to assess and how to measure impairment of long-lived
assets, certain intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held
and used, and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to

The Company has decided to focus its resources toward providing services to
the entertainment and corporate communications areas, which represents the
Company's strength.  As part of this strategy, the Company has decided to
sell its Editel New York, Editel Chicago and Editel Los Angeles divisions,
which specialize in the highly competitive commercial advertising portion of
the video facilities industry.  During the 1995 fiscal year, the three Editel
divisions incurred a pretax loss of $3,682,000.  As a result the Company
identified property, plant and equipment associated with these divisions with
a carrying value of approximately $24,000,000 that it no longer needed for
its current and future operations, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal
1995 committed to a plan to dispose of them.  Accordingly, the Company began
marketing these divisions to potential buyers and plans to sell them.
Although the Company intends to sell these assets within one year there is
no assurance that it will be able to do so, accordingly these assets are
classified in the balance sheet as long-term.  The Company estimated the
revised value to be approximately $19,300,000.  Accordingly, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $4,700,000 in 1995 on these
assets, which was included in impairment charges.  The Company intends to
operate these divisions until a sale is consummated.

     The Company reevaluated its investment in its Windsor division in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 and determined that based upon it's operating
results, the goodwill associated with the purchase of this division and certain
property, plant and equipment that will not provide any future benefits to the
Company were impaired.  The Company recognized an impairment charge of
approximately $3,000,000 included in impairment charges during the fourth
quarter which represents the remaining balances of these assets.

In May of 1995, the Company adopted a plan to downsize the operations of its
Editel Chicago division and reorganize and reduce its corporate management which
resulted in recording a restructuring charge of $400,000 for severance and early
retirement expense.  In fiscal 1995, the restructuring liability was reduced by
approximately $127,000 as a result of retirement and severance payments made
during the year.  As of August 31, 1995, the balance of the restructuring
liability was approximately $273,000 and is included in accrued payroll.

has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding ) is asserted by such directors, officers or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities
Act of 1993 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

such other places, within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine.

                       ARTICLE II - STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

          SECTION 2-1.   PLACE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS.  All meetings of
stockholders shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware
as may be designated by the board of Directors from time to time. If no such
place is designated by the Board of Directors, meetings of the stockholders
shall be held at the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware.

          SECTION 2-2.   ANNUAL MEETING.  A meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held in each calendar year, commencing with the year 1987,
at a date, time and place fixed by the Board of Directors.

          At such annual meeting, there shall be held an election for a Board of

          SECTION 2-3.   SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Except as otherwise specifically
provided by law, special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time:

               (a)  By the President of the Corporation; or

               (b)  By a majority of the Board of Directors; or

          Upon the written request of any person entitled to call a special
meeting, which request shall set forth the purpose for which the meeting is
desired.  It shall be the duty of the Secretary to give prompt written notice of
such meeting to be held at such time as the Secretary may fix, subject to the
provisions of Section 2-4 hereof.  If the Secretary shall fail to fix such date
and give such notice within ten (10) days after receipt of such request, the
person or persons making such request may do so.

          This Section 2-3 may be replaced or amended only by an affirmative
vote or written consent of at least 80% of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote thereon.

          SECTION 2-4.   NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS.  Written notice
stating the place, date, hour and purpose of any meeting shall be given not less

The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting can continue to do business

leave less than a quorum.  If a meeting cannot be organized because of the
absence of a quorum, those present may, except as otherwise provided by law,
adjourn the meeting to such time and place as they may determine.  In the case
of any meeting for the election of Directors, those stockholders who attend the
second of such adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum as fixed in this
Section, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing
Directors.

          SECTION 2-6.   VOTING.  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger
of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose
ermane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the
meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where said meeting is to be held.
The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present.  Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the Directors to produce such a
list at any meeting for the election of Directors, they shall be ineligible to
any office at such meeting.

          At all stockholders' meetings, stockholders entitled to vote may
attend and vote either in person or by proxy.  All proxies shall be executed in
writing and shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation not later than
the day on which exercised.  No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
(3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

          Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all matters coming
before the meeting shall be determined by a vote by shares.  All elections of
Directors shall be by written ballot unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation.  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law,
all other votes may be taken by voice unless a stockholder demands that it be
taken by ballot, in which latter event the vote shall be taken by written
ballot.

          SECTION 2-7.   INFORMAL ACTION BY STOCKHOLDERS.  Unless otherwise
provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the vote of stockholders
at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken in connection with any
corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with on
the written consent of the stockholders having not less than the minimum number
of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting
at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and
provided that prompt notice of the taking of corporate action shall be given to
those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

          SECTION 2-8.   NOTIFICATION OF NOMINATIONS. Nominations for the
election of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a nominating or
proxy committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder
entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally. However, any
stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally may nominate
one or more persons for election as Directors at a meeting only if written
notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has
been given, either by personal


                                        3

delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the

Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or

stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person
or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by
the stockholder or pursuant to which votes shall be cast or other actions taken

other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would
have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the
proxy rules of the Securities and  xchange Commission had the nominee been
nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the
written consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation if so
elected. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of
any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

          SECTION 2-9.   ORGANIZATION OF MEETING.  Prior to or at the
commencement   of each meeting of stockholders, a chairman to preside at such
meeting may be chosen by a majority vote of the Board of Directors.  In the
absence of such action of the Board of Directors, the President of the
Corporation shall serve as chairman.  If such chairman is unable to fulfill his
duties as chairman, the Board of Directors shall, by majority vote, appoint a
successor.  The chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to act as
secretary of the meeting and such person shall keep a record of the proceedings
thereof.  The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be entitled to make
such rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it
shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.  Subject to such rules and
regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall
have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary,
appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including
without limitation, regulating the commencement, postponement, if any, and
adjournment of the meeting, establishing an agenda or order of business for the
meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the

<PAGE>

thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for
balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot.  The failure of the
Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting to formally establish rules,
regulations or procedures for the conduct of the meeting in advance of the
meeting shall not limit the authority of the chairman of the meeting to conduct
the meeting in an orderly fashion.  Unless, and to the extent, determined by the
Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders
shall not be required to be held in accordance with rules or parliamentary
procedure or other specified rules of order.

of Directors.  The term of office of the initial Class I Directors shall expire

Class II Director shall expire at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 1987,
and the term of the office of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at
the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 1988.  At each annual election of
Directors held after 1985, the Directors chosen to succeed those whose terms
then expire shall be identified as being of the same class as the Directors they
succeed and shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual
election of Directors.  Each Director shall serve and hold office until his
successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation or
emoval.

          In the event the number of Directors of the Company is increased by
appropriate corporate action, the number of Directors in each class shall be
adjusted to make each Class as equal in number as possible.

          This Section 3-1A may be replaced or amended only by the affirmative
vote or written consent of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares
entitles to vote thereon.

<PAGE>

meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held, and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of  stockholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply

Directors may fix a new record date for the adjournment meeting.

          SECTION 5-3.   TRANSFER OF SHARES.  Transfer of shares shall be made
on the books of the Corporation only upon surrender of the share certificate,
duly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, which certificate shall

the books of this Corporation if such transfer is in violation of a lawful

facts and circumstances surrounding the same; (2) advertise such facts to the
extent and in the manner the Board of Directors may require; and (3) give to the
Corporation his bond of indemnity with an acceptable surety.  Thereupon a new
share certificate shall be issued in lieu of the alleged lost, destroyed,
mislaid or wrongfully taken certificate, provided that the request therefor has
been made before the Corporation has notice that such shares have been acquired
by a bona fide purchaser.

                              ARTICLE VI - NOTICES

          SECTION 6-1.   CONTENTS OF NOTICE.  Whenever any notice of a meeting
is required to be given pursuant to these By-laws or the Certificate of
ncorporation or otherwise, the notice shall specify the place, date and hour of
the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or where otherwise required by
law, the general nature of the business to be transacted at such meeting.

          SECTION 6-2.   METHOD OF NOTICE.  All notices shall be given to each
person entitled thereto, either personally or by sending a copy thereof through
the mail or by telegraph, charges prepaid, to his address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation, or supplied by him to the Corporation for the
purpose of notice.  If notice is sent by mail or telegraph, it shall be deemed
to have been given to the person entitled thereto when deposited in the United
States Mail or with the telegraph office for transmission.  If no address for a
stockholder appears on the books of the Corporation and such stockholder has not
supplied the Corporation with an address for the purpose of notice, notice

given under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws of the Corporation, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled
to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders or
Directors shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
stockholder or Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting,
at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders or Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice
unless so  required by the Certificate of Incorporation.

                 ARTICLE VII - INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND
                           OFFICERS AND OTHER PERSONS

          SECTION 7-1.   INDEMNIFICATION.  The Corporation shall indemnify any
Director or officer of the Corporation against expenses (including legal fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by him, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law in connection
with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, brought or threatened to be
brought against him by reason of his performance as a Director or officer of the
Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, or in any other capacity on
behalf of the Corporation, its parent or any of its subsidiaries.

          The Board of Directors by resolution adopted in each specific instance
may  similarly indemnify any person other than a Director or officer of the
Corporation for liabilities incurred by him in connection with services rendered
by him for or at the request of the Corporation, its parent or any of its
subsidiaries.

The provisions of this section shall be applicable to all actions, suits or
proceedings commenced after its adoption, whether such arise out of acts or
omissions which occurred prior to subsequent to such adoption and shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a Director or officer or to render services
for or at the request of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  The rights of
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed the exclusive rights to
which any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation may be
entitled.

incurred by any person entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking,
by or on behalf of such person, to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized by law.

          SECTION 7-3.   INSURANCE.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director or officer, employee
or agent, of the Corporation or who is or was serving in any capacity in any
other corporation or organization at the request of the Corporation against any
liability asserted against him or incurred by him in any such capacity or
arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify him against such liability under law.

                               ARTICLE VIII - SEAL

          SECTION 8-1.   The form of the seal of the Corporation,

regular or special meeting, or (b) if the Certificate of Incorporation so
provides, by the Board of Directors, by a majority of those voting, at any

hereafter.

equal to $89,286 and the final installment due on December 12, 2000, or the
earlier to occur of (a) the Termination Date or (b) acceleration of the
Obligations in accordance with the provisions of subsection 8.3, in an amount
equal to the unpaid principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon.

          (A)(2)    TERM LOAN B.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Borrower
herein set forth, each Lender, severally, agrees to lend to Borrower on the

principal payments in the amounts of the applicable Scheduled Installments of
Term Loan B (or such lesser principal amount of Term Loan B as shall then be
outstanding) on the dates and in the amounts set forth below; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
Borrower, unless Agent otherwise consents in writing, may only make principal
payments on Term Loan B from a Permitted Term Loan B Repayment Source.

     "Scheduled Installment of Term Loan B" means each of the two (2) principal
installments each in an amount equal to $3,750,000, payable, subject to the

          (B)  REVOLVING LOAN.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Borrower

pursuant to subsection 8.3 or (ii) the Termination Date.  Except as otherwise

Amount.

               (1)  "Maximum Revolving Loan Amount" means, as of any date of

provided that such letter of credit has been delivered to Agent as additional
collateral;

Borrower does not have a satisfactory credit standing;

               (6)  Accounts with respect to which the customer is the United

or any of its Affiliates;
               (8)  Accounts due from a customer if more than fifty percent
(50%) of the aggregate amount of Accounts of such customer have at the time
remained unpaid for more than sixty (60) days after due date or ninety (90) days

               (9)  Accounts with respect to which there is any unresolved
dispute with the respective customer (but only to the extent of such dispute);

               (10) Accounts evidenced by an "instrument" or "chattel paper" (as

aggregate of all Accounts at said date;

               (15) Accounts with respect to which the customer's obligation to
pay is conditional or subject to a repurchase obligation or right to return or

or return transactions, sales on approval or consignment sales;

               (16) Accounts with respect to which the customer is located in
Indiana, New Jersey, Minnesota, or any other state denying creditors access to

authorized to transact business in such state or has filed a Notice of Business
Activities Report or similar filing with the applicable state agency for the
then current year; and

               (17) Accounts with respect to which the customer is a creditor of
Borrower, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such Account shall only be ineligible as

          (D)  BORROWING MECHANICS.  (1) LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans
made on any Funding Date shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and
integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of such amount.  (2) On any day when
Borrower desires to borrow under this subsection 2.1, Borrower shall give Agent
telephonic notice of the proposed borrowing by 11:00 a.m. Central time on the
Funding Date of a Base Rate Loan and two (2) Business Days in advance of the
Funding Date of a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan, which notice (a "Notice
of Borrowing") must also specify the proposed Funding Date (which shall be a
Business Day), whether such Loans shall consist of Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Rate
Loans or Fixed Rate Loans and for LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans the
Interest Period applicable thereto.  Any such telephonic notice shall be
confirmed in writing on the same day.  Neither Agent nor any Lender shall incur
any liability to Borrower for acting upon any telephonic notice Agent believes
in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person
authorized to borrow on behalf of Borrower or for otherwise acting in good faith
under this subsection 2.1(D).  Neither Agent nor any Lender will make any
advance pursuant to any telephonic notice unless Agent has also received the
most recent Borrowing Base Certificate and all other documents required under
subsection 5.1(F) by 11:00 a.m. Central time.  Each advance made to Borrower
under the Revolving Loan shall be deposited by wire transfer in immediately
available funds in such account as  Borrower may from time to time designate to
Agent in writing.  Unless payment is otherwise timely made by Borrower, the
becoming due of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan


                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Documents as principal, accrued interest and fees shall be deemed irrevocably to
be a request by Borrower for a Base Rate Revolving Loan on the due date of, and
in the amount required to pay, such principal, accrued interest and fees, and
the proceeds of each such Revolving Loan if made by Agent or any Lender shall be
disbursed by Agent or such Lender by way of direct payment of the relevant
obligation.

          (E)  NOTES.  Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender (i) an
Amended and Restated Term Note A and Amended and Restated Term Note B to
evidence such Lender's portion of the Term Loans, such Amended and Restated Term
Notes to be in the principal amount of the respective Term Loan Commitments of
such Lender and with other appropriate insertions and (ii) an Amended and
Restated Revolving Note to evidence such Lender's portion of the Revolving Loan,
such Amended and Restated Revolving Note to be in the principal amount of the
Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender and with other appropriate insertions.
In the event of an assignment under subsection 9.1, Borrower shall, upon
surrender of the assigning Lender's Notes, issue new Notes to reflect the new
Commitments of the assigning Lender and its assignee (or in the case of the
Amended and Restated Term Notes, the outstanding principal amount of the
assigning Lender's and its assignee's portions of the Term Loans).

          (F)  EVIDENCE OF REVOLVING LOAN OBLIGATIONS.  The advances
constituting the Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement, the
Amended and Restated Revolving Note, and notations made from time to time by
Agent in its books and records, including computer records.  Agent shall record
in its books and records, including computer records, the principal amount of
the Revolving Loans owing to each Lender from time to time.  Agent's books and
records shall constitute presumptive evidence, absent manifest error, of the
accuracy of the information contained therein.  Failure by Agent to make any
such notation or record shall not affect the obligations of Borrower to Lenders
with respect to the Revolving Loans.

          (G)  LETTERS OF CREDIT.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Borrower
herein set forth, the Revolving Loan Commitments may, in addition to advances
under the Revolving Loan, be utilized, upon the request of Borrower, for (i) the
issuance of letters of credit by Agent; or with Agent's consent any Lender, or
(ii) the issuance by Agent of risk participations (a "Risk Participation
Agreement") to banks to induce such banks to issue letters of credit for the
account of Borrower (each of (i) and (ii) above a "Lender Letter of Credit").
Each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased a participation in each Lender
Letter of Credit issued on behalf of Borrower in an amount equal to its Pro Rata
Share thereof. In no event shall any Lender Letter of Credit be issued to the
extent that the issuance of such Lender Letter of Credit would cause the sum of
the Letter of Credit Reserve (after giving effect to such issuance) plus the
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan to exceed the lesser of (x)
the Borrowing Base and (y) the Revolving Loan Commitment.

          (1)       MAXIMUM AMOUNT.  The aggregate amount of Letter of Credit
Liability with respect to all Lender Letters of Credit outstanding at any time
shall not exceed $2,000,000.

          (2)       REIMBURSEMENT.  Borrower shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally obligated forthwith without presentment, demand, protest or
other formalities of any kind, to reimburse Agent or the issuer for any amounts
paid with respect to a Lender Letter of Credit including all fees, costs


                                      -20-

<PAGE>

and expenses paid to any bank that issues Bank Letters of Credit. Borrower
hereby authorizes and directs Agent, at Agent's option, to debit Borrower's
account (by increasing the principal balance of the Revolving Loan) in the
amount of any payment made with respect to any Lender Letter of Credit. All
amounts paid with respect to any Lender Letter of Credit that are not
immediately repaid by Borrower with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan or
otherwise shall bear interest at the Default Rate applicable to Revolving Loans.
In the event that Borrower shall fail to reimburse Agent on the date of any
payment under a Lender Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the amount of such
payment, Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the unreimbursed amount of
such payment together with accrued interest thereon and each Lender, on the next
Business Day, shall deliver to Agent an amount equal to its respective
participation in same day funds. The obligation of each Lender to deliver to
Agent an amount equal to its respective participation pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made
notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default
or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 3. In the event any
Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Lender's
participation in such Lender Letter of Credit, Agent shall be entitled to
recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest at the
Base Rate.

          (3)       CONDITIONS OF ISSUANCE.  In addition to all other terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the issuance of any Lender Letter of
Credit shall be subject to the conditions precedent that the letter of credit
which Borrower requests be in such form, be for such amount, contain such terms
and support such transactions as are reasonably satisfactory to Agent. The
expiration date of each Lender Letter of Credit shall be on a date which is at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Termination Date.

          (4)       REQUEST FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT.  Borrower shall give Agent at
least three (3) Business Days prior notice specifying the date a Lender Letter
of Credit is to be issued, identifying the beneficiary and describing the nature
of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. The notice shall be
accompanied by the form of the letter of credit being requested.

          (H)       OTHER LETTER OF CREDIT PROVISIONS.

          (1)  OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.  The obligation of Borrower to reimburse
Agent or any Lender for payments made under any Lender Letter of Credit shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under all circumstances including the following
circumstances:

               (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Lender Letter
of Credit or any other agreement;

               (b) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
which Borrower, any of its Affiliates, Agent or any Lender, on the one hand, may
at any time have against any beneficiary or transferee of any Lender Letter of
Credit or Bank Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may
be acting), Agent, any Lender or any other Person, on the other hand, whether in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any


                                      -21-

<PAGE>

unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between Borrower or
any of its Affiliates and the beneficiary of the letter of credit);

               (c) any draft, demand, certificate or any other document
presented under any Lender Letter of Credit or Bank Letter of Credit which is
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

               (d) payment under any Lender Letter of Credit against
presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not
comply with the terms of such letter of credit; provided that, in the case of
any payment by Lender under any Lender Letter of Credit, Lender has not acted
with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction) in determining that the demand for payment under such
Lender Letter of Credit complies on its face with any applicable requirements
for a demand for payment under such Lender Letter of Credit;

               (e) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, which is
similar to any of the foregoing; or

               (f) the fact that a Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing.

          (2)  NATURE OF LENDER'S DUTIES.  As between Agent and Lenders, on the
one hand, and Borrower, on the other hand, Borrower assumes all risks of the
acts and omissions of, or misuse of any Lender Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
neither Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible: (a) for the form, validity,
sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document by any party
in connection with the application for and issuance of any Lender Letter of
Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (b) for the validity or
sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to
transfer or assign any Lender Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason; (c) for failure of the beneficiary of any
Lender Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to
demand payment thereunder; provided that, in the case of any payment by Agent or
any Lender under any Lender Letter of Credit, Agent or Lender has not acted with
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction) in determining that the demand for payment under such Lender
Letter of Credit complies on its face with any applicable requirements for a
demand for payment thereunder; (d) for errors, omissions, interruptions or
delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph,
telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (e) for errors in
interpretation of technical terms; (f) for any loss or delay in the transmission
or otherwise of any document required in order to make a payment under any
Lender Letter of Credit; (g) for the credit of the proceeds of any drawing under
any Lender Letter of Credit; and (h) for any consequences arising from causes
beyond the control of Agent or any Lender as the case may be. None of the above
shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any of Agent's or any Lender's
rights or powers hereunder.



                                      -22-

          (3)  LIABILITY.  In furtherance and extension of and not in limitation
of, the specific provisions herein above set forth, any action taken or omitted
by Agent or any Lender under or in connection with any Lender Letter of Credit,
if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put Agent or any Lender under any
resulting liability to Borrower.

     2.2  INTEREST.

          (A)  RATE OF INTEREST.  (i)   Subject to the provisions of subsections
(ii) and (iii) below, the Loans and all other Obligations shall bear interest
from the date such Loans are made or such other Obligations become due to the
date paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of Base Rate Loans, the
Base Rate plus (a) three-quarters of one percent (.75%) with respect to the
Revolving Loan, (b) one percent (1.00%) with respect to Term Loan A and (c) one
and one-quarter percent (1.25%) with respect to Term Loan B, (y) in the case of
LIBOR Rate Loans, the LIBOR Rate plus (a) two and one-half percent (2.50%) with
respect to the Revolving Loan, (b) two and three-quarters percent (2.75%) with
respect to Term Loan A and (c) three percent (3.00%) with respect to Term Loan B
and (z) a fixed rate determined in accordance with subsection (iii) below. (the
"Interest Rate").  The applicable basis for determining the rate of interest
shall be selected by Borrower initially at the time a notice of borrowing is
given pursuant to subsection 2.1(D).  The basis for determining the interest
rate with respect to any Loan or a portion of any Loan may be changed from time
to time pursuant to subsection 2.2(E).  If on any day a Loan or a portion of any
Loan is outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered to Agent
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying the basis for
determining the rate of interest, then for that day that Loan or portion thereof
shall bear interest determined by reference to the Base Rate.

     (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing subsection "(i)", so
long as no Default or Event of Default shall then be in existence, in the event
(a) Borrower's August 31, 1996 fiscal year-end audited financial statements (the
"1996 Year-End Financial Statements"), delivered to Agent in accordance with the
provisions of subsection 5.1(B) hereof, reflect an EBITDA of greater than
$16,000,000 and/or (b) Borrower's August 31, 1997 fiscal year-end audited
financial statements (the "1997 Year-End Financial Statements" and together with
the 1996 Year-End Financial Statements, collectively, the "Year-End Financial
Statements"), delivered to Agent in accordance with the provisions of subsection
5.1(B) hereof, reflect an EBITDA of greater than $20,000,000, then in each such
case, as applicable, Agent shall reduce the Interest Rates other than for any
Fixed Rate Loan by one-quarter of one percent (.25%) commencing on the fifth
(5th) Business Day following Agent's receipt of the applicable Year-End
Financial Statements (each, an "Adjustment Date"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in the
case of LIBOR Rate Loans, such adjusted rate shall only be effective for LIBOR
Rate Loans with Interest Periods commencing on or after the applicable
Adjustment Date.

     (iii)       So long as no Default or Event of Default shall then be in
existence, within ten (10) Business Days following Borrower's request therefor
to Agent, Agent on behalf of Lenders shall provide Borrower with a fixed rate of
interest quote in writing for, subject to the restrictions set forth in
Subsection 2.1(D), all or any part of the outstanding Loans (the "Quote").  The
Quote shall be determined by Lenders in good faith.  In the event Borrower
elects to convert all or any portion of the Loans to a Fixed Rate Loan, it shall
provide Agent such election in writing by delivering to Agent a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation as defined in subsection 2.2(E) no later than 11:00 a.m.


                                      -23-

<PAGE>

Central time on the Business Day following Borrower's receipt from Agent of the
Quote, which such written election shall be deemed Borrower's acceptance of the
Quote.

     (iv) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
and notice thereof by Agent to Borrower (except that no notice shall be required
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under subsection 8.1(G) or 8.1(H))
(i) the Loans and all other Obligations shall, at the option of Requisite
Lenders, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) plus the
applicable Interest Rate (the "Default Rate"), (ii) each LIBOR Rate Loan shall
automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan at the end of any applicable Interest
Period and (iii) no Loans may be converted to LIBOR Rate Loans.

          (B)  INTEREST PERIODS.  In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan or
Fixed Rate Loan, Borrower shall elect an interest period (each an "Interest
Period") to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period for LIBOR Rate
Loans shall be either a one, two, three or six month period and for Fixed Rate
Loans shall be one month or any whole multiple thereof; provided that:

               (1)  the initial Interest Period for any Loan shall commence on
the Funding Date of such Loan;

               (2)  in the case of successive Interest Periods, each successive
Interest Period shall commence on the day on which the immediately preceding
Interest Period expires;

               (3)  if an Interest Period expiration date is not a Business Day,
such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided
that if any Interest Period expiration date is not a Business Day but is a day
of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
Interest Period shall expire on the immediately preceding Business Day;

               (4)  any Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of
a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding
day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall, subject to
part (5), below, end on the last Business Day of a calendar month;

               (5)  no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Termination Date;

               (6)  no Interest Period may extend beyond a  scheduled principal
payout date unless the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of Loans that
are Base Rate Loans or that have Interest Periods expiring on or before such
date and (b) the available, unused Revolving Loan Commitment or Borrowing Base
equals or exceeds the principal amount required to be paid on the Loans on such
date; and

               (7)  there shall be no more than five (5) Interest Periods
relating to LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans outstanding at any time.

          (C)  COMPUTATION AND PAYMENT OF INTEREST.  Interest on the Loans and
all other Obligations shall be computed on the daily principal balance on the
basis of a 360 day year for the


                                      -24-

<PAGE>

actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues.  In
computing interest on any  Loan, the date of funding of the Loan or the first
day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base
Rate Loan being converted from a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan, the date
of conversion of such LIBOR Rate Loan or such Fixed Rate Loan to such Base Rate
Loan, shall be included and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration
date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan, or with respect to a Base
Rate Loan being converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan, the date of
conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such LIBOR Rate Loan or such Fixed Rate
Loan, shall be excluded; provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on
which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.  Interest on
Base Rate Loans and all other Obligations other than LIBOR Rate Loans shall be
payable to Agent for the benefit of Lenders monthly in arrears on the first day
of each month, on the date of any prepayment of Loans and at maturity, whether
by acceleration or otherwise.  Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans shall be payable to
Agent for the benefit of Lenders on the last day of the applicable Interest
Period for such Loan, on the date of any prepayment of the Loans, and at
maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise.  In addition, for each LIBOR
Rate Loan having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months, interest
accrued on such Loan shall also be payable on the last  day of each three (3)
month interval during such Interest Period.

          (D)  INTEREST LAWS.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Borrower shall not be
required to pay, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be permitted to collect,
any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by
law ("Excess Interest").  If any Excess Interest is provided for or determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been provided for in this Agreement
or in any other Loan Document, then in such event:  (1) the provisions of this
subsection shall govern and control; (2) neither Borrower nor any Loan Party
shall be obligated to pay any Excess Interest; (3) any Excess Interest that
Agent or any Lender may have received hereunder shall be, at such Lender's
option, (a) applied as a credit against the outstanding principal balance of the
Obligations or accrued and unpaid interest (not to exceed the maximum amount
permitted by law), (b) refunded to the payor thereof, or (c) any combination of
the foregoing; (4) the interest rate(s) provided for herein shall be
automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate allowed from time to time under
applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"), and this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to have been and shall be, reformed and modified to
reflect such reduction; and (5) neither Borrower nor any Loan Party shall have
any action against Agent or any Lender for any damages arising out of the
payment or collection of any Excess Interest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
for any period of time interest on any Obligations is calculated at the Maximum
Rate rather than the applicable rate under this Agreement, and thereafter such
applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable
on such Obligations shall remain at the Maximum Rate until each Lender shall
have received the amount of interest which such Lender would have received
during such period on such Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited
to the Maximum Rate during such period.

            CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION.  Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.2(A) Borrower shall have the option to (1) convert at any time all
or any part of outstanding Loans equal to $500,000 and integral multiples of
$100,000 in excess of that amount from Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans or
Fixed Rate Loans or (2) upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan to (a) continue or convert all or any
portion of such


                                      -25-

<PAGE>

Loan equal to $500,000 and integral multiplies of $100,000 in excess of that
amount as a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan or (b) convert all or any
portion of such Loan to a Base Rate Loan.  The succeeding Interest Period(s) of
such continued or converted Loan commence on the last day of the Interest Period
of the Loan to be continued or converted; provided that no outstanding Loan may
be continued as, or be converted into, a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan,
when any Event of Default or Default has occurred and is continuing.

          Borrower shall deliver a notice of conversion/continuation to Agent no
later than noon (Central time) at least two (2) Business Days in advance of the
proposed conversion/ continuation date ("Notice of Conversion/Continuation").  A
Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall certify:  (1) the proposed
conversion/continuation date (which shall be a Business Day); (2) the amount of
the Loan to be converted/continued; (3) the nature of the proposed
conversion/continuation; (4) in the case of  conversion to, or a continuation
of, a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan the requested Interest Period; and
(5) that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would
result from the proposed conversion/continuation.

          In lieu of delivering the Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Borrower
may give Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed
conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2(E); provided that such notice
shall be promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation to Agent on or before the proposed
conversion/continuation date.

          Neither Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to Borrower in
acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that Agent believes in good
faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized
to act on behalf of Borrower or for otherwise acting in good faith under this
subsection 2.2(E) and upon conversion/continuation by Lenders in accordance with
this Agreement pursuant to any telephonic notice, Borrower shall have effected
such conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder.

     2.3  FEES.

          (A)  UNUSED LINE FEE.  Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of
Lenders, a fee in an amount equal to the Revolving Loan Commitment less the sum
of the average daily balance of the Revolving Loan plus the average daily face
amount of the Lender Letter of Credit Reserve during the preceding month
multiplied by one-half of one percent (.5%) per annum, such fee to be calculated
on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be
payable monthly in arrears on the first day of the first month following the
Closing Date and the first day of each month thereafter.

          (B)  LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.  Borrower shall pay to Agent for the
account of Lenders, a fee with respect to the Lender Letters of Credit in the
amount of the average daily amount of Letter of Credit Liability outstanding
during such month multiplied by two and one half percent (2.5%) per annum. Such
fees will be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of
days elapsed and will be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each
month. Borrower shall also reimburse Agent for any and all fees and expenses, if
any, paid by Agent or any Lender to the issuer of Bank Letters of Credit.


                                      -26-

<PAGE>

          (C)  PREPAYMENT FEES.  If Borrower voluntarily prepays (a) the
Obligations in full (other than voluntary prepayments of the Revolving Loan
which do not terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment) or (b) Term Loan A in
whole or in part, Borrower at the time of prepayment shall pay to Agent, for the
benefit of Lenders, as compensation for the costs of being prepared to make
funds available to Borrower under this Agreement, and not as a penalty, an
amount determined by multiplying the percentage set forth below by (1) in the
case of a prepayment in full of the Obligations, the amount of the Revolving
Loan Commitment plus the amount of the then outstanding Term Loans, or (2) in
the case of a prepayment of Term Loan A only, in whole or in part, the amount of
such prepayment:  two percent (2%) upon a prepayment during the first Loan Year
and one percent (1%) upon a prepayment during the second Loan Year.  No
prepayment fees shall be payable for any prepayments made (i) after the second
Loan Year (ii) in the event Borrower prepays the Obligations in full in cash at
any time during which Heller's Total Loan Commitment does not exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the aggregate Total Loan Commitments for all Lenders, (iii)
solely with the proceeds of Borrower's internally generated funds or (iv)
pursuant to a mandatory prepayment in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 2.4(B) or optional prepayment in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 2.11(B).

          (D)  COLLATERAL MONITORING FEE.  On the Closing Date and on the first
day of each December (other than December 1, 1995), March, June and September
thereafter, Borrower shall pay to Agent, for its own account, a nonrefundable
collateral monitoring fee of $3,750.

          (E)  AUDIT FEES.  Borrower shall pay to Agent for its own account an
audit fee for each inspection equal to $650 per auditor per day or any portion
thereof, together with out of pocket expenses.

          (F)  OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES.  Borrower shall pay to Agent, for its
own account, all charges for returned items and all other bank charges incurred
by Agent, as well as Agent's standard wire transfer charges for each wire
transfer made under this Agreement.

     2.4  PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS.

          (A)  MANNER AND TIME OF PAYMENT.  In its sole discretion, Agent may
charge interest and other amounts payable hereunder to the Revolving Loan, all
as set forth on Agent's books and records.  If Agent elects to bill Borrower for
any amount due hereunder, such amount shall be immediately due and payable with
interest thereon as provided herein.  All payments made by Borrower with respect
to the Obligations shall be made without deduction, defense, setoff or
counterclaim.  All payments to Agent hereunder shall, unless otherwise directed
by Agent, be made to Agent's Account or in accordance with subsection 5.6.
Proceeds remitted to  Agent's Depository Account in accordance with subsection
5.6 shall be credited to the Obligations on the first Business Day following the
day such proceeds were received; provided, however, for the purpose of
calculating interest on the Obligations, such funds shall be deemed received on
the first Business Day thereafter.  Proceeds remitted to Agent's Account by wire
transfer shall be credited to the Obligations on the Business Day received.

          (B)  MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.


                                      -27-

<PAGE>

                 OVERADVANCE.  At any time that the principal balance of the
Revolving Loan exceeds the Maximum Revolving Loan Amount, Borrower shall, upon
demand by Agent, immediately repay the Revolving Loan to the extent necessary to
reduce the principal balance to an amount that is equal to or less than the
Maximum Revolving Loan Amount.

               (2)  PROCEEDS OF ASSET DISPOSITIONS.  (i)  Immediately upon
receipt by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the net proceeds of any Asset
Disposition, Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in an amount equal to such
proceeds.  So long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist and Borrower
reasonably expects the proceeds of any Asset Disposition to be reinvested within
180 days to repair or replace such assets with like assets, Borrower shall
deliver the proceeds to Agent to be applied to the Revolving Loan, and Borrower
may, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, reborrow such proceeds only for such repair or replacement.  If
Borrower fails to reinvest such proceeds within 180 days, such proceeds shall be
applied as set forth below.  Provided, however, proceeds from Specified Fixed
Asset Dispositions shall not be eligible for such reinvestment option.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this subsection 2.4(B)(2) to the contrary,
Borrower shall be permitted to retain the net proceeds of any Asset Disposition
so long as such net proceeds do not exceed $200,000 in the aggregate in any
Fiscal Year for all such Asset Dispositions.  Should such proceeds exceed such
minimum, the entire amount and not just the portion above the minimum shall be
subject to this subsection 2.4(B)(2).  Borrower shall remit, or cause its
Subsidiaries to remit, all such net proceeds to Agent's Account for application
to the Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this subsection
2.4(B)(2).

     (ii)  In the event any such net proceeds arise out of an Asset Disposition
which is not a Specified Fixed Asset Disposition, Agent shall apply such net
proceeds to repay Term Loan A (x) in the inverse order of maturity thereof, to
the extent such proceeds are less than or equal to $500,000 and (y) on a pro
rata basis to the extent such net proceeds are greater than $500,000, then to
Term Loan B in the inverse order of maturity thereof and then to the remaining
Obligations in such order as Agent shall elect.

     (iii)  Until such time as Term Loan B has been repaid in full in cash,
Agent shall apply the net proceeds of each Specified Fixed Asset Disposition to
repay the installments of Term Loan B in the order in which they mature.

     (iv) In the event Term Loan B has been repaid in full in cash and the
Orderly Liquidation Value of the Appraised Assets sold or otherwise disposed of
in all Specified Fixed Asset Dispositions through such date is:

          (a) less than the Threshold Amount, then, until such time as the
     Orderly Liquidation Value of the Appraised Assets so disposed of exceeds
     the Threshold Amount, all net proceeds of Specified Fixed Asset
     Dispositions of Appraised Assets shall be applied by Agent to the Revolving
     Loan and all net proceeds of Specified Fixed Asset Dispositions other than
     those applicable to Appraised Assets shall be applied by Agent to repay
     installments of Term Loan A, in the inverse order of maturity and then to
     the remaining Obligations in such order as Agent shall elect; and


                                      -28-

<PAGE>

          (b) greater than the Threshold Amount, then all net proceeds arising
     out of a Specified Fixed Asset Disposition occurring after reaching the
     Threshold Amount, shall be applied by Agent to repay installments of Term
     Loan A, in the inverse order of maturity to the extent such proceeds are
     less than or equal to $500,000 and on a pro rata basis to the extent such
     net proceeds are greater than $500,000 and then to the remaining
     Obligations in such order as Agent shall elect.

     (v)  During the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, all net
proceeds of any Asset Disposition shall be applied by Agent first to all fees,
costs and expenses then owing to Agent and Lender under subsection 10.1, second
to repay Term Loan A in the inverse order of maturity thereof, third to repay
Term Loan B in the inverse order of maturity thereof and fourth to the remaining
Obligations.

               (3)  PREPAYMENTS OF TERM LOAN A.  In the event any of Borrower's
Compliance Certificates delivered to Agent in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 5.1(E) with respect to any applicable four fiscal quarter period of
Borrower discloses that Borrower shall have failed to purchase Qualified Assets
("Qualified Asset Purchases") in an aggregate amount of at least $3,200,000 for
such applicable four fiscal quarter period, Borrower shall repay the remaining
installments of Term Loan A in the inverse order of maturity thereof on the
first Business Day after delivery of the appropriate Compliance Certificate as
required in accordance with the provisions of subsection 5.1(E) in an amount
equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference between (i) $3,200,000 and
(ii) the aggregate amount of expenditures made by Borrower for Qualified Asset
Purchases during such applicable four fiscal quarter period.

          (C)  VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS AND REPAYMENTS.  Except as provided in
subsections 2.1(B), 2.3(C) and 2.4(B), Borrower's Obligations may only be
prepaid or repaid in full and not in part.  Borrower may, at any time upon not
less than three Business Days' prior notice to Agent, prepay Term Loan A or
terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment; provided Borrower pays to Agent for the
benefit of Lenders the applicable prepayment fees set forth in subsection
2.3(C); provided, further the Revolving Loan Commitment may not be terminated by
Borrower until the Term Loans are paid in full.  Upon termination of the
Revolving Loan Commitment, Borrower shall cause Agent and each Lender to be
released from all liability under any Lender Letters of Credit or, at Agent's
option, Borrower will deposit cash collateral with Agent in an amount equal to
105% of the Letter of Credit Liability that will remain outstanding after
prepayment or repayment.

          (D)  PAYMENTS ON BUSINESS DAYS.  Whenever any payment to be made
hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the
payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of
time shall be included in the computation of the amount of interest or fees due
hereunder.

     2.5  TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall be effective until
December 12, 2000 (the "Termination Date").  The Commitments shall (unless
earlier terminated) terminate upon the earlier of (i) the occurrence of an event
specified in subsection 8.3 or (ii) the Termination Date.  Upon termination in
accordance with subsection 8.3 or on the Termination Date, all Obligations shall
become immediately due and payable without notice or demand.  Notwithstanding
any


                                      -29-

<PAGE>

termination, until all Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied, Agent, on
behalf of Lenders, shall be entitled to retain security interests in and liens
upon all Collateral, and even after payment of all Obligations hereunder,
Borrower's obligation to indemnify Agent and each Lender in accordance with the
terms hereof shall continue.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent, on behalf of
Lenders, shall release the security interest in and liens upon all Collateral
upon payment in full of all Obligations hereunder and termination of the
Commitments.

     2.6  STATEMENTS.  Agent shall render a monthly statement of account to
Borrower within twenty (20) days after the end of each month.  Such statement of
account shall constitute an account stated unless Borrower makes written
objection thereto within sixty (60) days from the date such statement is mailed
to Borrower.  Borrower promises to pay all of its Obligations as such amounts
become due or are declared due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

     2.7  GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST.  To secure the payment and performance of
the Obligations, including all renewals, extensions, restructurings and
refinancings of any or all of the Obligations, each Loan Party hereby grants to
Agent, on behalf of Lenders, a continuing security interest and lien in and to
all right, title and interest of such Loan Party in the following property of
such Loan Party, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising
and regardless of where located (all being collectively referred to as the
"Collateral"):  (A) Accounts, and all guaranties and security therefor, and all
goods and rights represented thereby or arising therefrom including the right of
stoppage in transit, replevin and reclamation; (B) Inventory; (C) general
intangibles (as defined in the UCC); (D) documents (as defined in the UCC) or
other receipts covering, evidencing or representing goods; (E) instruments (as
defined in the UCC); (F) chattel paper (as defined in the UCC); (G) Equipment;
(H) Intellectual Property; (I) all deposit accounts of such Loan Party
maintained with any bank or financial institution; (J) all cash and other monies
and property of such Loan Party in the possession or under the control of Agent,
any Lender or any participant; (K) all books, records, ledger cards, files,
correspondence, computer programs, tapes, disks and related data processing
software that at any time evidence or contain information relating to any of the
property described above or are otherwise necessary or helpful in the collection
thereof or realization thereon; and (L) proceeds of all or any of the property
described above, including, without limitation, the proceeds of any insurance
policies covering any of the above described property; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
Agent's security interest in Collateral owned by Borrower on the Closing Date
subject to a Permitted Encumbrance under subsections "(f)" and "(h)" of the
defined term "Permitted Encumbrances" (the "Excluded Collateral") shall not
arise with respect to the Excluded Collateral if and to the extent that (a) the
terms of the agreement or agreements creating or evidencing the Excluded
Collateral prohibit such grant and (b) the term prohibiting such grant is
effective as a matter of law and has not been waived or the consent of the
necessary party to the grant to Agent has not been obtained; PROVIDED, FURTHER,
if any such prohibition is subsequently lifted, terminated or is otherwise no
longer effective as a matter of law or is waived or consent of the necessary
party is obtained, a security interest therein shall automatically arise
hereunder without any further action on the part of Borrower or Agent.

     2.8  CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS.  In the event Agent or any
Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the date hereof of any law,
treaty, governmental (or quasi-governmental) rule, regulation, guideline or
order regarding capital adequacy, reserve requirements or similar requirements
or compliance by Agent or such Lender or any corporation controlling


                                      -30-

<PAGE>

Agent or such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy,
reserve requirements or similar requirements (whether or not having the force of
law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) from any
central bank or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction does or shall
have the effect of increasing the amount of capital, reserves or other funds
required to be maintained by Agent or such Lender or any corporation controlling
Agent or such Lender and thereby reducing the rate of return on Agent's or such
Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder, then Borrower shall from time to time within fifteen (15) days after
notice and demand from such Lender (with a copy to Agent) or Agent (together
with the certificate referred to in the next sentence) pay to Agent or such
Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate Agent or such Lender for such
reduction.  A certificate as to the amount of such cost and showing the basis of
the computation of such cost submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrower shall,
absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

     2.9  TAXES.

          (A)  NO DEDUCTIONS.  Any and all payments or reimbursements made
hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto; excluding, however, the
following:  taxes imposed on the net income of any Lender or Agent and franchise
taxes to the extent based on net income imposed on any Lender or Agent by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which Agent or such Lender is organized or doing
business or any political subdivision thereof and taxes imposed on its net
income or franchise taxes to the extent based on net income by the jurisdiction
of Agent's or such Lender's applicable lending office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto excluding such taxes
imposed on net income and franchise taxes to the extent based on net income,
herein "Tax Liabilities").  If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any
such Tax Liabilities from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to Agent or
any Lender, then the sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be
necessary so that, after making all required deductions, Agent or such Lender
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made.

          (B)  CHANGES IN TAX LAWS.  In the event that, subsequent to the
Closing Date, (i) any changes in any existing law, regulation, treaty or
directive or in the interpretation or application thereof, (ii) any new law,
regulation, treaty or directive enacted or any interpretation or application
thereof, or (iii) compliance by Lender with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any governmental authority, agency or
instrumentality:

               (1)  does or shall subject Agent or any Lender to any tax of any
kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any
Loans made or Lender Letters of Credit issued hereunder, or change the basis of
taxation of payments to Agent or such Lender of principal, fees, interest or any
other amount payable hereunder (except for net income taxes, or franchise taxes
imposed in lieu of net income taxes, imposed generally by federal, state or
local taxing authorities with respect to interest or commitment or other fees
payable hereunder or changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of
Agent or such Lender); or


                                      -31-

<PAGE>

               (2)  does or shall impose on Agent or any Lender any other
condition or increased cost in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or participations herein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to Agent or such Lender of issuing any Lender Letter of Credit
or making or continuing any Loan hereunder, as the case may be, or to reduce any
amount receivable hereunder,

then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay to Agent or such Lender,
upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate Agent or such
Lender, on an after-tax basis, for such additional cost or reduced amount
receivable, as determined by Agent or such Lender with respect to this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents.  If Agent or any Lender becomes entitled to claim
any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify
Borrower of the event by reason of which Agent or such Lender has become so
entitled.  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the
foregoing sentence submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrower shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

          (C)  FOREIGN LENDERS.  Each Lender organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States (a "Foreign Lender") as to which payments
to be made under this Agreement or under any Note are exempt from United States
withholding tax or are subject to United States withholding tax at a reduced
rate under an applicable statute or tax treaty shall provide to Borrower and
Agent (i) a properly completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form 4224
or Form 1001 or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the
Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying as to such Foreign

Foreign Lender stating that it is not entitled to any such exemption or reduced

under this Agreement and within fifteen (15) days after a reasonable written
request of Borrower or Agent from time to time thereafter, each Foreign Lender
that becomes a Lender under this Agreement shall provide a Certificate of

and Agent within the time periods set forth in the preceding paragraph, Borrower
shall withhold taxes from payments to such Foreign Lender at the applicable

Loans has become unlawful or impossible by compliance by Lender in good faith

force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful),
then, and in any such event, that Lender shall promptly give notice (by
telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and Agent of that determination.
Subject to prior withdrawal of a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation or prepayment of the LIBOR

option, notify Agent and such Affected Lender of its intention to do one of the
following:

          (A)  Borrower may obtain, at Borrower's expense, a replacement Lender
("Replacement Lender") for such Affected Lender, which Replacement Lender shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Agent.  In the event Borrower obtains a

do so, the Affected Lender shall sell and assign its Loans and Commitments to

Lender for its increased costs for which it is entitled to reimbursement under
this Agreement through the date of such sale and assignment.

          (B)  Borrower may, without penalty, prepay in full all outstanding
Obligations owed to such Affected Lender and terminate such Affected Lender's
Commitments.  Borrower shall, within ninety (90) days following notice of its
intention to do so, prepay in full all outstanding Obligations owed to such
Affected Lender (including such Affected Lender's increased costs for which it
is entitled to reimbursement under this Agreement through the date of such
prepayment) and terminate such Affected Lender's Commitments.

     2.12 COMPENSATION.  Borrower shall compensate Lender, upon written request
by Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
requesting such amounts and which shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive
and binding upon all parties hereto), for all reasonable losses, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss (including interest paid)
sustained by Lender in connection with the re-employment of such funds), Lender
may sustain:  (i) if for any reason (other than a default by Lender) a borrowing
of any LIBOR Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing, a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or a
telephonic request for borrowing or Conversion/Continuation; (ii) if any
prepayment of any of its LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans occurs on a date
that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan; (iii) if
any prepayment of any of its LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans is not made on

Fixed Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement; provided that

reserve an equal amount from amounts otherwise available to be borrowed under

Subsidiaries to, pay all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges
imposed upon it or any of its properties or assets or with respect to any of its

insurers, public liability and property damage insurance with respect to its

business interruption insurance received by Agent hereunder shall be applied by
Agent to the Revolving Loan and (b) in the event there shall be no Revolving
Loans outstanding, Agent, upon Borrower's request therefor, shall remit such
business interruption proceeds to Borrower.

Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act.

     5.16 REQUIRED QUALIFIED ASSET EXPENDITURES.  Borrower shall make purchases

<PAGE>

     8.2  SUSPENSION OF COMMITMENTS.  Upon the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default, notwithstanding any grace period or right to cure, Agent may
or upon demand by Requisite Lenders shall, without notice or demand, immediately
cease making additional Loans and the Commitments shall be suspended; PROVIDED
that, in the case of a Default, if the subject condition or event is waived or
cured within any applicable grace or cure period, the Commitments shall be
reinstated.

     8.3  ACCELERATION.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described
in the foregoing subsections 8.1(G) or 8.1(H), all Obligations shall
automatically become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or other requirements of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by each Loan Party, and the Commitments shall thereupon terminate.  Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, Agent
may, and upon demand by Requisite Lenders shall, by written notice to Borrower,
(a) declare all or any portion of the Obligations to be, and the same shall
forthwith become, immediately due and payable and the Commitments shall
thereupon terminate and (b) demand that Borrower immediately deposit with Agent
an amount equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the Letter of Credit
Reserve to enable Lender to make payments under the Lender Letters of Credit
when required and such amount shall become immediately due and payable.

     8.4  REMEDIES.  If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights or remedies
available to Agent and Lenders at law or in equity, Agent may and shall upon the
request of Requisite Lenders exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition
to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to
it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the UCC
(whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and may also (a)
notify any or all obligors on the Accounts to make all payments directly to
Agent; (b) require each Loan Party to, and each Loan Party hereby agrees that it
will, at its expense and upon request of Agent forthwith, assemble all or part
of the Collateral of such Loan Party as directed by Agent and make it available
to Agent at a place to be designated by Agent which is reasonably convenient to
both parties; (c) withdraw all cash in the Agent's Depository Account and apply
such monies in payment of the Obligations in the manner provided in subsection
8.7; (d) without notice or demand or legal process, enter upon any premises of
any or all Loan Parties and take possession of the Collateral; and (e) without
notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one
or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Agent's offices or
elsewhere, at such time or times, for cash, on credit or for future delivery,
and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as Agent may deem
commercially reasonable.  Each Loan Party agrees that, to the extent notice of
sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days notice to Borrower on
behalf of all Loan Parties of the time and place of any public sale or the time
after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable
notification.  At any sale of the Collateral, if permitted by law, Agent or any
Lender may bid (which bid may be, in whole or in part, in the form of
cancellation of indebtedness) for the purchase of the Collateral or any portion
thereof for the account of Agent or such Lender.  Agent shall not be obligated
to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.
Each Loan Party shall remain liable for any deficiency.  Agent may adjourn any
public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place
fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time
and place to which it was so adjourned.  To the extent permitted by law, each
Loan Party hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay


                                      -56-

<PAGE>

or appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter
enacted.  Agent shall not be required to proceed against any Collateral but may
proceed against any or all Loan Parties directly.

     8.5  APPOINTMENT OF ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.  Each Loan Party hereby constitutes
and appoints Agent as such Loan Party's attorney-in-fact with full authority in
the place and stead of such Loan Party and in the name of such Loan Party, Agent
or otherwise, from time to time in Agent's discretion while an Event of Default
is continuing to take any action and to execute any instrument that Agent may
deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement,
including: (a) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and
give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in
respect of any of the Collateral; (b) to adjust, settle or compromise the amount
or payment of any Account, or release wholly or partly any customer or obligor
thereunder or allow any credit or discount thereon; (c) to receive, endorse, and
collect any drafts or other instruments, documents and chattel paper, in
connection with clause (a) above; (d) to file any claims or take any action or
institute any proceedings that Agent may deem necessary or desirable for the
collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of Agent
and Lenders with respect to any of the Collateral; and (e) to sign and endorse
any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse
receipts, assignments, verifications and notices in connection with Accounts and
other documents relating to the Collateral.  The appointment of Agent as each
Loan Party's attorney and Agent's rights and powers are coupled with an interest
and are irrevocable until payment in full and complete performance of all of the
Obligations.

     8.6  LIMITATION ON DUTY OF AGENT WITH RESPECT TO COLLATERAL.  Beyond the
safe custody thereof, Agent and each Lender shall have no duty with respect to
any Collateral in its possession or control (or in the possession or control of
any agent or bailee) or with respect to any income thereon or the preservation
of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto.  Agent
shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which Agent accords its own property.
Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be liable or responsible for any loss or
damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by
reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency,
consignee or other agent or bailee selected by Agent in good faith.

     8.7  APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.  Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, (a) each Loan Party irrevocably waives the
right to direct the application of any and all payments at any time or times
thereafter received by Agent from or on behalf of such Loan Party, and each Loan
Party hereby irrevocably agrees that Agent shall have the continuing exclusive
right to apply and to reapply any and all payments received at any time or times
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default against
the Obligations in such manner as Agent may deem advisable notwithstanding any
previous entry by Agent upon any books and records  and (b) the proceeds of any
sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral shall be
applied: FIRST, to all fees, costs and expenses incurred by Agent or any Lender
with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Collateral;
SECOND, to all fees due and owing to Agent and Lenders; THIRD, to accrued and
unpaid interest on the Obligations; FOURTH, to the principal amounts of the
Obligations outstanding; FIFTH, to any other indebtedness or


                                      -57-

<PAGE>

obligations of each Loan Party owing to Agent or any Lender and SIXTH to
Borrower, its successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may
direct.

     8.8  LICENSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  Each Loan Party hereby assigns,
transfers and conveys to Agent, for the benefit Lenders, effective upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, the non-exclusive right and
license to use all Intellectual Property owned or used by such Loan Party
together with any goodwill associated therewith, but only to the extent
necessary to enable Agent to realize on the Collateral and any successor or
assign to enjoy the benefits of the Collateral.  This right and license shall
inure to the benefit of all successors, assigns and transferees of Agent and its
successors, assigns and transferees, whether by voluntary conveyance, operation
of law, assignment, transfer, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise.  Such right and license is granted free of charge, without
requirement that any monetary payment whatsoever be made to any Loan Party by
Agent.

     8.9  WAIVERS, NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES.  No failure on the part of Agent or
any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising and no course of dealing with
respect to, any right under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by Agent
or any Lender of any right under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right.  The rights in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.


     SECTION 9.  ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION

     9.1  ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS IN LOANS.

          (A)  Each Lender may assign its rights and delegate its obligations
under this Agreement to another Person; PROVIDED, that (a) such Lender shall
first obtain the written consent of Agent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, (b) the amount of Commitments and Loans of the assigning Lender being
assigned shall in no event be less than the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the
entire amount of the Commitments and Loans of such assigning Lender and (c)(i)
each such assignment shall be of a pro rata portion of all such assigning
Lender's Loans and Commitments hereunder, and (ii) the parties to such
assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent for acceptance and recording a
Lender Addition Agreement together with (x) a processing and recording fee of
$2,500 payable to Agent and (y) the Notes originally delivered to the assigning
Lender.  Upon receipt of all of the foregoing, Agent shall notify Borrower of
such assignment and Borrower shall comply with its obligations under the last
sentence of subsection 2.1(E).  In the case of an assignment authorized under
this subsection 9.1, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment,
the same rights, benefits and obligations as it would if it were a Lender
hereunder.  The assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder
with respect to its Commitment or assigned portion thereof.  Borrower hereby
acknowledges and agrees that any assignment will give rise to a direct
obligation of Borrower to the assignee and that the assignee shall be considered
to be a "Lender".  No Lender will directly assign its rights to a Foreign Lender
unless such Foreign Lender has provided such Lender with a current Certificate
of Exemption.


                                      -58-

<PAGE>

          (B)  Each Lender may sell participations in all or any part of any
Loans made by it to another Person (provided that such Lender shall remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder); PROVIDED, that
any such participation shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that all amounts payable by Borrower hereunder shall be determined as
if that Lender had not sold such participation and the holder of any such
participation shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to
take any action hereunder except action directly effecting (a) any reduction in
the principal amount, interest rate or fees payable with respect to any Loan in
which such holder participates; (b) any extension of the Termination Date or the
date fixed for any payment of principal, interest or fees payable with respect
to any Loan in which such holder participates; and (c) any release of
substantially all of the Collateral (other than in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or the Loan Documents).  Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees
that any participation will give rise to a direct obligation of Borrower to the
participant, and the participant shall for purposes of subsection 2.8, 2.9,
2.10, 9.4 and 10.2 be considered to be a "Lender".

          (C)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 9.1 no Lender
shall, as between Borrower and that Lender, be relieved of any of its
obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment, transfer or
negotiation of, or granting of participation in, all or any part of the Loans or
other Obligations owed to such Lender.  Each Lender may furnish any information
concerning any Loan Party and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender
from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees
and participants) provided that the Persons obtaining such information agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of such information to the extent required by
subsection 10.21.

          (D)  Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Loans owing
to it and the Note held by it in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance
with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

     9.2  AGENT.

          (A)  APPOINTMENT.  Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Heller
as its agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and each Lender hereby
irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action or to refrain from taking such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan
Documents and to exercise such powers as are set forth herein or therein,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Agent is
authorized and empowered to amend, modify, or waive any provisions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents on behalf of Lenders subject to the
requirement that certain of Lenders' consent be obtained in certain instances as
provided in subsection 9.3.  Agent agrees to act as such on the express
conditions contained in this subsection 9.2.  The provisions of this subsection
9.2 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and neither Borrower nor any
Loan Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the
provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement,
Agent shall act solely as an administrative representative of Lenders and does
not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or
relationship of


                                      -59-

<PAGE>

agency or trust with or for Lenders, Borrower or any Loan Party.  Agent may
perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Loan Documents, by or through
its agents or employees.

          (B)  NATURE OF DUTIES.  Agent shall have no duties, obligations or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Loan Documents.  The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature.  Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Lender.  Each Lender shall make its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower in
connection with the extension of credit hereunder and shall make its own
appraisal of the credit worthiness of Borrower, and Agent shall have no duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into
its possession before the Closing Date or at any time or times thereafter.  If
Agent seeks the consent or approval of any Lenders to the taking or refraining
from taking any action hereunder, then Agent shall send notice thereof to each
Lender.  Agent shall promptly notify each Lender any time that the applicable
percentage of Lenders have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting
pursuant hereto.

          (C)  RIGHTS, EXCULPATION, ETC.  Neither Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable to any Lender for any action
taken or omitted by them hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, except that Agent shall be obligated on the
terms set forth herein for performance of its express obligations hereunder, and
except that Agent shall be liable with respect to its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.  Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment
or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made, shall be to recover
from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are
determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such
Lender any such erroneous payments received by them).  In performing its
functions and duties hereunder, Agent shall exercise the same care which it
would in dealing with loans for its own account, but Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, collectibility, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the
Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial
condition of any Loan Party.  Agent shall not be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions
or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the financial
condition of any Loan Party, or the existence or possible existence of any
Default or Event of Default.  Agent may at any time request instructions from
Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this
Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents Agent is permitted or required to take
or to grant, and Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any
action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability
whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding any
approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such
instructions from the applicable percentage of the Lenders.  Without limiting
the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent
as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the
applicable percentage of the Lenders and notwithstanding the instructions of
Lenders, Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it, in good faith
believes that such action exposes Agent to any liability.


                                      -60-

<PAGE>

          (D)  RELIANCE.  Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written
notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or any telephone
message or other communication (including any writing, telex, telecopy or
telegram) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all matters
pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and its duties
hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.  Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel, independent accountants, and
other experts selected by Agent in its sole discretion.

          (E)  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each Lender, severally, agrees to reimburse and
indemnify Agent for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent
under this Agreement for any of the Loan Documents, in proportion to each
Lender's Pro Rata Share; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or disbursements resulting
from Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The obligations of Lenders
under this subsection 9.2(E) shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

          (F)  HELLER INDIVIDUALLY.  With respect to its Commitments and the
Loans made by it, and the Notes issued to it, Heller shall have and may exercise
the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and
liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other Lender.  The
terms "Lenders" or "Requisite Lenders" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include Heller in its individual capacity
as a Lender or one of the Requisite Lenders.  Heller may lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with any Loan
Party as if it were not acting as Agent pursuant hereto.

          (G)  SUCCESSOR AGENT.

               (1)  RESIGNATION.  Agent may resign from the performance of all
its functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30)
Business Days' prior written notice to Borrower and the Lenders.  Such
resignation shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Agent of
appointment pursuant to clause (2) below or as otherwise provided below.

               (2)  APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.  Upon any such notice of
resignation pursuant to clause (G)(1) above, Requisite Lenders shall, upon
receipt of Borrower's prior consent which shall not unreasonably be withheld,
appoint a successor Agent.  If a successor Agent shall not have been so
appointed within said thirty (30) Business Day period, the retiring Agent, upon
notice to Borrower, shall then appoint a successor Agent who shall serve as
Agent until such time, as Requisite Lenders, upon receipt of Borrower's prior
written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, appoint a successor
Agent as provided above.

               (3)  SUCCESSOR AGENT.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent under the Loan Documents by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed


                                      -61-

<PAGE>

to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under the Loan Documents.  After any retiring Agent's resignation as
Agent under the Loan Documents, the provisions of this subsection 9.2 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under the Loan Documents.

          (H)  COLLATERAL MATTERS.

               (1)  RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.  Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize
Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or
held by Agent upon any property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents
(i) upon termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction of all
Obligations; (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if Borrower on
behalf of each Loan Party certifies to Agent that the sale or disposition is
made in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement (and Agent may rely in
good faith conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or
(iii) constituting property leased to any Loan Party under a lease which has
expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is
about to expire and which has not been, and is not intended by such Loan Party
to be, renewed or extended.  In addition during any Fiscal Year (x) Agent may
release Collateral having a book value of not more than 10% of the book value of
all Collateral, (y) Agent, with the consent of Requisite Lenders, may release
Collateral having a book value of not more than 25% of the book value of all
Collateral and (z) Agent, with the consent of Lenders having 90% of (i) the
Total Loan Commitments and (ii) Loans, may release all the Collateral.

               (2)  CONFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY; EXECUTION OF RELEASES.  Without
in any manner limiting Agent's authority to act without any specific or further
authorization or consent by Lenders (as set forth in subsection 9.2(H)(1)), each
Lender agrees to confirm in writing, upon request by Borrower on behalf of each
Loan Party, the authority to release any property covered by this Agreement or
the Loan Documents conferred upon Agent under subsection 9.2(H)(1).  So long as
no Event of Default is then continuing, upon receipt by Agent of confirmation
from the requisite percentage of Lenders, of its authority to release any
particular item or types of property covered by this Agreement or the Loan
Documents, and upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written request by
Borrower on behalf of each Loan Party, Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably
authorized by Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence
the release of the Liens granted to Agent for the benefit of Lenders herein or
pursuant hereto upon such Collateral; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) Agent shall
not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in Agent's opinion,
would expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty,
and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the
Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of any Loan Party, in respect of),
all interests retained by any Loan Party, including, without limitation, the
proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the
property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents.

               (3)  ABSENCE OF DUTY.  Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever
to any Lender or any other Person to assure that the property covered by this
Agreement or the Loan Documents exists or is owned by the applicable Loan Party
or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens
granted to Agent on behalf of Lenders herein or pursuant



                                      -62-

<PAGE>

hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected,
protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise
at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or
fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers
granted or available to Agent in this subsection 9.2(H) or in any of the Loan
Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the property
covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents or any act, omission or event
related thereto, Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its
discretion, given Agent's own interest in property covered by this Agreement or
the Loan Documents as one of the Lenders and that Agent shall have no duty or
liability whatsoever to any of the other Lenders; PROVIDED, that Agent shall
exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account.

          (I)  AGENCY FOR PERFECTION.  Each Lender hereby appoints each other
Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Lenders' security interest in
Collateral which, in accordance with ARTICLE 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in
any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected only by possession.  Should any
Lender (other than Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender
shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent's request therefor, shall
deliver such Collateral to Agent or in accordance with Agent's instructions.

          (J)  EXERCISE OF REMEDIES.  Each Lender agrees that it will not have
any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or any Loan
Document or to realize upon any collateral security for the Loans, it being
understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by
Agent.

     9.3  CONSENTS.

          (A)  In the event Agent requests the consent of a Lender and does not
receive a written denial thereof within five (5) Business Days after such
Lender's receipt of such request, then such Lender will be deemed to have given
such consent.

          (B)  In the event Agent requests the consent of a Lender and such
consent is denied, then Heller may, at its option, require such Lender to assign
its interest in the Loans to Heller for a price equal to the then outstanding
principal amount thereof PLUS accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such
Lender, which interest and fees will be paid when collected from Borrower.  In
the event that Heller elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to
Heller, Heller will so notify such Lender in writing within forty-five (45) days
following such Lender's denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to
Heller no later than five (5) days following receipt of such notice.

     9.4  SET OFF AND SHARING OF PAYMENTS.  In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
each Lender is hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time to time,
with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to Borrower on behalf of all Loan
Parties or to any other Person (any prior or contemporaneous notice being hereby
expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all (A)
balances held by such Lender or such holder at any of its offices for the
account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such
balances are then due to any Loan Party or its Subsi-


                                      -63-

<PAGE>

diaries), and (B) other property at any time held or owing by such Lender or
such  holder to or for the credit or for the account of any Loan Party or any of
its Subsidiaries, against and on account of any of the Obligations which are not
paid when due; except that no Lender or any such holder shall exercise any such
right without the prior written consent of Agent.  Any Lender which has
exercised its right to set off shall, to the extent the amount of any such set
off exceeds its Pro Rata Share of the Obligations, purchase for cash (and the
other Lenders or holders shall sell) participations in each such other Lender's
or holder's Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause
such Lender to share such excess with each other Lender or holder in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares.  Each Loan Party agrees, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, that (a) any Lender or holder may exercise its right to
set off with respect to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the
Obligations and may sell participations in such excess to other Lenders and
holders, and (b) any Lender or holder so purchasing a participation in the Loans
made or other Obligations held by other Lenders or holders may exercise all
rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender or holder were a direct holder of
Loans and other Obligations in the amount of such participation.

     9.5  DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.  Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, disburse
funds to Borrower for Loans requested.  Each Lender shall reimburse Agent on
demand for all funds disbursed on its behalf by Agent, or if Agent so requests,
each Lender will remit to Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Loan before Agent
disburses same to Borrower.  If Agent elects to require that funds be made
available prior to disbursement to Borrower, Agent shall advise each Lender by
telephone, telex or telecopy of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
such requested Loan no later than (a) one (1) Business Day prior to the Funding
Date applicable thereto for LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans and (b) by 1:00
p.m. Central time on the Funding Date for Base Rate Loans, and each such Lender
shall pay Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such requested Loan, in same day
funds, by wire transfer to Agent's Account not later than 10:00 a.m. Central
time on such Funding Date for LIBOR Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans and 3:00 p.m.
Central time for Base Rate Loans.  If any Lender fails to pay the amount of its
Pro Rata Share forthwith upon Agent's demand, Agent shall promptly notify
Borrower, and Borrower shall immediately repay such amount to Agent.  Any
repayment required pursuant to this subsection 9.5 shall be without premium or
penalty.  Nothing in this subsection 9.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, including without limitation the provisions of subsection
9.6, shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender
or to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments
hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Agent or Borrower may have against any
Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

     9.6  SETTLEMENTS, PAYMENTS AND INFORMATION.

          (A)  REVOLVING LOAN ADVANCES AND PAYMENTS; FEE PAYMENTS.

               (1)  The Revolving Loan balance may fluctuate from day to day
through Agent's disbursement of funds to, and receipt of funds from, Borrower.
In order to minimize the frequency of transfers of funds between Agent and each
Lender notwithstanding terms to the contrary set forth in Section 2 and
subsection 9.5, Revolving Loan advances and payments may be settled according to
the procedures described in subsection 9.6(A)(2) and 9.6(A)(3) of this


                                      -64-

<PAGE>

Agreement.  Payments of principal, interest and fees in respect of the Term
Loans will be settled on the Business Day received in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.  Notwithstanding these procedures, each Lender's
obligation to fund its portion of any advances made by Agent to Borrower will
commence on the date such advances are made by Agent.  Such payments will be
made by such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or reduction of any kind.

               (2)  Once each week, or more frequently (including daily), if
Agent so elects (each such day being a "Settlement Date"), Agent will advise
each Lender by 1 p.m. Central time by telephone, telex, or telecopy of the
amount of each such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan balance.  In
the event that payments are necessary to adjust the amount of such Lender's
share of the Revolving Loan balance to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Revolving Loan, the party from which such payment is due will pay the other, in
same day funds, by wire transfer to the other's account not later than 3:00 p.m.
Central time on the Business Day following the Settlement Date.

               (3)  On the first Business Day of each month ("Interest
Settlement Date"), Agent will advise each Lender by telephone, telefax or
telecopy of the amount of interest and fees charged to and collected from
Borrower for the proceeding month.  Provided that such Lender has made all
payments required to be made by it under this Agreement, Agent will pay to such
Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender's account (as specified by such Lender
on the signature page of this Agreement as amended by such Lender from time to
time after the date hereof pursuant to the notice provisions contained herein or
in the applicable Lender Addition Agreement) not later than 3 p.m. Central time
on the next Business Day following the Interest Settlement Date such Lender's
share of such interest and fees.

          (B)  AVAILABILITY OF LENDER'S PRO RATA SHARE.

               (1)  Unless Agent has been notified by a Lender prior to a
Funding Date of such Lender's intention not to fund its Pro Rata Share of the
Loan amount requested by Borrower, Agent may assume that such Lender will make
such amount available to Agent on the Funding Date or the Business Day following
the next Settlement Date, as applicable.  If such amount is not, in fact, made
available to Agent by such Lender when due, Agent will be entitled to recover
such amount on demand from such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or
deduction of any kind.

               (2)  Nothing contained in this subsection 9.6(B) will be deemed
to relieve a Lender of its obligation to fulfill its Commitments or to prejudice
any rights Agent or Borrower may have against such Lender as a result of any
default by such Lender under this Agreement.

               (3)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Lender shall be obligated to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan made
with respect to any draw on a Lender Letter of Credit.


                                      -65-

<PAGE>

          (C)  RETURN OF PAYMENTS

               (1)  If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in
the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by
Agent from Borrower and such related payment is not received by Agent, then
Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender without set-off,
counterclaim or deduction of any kind.

               (2)  If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by
Agent under this Agreement must be returned to Borrower or paid to any other
Person pursuant to any solvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any
other term or condition of this Agreement, Agent will not be required to
distribute any portion thereof to any Lender.  In addition, each Lender will
repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed
to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is
required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without set-off, counterclaim
or deduction of any kind.

     9.7  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.  Agent will provide Lenders with any
information received by Agent from any Loan Party which is required to be
provided to a Lender hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Agent shall not be
liable to Lenders for any failure to do so, except to the extent that such
failure is attributable to Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     9.8  DISCRETIONARY ADVANCES.  Agent may, in its sole discretion, (i)
provided that no Event of Default exists, make Revolving Loans of up to 10% in
excess of the limitations set forth in subsection 2.1 (B)(1)(b) but not in
excess of the limitation set forth in subsection 2.1 (B)(1)(a) for a period of
not more than 30 consecutive days and (ii) during the continuance of an Event of
Default, make Revolving Loans in excess of the limitations set forth in
subsection 2.1 (B)(1) for the purpose of preserving or protecting the
Collateral.


     SECTION 10.  MISCELLANEOUS

     10.1 EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.  Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, each Loan Party jointly and severally

arrangements provided under this Agreement, whether in the nature of a "workout"

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this Section 10.1 shall obligate any Loan
Party with expenses arising solely from the relationship between Lenders INTER
SE or among participants.

     10.2 INDEMNITY.  In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to
subsection 10.1, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or arising solely out of the
relationship between Lenders INTER SE.

     10.3 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

          (A)  Except as otherwise provided herein, no amendment, modification,

it was given.  No amendment, modification, termination or waiver shall be
required for Agent to take additional Collateral pursuant to any Loan Document.


          (C)  No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any
Lender Letter of Credit shall be applicable without the written concurrence of

Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.  Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this subsection 10.3 shall be binding upon each
holder of the Notes at the time outstanding, each future holder of the Notes,

5 of this Agreement (other than any such breach which constitutes an Event of
Default) or (2) any Default constituting a condition to the funding of any
Revolving Loan or issuance of any Lender Letter of Credit, such waiver shall
expire on the date upon which the Default which was the subject of such waiver
matures into an Event of Default pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

     10.5 SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND CERTAIN AGREEMENTS.  All agreements,
representations and warranties made herein shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to the contrary,
the agreements of each Loan Party set forth in subsections 10.1 and 10.2 shall
survive the payment of the Loans and the termination of this Agreement.

     10.6 INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER.  No failure or delay on the part of Agent, any
Lender or any holder of any Notes in the exercise of any power, right or
privilege hereunder or under the Notes shall impair such power, right or
privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or
privilege.

     10.7 MARSHALING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.  Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be
under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any
other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.  To the
extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to Agent and/or any
Lender or Agent and/or any Lender enforces its security interests


                                      -69-

<PAGE>

or exercise its rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state
or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied,
and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement
or setoff had not occurred.

     10.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan
Documents referred to herein embody the final, entire agreement among the
parties hereto and supersede any and all prior commitments, agreements,
representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof and may not be contradicted or varied by evidence of
prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements or discussions of the
parties hereto.  There are no oral agreements among the parties hereto.

     10.9 INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS.  All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception
to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid
the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or
condition exists.

     10.10 SEVERABILITY.  The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction of any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents shall not affect or impair the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations under this Agreement,
or the other Loan Documents or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction.

     10.11 LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS.
The obligation of each Lender hereunder is several and not joint and neither
Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for the obligation or commitment of
any other Lender hereunder.  In the event that any Lender at any time should
fail to make a Loan as herein provided, the Lenders, or any of them, at their
sole option, may make the Loan that was to have been made by the Lender so
failing to make such Loan.  Nothing contained in any Loan Document and no action
taken by Agent or any Lender pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to
constitute Lenders to be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender
shall be a separate and independent debt, and, provided Agent fails or refuses
to exercise any remedies against any Loan Party after receiving the direction of
the Requisite Lenders, each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its
rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any other
Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

     10.12 HEADINGS.  Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns except that no Loan Party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder
without the written consent of Lenders.

     10.15 NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP; LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES.

          (A)  No provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents and no course of dealing between the parties shall be deemed to create
any fiduciary duty by Agent or any Lender to any Loan Party.

          (B)  Neither Agent nor any Lender, nor any affiliate, officer,
director, shareholder, employee, attorney, or agent of Agent or any Lender shall
have any liability with respect to, and each Loan Party hereby waives, releases,
and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special, indirect,
incidental, or consequential damages suffered or incurred by any Loan Party in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any

in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK
STATE OF NEW YORK AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT, SUBJECT TO AGENT'S ELECTION, ALL
ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES

UNCONDITIONALLY, THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS AND
WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND
BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES,
THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE OBLIGATIONS.

     10.17 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH LOAN PARTY, AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY
WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS.  EACH LOAN PARTY, AGENT AND EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER
IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT


                                      -71-

<PAGE>

EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER
IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS.  EACH LOAN PARTY, AGENT AND EACH LENDER
FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL
COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS

     10.18 CONSTRUCTION.  Each Loan Party, Agent and each Lender each
acknowledges that it has had the benefit of legal counsel of its own choice and
has been afforded an opportunity to review this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with its legal counsel and that this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be construed as if jointly drafted by each Loan Party, Agent and
each Lender.

     10.19 COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS.  This Agreement and any amendments,
waivers, consents, or supplements may be executed in any number of counterparts
and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a counterpart hereof by
each of the parties hereto.

     10.20 NO DUTY.  All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, and other
professional Persons and consultants retained by Agent or any Lender shall have
the right to act exclusively in the interest of Agent or such Lender and shall
have no duty of disclosure, duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or
obligation of any type or nature whatsoever to any Loan Party or any
shareholders of any Loan Party or any other Person.

     10.21 CONFIDENTIALITY.  Agent and Lenders shall hold all nonpublic
information obtained pursuant to the requirements hereof and identified as such
by any Loan Party in accordance with such Person's customary procedures for
handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and
sound business practices and in any event may make disclosure reasonably
required by a bona fide offeree or assignee (or participation), or as required
or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof, or

and shall require any such offeree or assignee (or participant) to agree (and
require any of its offerees, assignees or participants to agree) to comply with
this Section 10.21.  In no event shall the Agent or any Lender be obligated or
required to return any materials furnished by any Loan Party; provided, however,

<PAGE>

          SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of December 12,
1995 between UNITEL VIDEO, INC. ("Unitel" or the "Borrower") and THE CHASE
MANHATTAN BANK, N.A. ("Chase" or the "Bank").


                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

          1.  REFERENCES.  Reference is made to each of (a) the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement and Guaranty dated as of May 6, 1992 among the
Borrower, R Squared, Inc. ("R Squared"), Chase, Chemical Bank ("Chemical") (each
of Chase and Chemical a "Bank" and collectively, the "Banks"), Chemical as
revolving credit agent for the Banks, and Chase as collateral agent for the
Banks (as previously amended and supplemented from time to time, the "1992
Credit Agreement"); and (b) the Assignment of Loans, Liens and Loan Documents
dated the date hereof (the "Assignment Agreement") among the Borrower, R
Squared, Chase, Chemical, and Heller Financial Inc. ("Heller").

          2.  BIFURCATION.  Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement each of Chase
and Chemical sold and assigned all of their respective rights and obligations
under the 1992 Credit Agreement to Heller (other than any mortgage related
indebtedness owed to Chase under the 1992 Credit Agreement).  As set forth in
the fourth Preliminary Statement hereof, Chase retains mortgage related
indebtedness under the 1992 Credit Agreement of Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000) (the "Chase Indebtedness").

          The 1992 Credit Agreement shall now be bifurcated such that the
indebtedness sold and assigned to Heller pursuant to the Assignment Agreement
shall be governed by the terms and provisions of the Amended and Restated Loan
and Security Agreement dated the date hereof between Unitel and Heller, as agent
and lender, and the Chase Indebtedness shall be governed by the terms and
provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

          3.  AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT.  To the extent this Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement amends the 1992 Credit Agreement, the 1992 Credit
Agreement is amended, and to the extent this Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement restates the 1992 Credit Agreement, the 1992 Credit Agreement is
restated.

          4.  MORTGAGED PROPERTY.  Chase is currently the owner and holder of a
consolidated note made by the Borrower which is more particularly described in
that certain Note Modification and Consolidation Agreement between the Borrower
and Chase dated as of May 18, 1992 and which

<PAGE>

consolidated note evidences an indebtedness in the principal amount of Three
Million Eight Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty-Three Dollars and
Thirty-Five Cents ($3,845,833.35) as of the date hereof (the "Existing Chase
Note").  The Existing Chase Note is secured by a consolidated mortgage made by
the Borrower which is more particularly described in that certain Mortgage
Modification and Consolidation Agreement by and among the New York City
Industrial Development Agency (the "Agency"), the Borrower and Chase dated as of
May 18, 1992 (the "Existing Chase Mortgage") and which encumbers the Mortgaged
Property (as hereinafter defined).  In order to restructure and refinance the
existing indebtedness evidenced by the Existing Chase Note and extend a
restructured credit facility to the Borrower, on the date hereof Chase shall
advance an amount equal to One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand One Hundred Sixty-Six
Dollars and Sixty-Five Cents ($154,166.65) to Chemical and take by assignment
from Chemical a severed note made by the Borrower (the "Existing Chemical Note")
and the severed mortgage made by the Borrower and the Agency which encumbers the
Mortgaged Property (the "Existing Chemical Mortgage") and which secures the
Borrower's obligations under the Existing Chemical Note, and Chase shall
consolidate the Existing Chase Note with the Existing Chemical Note, as
assigned, into a single indebtedness in the principal amount of Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000) pursuant to a Note Consolidation and Modification Agreement
between the Borrower and Chase of even date herewith (the "Note Consolidation
and Modification Agreement" in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto) (the
Existing Chase Note and the Existing Chemical Note, as consolidated and
modified, the "Amended and Restated Term Loan Note" in substantially the form of
Exhibit A hereto) and consolidate the Existing Chase Mortgage with the Existing
Chemical Mortgage, as assigned, into a single lien of $4,000,000 pursuant to a

of even date herewith (the "Mortgage Consolidation and Modification Agreement"
in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto) (the Existing Chase Mortgage and
the Existing Chemical Mortgage, as consolidated and modified, the "Consolidated
Term Loan Mortgage" in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto).

             AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED TERM LOAN

terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, that as of the Third Closing
Date, the Existing Chase Note and the Existing Chemical Note will be
consolidated into a single Amended and Restated Term Loan Note consolidating and
continuing a loan (the "Amended and Restated Term Loan") to the Borrower in a

Rate Loan; or (4) any combination of the foregoing, as determined by the

          In the case of Fixed Rate Loans, the Borrower may make one request
that Chase convert, subject to the terms hereof, all or part of any type of Loan
into a Loan to which the Fixed Rate applies by providing Chase with a written or
telegraphic or facsimile request (effective upon receipt), by no later than
10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the proposed date of borrowing, specifying the
proposed amount of such Loan and requesting that Chase quote a rate for such
Loan to the Borrower. If Chase, in its sole discretion, quotes a rate to the
Borrower in response to such request and the Borrower immediately accepts such
rate, then such annual rate of interest shall apply to such Fixed Rate Loan
until the Maturity Date. If Chase in its sole discretion does not quote a rate
to the Borrower or if the Borrower fails to accept the quoted rate, the
applicable annual rate of interest which applies to such Loan shall be the Prime
Rate or the LIBOR Interest Rate in accordance with the Section 2.10 hereof.
Once all or a portion of the Amended and Restated Term Loan has been converted
to a Fixed Rate Loan, no other portion of the Amended and Restated Term Loan can
be converted to a Fixed Rate Loan.

          SECTION 2.03  INTEREST.  The Borrower shall pay interest to the Bank
on the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of the Amended and Restated Term
Loan at a rate per annum as follows: (1) for a Prime Rate Loan at a rate equal
to the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin; (2) for a LIBOR Loan at a rate
equal to the LIBOR Interest Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and (3) for a Fixed
Rate Loan at a rate equal to the Fixed Rate.  Any principal amount not paid when
due (at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest thereafter,
payable on demand, at the Default Rate.

          The interest rate on each Prime Rate Loan shall change when the Prime
Rate changes.  Interest on each Amended and Restated Term Loan shall not exceed
the maximum amount permitted under applicable law and shall be calculated on the
basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days for the actual number of days
elapsed.

          Accrued interest shall be due and payable in arrears upon any payment
of principal and (1) for each Prime Rate Loan and Fixed Rate Loan, on each
Monthly Date, commencing the first such date after the Third Closing Date, (2)
for each LIBOR Loan, on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto
and, in the case of an Interest Period greater than three (3) months, at three
(3) months' intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and (3)
interest accruing at the Default Rate shall be due and payable on demand.

Restated Term Loan Note of the Borrower, in substantially the form of Exhibit A
duly completed, in the principal amount equal to Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000), payable to the Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office.  The Amended and Restated Term Loan Note shall be dated the Third
Closing Date and the principal of the Amended and Restated Term Loan shall be
repaid in eighty-four (84) consecutive monthly installments where each of the
first eighty-three (83) installments shall be in an amount equal to Twenty-Two
Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($22,250) and the eighty-fourth
installment shall be in an amount equal to Two Million One Hundred Fifty-Three
Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($2,153,250); the first installment shall be
due on January 5, 1996, with subsequent installments on the fifth day of each
month thereafter, to and including December 5, 2002; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
last such installment shall be in an amount necessary to repay in full the
unpaid principal amount of such Amended and Restated Term Loan.

          SECTION 2.05  OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.  The Borrower may, upon at least
one (1) Business Day's notice to the Bank in the case of Prime Rate Loans or
Fixed Rate Loans, and at least three Business Day's notice to the Bank in the
case of LIBOR Loans, prepay the Amended and Restated Term Loan Note, in whole or
in part with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount
prepaid, provided that:  (1) each partial prepayment shall be in a principal
amount of not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000); (2) LIBOR Loans
may be prepaid only on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; and
(3) Fixed Rate Loans may be prepaid only if the Borrower pays the Bank the fees
set forth in Section 2.07.  Except as provided above, prepayments of the Amended
and Restated Term Loan in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.05 shall
be without premium or penalty.

          SECTION 2.06  MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.  If at any time a Real Property
Appraisal demonstrates that the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each
of the Amended and Restated Term Loan and the ESOT Loan exceeds seventy-five
percent of the Real Property Appraisal Value, then the Borrower shall
immediately (1) have a standby letter of credit issued for the benefit of Chase
in an amount equal to such excess, in a form and by a party acceptable to Chase,
and with respect to which Chase shall have the ability to draw at any time on
such standby letter of credit, or (2) make a payment to the Bank in an amount
equal to such excess which payment shall be applied pro rata to the remaining
scheduled installments of principal of the Amended and Restated Term Loan.

<PAGE>

          SECTION 2.07  PREPAYMENT PREMIUM ON FIXED RATE LOANS.  Any prepayment
by the Borrower of the Fixed Rate Loans shall be accompanied by a prepayment
premium on any principal balance prepaid equal to the total of the present
values of the monthly prepayment premiums for each month from the date of
prepayment through the remaining term of the Amended and Restated Term Loan.
The monthly prepayment premium shall be the product of (1) the principal amount
prepaid, (2) multiplied by the interest rate differential, (3) divided by 12.
The interest rate differential shall equal the difference between (a) the
average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities having maturities matching the
original term of the Amended and Restated Term Loan on the Third Closing Date
and (b) the average yield of U.S. Treasury Securities having maturities matching
the remaining term of the Amended and Restated Term Loan on the prepayment date.
The present value of each monthly prepayment premium shall be the monthly
prepayment premium discounted from the due date thereof to the prepayment date
at a discount rate equal to the average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities having
maturities matching the remaining term of the Amended and Restated Term Loan.
Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, no prepayment premium will be payable
upon the prepayment of the Amended and Restated Term Loan if, on the prepayment
date, (b) is greater than (a).  A determination by the Bank of any amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.08  METHOD OF PAYMENT.  The Borrower shall make each payment
under this Agreement and under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Note not later

authorizes the Bank, if and to the extent payment is not made when due under
this Agreement or under the Bank's Amended and Restated Term Loan Note, to
charge from time to time against any account it maintains with the Bank any
amount so due to the Bank.

          Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, whenever any payment
to be made under this Agreement or under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Note
shall be stated to be due on any day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time
shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest.

          SECTION 2.09  MARGIN STOCK.  The Borrower shall not, directly or
indirectly, use any part of the proceeds of the Amended and Restated Term Loan
for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of
Regulation U of the Board of Governors or to extend


                                       18

Bank shall, in the case of Prime Rate Loans, be in an amount at least equal to
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), and in the case of LIBOR Loans, be in an
amount at least equal to Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (Conversions of or
into Loans of different types or, in the case of LIBOR Loans having different
Interest Periods at the same time hereunder to be deemed separate Conversions
for purposes of the foregoing, one for each type or Interest Period).  Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate principal
amount of LIBOR Loans of the Bank having the same Interest Period shall be at
least equal to Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and, if any LIBOR Loan would
otherwise be in a lesser principal amount for any period, such LIBOR Loan shall
be a Prime Rate Loan during such period.

Conversions, and Continuations of all or any portion of the Amended and Restated
Term Loan and of the duration of Interest Periods shall be irrevocable and shall

any amount receivable by the Bank hereunder in respect of any of such LIBOR
Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts
receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any
Regulatory Change which:

          (1)  changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to the Bank
     under this Agreement or the Amended and Restated Term Loan Note in respect
     of any of such LIBOR Loans (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the
     overall net income of the Bank or of its Applicable Lending Office for any
     of such LIBOR Loans by the jurisdiction in which the Bank has its principal
     office or such Applicable Lending Office); or

          (2)  (other than to the extent of the LIBOR Reserve Requirement taken
     into account in determining the LIBOR Rate, at the commencement of the
     applicable Interest Period) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
     deposit, deposit insurance or assessment, minimum capital, capital ratio or
     similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets
     of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, the Bank (including any
     LIBOR Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR
     Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of the Bank; or

          (3)  imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or the
     Amended and Restated Term Loan Note (or any of such extensions of credit or
     liabilities).

If the Bank requests compensation from the Borrower under the first paragraph of
this Section 2.13, the Borrower may, by notice to the Bank, suspend the
obligation of the Bank to Continue LIBOR Loans with respect to which such
compensation is requested or to Convert Prime Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans, until
the Regulatory Change giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in
which case the provisions of Section 2.16 hereof shall be applicable).

          Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the first paragraph
of this Section 2.13, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, the
Bank either (1) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above
a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits of other liabilities
of the Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the LIBOR Interest
Rate is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of
credit or other assets of the Bank which includes loans based on the LIBOR
Interest Rate or (2) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a
category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if the Bank so elects
by notice to the Borrower, the obligation of the Bank to Continue, or to Convert
Prime Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such Regulatory
Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 2.16
hereof shall be applicable).

          Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.13 (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay directly to the
Bank from time to time on request such amounts as the Bank may determine to be
necessary to compensate the Bank for any costs which it determines are
attributable to the maintenance by the Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office),
pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request
(whether or not having the force of law and whether in effect on the date of
this Agreement or thereafter) of any court or governmental or monetary authority
of capital in respect of the Amended and Restated Term Loan (such compensation
to include, without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of
return on assets or equity of the Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office) to a
level below that which the Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office) could have
achieved but for such law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request).
The Bank hereby agrees that it shall designate a different Applicable Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of
Additional Costs and will not, in the sole discretion of the Bank, be illegal or
in any way disadvantageous to the Bank.

          Determinations and allocations by the Bank for purposes of this
Section 2.13 of the effect of any


                                       21

<PAGE>

Regulatory Change pursuant to the first or second paragraph of this Section 2.13
or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to the third paragraph of this
Section 2.13, on its costs or rate of return of maintaining the Amended and
Restated Term Loan or on amounts receivable by it in respect of the Amended and
Restated Term Loan, and the amounts required to compensate the Bank under this
Section 2.13, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14  LIMITATION ON TYPES OF LOANS.  Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of the LIBOR
Interest Rate for any Interest Period:

          (1)  the Bank determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
     that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in
     the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not
     being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for
     purposes of determining rates of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided in
     this Agreement; or

          (2)  the Bank determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
     that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBOR
     Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of
     interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined do
     not adequately cover the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining such
     LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Bank shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as such
condition remains in effect, the Bank shall be under no obligation to Convert
Prime Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans, or Continue LIBOR Loans, and the Borrower
shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the
outstanding LIBOR Loans, either prepay such LIBOR Loans or Convert such LIBOR
Loans into a Prime Rate Loan in accordance with Section 2.10.

          SECTION 2.15  ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for the Bank or its Applicable
Lending Office to honor its obligation to maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder or
Convert Prime Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans, then the Bank shall promptly notify
the Borrower thereof and the Bank's obligation to Continue, or to Convert Loans
of any other type into LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such time as the
Bank may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of
Section 2.16 hereof shall be applicable).  If the Bank invokes the foregoing
provision, then upon the request of the Borrower the Bank will attempt


                                       22

<PAGE>

to establish a different Applicable Lending Office to fulfill its obligation to
maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, provided that such offices are available to the
Bank and the Bank incurs no additional costs due to the use of such office
unless the Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank for such costs.

          SECTION 2.16  TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.  If the obligations of the
Bank to Continue LIBOR Loans, or to Convert Prime Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans
are suspended pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15 hereof (LIBOR Loans so affected
being herein called "Affected Loans") the Bank's Affected Loans shall be
automatically Converted into Prime Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then
current Interest Period(s) for the Affected Loans (or, in the case of a
Conversion required by Section 2.13 or 2.15, on such earlier date as the Bank
may specify to the Borrower).

          To the extent that the Bank's Affected Loans have been so Converted,
all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to
the Bank's Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its Prime Rate Loans.  All
Loans which would otherwise be made or Continued by the Bank as LIBOR Loans
shall be made or Continued instead as Prime Rate Loans and all Prime Rate Loans
of the Bank which would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as
Prime Rate Loans.

          SECTION 2.17  CERTAIN COMPENSATION.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Bank, upon the request of the Bank, such amount or amounts as shall be
sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Bank) to compensate it for any
loss, cost or expense which the Bank determines is attributable to:

          (1)  any payment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation of a LIBOR
     Loan made by the Bank on a date other than the last day of an Interest
     Period for such Loan whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise; or

          (2)  any failure by the Borrower for any reason to Convert or Continue
     a LIBOR Loan to be made, Converted or Continued by the Bank on the date
     specified therefor in the relevant notice issued by the Borrower.

          Without limiting the foregoing, such compensation shall include an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the amount of interest which
otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Converted
or Continued or not borrowed, Converted or Continued for the period from and
including the date of such payment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation or
failure to Convert or Continue to but excluding the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan (or, in the case


                                       23

<PAGE>


of a failure to Convert or Continue, to but excluding the last day of the
Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan which would have commenced on the date
specified therefor in the relevant notice) at the applicable rate of interest
for such LIBOR Loan provided for herein; over (2) the amount of interest (as
reasonably determined by the Bank) which the Bank would have bid in the London
interbank market for Dollar deposits, for amounts comparable to such principal
amount and maturities comparable to such period.  A determination of the Bank as
to the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

          SECTION 2.18  RISK-BASED CAPITAL.  In the event that the Bank
determines that (1) compliance with any judicial, administrative, or other
governmental interpretation of any law or regulation or (2) compliance by the
Bank or any corporation controlling the Bank with any guideline or request from
any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the
force of law) has the effect of requiring an increase in the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation controlling
the Bank, and the Bank determines that such increase is based upon its
obligations hereunder, and other similar obligations, the Borrower shall pay to
the Bank, such additional amount as shall be certified by the Bank to be the
amount allocable to the Bank's obligations to the Borrower hereunder.  The Bank
will notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement
that will entitle the Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.18 as
promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to
request such compensation.

          Determinations by the Bank for purposes of this Section 2.18 of the
effect of any increase in the amount of capital required to be maintained by the
Bank and of the amount allocable to the Bank's obligations to the Borrower
hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
the Loan Documents.

          SECTION 4.03  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  The Borrower is not in violation

     Plan, or the PBGC (or any combination thereof) which in the aggregate
     exceed or may exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000);

          (13)  The Borrower shall fail to comply with Warren & Panzer, the

          (14)  The Borrower shall fail to pay any fees within sixty (60) days
     of the Closing Date with respect to either the real estate appraisal
     conducted by Pearson Partners Inc. or the environmental audit conducted by

then, and in any such event (other than Section 8.01(5)), the Bank may, by
notice to the Borrower, (1) declare the outstanding Amended and Restated Term
Loan Note, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon the Amended and Restated Term Loan Note, all such interest, and all
such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest, or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Borrower; and (2) exercise any of the remedies provided

HOWEVER, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in Section

thereon, and any other amounts payable under this Agreement in any of the other
Loan Documents, shall be forthwith due and payable without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01  AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.  No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Borrower and the Bank and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given.

          SECTION 9.02  NOTICES, ETC.  All notices and other communications
provided for under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents to which
the Borrower is a party shall be in writing and mailed or delivered by messenger
or sent by facsimile, if to the Borrower, at its address at 515 West 57th
Street, New York, New York, 10019, Attention: Barry Knepper, Senior Vice
President - Finance, with a copy to Karen Lapidus, Esq. at the same address for

York, New York, 10018, Attention: Gordon Smith, Vice President; or, as to each
party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written
notice to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this
Section.  All such notices and communications shall be effective when received.

          SECTION   NO WAIVER; REMEDIES.  No failure on the part of the Bank
to exercise and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy under any
Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right under any Loan Documents preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies
provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

          SECTION 9.04  ASSIGNMENT; PARTICIPATION.  This Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Borrower and the Bank.  The
Borrower may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder.  The
Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other


                                       43

<PAGE>

institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its portion of
the Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest
to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower, the Bank shall
remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and
Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Bank in connection
with the Bank's rights and obligations hereunder.  Any agreement pursuant to
which the Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that the
Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations
of the Borrower hereunder and under any other Loan Document including, without
limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

          SECTION 9.05  EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.  The Borrower agrees to
reimburse the Bank on demand for all  costs, expenses, and charges (including,
without limitation, all reasonable fees and expenses of external legal counsel
for the Bank and of persons conducting appraisals as provided in Section 5.10
and of persons conducting field examinations for the Bank) incurred by the Bank
in connection with the preparation, performance, or enforcement of this
Agreement, the Amended and Restated Term Loan Note, or any other Loan Documents
or in connection with any amendment, modification or waiver of the provisions
hereof or thereof (whether or not the proposed transaction is consummated).  All
such costs, expenses, fees and charges paid by the Borrower shall be non-
refundable.  The Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Bank and
each director, officer, employee and affiliate thereof (each, an "indemnified
person"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses and
liabilities incurred by any indemnified person that arise out of or relate to
any investigation or litigation or other proceeding (including any threatened
investigation or litigation or other proceedings and whether or not such
indemnified person is a party thereto) relating to the transactions contemplated
by the Loan Documents or to the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the
Loans or that are otherwise attributable to the acts or omissions of the
Borrower or its officers, employees, agents or advisors in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, including without limitation
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any
of the foregoing (but excluding any of the foregoing claimed by any indemnified
person to the extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such person as determined by a final judgment of a court).


                                       44

<PAGE>

          The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive the
repayment of the Loans and all amounts due under or in connection with any of
the Loan Documents.

          SECTION 9.06  RIGHT OF SETOFF.  The Borrower agrees that, in addition
to (and without limitation of) any right of setoff, bankers' lien or
counterclaim the Bank may otherwise have, the Bank shall be entitled, at its
option, to offset balances (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) held by it for the account of the Borrower at any of the Bank's offices,
in Dollars or in any other currency, against any amount payable by the Borrower
to the Bank under this Agreement or the Bank's Amended and Restated Term Loan
Note, or any other Loan Document which is not paid when due (regardless of
whether such balances are then due to the Borrower), in which case it shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof; provided that the Bank's failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

          SECTION 9.07  TABLE OF CONTENTS; HEADINGS.  Any table of contents and
the headings and captions hereunder are for convenience only and shall not
affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.08  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement are
intended to be severable.  If for any reason any provision of this Agreement
shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction,
such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity
or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions
hereof in any jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.09  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument, and any party hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any
such counterpart.

          SECTION 9.10  INTEGRATION.  The Loan Documents set forth the entire
agreement among the parties hereto relating to the transactions contemplated
thereby and supersede any prior oral or written statements or agreements with
respect to such transactions.

          SECTION 9.11  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and interpreted and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York.


                                       45

          SECTION 9.12  JURISDICTION; IMMUNITIES.  The Borrower and the Bank
hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any New York State or United
States Federal court sitting in New York City over any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Amended and Restated Term Loan
Note or any other Loan Document, and the Borrower and the Bank hereby
irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such New York State or Federal court.  The Borrower and
the Bank irrevocably consent to the service of any and all process in any such
action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to the Borrower or
Bank at its address specified in Section 9.03.  The Borrower and the Bank agree
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.  The Borrower and the Bank further waive any objection
to venue in such State and any objection to an action or proceeding in such
State on the basis of forum non conveniens.  The Borrower further agrees that
any action or proceeding brought against the Bank shall be brought only in New
York State or United States Federal court sitting in New York County.

          Nothing in this Section 9.12 shall affect the right of the Bank to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of
the Bank to bring any action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its
properties in the courts of any other jurisdictions.

          To the extent that the Borrower has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, the
Borrower hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations
under all of the Loan Documents.

          THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

     9.   TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.  The Company may terminate this Agreement at
any time during the Term if Hoffman breaches any material obligation under this
Agreement, or is convicted of any fraud, embezzlement or dishonest action
against the Company, in which event the Company shall have no further obligation

     (c)  Hoffman acknowledges that the restrictions contained in the foregoing
subparagraphs (a) and (b), in view of the nature of the business in which the
Company is engaged, are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the
legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation thereof would result
in irreparable injuries to the Company, and Hoffman therefore acknowledges that,
in the event of his violation of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be
entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief as well as damages and an equitable accounting of
all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such violation, which
rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to
which the Company may be entitled.

     (d)  If the period of time or the area specified in subparagraph (a) above
should be adjudged unreasonable in any proceeding, then the period of time shall
be reduced by such number of months or the area shall be reduced by the
elimination of such portion thereof or both so that such restrictions may be
enforced in such areas and for such time as is adjudged to be reasonable.

     11.  GENERAL RELEASE.

     (a)  Hoffman waives and hereby releases and discharges Employer from any
and all claims, demands, causes of action, fees and liabilities of any kind
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, which Hoffman ever had or now has against

practice, conduct, occurrence, or other matter up to and including the date of
this Agreement.

     (b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement is
intended to and shall release Employer from any and all claims, whether known or
unknown, which

     (a)  INDULGENCES, ETC.  Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of
either party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further
exercise of the same or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege, nor
shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any
occurrence be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege
with respect to any other occurrence.  No waiver shall be effective unless it is
