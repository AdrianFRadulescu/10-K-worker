                        FORM 12b-25 OF UNITEL VIDEO, INC.
                        ---------------------------------

                         NOTE A - SUPPLEMENT TO PART III


         The  Registrant  was unable to file its Annual  Report on Form 10-K for
its  fiscal  year  ended  August  31,  1995 (the  "Form  10-K") on or before the
prescribed  due date of November 29, 1995.  The  Registrant is in the process of
completing a refinancing of a substantial  amount of its bank and  institutional
indebtedness,  which is expected  to be  completed  no later than the  fifteenth
calendar day after the  prescribed  due date for the Form 10-K.  The  Registrant
believes that the effect on the  financial  statements  and financial  statement
footnotes,   as  well  as  the  narrative  disclosures  (including  Management's
Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations),  to be contained in the Form
10-K will be material. The Registrant expects to file the Form 10-K on or before
December 14, 1995.


                         NOTE B - SUPPLEMENT TO PART IV

         On November 30, 1995, the Registrant issued a press release announcing,
among other things,  results of operations  for its fiscal year ended August 31,
1995. The Registrant  reported  revenue of $83,285,000 for the year ended August
31, 1995 ("fiscal  1995")  compared to $80,498,000 for the year ended August 31,
1994 (fiscal 1994"),  an increase of $2,787,000.  The Registrant also reported a
net loss of $6,547,000 for fiscal 1995, compared to net earnings of $859,000 for
fiscal 1994.  The net loss for fiscal 1995 included  one-time  pre-tax  charges,
aggregating  $8,081,000,  as  follows:  an  impairment  charge of  approximately
$4,681,000  in  respect  of the  assets of its  three  Editel  divisions,  which
incurred losses of approximately $3,682,000 during fiscal 1995 and for which the
Registrant   announced  it  was  seeking  a  buyer;  an  impairment   charge  of
approximately $3,000,000 in respect of the assets of its Windsor division; and a
restructuring  charge of  approximately  $400,000 in respect of the Registrant's
Editel-Chicago  division in connection with the downsizing and reorganization of
that division during fiscal 1995.
